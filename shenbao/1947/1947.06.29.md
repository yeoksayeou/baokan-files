### U.S. Announces Increased Aid to China: Consideration of Arms Sales and Loans; Our Government to Issue Policy Statement

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] The government is expected to issue a formal statement regarding its policy on the current situation. It is rumored that this statement may be released on the 30th after a joint meeting of the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee.

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] Government officials today expressed deep welcome for the U.S. decision to lift the ban on military supplies to China, calling it the most significant step in American policy. It is generally believed that the lifting of the arms embargo and the statement by Martin, Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, regarding the preparation for loans have strengthened the position of the Nanjing government and dispelled fears that the United States would ignore the China problem. The morale of the National Army will surely be boosted, and the order to suppress the Communist army may be issued more quickly as a result. A stronger attitude will also be taken in diplomacy with the Soviet Union, especially in dealing with the issue of Dalian and Lushun. In addition, Lou Tongsun, chairman of the Legislative Yuan's Economic Affairs Committee, commented on Martin's statement, saying that what China urgently needs is to obtain large loans from the United States immediately to stabilize China's economic position. Lou refused to reveal whether the government would issue new currency to stabilize the economy after obtaining U.S. loans, but sources with inside knowledge say this is indeed the government's plan.

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Given the difficulties faced by the Chinese government, the United States is providing moral and material support by selling arms to China for use by the National Army against the Communist army. This decision was made because the National Army is valiantly containing the advance of the Communist army in the Northeast and because President Chiang and his senior advisors are pursuing a firm anti-Soviet and anti-Communist policy. This move also marks the end of the neutral policy towards the Chinese civil war held by General Marshall when he went to China in 1945 to mediate, a policy that lasted for eighteen months. The United States is now using all its strength to help President Chiang deal with the Communist Party, and a large-scale and long-term economic aid plan for China is expected soon.

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] The State Department announced that the United States has agreed to sell surplus U.S. military rifle bullets to China. The Chinese government may also purchase any aircraft or other military equipment from the U.S. military with funds, and may also purchase military equipment from U.S. commercial manufacturers. The Export-Import Bank also announced that it will consider granting special loans to China. This action by the State Department and the Export-Import Bank is believed to have been approved by Secretary of State Marshall, although it is a major decision since Marshall abandoned mediating the Chinese civil war in January, it is still far from what the Chinese government has applied for.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 27th] The U.S. State Department announced on the 27th that the Foreign Liquidation Commission has signed an agreement with China to sell 13 million rounds of 7.92mm ammunition to the Chinese government for $656,658. The original value of this ammunition was $6,566,589. This ammunition is similar to .30 caliber rifle ammunition and was manufactured by the United States between 1942 and 1944. It was originally intended to be shipped to China under the Lend-Lease program at China's request, but due to transportation difficulties during the war, it could not be shipped as scheduled. This ammunition is for a special caliber used by China, so it is not suitable for the U.S. military and has become surplus U.S. government material, currently stored in western states. All shipping issues will be handled by the Chinese government itself.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Martin, Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, announced on the 27th that the Export-Import Bank is currently preparing to consider credit loans for various special projects in China, regardless of the expiration on June 30th of the $500 million of other potential credit loans allocated to Chinese government agencies and private enterprises. This is the first official U.S. announcement that the $500 million loan allocated to China in April last year will be allowed to expire. Martin also stated that the Export-Import Bank will pay attention to the basic principles guiding loan activities in all regions of the world when applying for any grain loans. He said that the Export-Import Bank, in following the policies determined by Congress, will only grant loans for (1) promoting U.S. foreign trade, (2) not competing with private capital, (3) having special purposes, and (4) the board of directors believes there is a reasonable guarantee of repayment. Martin's statement, in fact, indicates that the action of reviving the credit loan program is returning to its original primary purpose, which is to fund and facilitate special U.S. imports and exports. This includes funding U.S. tools and technical services for foreign production enterprises. He further stated that the general rule of the Export-Import Bank is only to fund the purchase of goods and tools produced or manufactured in the United States, as well as the hiring of technical personnel from U.S. companies, which is different from the expenses for goods and personnel purchased by borrowing countries in their own countries.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] A government spokesman said on the evening of the 28th regarding the Washington dispatch of the U.S. Export-Import Bank's announcement that the $500 million loan deadline will not be extended after the end of June: The external affairs have not yet received official documents regarding this notification. At the same time, we have not received a report from our ambassador to the United States, so the official side cannot express any opinion on this matter. As for whether the $500 million loan will be established before the end of June, we still have a final hope for the next two days. According to reporters from other sources, the government is indeed in negotiations with the United States for new loans.

### No Matter Pro-U.S. or Pro-Soviet, National Interests Should Take Priority

Sun Ke Delivers Speech on World Situation

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] Vice President Sun Ke, at the invitation of the Returned Students Association on the evening of the 28th, gave a speech on the current world situation, saying that the key to whether a third world war can be avoided lies in whether the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union can be reconciled and whether the United Nations organization can be strengthened. As for China, it should neither be pro-American and anti-Soviet, nor should it be pro-Soviet and anti-American. As the Chinese Communists have done in the Northeast, those with a conscience cannot do this. Our pro-American and pro-Soviet stances should be based on the interests of the nation and the people. We are pro-American because they are beneficial to China, and we are pro-Soviet because it can bring stability to the country. Stability can lead to revitalization. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced the process of negotiations with the Soviet Union to recover Dalian and Lushun, making public our position and the reasons why our government cannot take over the Northeast to the world. According to his personal observation, this is enough to promote the removal of misunderstandings between China and the Soviet Union and enhance friendship.

### Wang Chonghui Discusses Current Situation: Hopes for Active U.S. Aid to China

[Our Report] State Councilor Wang Chonghui is scheduled to return to Nanjing the day after tomorrow. He told reporters yesterday that the deteriorating situation in the East and the awakening of American public opinion have led the U.S. government to adopt measures to provide military assistance. Our country has fought for eight years, and the remaining amount of military supplies is limited, so although the current assistance is not direct, it has opened up the source of our military supplies, which shows its sincerity in assisting the National Government. I hope that this is only a preliminary assistance, and that it can become more active in the future. Because our country's situation and circumstances are no different from those of Greece and Turkey, and logically speaking, it should receive the same level of support. Furthermore, the United Kingdom and the United States should bear some responsibility for the current crisis in our country, because both countries are signatories to the Yalta Secret Agreement. Our country has suffered significant sacrifices because of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, but it has not yet gained peace. Regarding the failure to extend the deadline for the U.S. Export-Import Bank loan, Wang believes that the extension has been made more than once. If direct loans cannot be obtained, extending the deadline will also be of no use. He hopes that the U.S. government can use other methods. Since the United States intends to provide assistance, there are many ways to do so. Our country only seeks to achieve the goal of obtaining loans, and all other methods are welcome. When asked about his views on the current Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, Wang said: Because the international situation is too complicated, it is impossible to make predictions at the beginning of the meeting. But logically, the Soviet Union may conditionally accept Secretary of State Marshall's aid plan for Europe.

### Legislative Yuan to Adjourn Soon; President and Members Host Banquets for Each Other

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] With the Legislative Yuan to adjourn soon, all the members and Vice Presidents Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng hosted banquets twice on the 28th, at noon and in the evening. Sun and Wu hosted the noon banquet, with 151 attendees, including all senior staff of the Legislative Yuan. In the evening, all the members returned the favor at the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse. The Yuan will hold its last meeting on the 3rd of next month and then adjourn for two months, so the atmosphere at today's banquet was very pleasant. President Sun said in his speech at the noon banquet that the Legislative Yuan's past achievements, especially the constitutional laws and regulations, were completed in the shortest possible time, which helped to implement the constitution as scheduled and is truly admirable. Sun pointed out that after the Legislative Yuan's organization expanded, the newly elected members and the original members met in one place, and although they argued over proposals, they were harmonious and agreeable outside the meeting, which fully demonstrates that they have a democratic spirit. This is the most precious thing. He also mentioned that after the last meeting next week, some members have not returned to their hometowns for many years, and he hoped that they could all return home to participate in the election. Sun then introduced Wu Tiecheng, saying: "Vice President Wu used to hold important positions within the Kuomintang and served as the convener of the Nomination Committee. In the future Legislative Yuan elections, regardless of whether they are Kuomintang, Democratic Socialist Party, Youth Party, or social elites, Vice President Wu will definitely be able to assist." Wu Tiecheng also gave a speech on the spot. He mentioned that he had served as a member of the Legislative Yuan 15 years ago, saying that now it is like returning home. Wu said that he was impressed by the past achievements of the Legislative Yuan and expressed his willingness to work together with all the members to complete the legislative cases that should be amended and formulated before the implementation of the constitution as soon as possible. Committee Member Liu Jianshun then delivered a reply on behalf of the members, expressing gratitude for the praise of Sun and Wu, and expressed his willingness to continue to work hard to complete the great cause of constitutional government.

### Ambassador Stuart Arrives in Beiping by Plane: After Presiding Over Yanjing University Graduation Ceremony, Returns to Nanjing; Believes That Although China's Problems Are Serious, They Are Not Hopeless

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] July 4th is the U.S. Independence Day. Ambassador Stuart Leighton will hold a reception at his residence from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on the afternoon of that day to entertain diplomatic envoys from various countries, our leaders, and people from all walks of life. The Ambassador's Yanjing University graduation ceremony is about to be held. He will fly to Beiping with advisor Zhao Jingbo at 8 a.m. on the 28th to preside over it and will return to Nanjing on July 2nd.

[Our Beiping Bureau, 28th] Ambassador Stuart arrived in Beiping by plane from Nanjing at 12:30 p.m. on the 28th. He returned to Yanjing University. The reporter approached him at Linhu Xuan. The Ambassador said: (1) China's usage plan is not yet final. Although the deadline for the $500 million loan is approaching, the funds can still be reserved. China can submit another usage plan. This will not disappear due to the expiration of the 30th. (2) The United States is constantly paying close attention to the Northeast and Baitashan incidents. However, as a whole, international issues are considered to be no more than internal Chinese problems. If China's internal affairs are sound, there will be no foreign troubles. (3) Regarding the issue between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, I hope there can be another negotiation to give a final chance for peace. He believes that whoever wins between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party depends on the support of the people's united strength. He personally believes that the government can still have a way to win the support of the people. (4) Although China's current problems are extremely serious, they are not hopeless. This depends on how the strength of the Chinese people's unity is brought into play. The Ambassador decided to return to Nanjing on the 2nd after attending the Yanjing University graduation ceremony.

### Supreme Court Procuratorate Issues Order to Arrest Mao Zedong

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] The Supreme Court Procuratorate has recently ordered the Chief Procurators of all Higher Courts in the country to order their subordinates to strictly arrest Mao Zedong. The full text is as follows:

The case is based on a report from Ye Zaizhou, President of the Gansu Higher Court, and Zhan Shiming, Chief Procurator, stating that Wang Zuozhu, Speaker of the Cheng County Council, and others, reported that Mao Zedong is using troops to incite rebellion. Please punish him according to the law to appease public anger, etc. Based on this, it is appropriate to report to your superior for review. After investigation, the rebel Mao Zedong has seized the country's land, used troops to rebel, harmed the country and the people, and his crimes are heinous. He should be arrested and dealt with according to the law. In addition to issuing separate orders, you are hereby ordered to instruct your subordinates to strictly arrest him and bring him to justice to uphold the law. This order.

### Number of Additional Legislative Yuan Seats Increased: Total of Eighty-Four; Legislative Yuan Passes After Heated Debate

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] The Legislative Yuan held its 330th routine meeting on the morning of the 28th, spending the entire time discussing various laws and regulations related to the implementation of the constitution and the allocation table for the number of additional Legislative Yuan seats. Today's meeting was chaired by concurrent President Sun Ke, with more than 80 members present. The first issue discussed was the number of additional Legislative Yuan seats. After two hours of heated debate, it was resolved to increase the number of additional seats from 56 to 84. Then, the Legislative Yuan discussed the distribution table for additional Legislative Yuan seats. According to the original table of 56 seats, agricultural and fishery groups could get 18 seats, industrial groups 12 seats, commercial groups 3 seats, industrial and mining groups 5 seats, educational groups 11 seats, and free professional groups 7 seats. Now that the total number has been changed to 84, the number of seats for each industry should be increased proportionally. However, Deng Hongye believes that the number of seats occupied by fishery groups is too large. There are people in northern China who have never tasted fish in their lives. This provision may increase the opportunity for so-called fishery companies in Shanghai and Tianjin to "pass off imitation goods as genuine." Jian Guansan also pointed out that we have only heard of building a country based on agriculture, building a country based on industry, but we have never heard of building a country based on fishery. How can fishery representatives represent the people of the north who have been eating rice and fresh fish for thousands of years? Jian suggested that it would be better to increase the number of representatives of free professions than to increase the number of fishery representatives. Zhang Huai also advocated increasing the number of free professional representatives. Finally, it was decided to return the matter to the committee for review. The division of legislative electoral districts for people residing abroad and the allocation table for the number of members to be elected in each district were slightly amended and passed.

The allocation table for the number of National Assembly seats for professional groups was also one of the cases passed at today's meeting. According to the regulations, there are a total of 450 National Assembly seats for professional representatives. Agricultural and fishery groups account for 32%, or 144 seats, of which 134 seats are for agricultural representatives and 10 seats are for fishery representatives. Workers' groups account for 28%, or 126 seats. Industrial and commercial groups account for 17%, commercial groups account for 3%, or 13 seats. Industrial and mining groups account for 4%, or 18 seats. Educational groups account for 20%, 90 seats. Free professional groups account for 13%, 59 seats. Among the above 450 seats, women representatives account for 72 seats. The detailed allocation method will be determined by the Ministry of Social Affairs.

The allocation table for the number of National Assembly representatives for women's groups was also discussed at the meeting. Committee Members Zhao Maohua, Chuan Yan, and others spoke up. Peng Zuishi, using his status as "not a woman," argued for his native Jiangxi. Some members of the Legislative Yuan expressed doubts about the women's groups established in various places. It was later decided to return the table to the committee for review.

The original regulations for the number of signatures required for candidates for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan members from overseas Chinese were too high. The Overseas Department requested that they be reduced. There was not much disagreement in the meeting when this case was discussed today. Later, it was decided to reduce the number of signatures required for Legislative Yuan members from overseas Chinese to 500, and the number of signatures required for Legislative Yuan members to 200. At that time, someone mentioned the issue of political party nominations. Concurrent President Sun Ke instructed that parties participating in the constitutional government can propose nominations. It has not yet been decided whether other parties can nominate.

Finally, the two cases of amending the Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law and increasing the number of Legislative Yuan seats for Tibet were discussed. The former was resolved not to be amended for the time being, and the latter was returned to the committee for review. The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 p.m. The next routine meeting is scheduled to be held on July 3rd. That meeting may be the last routine meeting of the current Legislative Yuan. All accumulated important cases are expected to be cleared up at that time.

### Legislative Yuan Resolves That Number of Overseas Chinese Legislative Yuan Members Be Nineteen

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Legislative Yuan passed the following division of legislative electoral districts for overseas Chinese nationals and the allocation table for the number of members to be elected in each district on the 28th: District 1: United States (Honolulu) 2 members; District 2: Canada 1 member; District 3: Central and South American countries 1 member; District 4: Cuba and other West Indies Islands 1 member; District 5: Australia, Tahiti, and nearby islands, and eastern New Guinea 1 member; District 6: Philippines 1 member; District 7: Japan, Korea, Ryukyu, and eastern Pacific Islands 1 member; District 8: Hong Kong, Macau 1 member; District 9: Vietnam 1 member; District 10: Burma, India, and southwestern Asian countries 1 member; District 11: Thailand 2 members; District 12: Malaya and North Borneo 2 members; District 13: East Indies and southwestern Borneo, Portuguese Timor, and western New Guinea 2 members; District 14: Europe 1 member; District 15: Africa 1 member.

### Prelude to Major Battle in Shandong Opens

[Our Jinan Bureau, 28th] The prelude to the major battle in the Yimeng Mountain area has reopened, and the National Army has gained an absolute advantage and an active position. Since the 26th, the National Army, launching a fan-shaped attack to the northeast from Tangtou via Mengyin, Xintai, Laiwu to Longshan Station on the Jiaoji Line, has advanced an average of 25 kilometers along the entire line by the 28th. The National Army has captured all areas east from Yishui, southwest of Maquan, Anqian, Jiuzhai, Tanbu via Dazhangzhuang, Liushutou (about 30 kilometers east of Xintai) to Taoyu and Panlong Mountain, more than 20 kilometers east of Laiwu. The National Army has also recovered Zaoyuansi on the front of the Jiaoji Line, and the vanguard has reached the vicinity of Mingshui.

### Chaoyang Relieved

[Our Shenyang Bureau, 28th] Chaoyang has been relieved. The Communist army retreated north, destroying telecommunications equipment along the way.

### Law on the Protection of People's Rights: Constitutional Committee of the Legislative Yuan Redrafts; To Be Discussed at First Meeting After Adjournment

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] The draft Law on the Protection of People's Rights was submitted to the Constitutional Committee for discussion at 3:00 p.m. on the 28th after preliminary review by the subcommittee of the Legislative Yuan. Because the scope covered by the original proposal seemed to be too narrow, it was decided to appoint Liu Kezhen, Lu Fu, Chen Guyuan, Liu Butong, Wang Shixian, and others to redraft it. The redraft is to be submitted for discussion at the first meeting after adjournment. The main points of the original proposal are: (1) Suspects shall not be arrested arbitrarily; judicial police should first issue a summons. If they do not appear, then an arrest warrant shall be issued. (2) After arrest, the suspect shall be brought to court within 24 hours. (3) If the suspect is not sent to court, the judicial organ or the suspect himself or his relatives may request a habeas corpus hearing. (4) Military and police agencies shall not dissolve people's assemblies or interfere with their speech before they have actually disturbed social order. (5) People's residences shall not be searched without solid evidence of crime. (6) Publishing businesses shall not be censored before publication. Publications shall not be suspended or closed down without a court ruling. (7) Except for judicial police (referring to police and military police), other personnel shall not carry out inspection and arrest activities. Those who violate this shall be held criminally liable.

### Secretariat of the National Political Council Issues Statement

United Press Report Inaccurate

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, stated to a reporter from the Central News Agency on the 28th: "Regarding the foreign affairs report and questioning at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Council on the 27th, the report published by the United Press yesterday differed greatly in content from the words reported and answered by Minister Wang Shijie at the time. The Secretariat has a responsibility to issue a statement through your agency to avoid misunderstandings."

### A Lively Debate in the Legislative Yuan: Each Expressing Their Views on the Issue of Increasing Seats

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The long-pending issue of increasing the number of seats for occupational representatives in the Legislative Yuan was once again brought up at today's regular meeting, resulting in an unprecedentedly heated debate. Over two hours, nearly all of the eighty-odd legislators, with only a few exceptions, rose to speak, at one point almost reaching a deadlock. Thanks to President Sun Ke's two earnest explanations, it was finally decided to reduce the number from 112 to 84, which is still a 50% increase over the original 56 seats.

This dispute has been ongoing for some time. Its most recent resurgence stems from the fifth meeting of the State Council, which resolved that "the number of seats for occupational elections in the Legislative Yuan be increased to 112, and the Legislative Yuan be instructed to amend the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators." When the case was submitted to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee for review, it was generally agreed that the total number of legislators, already exceeding 700, would be excessive if increased further, and it was resolved that "no amendment is necessary." After Committee Chairman Liu Kejun explained the review process to the general assembly, the heated debate ensued.

Mr. Chen Haicheng raised the "issue of legislative principles," arguing that the Legislative Yuan should not make decisions that contradict the principles of the National Government, nor should it place itself in a confrontational position with the National Government.

President Sun Ke spoke, urging legislators not to insist.

Liu Butong, the strongest opponent of increasing occupational representatives, immediately rebutted Chen's remarks, pointing out that the original proposal submitted by the State Council did not explain what difficulties would arise if the number of occupational representatives was not increased, but merely stipulated an increase to 112 seats, which he considered too vague.

At this point, President Sun Ke, in his capacity as a State Councilor, refuted Liu's argument, stating that the National Government is the parent body of the Legislative Yuan and, in principle, has absolute binding authority over the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan's decision to "make no amendment" to the principles submitted by the State Council is a violation of the system and is, in fact, illegal. Some might consider it an act of rebellion by the Legislative Yuan. Legally speaking, the current Legislative Yuan is not the Legislative Yuan of the constitutional era and cannot regard itself as supreme. He hoped that all legislators would reconsider the proposal and voice any opinions they may have, but that they should not reject it outright.

Zhou Yizhi, another staunch opponent of increasing the number of occupational representatives, rose to speak, offering two suggestions: (1) The Legislative Yuan need not take responsibility for future generations on this matter. Since the National Government wishes to increase the number of occupational representatives, this case can be left for the National Government to decide on its own, selecting as many as it desires. (2) The Legislative Yuan should present a record of past meetings opposing the increase in the number of occupational representatives, along with the reasons for opposing it, and request the National Government to provide clear instructions based on these reasons. Tan Tiwu pointed out that if the National Government is supreme, it should be supreme not only over the Legislative Yuan but also over the entire nation. Why does the state not value the opinions of the Legislative Yuan but only pay attention to certain occupational groups? It should not disregard the dignity of the legislature to satisfy the needs of a small group of people. If coercive measures are necessary, the National Government can act unilaterally. The National Government's actions on this matter must be considered ill-considered. Lu Fu reiterated his consistent stance, firmly opposing the increase in seats, and cited the Constitution, stating that all people are completely equal before the law and in elections. There are only slightly over 800 members of occupational organizations nationwide. Based on the Legislative Yuan's stipulated 56 seats, their proportion is already much more favorable than that of regional representatives. If it is further increased to 112, the unreasonableness and unfairness will be even greater, a situation rarely seen in any country in the world.

Wang Shizeng, a minority party legislator who rarely speaks, also rose to speak. Wang pointed out that occupational groups have been using all means of persuasion and intimidation to secure seats in the Legislative Yuan. This tactic has been applied not only to the Legislative Yuan but also to the National Government. If this continues, will not the entire national policy be swayed by them?

Tong Kunsun, who supports the increase in the number of occupational representatives, raised three points: system, organization, and hierarchy, hoping that they would not be overly rigid. By this point, the discussion had lasted nearly two hours, and many legislators continued to speak. Based on the situation at the time, further discussion over several days would not lead to any concrete decision. President Sun Ke rose again to speak, in order to break the deadlock. Sun first pointed out that although this issue has been repeatedly delayed, when the State Council discussed this case, frankly speaking, most of the committee members did not pay much attention to it. The reason for stipulating 112 seats was merely based on doubling the original 56 seats. The initial intention was to assist the Legislative Yuan in resolving this issue. The main reason for opposing the increase in the number of occupational representatives is the deep fear of manipulation by Shanghai financial groups. However, according to the distribution list of legislators for occupational representatives, commercial groups only get three of the 56 seats, and industrial and mining groups only get five. Even if doubled, the number would only be six and ten, respectively, a very small proportion. We should pay attention to whether the representatives produced in the future are genuinely practitioners of their respective industries, and there is no need to worry too much about other things.

A Vote is Finally Held and Passed by a Majority

Sun's speech was met with enthusiastic applause from the entire body. Immediately following, a vote was held and passed by a large majority. It was decided to increase the number of occupational representatives in the Legislative Yuan from 56 to 84.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 28th] The focus of the war in the Northeast has now shifted to where the National Army forces from the north and south will converge and how to annihilate the main force of the Communist Army on the Changchun-Dalian Railway. After breaking through the Communist Army's strong defensive position at Bianmiaozi Station, the National Army is now approaching Huanggouzi Station.

The majestic train station building was also destroyed by artillery fire.

Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Baoding, National Army Moves South to Reinforce

Following the fall of Xushui and Caohe stations, Baodian Station was attacked and captured last night, with the building burned down and the stationmaster and eight employees captured. The situation at Gucheng Station after the fierce fighting remains unclear as of last night. The military claims that after recapturing Beihedian, the National Army continued to engage in fierce fighting with the Communist Army in the area. Three regiments of the Communist Army were discovered in the eastern suburbs of Zhuozhou, at Dongxicicun, at noon on the 28th, crossing the Daqing River with the intention of attacking Zhuozhou.

### Resolution Reached on the Yellow River Dike Restoration Issue: Government Representatives, the CCP, and UNRRA Reach an Agreement, Both Sides Mutually Guarantee the Safety of Employees

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The Yellow River dike restoration project urgently needs to be advanced. The government had already considered the UNRRA's suggestion that both sides cease military action to facilitate the rapid selection of a site. It has already sent personnel to Heze to negotiate with representatives of the CCP and UNRRA, and an agreement has been reached. Only the issue of the implementation date remains. These negotiations were held on the morning of June 21st at the Luxi Office of the Shandong Water Conservancy and Flood Control Bureau in Heze. They were attended by Yan Zhenxing, a technician from the Ministry of Water Resources; Xu Yuanchong (substituting for Du Lie), representing Commander-in-Chief Gu; Hansen, representing UNRRA; and Yang Gongsu and Ban Lianwen, representing the CCP. Six other people were present, including UNRRA's Fan Mingxun, Peng Sleigh, and Kong Lingyong, director of the Shandong Water Conservancy and Flood Control Bureau. The results of the negotiations are as follows: (1) Construction Deadline: The start date is from June 12th to 15th, and the preliminary completion date is July 15th.

### Guangdong People in Beijing Petition for Swift Allocation of Funds for Flood Relief, Guangdong People in Shanghai Host Reporters to Report on the Disaster

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Guangdong people in Beijing, in order to appeal for relief for the Guangdong floods, sent representatives Zhang Meng, Li Jiamian, Wang Shangyi, and others totaling eleven people to the Senate, the National Government, and the Executive Yuan on the 27th to urge the swift allocation of large sums of money to carry out emergency relief. Secretary-General Shao Lizi of the Senate received them, Military Counselor Xue Yue of the National Government received them, and Secretary-General Gan received them at the Executive Yuan. After listening to the disaster reports from the representatives, they all expressed extreme concern and promised to forward the disaster situation to Chairman Chiang and President Zhang as soon as possible and to allocate relief funds quickly.

[Local News] The floods in Guangdong Province this time are a disaster rarely seen in decades. Guangdong people in Shanghai are extremely concerned. Mr. Xie Hanguang, the head of the Shanghai Broadcasting Office, hosted the press yesterday at the Guanshengyuan Restaurant, with over forty reporters from various newspapers attending. Xie reported on the disaster situation, saying that the Guangdong Association and the Guangzhao Association, along with their directors and supervisors, have also begun to raise funds separately, and have already raised over 700 million yuan. In addition, many Guangdong businessmen have launched charity sales to raise funds, and Guangdong opera star Guan Dexing also performed a charity performance last night, with all ticket sales going to Guangdong for emergency relief, etc. Huang Guanghua then reported, saying: This year's floods in Guangdong Province are due to the fact that the Japanese invaders set up many obstacles in various rivers during their occupation, coupled with years of silt accumulation that has not been dredged. Now, after months of snow and rain, the Dongjiang, Xijiang, and Hanjiang rivers have all surged, eventually leading to the destruction of fields and homes. Most importantly, the "Shijiaoyuan" in Qingyuan has collapsed twice. The first time was about ten feet, and thousands of people worked together to rescue it and quickly blocked it. The second time was about seven or eight days. At that time, there was a lack of rescue tools, and the villagers automatically dismantled several ancestral halls to use as needed to block the breach, which was blocked again after an hour. Otherwise, if the embankment had breached, the extent of the disaster would have been unimaginable. In the Dongjiang and Beijiang areas, the water reached the roofs of lower-lying areas, and was also several feet deep in higher areas. Fortunately, the weather has been sunny for several days, and the floodwaters have receded slightly. As for Guangzhou City, the water in the lower-lying areas of "Xiguan" and "Henan" was several feet deep, and the water on Changdi Road was also several inches deep. Currently, the water level is gradually decreasing. According to a report from the Water Conservancy Bureau, the water level of the Pearl River has dropped by more than four feet. If the weather continues to be sunny, the water levels of the rivers may not rise again.

### Ministry of Finance Pays Attention to Unsound Banks in Shanghai. Orders Datong Bank to Suspend Business for Liquidation. Revokes the Beijing and Chongqing Offices of Xikang Provincial Bank.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the rectification of the Shanghai financial market. Following the suspension of exchange and revocation of license of Jianghai Bank, the ministry is paying particularly close attention to banks with unsound operations. It is learned that the Datong Commercial Bank on Beijing East Road in Shanghai was previously penalized by the Ministry of Finance for violating regulations such as poor management, fraudulent promissory notes, and failure to pay reserves.

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 28th] Chairman Wei met with our newspaper's reporter alone at 11:00 AM today. He said that he is currently striving to build an economic breakwater to stabilize the value of the Taiwan dollar. The inflow of funds is under control, and the exchange rate is adjusted at any time, which has been enthusiastically supported by the people of the province, so that prices have not risen as sharply as in Shanghai. The reorganization of the Monopoly Bureau does not affect finance, and the province's revenue and expenditure remain balanced. Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, he said that countermeasures are currently being considered and must be submitted to the central government for decision. Regarding the unemployment problem, he said that fellow compatriots and people on the mainland have the same character, that is, they want face.

He absolutely does not want a few capitalists to manipulate the industry and commerce of Taiwan Province. Large-scale factories will be handed over to private operation so that ordinary people can buy shares, and small-scale factories will be auctioned off. This province is a province with a production environment. He hopes for foreign investment in enterprises, and speculation and buying and selling are not welcome. Proper commercial exchanges are also enough to enhance the feelings between people inside and outside the province. He also plans to tour the province at the beginning of the month.

### MacArthur Favors the Japanese Textile Industry. The China Textile Institute Lodges a Protest.

[This City News] The China Textile Institute protested against MacArthur's favoring of the Japanese textile industry, not allowing it to be included in the list of reparations and demolition, and repeatedly protecting it, so that the Japanese textile industry is rapidly recovering, which is actually a step towards the resurgence of Japan. The general assembly of the association unanimously decided to lodge a protest with MacArthur. The protest letter is recorded as follows:

To the Far Eastern Commission of the United Nations Reparations Commission, transferred to MacArthur for consideration: Your Excellency commands the three armies and conquers strong enemies. Your great achievements are admired by the world. Now, all the political, military, economic, and educational policies in Japan are in accordance with your orders. The Chinese people believe that Your Excellency, witnessing the brutality of the invaders, will be able to make thorough plans to make the invaders surrender forever and unable to rise again. Who knows that the news came that Your Excellency's measures towards Japan are excessively generous, and the special protection given to the Japanese textile industry is even more so. Your Excellency believes that the Japanese textile industry is not comparable to the military industry and cannot be listed as reparations, and that the existing 2.8 million spindles in Japan are not enough and plan to expand it to 6 million spindles, which will not only be used to maintain the needs of its own country, but also encourage exports to compete for the international trade market. Therefore, the Chinese government's request to reduce the Japanese textile industry has been ignored. This association is a Chinese people's organization and is organized by textile industry practitioners. We have had a lot of contact with Japan and have a deeper understanding of the textile industry. We believe that the above-mentioned measures are enough to threaten the survival of China—America's ally—and promote the future aggression of Japan—America's enemy. We have to raise Your Excellency's awareness and state the reasons as follows: (1) Japan has a population of 70 million. Calculating 20 yards of cotton cloth per person per year, at most 1.3 million to 1.5 million spindles can supply it with surplus. Japan's existing spindles have exceeded the limit required for self-supply. If it is said that it must rely on cotton exports to exchange for food and other necessities, is that really the case? It has been found that Japan produces a large amount of silk, tea, and other products, and the export volume is huge, which can be used as a regulating material, and there is no need for cotton goods made by spinning machines. (2) Japan is the culprit of this war. It dares to act willfully because it relies on its military equipment. The foundation of military equipment lies in industry, but the development of Japanese industry is more dependent on the textile industry. Before the war, the sale of cheap Japanese textile products was not only widespread in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but also extended to Western Europe and South America. The surging momentum is still frightening to think about it, and the Japanese use their surplus to build military industries. Therefore, to weaken Japan's military preparedness, it is necessary to weaken its economic sources, and restricting its textile industry beyond the required limit is one of the best ways. (3) To prevent Japan from rising again and invading, it must rely on neighboring countries to monitor it. The Allied countries' control over Japan cannot be extended indefinitely. China and Japan are neighbors. They can supervise Japan's actions at any time. Moreover, China will be particularly concerned about all its measures. (4) This war was launched in Japan, and the first to bear the brunt was China. In total, the war of resistance lasted for eight years, and the sacrifices were heavy. Everything needed for food, clothing, housing, and transportation should be actively replenished to save the people from fire and water. Dismantling Japan's surplus textile industry equipment in China is an appropriate and fair move. (5) The textile industry is a civilian industry in peacetime, but it becomes a military industry in wartime. Just think, how can millions of troops carry out operations without clothing and equipment? As for those that directly supply military use, such as the tents of ships and vehicles, the wings of airplanes, the parachutes that land, and the bandages and gauze used to treat the wounded, almost none of them are not textile products. Dismantling the textile equipment beyond the minimum limit for civilian use is a powerful measure to deprive its military potential. Is there any doubt about it? The above is just a general outline. There are many other reasons that cannot be enumerated one by one. For the sake of permanent peace in East Asia and permanent peace in the Pacific, we dare not tell you sincerely what we think is dangerous. If you adopt our humble opinion and correct it in time, it will not be too late.

Editorial

### The Beginning of the United States' New Policy Toward China

The US State Department announced on the 27th that the US government has signed a contract with the Chinese government to allow China to purchase US surplus military equipment worth 650,000 US dollars; at the same time, Martin, the president of the US Export-Import Bank, is still considering granting new loans to China, and will divide the nature of the loans into four categories: (1) Loans to promote US import and export trade; (2) Loans to subsidize and encourage private capital without competing with it; (3) Loans with special purposes; (4) Loans decided by the board of directors. These two pieces of news spread to China, sweeping away all the factors that seemed to cause controversy between China and the United States these days.

Although the above-mentioned batch of surplus military equipment was leased to China during the war, selling it to China at this time, no matter how much the quantity is, the significance is self-evident. United Press reporter Shackford telegraphed: The United States' sale of surplus military equipment to China can be regarded as the United States abandoning its neutral policy adopted since Marshal Marshall went to China in 1945 to mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for 18 months. As for the loan issue, the US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan, which is being held in reserve, will mostly no longer be extended by the 30th of this month, which will inevitably disappoint the Chinese people, but the United States has stated that it will not stop providing economic assistance to China, and on the contrary, the US economic aid to China plan will be implemented soon, whether it is a long-term loan to promote China's economic recovery or a short-term loan to stabilize China's current economic situation, as long as the Chinese government puts forward a "special plan" and "guarantees debt repayment," the United States has the possibility of granting it to China.

In the past few days, our newspaper has published three or four editorials one after another, repeatedly stating our belief that far-sighted politicians in the United States will be able to make new decisions on the increasingly critical situation in the Far East. We have seen the above-mentioned two pieces of news from Washington, which makes us more believe that the United States is not short of far-sighted politicians, and that the United States has begun to make new decisions on China.

The diplomatic relations between ordinary two countries depend half on the relationship of interests and half on the historical relationship. From a distance, the United States has always been our country's friendly country, and the relations between the two countries are very friendly and close. The United States has no territorial and political ambitions for China and has used the principles of "Open Door" and "Equal Opportunity" to maintain the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, which everyone has long known. During the war of resistance, the United States not only sympathized with China's arduous war in spirit, but also provided continuous material assistance to China. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, China and the United States became allies in adversity. After the victory, the United States sent Marshal Ma to China to mediate the Chinese Communist Party issue. Although it is inevitable that the observation was not in the middle of the country, his sincerity in seeking peace and unity for China is really touching. Therefore, from the perspective of the development of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the United States' policy toward China has always been consistent, that is, it hopes that there will be a peaceful, unified, democratic, and powerful new China in the Far East, which will be a stabilizing force for world peace.

Marshal Ma's farewell remarks when he left China and returned to the country are still deeply imprinted in the hearts of all Chinese people. Unfortunately, Marshal Ma's good intentions were ultimately obstructed by the Chinese Communist Party's stubbornness and failed to fully meet the wishes of the people to turn hostility into friendship. Marshal Ma must also be very clear and sympathetic about the difficulties of the Chinese government's situation. Logically, there should be no misunderstandings or illusions between China and the United States, and controversies such as who abandoned whom or whether the United States will withdraw from the Far East are even more unnecessary. Sooner or later, the haze will be dispelled by the sun.

Therefore, we believe that the relationship between China and the United States has its historical origin, and the United States will be able to make new decisions on China that meet the needs of the times. But what we should focus on is that China must have a democratic and strong government of its own, determine the policies needed by the people, and resolutely implement them regardless of everything with the support of the people, so that China can truly become a nation with national independence, the development of civil rights, and the well-being of the people under the National Government. Then the assistance of any friendly country will be abundant, not just the United States? "God helps those who help themselves!" On the day when the United States adopted a new policy, we must work harder and strengthen ourselves.

### A Major Key to World Division and Unity

The foreign ministers of England, France, and the Soviet Union held their first meeting on the 27th at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the European economic aid plan proposed by US Secretary of State Marshall. Although the details of the meeting were kept strictly confidential, observers noted that the atmosphere was filled with harmony and cooperation, and it is expected that the three foreign ministers will be able to agree on a plan for the reconstruction of Europe. People all over the world must attach great importance to this meeting, because the future division and unity of the world can be glimpsed from its outcome.

The unpleasant ending of the last Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference gave the world a very bad impression, almost making everyone feel that true peace was moving further away from us. Subsequently, the United States announced the Truman Doctrine, not hesitating to lend huge sums to Greece and Turkey, which were threatened by foreign aggression; on the Soviet side, it intensified its efforts in the Balkans, causing the coup in Hungary and putting Bulgaria and Romania in precarious situations. No matter from which perspective one observes, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is indeed causing people to feel increasingly tense. If this situation is not remedied, not only will European countries fall into a tragic fate, but also the catastrophe of mankind may be inevitable. Secretary of State Marshall, aware of this, made a final appeal for world peace and human happiness. In a speech delivered at Harvard University on the 5th of this month, Marshal Marshall proposed a US economic aid plan for Europe, roughly stating that "European countries should unite and carry out large-scale reconstruction work together, and the United States will do its best to assist them"; and that "in the next three or four years, Europe must obtain more assistance, otherwise it will cause political and economic collapse, so the United States must do its best to promote European economic recovery, without economic recovery, political stability is impossible, and without political stability, there is no peace to speak of."

Marshal Marshall's speech on aid to Europe immediately aroused the excitement and excitement of people in various European countries, and everyone believed that the European haze after the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference might reveal a ray of sunshine from here. In particular, Marshall also included the Soviet Union in the scope of the US aid plan for Europe, which added a new factor to breaking the European stalemate.

Following Marshal Marshall's speech, the British and French authorities decided to invite Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Paris in the name of the British and French foreign ministers to hold a meeting to discuss the US aid plan for Europe. Although the Soviet government initially remained silent, and public opinion criticized Marshal Marshall's attempt to use his dollars to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, it seemed unwilling to participate in the consultation. However, Marshall's aid plan for Europe is ultimately beyond reproach. Republican presidential candidate Stassen also agreed that the United States should provide substantial assistance to European war-stricken countries within the next ten years. Former British Foreign Secretary Eden praised Marshall's aid plan for Europe as the greatest gift from the United States, which is enough to bring new hope to Europe and the world. Moreover, all parties in other European countries unanimously expressed their willingness to cooperate fully to promote the implementation of this plan. Seeing the reaction of various European countries, the Soviet Union finally issued a communique on the 23rd, accepting the invitation of the British and French foreign ministers to participate in the three-nation foreign ministers meeting and suggested that it be held in Paris on the 27th to discuss Marshall's aid plan for Europe.

This major announcement by the Soviet Union made the United Kingdom, France, and Eastern European countries express their gratification. Although it cannot be immediately concluded that the three-nation foreign ministers meeting will be successful, the possibility of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western countries to jointly rebuild Europe has ultimately increased. This is not only a celebration for Europe but also a celebration for the world. The peace-loving Chinese people will surely place greater expectations on it. As long as contemporary politicians and diplomats can use their political wisdom, look at the situation from a long-term perspective, think from a broad perspective, eliminate international suspicion and misunderstanding, and restore the spirit of wartime allies sharing weal and woe as much as possible, and use the perseverance of fighting for victory during the war to create world peace, then the current world situation can be changed immediately. Therefore, we believe that although the three-nation foreign ministers meeting is discussing the US aid plan for Europe, it is actually a major key to world division and unity.

According to reports from various news agencies, the four powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have their own calculations for the aid plan for Europe, and their opinions are not entirely the same. For example, the United States first wants European countries to reach an agreement on their basic needs and establish an appropriate foundation before applying for assistance from the United States; the United Kingdom is deeply concerned that the Soviet Union will demand too much assistance from the United States, so it advocates that the British and American occupation zones in Germany should enjoy priority, but this proposal cannot be agreed to by France and the Soviet Union; as for the Soviet Union, it advocates that European countries whose economic difficulties are caused by German aggression should first obtain assistance from the United States. These differences of opinion are enough to hinder the progress of the three-nation foreign ministers meeting, but as long as the three foreign ministers can discuss with an open mind, without prejudice, and put the interests of the entire Europe above their individual interests, and draft a practical and feasible plan for the reconstruction of Europe, then these divergent opinions will not be difficult to resolve. Although China is not a member of Europe, peace is indivisible, so its hope for the success of Marshall's aid plan for Europe, which is related to the future division and unity of the world, is no less than that of any European country.

### US Representative Sternly Condemns Aggressive Actions of Three Neighboring Countries of Greece and Suggests Establishing a Committee to Monitor the Border

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 27th] US Representative Austin, at the start of the Security Council's discussion of the report of the Balkan Investigation Committee, issued a warning, stating that if Greece's northern neighbors continue to violate Greece's borders, the Security Council will have to adopt "enforcement measures" (according to the UN Charter, enforcement measures include various measures ranging from economic blockade to military intervention). Austin also suggested establishing a permanent UN committee to monitor Greece's northern border.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 27th] US Representative to the UN Security Council, Austin, declared at the council meeting on the 27th that if actions against the independence of Greece continue, world peace will be subjected to a more serious threat. The assistance of Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia to guerrilla warfare is tantamount to actual aggression by regular troops. The Balkan guerrilla war has become one of the most serious cases under the UN organization, and the future of the UN depends on how to resolve this case. The Security Council should immediately accept all the recommendations of the Balkan Investigation Committee, including the organization of a Balkan border committee proposed by the United States to patrol the disputed southeastern European border. Austin also formally suggested that the committee be organized by the eleven member states of the Security Council, and its first term should end in August 1949.

After Austin's speech, Dendramis immediately supported it, saying that it is necessary to take swift action to rescue Greece from communist dictatorship. At this Security Council meeting, the three countries of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania, as well as Greece, were also invited to attend. Representatives of Bulgaria and Albania denied the accusations against Greece. The Bulgarian representative said that the country had never trained a single guerrilla. This case may require several weeks of debate.

[United Press, Lake Success, 28th] The United States and the Soviet Union have been avoiding vetoes in the UN Security Council for a long time, but now the Balkan issue may become a reality. After US Chief Representative Austin yesterday accused the three countries of Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria of violating some of the basic principles of the UN Charter, most representatives today believe that the primary issue is whether the Soviet Union will support its satellite countries, and when the case of establishing a fact-finding mission permanently stationed in the Balkans to monitor the situation for two years is put to a vote, it will definitely cause a crisis. The three countries, including Yugoslavia, have stated that they are unwilling to allow UN investigators to freely enter and leave their borders.

### Three Foreign Ministers Hold Second Meeting to Discuss Principles of European Reconstruction. Meeting Kept Strictly Secret at UK's Request.

[Our dispatch] London, 28th Broadcast: The three foreign ministers held their second meeting at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs starting at 3 pm today. Although the news blockade is extremely strict, the "Parisian" newspaper said that Molotov has a very detailed proposal, which has been discussed at the first foreign ministers meeting. According to reliable sources, the three foreign ministers are trying their best to grasp the basic principles of economic reconstruction. Bidault proposed that all United Nations members, neutral countries, or former enemy countries that participated in the war, except Spain, should be included in the scope of the reconstruction plan.

[Our dispatch] London, 28th Broadcast: Bidault said at the first meeting of the three foreign ministers that accepting the Marshall Plan should be carried out from a distance, and suggested that September 1 be the deadline for preparing the European reconstruction plan. Molotov opposed hasty action, advocating that the Marshall Plan should be studied in detail, and suggested that the future of Germany and Soviet compensation be resolved first. However, according to TASS telegram, Molotov suggested that the United States should obtain guarantees as the first step in the meeting.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] Although the meeting of the foreign ministers of England, the Soviet Union, and France is kept strictly secret, according to reliable sources, the three foreign ministers began to discuss Marshall's aid plan for Europe immediately after holding the first meeting at 4 pm today. The meeting today began at 4 pm, chaired by French Foreign Minister Bidault. It is said that the atmosphere at the meeting was quite serious. According to well-informed sources, the three foreign ministers may have discussed the various subtle issues raised by the US proposal. French Foreign Minister Bidault, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Mueville, Director of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arlphonse, and Monnet, the drafter of the French four-year reconstruction plan, arrived first. After a while, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, accompanied by British Ambassador to France Duff Cooper, Sir Dixon Hall Patch, and Wallace, arrived. Foreign Minister Molotov was the last to arrive, followed by Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov, four experts, and one English-French interpreter each. The three-nation foreign ministers meeting adjourned at 8:10 pm, and no statement was issued afterward. It is believed that the three foreign ministers will meet again tomorrow afternoon. Foreign Minister Molotov left first at 8:04 pm, and Foreign Secretary Bevin left the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 8:15 pm with Ambassador Duff Cooper and consultants. Because the three foreign ministers kept the meeting strictly secret, the press conference originally scheduled for 7 pm was also temporarily cancelled, and it is feared that no statement will be issued tonight.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] It is reported that the strict secrecy of the talks was proposed by Bevin. In fact, France had expressed opposition. France had originally scheduled a press conference last night, which was cancelled about an hour after the three foreign ministers began their talks. France was very surprised by Bevin's proposal, so it is still doubtful whether France is willing to keep the secret throughout the meeting. The attitude of the Soviet delegation is still unknown. However, from the time the Soviet representatives arrived at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend the meeting until they left the venue after the meeting adjourned, they did not say a word outside the meeting room, which was the opposite of the attitude of the British delegation. Moreover, the faces of the members of the Soviet delegation were expressionless and without the slightest smile, so it was absolutely impossible to guess whether they were happy or not. The outside world can only speculate on the process of this meeting. If the three foreign ministers keep the secret throughout and announce it only after the meeting is over, then the results of the meeting will not be known until Tuesday.

### Soviet Newspaper's Tone Towards Marshall Plan Slightly Softer Than Before

[Associated Press, Moscow, 27th] The "New Times" weekly published an editorial today, which is the most optimistic response from the Soviet Union recently to the Marshall Plan, roughly stating: If the Marshall Plan is an economic measure to restore commerce and has no intention of supplementing the Truman Doctrine, then all European countries will "undoubtedly" support it. Of course, no democratic country in Europe can accept the loan conditions imposed on Turkey and Greece by the Truman Doctrine. How can this be called true economic assistance? In view of the fact that supporters of the Western bloc are clearly planning to accept the Marshall Plan, it is currently difficult to judge to what extent the plan can achieve in the future. The original text of Marshall's outline of the plan at Harvard University and British Foreign Secretary Bevin's explanation in the House of Commons have very vague meanings.

### United States Demands Soviet Union Pay a Heavy Price

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] According to authoritative sources, if the Soviet Union participates in the European reconstruction plan, it must open up the economic "curtain" of Eastern Europe and allow Eastern European countries to restore normal commercial relations with Western Europe. This may be the main "price" that the United States demands for participating in any aid plan that includes the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite countries. Some US officials admit that the price paid by the Soviet Union is quite high, or too high.

### Clayton Departs for France to Attend Three Foreign Ministers Meeting

[Reuters, London, 27th] US Deputy Secretary of State Clayton departed from London for Paris at 11:15 this morning to attend the first meeting of the three foreign ministers.

[Associated Press, London, 27th] A British Foreign Office spokesman denied on the 27th that US Deputy Secretary of State Clayton had reached an agreement with British cabinet members to implement the Marshall Aid Plan outside the scope of the United Nations. He also declined to say whether an agreement had been reached in the US-UK negotiations before Foreign Secretary Bevin left for Paris. Clayton is still in London and is scheduled to go to the European continent this weekend. The US Embassy said that it has not yet learned when Clayton will leave or where he will go. Clayton himself still refuses to meet with reporters.

### Stassen Advocates US Participation in Paris Conference

And Suggests Stopping the Shipment of Goods to the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Stassen, who is expected to be the Republican Party's next presidential candidate, broadcast yesterday, advocating that the United States participate in the Paris Conference and stop the shipment of oil and goods to the Soviet Union. Stassen said: "We should immediately participate in the Paris Conference so that our country and the United Kingdom can act together in the Ruhr area to revive the poor and sick residents of that area." Stassen advocated stopping the shipment of industrial products to the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union has repeatedly violated the Yalta Agreement. He believes that at least until the United States has a definite foreign policy, the shipment of oil and industrial products to the Soviet Union should be stopped.

### Congress Asks Marshall to Explain US Aid Plan for Europe, Especially Emphasizing the Loans That the Plan May Cause

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Congress declared today that it intends to ask Secretary of State Marshall to explain in detail its aid plan for Europe, as well as the amount of loans that the plan may cause. President Truman had already expressed his full support for Marshall's plan yesterday.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Republican Senator Colorado, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, declared today that the committee has requested Marshal Marshall, Secretary of State, to report in detail on the international obligations borne by the US government, and at the same time, the committee has also requested Marshall to report in detail on foreign requests for financial assistance from the US government.

### General Eisenhower Issues a Statement

Saying That the United States Needs to Conscript Soldiers

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] General Dwight D. Eisenhower reiterated today that the United States needs conscription and to step up voluntary enlistment. It is said that this is dictated by the current situation and is necessary for the United States to meet its international obligations. General Eisenhower also said that he has no political ambitions after resigning as Army Chief of Staff, and declined to hint at who will succeed him.

### Purge Movement in the US State Department

Many Disloyal Officials Dismissed

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 28th] A State Department spokesman revealed last night that since Secretary of State Byrnes established a special purge committee, at least ten State Department officials have been dismissed for being involved in communist suspicion or negligence.

### US Communist Party Secretary General Sentenced to One Year of Detention

[United Press, Washington, 27th] A federal jury today sentenced US Communist Party Secretary General Dennis to one year of detention for refusing to testify before the House and US Activities Committee.

### US Senate Passes Presidential Succession Bill

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] The US Senate passed the Presidential Succession Bill today by a vote of 50 to 35, stipulating that the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate are presidential candidates. An amendment on the Speaker of the Senate being the first presidential candidate in the event of the death of the President and Vice President, which was proposed by Republican Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was rejected by a vote of 55 to 31.

### US Army Chief Sends Personnel to Berlin, Reportedly on a Secret Mission. Premiers' Conference Held in Soviet Zone of Germany.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 27th] New York architect Moses, on a secret mission from US Army Secretary Patterson, arrived here today. He refused to announce the nature of his mission.

[Reuters, Hamburg, 27th] The German British Information Office said that Archbishop Spellman of New York sent a letter to Archbishop Frings of Cologne, saying that the US will vote to appropriate $50 million to the British and American occupation zones in Germany.

[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] The premiers of the five states in the Soviet zone of Germany, and the ministers of the central zone political departments of trade, supply, fuel, electricity, transportation, and agriculture, held a secret meeting today at the headquarters of the Soviet military government. According to sources close to German and Soviet officials, the topic of discussion was to review and reorganize the economic and supply organizations in the Soviet zone. Two weeks ago, the Soviet side announced the establishment of a seven-member economic committee, because in the Soviet zone, the tasks of the state governments and the central zone government often overlap. The Soviet military government had previously urged the Germans to find ways to improve this situation, but the Soviet military government also stated that before a central government for all of Germany is possible, there is no need to take a final decision.

### British to Protest Japanese Mining on Palau Island

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] Officials here were surprised to learn of MacArthur's decision to allow the Japanese to mine phosphate ore on the Palau Islands in the Pacific. According to responsible persons, the British government has not yet received a formal report, but if this news is officially confirmed, the United Kingdom will follow in the footsteps of Australia and lodge a protest with the United States. Australia has already announced that it will file a protest.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 28th] A spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters explained today regarding the permission for Japan to mine phosphorus on Angaur Island in the Palau Islands, saying that the mining of phosphorus on Angaur Island has been going on for more than a year so that Japan can obtain fertilizer to increase food production, thereby reducing the burden on the United States for continuing to provide Japan with aid. This work was initially approved by the Washington International Joint Food Bureau, and a contract was concluded with a certain US company to mine on the island. After its funds ran out, Washington ordered MacArthur to take over this work, employing Japanese workers and using Japanese funds to mine phosphorus for the occupation of Japan. Angaur Island was captured by the US military and is now under US control, so the United States has the right to give priority to using the island's resources to meet the needs of the occupation of Japan.

### America Flying Arrow Returns to Guam

### Sukarno's Reply Delivered to Dutch Governor. Indonesian Sudden Shift to Compromise. Rumor that Sjahrir May Resume Position as Foreign Minister.

[Reuters, Batavia, 28th] Bodjonegoro, secretary of the Indonesian delegation to the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations, arrived here today by train from Yogyakarta with a reply from Indonesian President Sukarno to the Netherlands, and immediately went to the Governor's Office of the Dutch East Indies to hand it over to Governor-General Van Mook. [Reuters, Batavia, 28th] The Indonesian News Agency said that an army spokesman said that he had intercepted an order from the commander of the Dutch East Indies army to launch an attack on the entire line at 6 am on Monday. A Dutch military spokesman in Batavia denied knowing about this. [Reuters, Yogyakarta, 27th] Indonesian Republic President Sukarno has accepted today the main points listed in the Dutch note of May 27. His reply includes the concessions made by Sjahrir earlier, so it is expected that Sjahrir will be able to resume his position soon. Sukarno's decision to make concessions was made after leftist parties, including Indonesian representatives who had just returned from attending the International Federation of Trade Unions in Prague, urged him to abandon his opposition. It is understood that the main points of the reply include the following: (1) The interim federal government should be established as soon as possible; (2) The Republic no longer opposes the participation of a representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the interim federal government; (3) The first task of the interim government will be to establish a federal agency, as suggested by the Dutch, to form a police force; (4) The Republic government is prepared to maintain internal security; (5) The Republic government is prepared for general cooperation.

### US Concerned About Near East Oil Sources; Iran Considers Granting Oil Rights to USSR

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 28th] Republican Senator Brewster told reporters last night that the Senate Defense Committee would soon investigate America's oil sources and reserves. America's intervention in Greece and Turkey aims to protect Arab oil sources, but to what extent the US will rely on these sources in the event of a conflict with the Soviet Union is questionable. Brewster also announced the contents of a letter he received from Under Secretary of the Navy Sullivan, stating that Persia is an important source of additional kerosene for the US Navy. From July 1 this year, the US Navy will obtain an additional 1.5 million barrels of kerosene, which can offset defense needs.

[Agence France-Presse, Montgomery, Alaska, USA, 27th] Iranian Air Force Minister Prince Firouz is currently inspecting airfields throughout the United States. It is said that Iran may grant oil rights to the Soviet Union, the same as those granted to Britain and the United States. A decision on this matter may be made within March.

### US Attaches Importance to Paris Conference; Hopes Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Will Submit Plans Soon; But the Power to Provide Economic Aid to Europe Rests with Congress

[United Press, Washington, 27th] As the Paris Tripartite Conference is held, President Truman has assured that senior US officials are unanimous in their views on undertaking the task of reviving Europe. According to official sources here: (1) There is currently no blueprint to consult regarding which of Europe's needs can be met independently and which require US assistance; (2) If the Paris Conference can reach an agreement, US officials sincerely hope that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can submit a detailed basis for a comprehensive European plan this summer; (3) If such a plan can be drafted by then, the United States will carefully study it, and the three committees recently established by the President will determine the tasks that can be undertaken based on America's ability to provide assistance.

US officials also agree that regardless of the plan formulated, the United States must continue to inject money into Europe in the next three to four years, otherwise, it will make the situation in Europe more chaotic and cause possible drastic setbacks domestically. However, the power over financial resources rests with Congress, so any promises must depend on congressional appropriations.

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The US government is paying close attention to the conference of the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union being held in Paris, although it is not expressing great optimism. One of the main problems discussed by European leaders is the huge trade deficit of Eastern Hemisphere countries with US dollar bloc countries, which has become even more serious due to the figures released by the US Bureau of Statistics for May. The US's exports in that month have set a record high, while imports into the US from countries in dire need of US dollars have decreased by more than approximately $38 million. In that month, the value of relief and reconstruction materials exported by the US was $1.00396 billion, even higher than the amount during the most intense period of Lend-Lease aid, while the total amount of imports into the US was only $473.6 million, approximately $31.82 million less than the previous month. This state of imbalance threatens Europe with famine within a few months, and the purpose of the Marshall Plan is to treat this ailment. Since Marshall has stated, "This is a matter for Europe, and we should not interfere," the United States is not sending observers to the Paris conference. However, the United States attaches great importance to this conference. A senior US official said today: This meeting may be like other meetings held after the war, but it is not impossible for it to become a turning point in European history.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that although the United States is not participating in the Paris Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference, it may put forward some suggestions that are in line with the concept of ensuring appropriate measures to be taken for European reconstruction. At the same time, US diplomats are maintaining a cautious and reserved attitude to avoid any criticism that could affect the consultations of the three foreign ministers. US political figures believe that the following conditions are necessary for the implementation of the US aid to Europe plan, given the current relations between European countries: (1) Abolish preferential tariff barriers; (2) Make various commercial agreements multilateral in nature; (3) Treat all countries on an equal basis; (4) The right to free navigation on European inland waterways, especially the Danube River; (5) Realize the economic unification of Germany; (6) Ratify and sign peace treaties; (7) Equitably distribute the resources of the European continent.

Until the Partition of India is Completed

[Our Newspaper] London, 28th Broadcast: Reliable sources in New Delhi say that after August 15, Mountbatten will continue to serve as Governor-General of the Dominion of India until the partition of India is completed in June next year. It is widely believed that Mountbatten and the leaders of the Congress Party have informally agreed on this point, but the Muslim League hopes to establish separate governors-general upon the completion of the partition, so that the outside world understands that India is composed of two countries.

### Pyongyang Conference to Open Tomorrow; US Representatives Head North

### Tenth Session of the Chamber of Commerce Member Representatives Congress; Appeals for Vigilance Against Economic Crisis; Heavy Taxation; Plans to Request the Government to Reform and Implement a Unified Tax System; The Issue of Amending the Chamber of Commerce Law Sparks Heated Debate

[Our Newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce held its tenth session of the Member Representatives Congress at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 3:00 PM yesterday. A total of 376 representatives from various industries attended, as well as more than ten officials, including Secretary-General Shen, representing Mayor Wu, Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chairman Du Yuesheng of the Local Association, Representative Wang Xianqing of the City Party Headquarters, and Representative Chen Quan of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. All members spoke enthusiastically and passed 72 motions and 6 emergency provisional motions. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

At the beginning of the meeting, Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, delivered the opening speech, followed by Standing Director Luo Qinghua's report on the work situation over the past year, which was divided into three points: (1) In terms of economic policy, the City Chamber of Commerce, in order to implement the resolutions of the previous congress, organized an industrial and commercial petition group to urge the government to provide production loans. It suggested abolishing the current foreign exchange controls and replacing them with an import-export linked sales system. Although it has not yet been realized, it has attracted the attention of the central government. The policy of suppressing commodity prices has also changed from price limits to negotiated prices due to the efforts of the Chamber of Commerce. (2) Labor-capital issues: After the victory, a widespread wave of labor unrest occurred, resulting in the adoption of salary payments based on the cost of living index. Now, due to the unfreezing and refreezing of the index, disputes have arisen again. The City Chamber of Commerce currently advocates two points: one is to restore the salary levels at the end of the 25th year of the Republic, but taking into account the facts; the other is that when factories encounter difficulties and are truly unable to maintain operations, labor and capital should negotiate and agree on discounts, from 90% to 60%. (3) Tax issues: Simplification of the collection procedures for profit tax in the 36th year of the Republic has been achieved after several rounds of negotiations. The central government has now agreed to change to standard simplification, sampling 5% to 10% of accounts for inspection, and abolish interest tax. It was also reported that the City Chamber of Commerce has won one or two seats in the Legislative Yuan.

Leaders deliver speeches one after another

Following the speeches by the officials, Secretary-General Shen said: After the First European War, France also experienced extreme difficulties in industry and commerce, similar to the situation in our country today. Ultimately, it relied on national unity to restore prosperity. He hoped that our industrial and commercial circles would work hard, unite as one, and that China would not find it difficult to restore prosperity. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau said: The City Chamber of Commerce has made much more progress this year than last year. Currently, with industry and commerce facing a crisis, he hoped that the City Chamber of Commerce would have concrete and practical measures to save this crisis. The municipal government is happy to help promote its realization and hopes to overcome the difficulties through labor-capital cooperation. Representative Wang Xianqing of the City Party Headquarters blamed the current industrial and commercial crisis on internal strife. In the previous National Revolution, the overthrow of the warlords, and the war of resistance against Japan, industry and commerce indirectly and directly made their best efforts. Currently, with the country facing difficulties, he still hoped that the industrial and commercial circles would work together. Representative Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs also expressed that the Ministry of Economic Affairs attaches importance to the industrial and commercial circles of this city and is willing to help the industrial and commercial circles solve their difficulties.

Discussing Provisional Motions

After the speeches by the officials, the discussion of provisional motions began: (1) Luo Qinghua, Wang Xianqing, Pan Shihao, Jin Runxiang, and others proposed that, with the economic crisis facing the eve of collapse, they plan to submit a request to the central government to quickly make emergency preparations to stabilize society and maintain the foundation of the country. After amendments were passed, it was forwarded to the central government. (2) Zhang Zhongyuan and others proposed uniting the national industrial and commercial circles to urge the government to end the civil war as soon as possible and strive for a $500 million loan from the US Export-Import Bank through diplomatic efforts, allocating $100 million to relieve industry and commerce. After a fierce debate, it was approved in principle and handed over to the Chamber of Commerce Council to organize the text and forward it to the central government. (3) Luo Qinghua proposed that, in order to stabilize social order, maintain industrial survival, and the livelihood of workers, the association should organize a labor problem research association to jointly seek labor-capital coordination. The original proposal was passed and handed over to the City Chamber of Commerce Council for prompt handling.

### Mayor Wu Returns to Shanghai, Talks Briefly; Visited Chairman to Report on the Current Situation of Commodity Prices in Shanghai; Adjustment of Public Utility Prices is Still Pending

[Our Newspaper] After Mayor Wu went to Beijing the night before, he returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties last night at 11:00 PM. According to Wu's statement to reporters: The purpose of going to Beijing was purely for the commodity price issue. After arriving in Beijing, he immediately visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, reported on the current situation of commodity prices in the city, and asked for instructions on the key points of the economic supervision work. It was then decided that the Economic Supervision Council meeting would be established on July 1. The focus of its work will be on cracking down on the black market for gold banknotes and preventing hoarding and profiteering. According to Wu, the municipal government has the greatest determination to suppress commodity prices and, in principle, has decided to start with daily necessities. In particular, coal prices will be strictly controlled because they will affect the cost of public utilities.

Mayor Wu also met with Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan, reported on the city's financial difficulties, and requested the central government to provide appropriate subsidies. It is said that it may be approved in principle, but it is still necessary to wait for Premier Zhang to carefully review the city's revenue and expenditure budget before making a decision.

When asked about the central government's instructions on the issue of adjusting public utility prices in the city, Wu replied: A final decision must await the National Commodity Price Conference. He did not bring any plans with him on this trip to Beijing. Wu denied last night the claim that public utility prices would rise from July 1, saying: "It's already too late in reality." According to general estimates, the price adjustment will be in mid-July.

### Additional Budgets for Various Bureaus and Offices; Seven Hundred Million Approved by the Mayor

[Our Newspaper] Due to the impact of rising commodity prices, various bureaus and offices of the municipal government have successively submitted requests for additional budgets. According to Min Xiangfan, director of the Municipal Government Accounting Office, to reporters yesterday: As of yesterday, the office has received 23 additional budget requests from various bureaus, totaling more than 7 billion yuan. In addition to the 4.1 billion yuan that has been approved by the mayor and allocated to various bureaus for use, more than ten additional budget requests have been received this week. Those that have been approved by the mayor include: (1) Printing costs for financial bureau bills and certificates (two items in total), totaling more than 300 million yuan; (2) Expenses for the Social Affairs Bureau's Commodity Price Appraisal Council, more than 60 million yuan; (3) Repair costs for the Yangjing Bridge of the Public Works Bureau, more than 200 million yuan; (4) Service fees for the Fire Department of the Police Bureau, more than 300 million yuan.

### Two Hundred and Three Trade Associations Propose Amending the Chamber of Commerce Law

(4) The Bank Commercial Association and other two hundred and three trade associations jointly proposed amending Article 13 of the Chamber of Commerce Law and Article 16 of the Chamber of Commerce Regulations, abolishing the calculation of voting and election rights based on the amount of fees paid, conforming to reality and democratic principles. This case is of great importance to the City Chamber of Commerce itself and sparked intense debate throughout the meeting. Finally, Chairman Luo Qinghua compromised, agreeing in principle, but not unconditionally. It is necessary to engage legal experts to study and revise the details and consider the matter further. (5) The aforementioned association proposed that the current tax system has numerous items and overlapping collections, and they planned to request the government to reform and implement a unified tax system to improve the situation and benefit industry and commerce. The original proposal was passed and handed over to the council to organize a special committee to handle it. The discussion of the temporary motions ended at 5:45 PM. More than 50% of the members stood up one after another and were about to leave the meeting. Luo Qinghua and Xu Jiqing shouted loudly, asking the members to stay for another two hours, as more than 70 proposals were still to be discussed. They also sent Boy Scouts maintaining order at the venue to persuade members leaving the meeting to re-enter and continue the meeting. There were a total of 72 proposals. Reading them aloud was time-consuming. When the discussion reached the 31st item, it was already 6:30 PM. All the members present had not drunk, eaten, or rested for more than two hours and could not continue the meeting. Therefore, someone proposed that all future proposals be handled by the council according to the review opinions. The meeting then came to an end. Among the 72 proposals, important ones included the passage of the proposal to raise 1 billion yuan for the City Chamber of Commerce's education and library undertakings, and the amended passage of the proposal to revitalize real estate finance and alleviate the housing shortage.

### Jianghai Customs Port Director Yuan Jin Accused of Corruption; District Attorney's Office to Investigate

[Report from our newspaper] Yuan Jin, the port director of the Jianghai Customs General Tax Office, has been accused of corruption by the families of the victims of the "Liuxing" and "Haiguang" ships. The lawsuit lists four points: (1) During the enemy and puppet regime period, Yuan Jin remained in the Jianghai Customs service and offered the "Liuxing" and "Haiguang" ships to the Japanese, using them to transport grain for the enemy at sea. They were bombed and sunk by Allied aircraft, and all crew members of the two ships were killed. (2) On April 4th of this year, when the Haiyun ship was transporting new banknotes from the Central Bank from the United States and was docked in the port, 24,045,000 yuan was stolen. Yuan Jin was involved in this matter. (3) Yuan Jin extracted 25% of the wages of the workers of the Water Patrol Company as a handling fee. (4) The corruption case of Wei Fangjunde, the acting port police officer of Jianghai Customs, is also related to Yuan. After accepting the lawsuit, the District Attorney's Office sent a letter to the General Tax Office of Jianghai Customs for investigation. Yesterday, the Customs replied with content that was beneficial to Yuan Jin, stating that Yuan's stay in Shanghai was ordered by the General Tax Commissioner Meilehe and the Deputy General Tax Commissioner Ding Guitang. The two ships were requisitioned by the Japanese and had nothing to do with Yuan. The theft of the new banknotes was committed by six port patrolmen.

The scheme has nothing to do with Yuan Jin. From September of last year to February of this year, threatening letters were frequently received from the families of the victims of the two ships. After receiving the reply, the District Attorney's Office will begin investigating within a few days.

### Black-Licensed Tricycle Drivers Illegally Organize Mutual Aid Society; Jiang Guangqing Leads Meetings; Disruption of Order Investigated

[Report from our newspaper] The case of Jiang Guangqing disrupting order was transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation by the Hongkou Branch. There are two types of tricycles in the city: white-licensed and black-licensed. Black licenses are for private use and are not allowed to operate for profit. However, some black-licensed car owners allow others to use them after they no longer need them, so there are often black-licensed tricycle drivers soliciting business on the road, operating illegally. After the police bureau revoked their licenses, the unemployed drivers illegally organized the "Black-Licensed Tricycle Drivers Unemployed Mutual Aid Society," led by Jiang Guangqing, and held three secret meetings near Kunshan Garden, planning to publish declarations and slogans, and petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Bureau, and the City Council. The day before yesterday, they gathered more than a hundred black-licensed tricycle drivers to hold a meeting next to Kunshan Garden, where Jiang delivered a speech. The Hongkou Police Branch dispatched police to disperse the drivers and took Jiang to the bureau for questioning. The police confiscated from Jiang's body a "Letter to Fellow Members of the Shanghai Black-Licensed Tricycle Drivers Unemployed Mutual Aid Society" and a "List of Shanghai Black-Licensed Tricycle Drivers." It was found that although Jiang once worked as a tricycle driver, he changed his career in 1945 and is now a salesman at the Guangyi Printing House at 171 Lafayette Road, and has nothing to do with the drivers. Why did he volunteer to participate in the leadership, with no suspicion of inciting unrest and disrupting social order. Therefore, in accordance with Article 153, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime of disrupting order, he was escorted to the District Attorney's Office yesterday for legal action.

### Tax Bureau Employee's Illegal Behavior: Tax Inspector Extorts 2 Million; Caught Accepting Money in Dance Hall

[Report from our newspaper] Gao ZhiKuan, an employee of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau's Third Section, Stamp Tax Inspectorate, has been arrested by the Direct Tax Bureau and sent to the District Attorney's Office for legal action for extorting 2 million yuan from the owner of Xie Xing Hao, Li Wangshu. On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, Gao, together with Ma Shirong, chief of the stamp tax unit of the Madang District Office of the bureau, and Zhou Ang and Zhang Jun, employees of the office, went to Xie Guang Hao at 110 Lane, 6 Dagu Road. They claimed to have received a tip that the store had evaded taxes and proceeded to inspect the books. They found that there were two books that only recorded one or two entries, each with a stamp tax of 100 yuan, and that other taxes had not been reported. Gao and the others then used this as a threat and demanded 2 million yuan, saying that "treating them" would solve the matter, and arranged to meet at the Venus dance hall at 5 p.m. the next day to hand over the money. Li Wei promised, and secretly reported it to the police. At 5 p.m. on the 10th, at the Venus dance hall, when Li handed a paper bag to Gao, plainclothes police officers stepped forward and arrested Gao. He was then sent back to the Direct Tax Bureau. After an investigation by the bureau, it was found that Gao ZhiKuan had gone to Xie Guang Hao to inspect the stamps without authorization, and had not reported the results of the inspection to the bureau afterwards, which was obviously suspicious of illegal behavior. He was sent to the District Attorney's Office for investigation yesterday.

### National Flag Merchant Defrauded; Petitions Court to Investigate

[Report from our newspaper] Zou Zheng, a merchant who manufactures and sells national and party flags, had two people, Zhou Haiou and Yang Tingfang, in July of last year, claiming to be the director and deputy director of the China National Party Flag Manufacturing and Sales Headquarters of the Central Propaganda Department, ordered 3,640 national and party flags and 6 flagpoles from Zou. At that time, Zou thought these two people were extravagant and believed them to be true, so he handed over the flags and flagpoles to Zhou and Yang without receiving payment. From then on, they disappeared without a trace. Knowing that he had been cheated, Zou had no way to think about it. On December 18th of last year, a narrow road led to an enemy, and Zhou met at the North Station. Zou held on to Zhou. Zhou pleaded bitterly and agreed to compensate 3.5 million yuan in legal tender and signed an installment repayment IOU. After Zhou returned to Bengbu, Anhui, he suddenly published a notice to deny it. Zou Zheng filed a complaint with the District Court in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law, claiming that Zhou had intended to defraud, and requested that the District Court send a letter to the Bengbu District Court to assist in the arrest and escort to Shanghai for legal action, in accordance with Article 5, Article 311, and Article 491 of the Criminal Procedure Law, because the crime location of the defendant was in Shanghai, and demanded compensation of 3.5 million yuan in legal tender in a supplementary civil suit.

### A Visit to the Xujin Tutoring School

— Zhi Sheng

Although there are many schools in Shanghai, very few of them are well-managed. This is especially rare in the case of tutoring schools, which can hardly satisfy everyone's expectations. The author went to the Shanghai Private Xujin Tutoring School at the intersection of Linsen Middle Road and Chengdu Road the other day, and the person in charge of the school gave a detailed account of the school's teaching policy. The author seemed to have discovered a new realm. In addition to admiring the school's principal for the rare spirit of education for education's sake, the author believes that the school's thoughtfulness and enthusiasm in assisting young people who are taking entrance exams are worth introducing.

The school was established nearly a year ago and specializes in guiding young students to review middle and high school courses and take entrance exams to major middle schools. It has a pre-university class, a high school advanced class, and a junior high school preparatory class. Now, it is expanding its enrollment and already has 800 students. Recently, at the board of directors meeting, Chairman Shen Gongzhan and directors Chen Baotai and Jiang Jianbai resolved to hire Xiao Yushu and others as directors, and solicit funds to expand the school. The school has added four college entrance examination guidance classes during the summer vacation this year and plans to enroll students in correspondence classes in other places, which has been approved by the Education Bureau. Most of the teachers are graduates of Jiaotong University with rich teaching experience. Their teaching is serious and they have won particular praise in science and engineering subjects. All subjects from the first year of junior high school to the third year of high school are available, and students can choose to study any subject. Moreover, in accordance with the regulations of the Education Bureau, no tuition fees are charged, only a small amount of miscellaneous fees, which can be said to be rare in private tutoring schools in Shanghai, and not easy to find.

Graduates of various schools often regard college entrance examinations as the first headache after the end of the semester. From choosing a school to registering for the entrance examination and registering for admission, they do not know how much running around it takes, and they still cannot be sure of getting their wish. For this reason, the school opened a college entrance examination guidance class during the summer vacation, with five weeks of classes, on the one hand to end their studies, and on the other hand to connect with the college entrance examination. The content of the curriculum is mostly the essentials of each subject, and the examination questions of each school are classified and compiled. If you can fully understand it, then getting into college is by no means difficult. At the same time, in order to enable students from various schools to receive guidance widely, the miscellaneous fees are only more than 20,000 yuan per subject, and the number of students has also increased to 600.

Now, it is probably only Xujin that can truly achieve the two words "guidance" in the various college entrance examination guidance classes. Because in addition to regular review and teaching, there is also the implementation of a college entrance examination guidance plan. That plan of thousands of words can indeed be called perfect, and it is still soliciting suggestions and improvements from students. According to this plan, there are several implementation guidelines that are very worthy of our praise:

(1) Collect past exam questions from various schools, and use the teaching materials of general schools as a reference, classify and compile them into a perfect handout, which is only supplied to students of this school, and teachers of each class will explain in detail the way each school asks questions, the traditional habits, and the attitude to take the exam.

(2) Due to the urgency of time, students are not allowed to ask any questions outside of that section during class, and another tutor is hired to stay in a specially designated office every day to answer any questions from students, whether they are within the teaching materials or outside the teaching materials. Or you can put the questions in the "Question and Answer" box, and the tutors will answer them separately.

(3) Specially hire tutors to explain everything about registration, examination, registration and admission of each school in the office, and the enrollment situation and dates of each school are announced in detail every day, so as to avoid students running around and distracting from their studies.

(4) The college entrance examination guidance committee will handle the registration, examination and registration procedures collectively on behalf of the students, and the school will contact the candidate service group of each school during the examination and lead them to the examination, so as to avoid temporary panic and delay the examination.

(5) If it is the time for the entrance examination of each school, a temporary liaison station will be set up in each school to facilitate the students of that school to rest or ask questions. From this guideline, it can be said that the school is meticulous in helping young students enter college, and this alone is enough to show the spirit of faithful and great service.

In the last two sets, Long was exhausted. (2) Australian Geoff Brown defeated French Berry-Chau, 6-3, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3.

Despite the heavy rain, more than 800 spectators still attended, creating a enthusiastic atmosphere. In the first match, Youjia's Li Guangyao played against Lianxing's Feng Hao. Li had a great reputation, but he could not defend for long, and Feng won by three to one. In the next group, Youjia's chopper Zhou Xintang fought against Lianxing's all-rounder Chen Xingli. The situation was tense. Although Zhou took the lead several times, Chen tied the score. In the final game, Zhou led by ten to nine, but unfortunately lost three points in a row, turning victory into defeat, which was very regrettable. Lianxing's winning streak greatly increased their courage. In the third group, Zhang Shanda played another miracle effect. In the fourth group, Youjia's veteran Wang Huijun faced Lianxing's Wu Zuochang. The veteran Wang showed extraordinary skills, and Zuochang carefully dealt with the battle for five games, with many wonderful moments. Lianxing was lucky and reversed the defeat with three to two, laying the foundation for victory. In the fifth group, Lianxing's new player Jiang Baiquan suddenly showed his talent, but he was unfortunately defeated by Youjia's Liu Zaoshi. Jiang was defeated by Liu. In the sixth and seventh groups, Youjia's Yu and Zhuang had no intention of fighting because the overall situation was already set. As a result, Lianxing defeated Youjia with six to one, shocking everyone. It can be said that the new generation replaces the old generation.

Tonight from 8 pm, the third match of the finals will still be held at the same place, with Hualian, the champion of the third division, facing Youyi, the runner-up. The former won the victory in the third division finals. They will meet again tonight on a narrow road, and they are particularly jealous.

### Yongsha Rise Hindered, Small Stocks Active

The Chinese stock market yesterday was very erratic. Yongsha's decline was due to the long holiday period, the interest payable still needing 3.9 to 4.55 jiao, and the upcoming swap date after the holiday. Bulls could not bear the burden, and major players also wavered, resulting in a low close. The general public had a 50% cash margin requirement, but the exchange has not yet issued a notice, and it is rumored that the broker representatives still need to go to Beijing, so there is still optimistic hope. It rose and fell repeatedly in the middle, with very rapid fluctuations. Small and second-tier hot stocks such as Meiya and Xinguang were very popular, rising instead of falling. Miscellaneous stocks such as Cement and Rongfeng even rose to the limit, mainly because some people took advantage of the rise in Xinguang and Meiya, and Cement and Rongfeng will also increase capital.

In the early morning, news that the US would lend us military supplies improved sentiment. Except for Yongsha's sluggishness, all other stocks opened high, especially Xinguang. After Yongsha opened, numbers 148, 142, and 112 rose to 9450 yuan, while numbers 155, 160, 36, 157, 142, and 163 were sold at 9230 yuan. Numbers 148, 35, 223, 69, 152, and 213 then came in, and number 142 suddenly came in after exiting number 32, rising to 9500 yuan. Numbers 235 and 171 were still selling and struggling, while numbers 224, 186, 143, 103, and 218 came in, and numbers 159 and 32 came in, even buying current Yongsha, and it rebounded to 9600 yuan. Numbers 235, 185, 157, 155, 174, 36, 8, 224, 76, and 32 were all sold, and after 10 o'clock it fell to 9270 yuan. Numbers 125, 232, 76, and 155 all came in, and number 104 even bought current Yongsha, and sentiment easily rebounded. Meiya's current transactions were first hung at the limit by number 223 and Shouguang. Then Meiya was bought in by numbers 202, 157, 197, 232, etc., also pushing it to the limit. Xinguang was forcefully bought in by numbers 204 and 154, soaring upwards. Jingfu was also absorbed by number 204, following suit. Then Yongsha rose again to over 9500 yuan. Numbers 65, 8, 36, 224, and 140 took the opportunity to sell, and it fell back to 9300 yuan. Numbers 190, 78, and 12 were still coming in, and numbers 18 and 104 came to buy current Yongsha, rising to 9450 yuan. Number 235 constantly sold current and deferred Yongsha, hindering the rise. Number 185 also sold current Yongsha, and numbers 130, 12, 83, 224, and small bulls reduced selling, and it fell to 9200 yuan. At 11:40, numbers 231, 112, and 14 made one last attempt to raise deferred Yongsha to over 9400 yuan. Numbers 157, 235, 224, 104, 213, 100, and 148 cut long positions, and numbers 185 and 217 also sold current Yongsha. Although Cement was at the limit due to number 220, and Rongfeng was at the limit due to number 83, with long positions wavering, deferred Yongsha gradually fell to 9060 yuan at noon. Current transactions were also at the low price of 8750 yuan. Numbers 112, 160, 202, 235, 224, 186, and 213 came in, and it was still easy to pull it up before closing. Current Meiya again approached the price limit. It ended at 9170 yuan at noon. After closing, numbers 213 and 152, etc., all came in, and it was again called up to around 9300 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, current transactions of Yongsha and Huafeng each rose slightly, Xinye and Yonggong were flat, and XInhe, Qinxing, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Zhongfa each rose by a little over half a jiao to a little less than one jiao.

### Cigarette Market Declining

The cigarette market situation yesterday initially showed stability, but around 9:00 AM, various parties' funds became tighter again. Foreign firms and foreign-funded firms in the market actively resold cigarettes from other ports, and those with long positions sold off due to the increasingly tight June settlement period. In particular, Hado Men cigarettes had more than enough inventory, so the final ten cases of Great Britain cigarettes fell to 7.44 million yuan, a decrease of 180,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Lao Dao brand also fell by 210,000 yuan, and Wuhua and Hado Men both fell by 120,000 yuan. The remaining Chinese merchant cigarettes also fell by 400 to 500 yuan to 1,350 yuan per carton. American goods such as Six Camel cigarettes are in short supply and inventory is insufficient, and sales are quite smooth, so the market price has risen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per carton.

### Sugar Prices Rise Sharply with Small Rebound

Yesterday's sugar market saw a small rebound after a sharp rise because it was Saturday and next Monday was the June ending period, and some holders were inevitably inclined to resell due to the tight credit situation. The association's reference price for Peruvian sand was 120,000 yuan, ranging from 660,000 to 672,000 yuan. Taiwan No. 20 sand was 585,000 to 590,000 yuan, down 20,000 yuan. The decline of Sanbanche white was greater, at 620,000 yuan. Shantou green was 426,000 yuan, down 4,000 yuan. Hainan red was still 500,000 yuan, Hainan red was 450,000 yuan, and Xinghua white did not change much, opening at 580,000 yuan and the next one at 535,000 yuan. Xing red was slightly looser, at 434,000 yuan, Dia Qing was 382,000 yuan, down 8,000 yuan. A total of 300 to 400 bags were traded.

### Serge in Short Supply

Regarding the serge market, the remaining items are all in short and lively demand, except for snow white and low-grade artificial cotton. The medium thick and thin plain green colors are all out of circulation. Because the total inventory in Shanghai is limited, the factory's production is much less than other woolens. Due to environmental conditions, American and Hong Kong shipments have disappeared. The profit of serge trading is much more solid than that of flannels, so there are few producers and sellers in factories and trading houses. Yesterday, the thin plain serge was particularly in short supply due to the lack of American imports, resulting in its selling price being comparable to that of the medium thick serge.

### The Cultural County: A Full View of Yuyao

— Hangzhou 25th Dispatch, Our Reporter Huang Xing-tian

Yuyao is not only a famous county in eastern Zhejiang, but also an important place historically and industrially nationwide. Spiritually, it nurtured luminaries such as Wang Yangming, Huang Lizhou, Zhu Shunshui, and Yan Ziling, providing the country and abroad with noble character and renowned scholarship. Materially, it supplied essential commodities such as salt, cotton, and tea. However, during the Anti-Japanese War, Yuyao was occupied for four and a half years. The enemy seized the county seat, established a puppet regime under Lao Naixin, while the Third and Fifth Detachments of the "New Fourth Army," based in Liangnong, entrenched themselves in Siming Mountain and its vicinity, dividing Yuyao into two counties: Yuyao County in the north and Nanshan County in the south (the former governed by [blank space], the latter by Zhang Zhiguang). The legitimate county government, led by Ni Yongqiang, remained underground, engaging in guerrilla warfare in the mountainous areas. Consequently, on a total of just over 2.2 million mu of land, there were four county magistrates. Although Yuyao was occupied for four and a half years, its losses were more severe than in other places. In the Siming Mountains, remnants of banditry still lurk, constantly seeking opportunities to disrupt the local area. To understand this troubled "Cultural County," the reporter made a special trip via the Xiaoshao Highway to visit it.

Severe Depletion of Vitality Requires Ten Years to Recover

According to the current County Magistrate Zhan Shiluo, "The bandits not only seized territory militarily and politically, establishing their own regimes, but also issued a large amount of 'Anti-Japanese Currency,' forcibly using it to collect legal tender at a ratio of one to forty, implementing economic plunder and exploitation. Even now, much of it remains among the people, who can only sigh at this useless waste paper." He paused, furrowing his brow, and said, "In recent years, Yuyao's vitality has been severely depleted, and it will take at least ten years to recover."

Current Status of Tea, Cotton, Rice, and Salt: The Focus is Not in the County Seat

Yuyao is bordered by Hangzhou Bay to the north and Siming Mountain to the south, resembling a folding fan in topography and a trapezoid in geology. The southern end is mountainous, producing tea; slightly north is a plain, a rice-growing area; further north is a cotton-growing area; and the coastal area is a salt-producing area. The total arable land in the county (including fields, land, mountains, and wetlands) amounts to 833,173 mu, but because not all of it can be planted with rice, the annual yield is only 1.49 million dan, insufficient for the county's needs. Fortunately, in the northern Yuyao area, local resources are used, with cotton and wheat intercropped, and 300,000 dan of wheat and more than 265,000 dan of miscellaneous grains can be harvested annually, providing some relief. Currently, the county's population is 690,000, with an average of only slightly less than 1.21 mu of arable land per person, so the food crisis is deeply rooted, and transportation from neighboring counties is needed every year. This year, Ningbo has transported a lot of rice, so Yuyao's rice price is still low, at 230,000 to 240,000 yuan per shi. Yuyao's customs, whether in the mountainous, salt-producing, cotton-growing, or rice-growing areas, are generally still simple and frugal. Even the county seat of Yuyao retains the essence of an agricultural town, quiet and peaceful, unlike the hustle and bustle of commercial cities. Mr. Ni Yongqiang, the current speaker of the County Council, further told me a unique feature: "If other places want to host banquets, whether it's buying vegetables or hiring chefs, they always go to the city, but in Yuyao, it's the opposite. You have to go to the countryside to find chefs and buy vegetables. So Yuyao's center of gravity is in the townships, not in the county seat."

Yuyao was originally not a commercial city, but today Yuyao's commerce is even more desolate. The busiest street in the city, "Xin Jian Road," is far from as prosperous as it was before the war. Moreover, according to Ma Zhongfu, the editor-in-chief of Yuyao's Zhejiang Eastern Daily, "Even the current market situation is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. When accounts were settled this spring, many shops had already closed, and more were struggling to survive by borrowing high-interest loans. The situation is quite pitiful. The decline of commerce has affected our newspaper industry. Now Yuyao has only two newspapers (the other is Nanlei Daily), both struggling to survive, so they have long since switched to publishing four-page newspapers."

Simple and Hardworking Customs, Poor Conditions in Rural Areas

The situation in the countryside is not very good either. The simple and hardworking customs of Yuyao people, with men plowing and women weaving, are still maintained, but affected by foreign exchange, some have declined. The southern mountainous area of Yuyao originally produced tea, but the cost is high, and it is impossible to export it. This year, only one or two tea factories in the entire province are operating. The goods are abandoned on the ground, and all they can do is watch it close down in vain. Therefore, tea farmers are reluctant to pick tea. Women, who used to weave hats and sell them to Southeast Asia and the Philippines, a major home handicraft industry with as many as 50,000 female workers, who could produce more than 16,000 caps a day, earning about thirty yuan per month, a major source of household income. But now, Philippine grass hat silk cannot be imported in large quantities, and even if it is imported, the wages are low, so many housewives [illegible]. According to the County Magistrate, "There are currently 200,000 people engaged in weaving in the county, all using '77 hand-cranked looms,' producing 100,000 bolts of local cloth annually, which are transported to Ningbo and Shaoxing via inland rivers, providing a large supply of clothing for rural Zhejiang." As for the [illegible] fields in northern Yuyao, the lives of the salt workers there are even more difficult, and the labor is even more arduous. Women also work with men, doing the "scooping, leaching, stacking, and drying" work of salt production. Because the situation there is special, the reporter will write a separate article to report on it.

Accelerating the Construction of the Yao-Liang Highway, Eliminating Remnant Bandits in the Mountains

Since the restoration, Yuyao has steadily embarked on the road of construction. Although the security problem has been deeply affected by the lurking bandits in the mountains, since the establishment of the Siming Mountain Pacification Zone, the Pacification Headquarters has been stationed in Liangnong, and the Commissioner's Office has also moved to Yuyao to facilitate Commissioner Zheng's supervision of the remaining bandits. Therefore, today the remnants of the Siming Mountains are no longer able to exert military effectiveness. According to local people, "The area has already been stabilized, but there are some deserters who sometimes take advantage of the unpreparedness to do some bad things, robbing homes, but it is rare to hear about it. Now we only hope that the authorities will manage the discipline of the clearing troops more strictly, because the harassment of the people by these soldiers often makes us feel disgusted with the clearing. If the authorities do not pay attention to these details, it may change the perception of the general ignorant farmers, thinking that it is similar to guerrilla warfare during the occupation. This is very dangerous." This is the current [illegible] issue said by an intellectual from the countryside. The reporter also asked County Magistrate Qi about the security issue, when it can be completely suppressed. He said, "It's hard to say, our difficulty is to deal with the intangible with the tangible, to deal with the darkness with the light, to deal with the lawless with the law-abiding, so there is a significant difference in action. Sometimes twenty or thirty bandits suddenly attack a defenseless township office or police station outpost, confiscating weapons, which is a striking example of this difficulty. But in general, we have made it impossible for the remaining bandits to carry out military activities. We are now accelerating the construction of the Yao-Liang Highway. Once the transportation in the Siming Mountain area is convenient, they will [illegible] to settle in their old nests."

Therefore, our topic turned to the neighboring construction. The most noteworthy is highway construction. Yuyao's highway transportation had a considerable foundation before the war, but it was completely destroyed during the occupation. After the government returned in September of the 34th year, it took the restoration of transportation as the primary task of governance, painstakingly planned, and was funded by fellow villagers from Shanghai. Those built by private enterprises included the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway [illegible] (as the Ningbo-Shaoxing Highway), as well as the Yuyao-Zhouxing, Ditang- [illegible], Shengzhen-Yushan, and Guan-Cao Highway sections, totaling eighty kilometers, costing more than 500 million yuan. The Yu-Liang Highway, which is 22 kilometers long from Yuyao to Jienong, was initiated and built by the government itself. The roadbed and earthwork have now been completed. The planned routes also include the Zhang (Shu)-Xin (Pu) Road, which is ten kilometers long, and the Yu (Yao)-(Lujiapu) Road, which is six kilometers long. Now, cars can reach all townships in northern Yuyao, so it has become the most developed salt area in Zhejiang's highway transportation. As for the construction of village telephones, according to the plan, it is based on the original eight administrative districts as the center, with districts arranged separately. Those already connected account for one-third of the county's villages, and another third will soon be connected. This is of great help to rural security.

### The County Government Promotes Two Unique Movements: Grain Assistance for Education and Document Inspection

Recently, the Yuyao County Government has promoted two unique movements: "Grain Assistance for Education" and "Implementation of Document Inspection." China's so-called "document politics" must go through steps such as receiving documents, dividing them into sections, drafting, reviewing and approving, copying, sealing and issuing, and archiving, which is a long and slow process, greatly affecting administrative efficiency. The County Magistrate is a young politician, so he is unwilling to stick to the old ways like old civil servants and is willing to do something. Therefore, in addition to immersing himself in the county's restoration and construction work, he also paid attention to the efficiency of his own government affairs. In addition to the existing inspection methods for receiving, distributing, reviewing, copying, sending for printing, and archiving documents, he has recently drafted the most important part of the document processing procedures, namely the inspection methods for the review and drafting of official duties by personnel in each section, so as not to stop or delay. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. The method is to compile a set of forms, with reward and punishment measures, to be inspected once every half month. According to statistics, the average number of unprocessed documents is only 9.58% each time, which is a great improvement compared to before the implementation. Therefore, County Magistrate Zhan hopes that this method can be improved at any time, so that it can become a widespread and systematic system in the future to help improve administrative efficiency. As for "Grain Assistance for Education," it is to remedy the difficulties of education funding and is similar to "donating funds to promote education." That is, a special committee is organized by relevant parties, stipulating that each mu of paddy field will assist with six jin, three jin for sandy fields, and two jin for construction land, with the tenant and landlord each bearing half, and stipulating that each jin will be converted into 180 yuan of national currency. In May, more than 16 million yuan had been collected. Since March, the national education funding for the entire county has relied entirely on this fund. Taking from the people and using it for the people, benefiting young children and saving the national education crisis, this is also a better way.

Promoting the Spirit of the Sages and Building a New Yuyao

For three hundred years, Yuyao has been known as a "Cultural County." Mr. Wang Yangming (1471-1528) was born in the Goruilou Hall of North City Shoushan in the eighth year of Chenghua in the Ming Dynasty. He became famous for his guidance in learning and created the theory of "unity of knowledge and action." When he was the post station magistrate of Longchang, he advocated education, cultivated customs, transformed the Miao and Li peoples, and quelled wars. His lofty aspirations and arduous practices have benefited hundreds of generations. Today, there is a Yangming Temple on Longquan Mountain in the north city. There is a stone statue, bluish-black, with a solemn appearance, but unfortunately, it was stolen by the enemy and has not yet been recovered. The Ming Shenyuan, where he praised the past and studied in his later years, is now dilapidated, and only the commemorative stone tablet in front of the county government is still available for people to admire. Recently, Mr. Song Hanning, the general manager of the Bank of China in Yao, donated 1 billion yuan and is building a new-style Yangming Hospital in the north of the city, equipped with X-rays, which can be written as the first-class hospital in eastern Zhejiang. Another person, Huang Lizhou (1610-1695), known for [illegible] studying the classics and history and being well-versed in literature, was born in Huangzhupu, Yuyao, in the 38th year of Wanli in the Ming Dynasty. Not only was he unique in historiography, with works such as "Ming Confucianism Case" and "Mingyi Daifang Lu," but he was also a revolutionary, dedicated to the restoration movement throughout his life. His tomb is still in Hua'an Mountain, Huhuxiang, twenty miles away from the city. Zhu Shunshui (1600-1682) was born in Yuyao in the 28th year of Wanli in the Ming Dynasty. He was a Confucian scholar who [illegible] and foreign countries. [Illegible] the fall of the Ming Dynasty, he [illegible] overseas. He stayed in Japan for nine years, single-handedly creating the cultural system of the book, mastering learning, being good at craftsmanship, advocating practice, and rejecting metaphysical discussions. He fled to Japan and copied it on Mount Ruifan in Japan. [illegible] There is no ancient town. After the enemy army attacked and occupied Yuyao County, they immediately sold and held a collective public sacrifice, which shows Zhu Gong's prestige in Japan. There is also Yan Ziling of the Eastern Han Dynasty, who was also from Yuyao, originally surnamed Zhuang. When Emperor Ming [illegible], he changed his name to Fa Guang, styled Ziling. He studied with Emperor Guangwu of Han when he was young and was known for his admiration of integrity. His tomb is between Zheng Mountain and Yuyao, with a "Gaofeng Pavilion." The township has also been renamed Gaofeng Township. The stone tablets of these four sages are all erected in front of the county government, and everyone admires their lofty aspirations, arduous practices, and renowned scholarship. More than 690,000 Yuyao citizens should take these sages as their role models to promote their spirit and build their hometown.

### China's Friend Kennedy, Kuang Bingyao Sits on the First Seat in the Film Industry

During my last few days in Hollywood, I met Mr. Kennedy, one of the owners of Columbia Pictures. Kennedy's full name is Qian, Lichert, Kennedy. He is now Columbia's " [illegible] person". Wearing a black striped suit, highlighting a delicate round face, he is very kind. No matter what he says, he always has a [illegible] "smiling face" that Western society admires most. While talking to guests, he kept lighting cigarettes one after another. He looks like he is only in his forties, so in this [illegible] group in Hollywood, he belongs to the "young group."

Most of the younger generation is dissatisfied with the status quo. Kennedy translated the established practices in this film kingdom and often showed a deep hatred for them. For example, he said: Hollywood's Xu Dong film bosses, Lei Ying directors, and even big stars, they never believe that Chinese people can [illegible] movies, "In addition to the simple equipment and insufficient funds in China, [illegible] they are very suspicious of the acting skills of Chinese people." Kennedy has studied this issue with many people in the film industry. They either say that the expressions of Chinese people are not enough, or that the movements of Chinese people are clumsy.

Acting in Chinese Films, Will Hire Overseas Chinese to Star

But Kennedy, the young man, has always held a skeptical view. He is determined to make a Chinese film, not only with Chinese actors but also with Chinese actors as the main characters. He said that he deeply hates two things: first, many American actors pretend to be Chinese to act in Chinese dramas. Second, he hates many Tong films that treat Chinese people as "errand boys" and as many other kinds of clowns.

Kennedy and Mao Gentao have a deep personal relationship. When Mao Gentao was the Minister of Finance, Kennedy served as a special committee member in the Ministry of Finance, concurrently handling the " [illegible] " of the Minister and the Ministry of Finance's external publicity affairs. He is a writer, a cultural person, a dramatist, a civil servant, and also a wealthy capitalist. When handling the confidential matters of the Ministry of Finance, he learned of a Chinese opium case, in which Japanese ronin smuggled into China. At that time, he was a "working" civil servant and could not immediately write this story, so he waited for several years.

After Mao Gentao handed over the Ministry of Finance, Kennedy abandoned this "poor errand" and returned to the life of writing dramas. The story he wrote in the Ministry of Finance, after his "skillful writing" embellishment, was finally put on the screen by Columbia Public Corporation. This is the origin of "Stealing the National Treasury."

Kennedy said: "After that, I looked for Chinese actors as the main characters everywhere. This is a rather troublesome issue." He once thought of going to Shanghai to recruit, but he was worried about the language problem of Chinese film actors. He said: "American films must of course be spoken in English. English must not only be fluent and clear, but also sonorous and pleasant"! In this way, it has been delayed for a long time.

Mr. Kuang Bingxiong, an Overseas Chinese Star

By chance, he met Kuang Bingxiong, an overseas Chinese star in Hollywood, in a restaurant. [Illegible] From Saiwada after getting married, he came to Hollywood with his new wife, Chen Cuifang. Kennedy's wife first discovered that Chen Cuifang could act, and at that time they talked about many life experiences and resumes. Kennedy asked Chen:

"Would you like to act in a movie? We want to ask you to play the leading role in a blockbuster"?

"Oh my God, I have never acted in a movie. I don't know anything"! The young overseas Chinese bride cried out in surprise.

Some people say: This is Kennedy's "deliberate surprise." When Kennedy proposed this new decision at the company's business meeting, he encountered strict [illegible] criticism and opposition. However, Kennedy's Tao Pu, wanted to invest two million dollars; "If the production of "Stealing the National Treasury" fails, I am willing to bear all the losses"!

In this way, an overseas Chinese girl who had never had any screen experience suddenly entered Hollywood's "star" circle. American newspapers and magazines all published special columns, and Chinese newspapers in San Francisco reported this news in more detail.

Overseas Chinese Youth Narrates His Acting Experience

I met Mr. Kuang Bingxiong and his wife in Hollywood. Mr. Kuang's English name is "Bianqin Fang", which is a direct translation based on the Guangdong dialect. Li Jun is from Taishan. He studied in Sacramento, California as an overseas Chinese student. When he was a child, he returned to Guangdong to study for a period of time. Later, he also studied at Lingnan University. I saw the school flag of Lingnan University hanging in his living room.

Li is only twenty-eight years old now. Since Huang Liuhong retired, he is now considered the number one Chinese actor in Hollywood. When I talked to many overseas Chinese young men and women in the Midwest or West Coast, they all had a [illegible] hot worship for "Bianqin Fang".

According to Li Bingxiong himself: His small world was initially [illegible] picked up by "Paramount". Later, he acted in plays for several companies. In Hollywood, he has been involved in 34 films, 33 of which were filmed in Hollywood, and one was filmed in Mexico. He speaks very good English and also understands Spanish. However, he cannot speak Mandarin. In addition to the Taishan dialect, even "Putonghua" is very difficult to speak. I advised him: It is not too difficult for Chinese people to learn Mandarin. When acting in movies about China, if there are a few sentences that need to be inserted in Chinese, it is best to speak Mandarin?

The domestic [illegible] public also has an impression of "Bianqin Fang". In "The Black Dragon Society's Evil Matchmaker", he played the adopted son who killed his father, and in "Thirty Sands Above Tokyo" ("Kingcom"), he also had his clock heads. In "Charlie Chan's Detective Cases", he still played Chen [illegible]'s second son. The Spanish film he recently shot in Mexico is called: "Shanghai Nightclub."

There are about 300 Overseas Chinese Stars in the United States

There are about 300 Chinese actors who appear in Hollywood, including extras and group actors. In addition, there are also Japanese, Koreans, and Filipinos, who often pretend to be Chinese to shoot films. The period from 1941 to 1945 during the war was the golden age for overseas Chinese actors. Many Chinese people often played roles such as Japanese warlords. One with the surname Luo was famous for playing Japanese warlords.

Zheng Bingxiong's new wife, Chen Cuifang, the protagonist of "Stealing the National Treasury", is only twenty years old now. She was born in Detroit, the industrial center of the United States. Her father is an overseas Chinese businessman from Guangdong who runs a "Huali Company" there. Chen Cuifang's acting "pen name" is "Maylia". The day I visited Columbia Pictures, I got to know "Beauty", and it was "known to everyone".

According to Kennedy, "Stealing the National Treasury" has been quite satisfactory. The male protagonist Dick Powell, the protagonist of "Magic Qin King", is not only a "red star" but also the pillar of Columbia. The female protagonist "Beautiful Chen", although a novice, but she is very hardworking, very humble, willing to learn, and plus her high talent, she performs no differently from veteran stars!

He also said: "It is unprecedented for a Chinese actor to earn 500 yuan a week in Hollywood. When I made the decision, many people scolded me and opposed me, but in order to protect my film - Stealing the National Treasury, I decided to do so!"

The location shooting team of "Stealing the National Treasury" has gone to Shanghai. At the end of this year, it can be completely edited and completed anyway. Kennedy wants to choose me to come to Hollywood again to watch the preview, and I am very grateful for his kindness. Dong agreed with his opinion. I told him a word: Let those guys who underestimate Chinese art go to China to take a look.

Kennedy nodded frequently. He said that he believed that the Chinese theater world must have extraordinary contributions and achievements. He said that he is always willing to visit China. If the Chinese art world welcomes him to China one day! (Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing Reported from New York)

Spring and Autumn

### The Road of Chinese Art

— Wen Zhaotong

Two weeks ago, I saw a special issue of this magazine "Where is Chinese Art Going". Friends in the industry have put forward many valuable opinions as guidance for Chinese art workers in the future.

Of course, in more than a dozen short articles, everyone put forward the most profound and reasonable opinions from various different perspectives; some advocate establishing objective criticism and new theories, some advocate expressing themselves, some advocate popularizing art, ... and so on, indeed putting forward how to diagnose the crux of Chinese art. However, the reality is that objective factors have already proven that Chinese art is a "dead end".

The new theory and criticism of artistic soil are the foundation of artistic works. However, in the current Chinese art world, what is considered a new theory? This is a standard, and so-called objective criticism is the application of new theories.

China's democratic nation-building movement has had a history of several decades, and the historical task of this movement is to build a country owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people. The road of Chinese art cannot violate this requirement and be isolated. Therefore, to solve the problem of the way out for Chinese art, we must first see clearly what is the way out for China's construction?

What comes from this question is "self-expression". Because I am determined not to be absolutely divorced from reality. If you want to use art to transcend reality and escape into the mountains and forests, even if you express yourself, in fact, this is an escape from reality. What does this kind of self-expression have to do with the establishment of Chinese new art?

Regarding the issue of popularizing art, this has been prevalent in various art departments since the Anti-Japanese War and has been promoted with great effort. But the problem is not only about sending noble art to the masses, but the most important thing is how much relationship does this art have with the masses? In other words, has this art been established through the trend of the times, the requirements of society, and the lives of the people?

These many major premises have been determined. Naturally, there is no need to "imitate", and there is no need to make "fake paintings". From then on, Chinese art will not only "emphasize quantity" but also "emphasize quality". Then you can walk your own road at a steady pace and go on the road to revival. At this time, the new form of Chinese art will be successfully created.

The times are advancing. Chinese art workers can only face reality, meet the times, and strive to create, which is the current road of Chinese art.

### An Impression of Mr. Hai Su's Art Exhibition

— Feng Li

Upon entering the Chinese Art Garden, the atmosphere immediately changes, becoming one of clarity and aesthetic refinement. Chinese and Western paintings are displayed on both sides, seemingly without end. Next to the square pillars in the center are placed hollow magnetic stools, along with potted oleander and pomegranate flowers. Along the windows are benches, and opposite the wall are several flower baskets sent by others. Linen curtains divide the Art Garden. The wall facing a row of windows is entirely hung with oil paintings, while the rest are Chinese paintings. The first room is entirely filled with the Chinese paintings of Mrs. Liu, Xia Yiqiao, with each painting arranged in perfect symmetry.

I am not knowledgeable about painting, but this exhibition seemed to capture my interest somewhat.

I remember when I saw "Rui Mountain Misty Rain," I took several steps back to admire it, as if a gust of cold wind swept me into that misty rain.

Two paintings of "Fishing in Snow" express two different meanings. One peeks through mountain rocks at a paradise outside the world in the snow, and the other depicts the towering snow-capped mountains of Java.

"Tongjin River After Snow" consists of four paintings joined together, vividly depicting the green mountains and rivers of Jin after the snow.

There are several paintings of "Red Plum," some painted on gold paper, others on white silk. A larger red plum on gold paper is titled "Competing for Spring in Han Palace," and opposite it is a "Unrestrained Vigor," a pine tree on gold paper.

In "Startled Crow," a startled crow squats on a tree, its eyes piercing, while other small birds flee. Their panicked expressions highlight the crow's nonconformity.

The eagle in "Clouds Moving, Angry Wings Soaring Thousands of Miles" and "Rolling Horse" fully express the intense heat.

The "Double Horses" in the Chinese painting and the "Double Horses" in the oil painting are completely different in nature. The former expresses roughness, while the latter expresses tameness.

The Chinese painting "Cattle on a Hill" and the oil painting "Water Buffalo" both express the nature of cattle, especially the two water buffalo floating in the water in the oil painting, which better presents their natural state.

The oil paintings that impressed me the most were "Suti Dawn" and "Willow Forest Moonlight." I love the reflection of Suti and the light red sunrise, which send me infinite beauty and fun. I feel that "Willow Forest Moonlight" is not a willow forest but a coconut grove, thus filling it with the enthusiasm of a rendezvous after dusk.

### Portrait of a Noble Lady

— Helbin

Holbein (H. Holbein 1497-1543) and Dürer are two outstanding talents of Germany. In their youth, they were very poor, merely painting illustrations for bookstores. Later, the literary giant Erasmus discovered his genius and gave him great encouragement, and soon he achieved great success.

His works are mostly portraits, with graceful lines, rich colors, solemn postures, and special attention to decoration. His delicate and exquisite brushwork can be called unprecedented. The work was originally stored in the Berlin National Art Museum. (Liu Shi)

### Departure

— Zang Zan

When Millet's painting talent gradually revealed itself, his father took him to see Mr. Shanbu'er, a classical painter. This student of David exclaimed in surprise:

"It is a sin to keep this child at home."

Respect the child's wishes and let him go where he yearns to go. According to Dreiser: the home is not lovely, and people cannot be confined at home all the time; small trees near dogwood trees can never grow healthily.

Chicks cannot forever hide in the eggshell; small birds cannot forever hide in the nest. Birds are not born for the nest, but to fly in the blue sky and treetops. All learning is for life; also for the creation of life.

Like Tagore's childhood, when there was no school, he wanted to go to school very much. When he entered school, he wanted to leave again, although his grades were very good. We know how many people are wandering outside the school gate, and how many people enter the school and leave due to lack of economic support - today you come out of this art gate that everyone yearns for, I don't know how many envious eyes are on you.

This gratifying mood may not be understood by you, because you are falling into a state of anxiety and helplessness, unable to find a job. Of course, it is impossible to hide under your mother's wings or in her arms again.

Facing this real earth, what covers your head is no longer a roof but a blue sky or dark clouds. What caresses your hair and arms is no longer your mother but the wild wind or the sun. Everything presented outside the window: storms and thunder, rainbows and white clouds are for you to contact or communicate with. This world is vast and fresh, but there are also storms...

In the vastness, there are no walls, no restrictions;

In the freshness, there is the singing of birds, the fragrance of flowers, the sparkle of dew;

In the storm – there is nothing else, rely on yourself to fight.

Vastness, freshness, and storms have the same requirement - to become a real person, a real artist. Uphold that kind heart of yours, do not sell yourself, do not sell the art that everyone respects. The artist is the engineer of the human soul, the nurse of the human soul, the model of the human soul. — If you can't fix the souls of others, you have to fix your own soul.

(If someone takes short-sightedness as reality; only seeks immediate gains, we don't need to talk about it here.)

The meaning of life is construction, not destruction and echoing destruction. Because the world does not only belong to you, it belongs to the entire past and future of mankind. Believe in the truth, believe that she has come to the sunlight of this world, believe that she is in your heart and will flow from your fingertips.

Five years, ten years, twenty years will pass in a flash. The past prepares for tomorrow's departure. Everything is for tomorrow's departure. Ahead is the ocean-like deep blue, bottomless happiness and freedom, and the waiting storms, and all the lightning, fire and fighting.

### New Views on Bamboo Painting

— Chen Dingshan

The recluse Dingshan once claimed that his poetry was first, his cursive script third, with nothing in between. In recent years, he has devoted himself to painting bamboo without stopping. Zhou Zi bowed to the flower and went on to say: "Mr. Dingshan's painting of bamboo, combines poetry and calligraphy, and can be ranked second, completing the three perfections." Dingshan threw his pen and said: "It is difficult to say, difficult to say."

In the past dynasties, the painting of bamboo was divided into two schools: Dongpo and Yuke. Dongpo was the literati school, led by Zhao Ziyang and Ke Danqiu, weakening by the time of Wang Mengduan. The Yuke school was the realistic school, led by Li Xishi and Xia Zhongzhao, ceasing by the time of Wen Zhengzhong. The bamboo paintings of the Qing Dynasty all followed Shi Tao, breaking the traditional methods of bamboo painting. In the contemporary world, only Wu Zishen still retains the scale of Xia Taichang; Wu Hufan draws from Zhao Zhongmu, and Yu Yueyuan painstakingly studies Song Zhongwen, all of whom are excellent bamboo painters. Zhang Daqian separately originated from Jin Dongxin and developed a profound understanding, being outstanding and unconventional. Ye Yuhu is good at painting small bamboos, and his brush tip has a kind of vigor, very similar to Nan Yue Wang Tuo. The old man takes his own fun. In terms of conformity, it is also like Zhongwen. Wang Jiqian studied with Wu Hufan very piously, but his bamboo paintings are said to surpass his teacher. In my opinion, his wife Zheng Yuansu's bamboo paintings are worthy of Guan Daosheng. Ying Yepin's bamboo paintings strive to improve, but the domineering spirit has not been removed, and there is Shi Tao in his womb. Tang Yun uses Hua Xinluo's method to paint bamboo, with a few leaves on a stem, showing the excellence. Other capable people such as Feng Chaoran and Wu Daiqiu, unfortunately, had regrets in painting bamboo, so I will not discuss them. As for me, how dare I boast? Zhou Zi said: "I have followed Dingshan for thirty years and have never heard him comment on people. I dare to record it in retirement."

### On Observing Daqian's Paintings

— Jiang Suchang

It is rare for talent to be versatile and enter the sacred realm. Everyone in the painting world praises him and he becomes a legend. The atmosphere is dark and chaotic, but looking around, everything is dazzling and bright. The stacked walls seem to still be damp, with misty scenery and lush vegetation. The setting sun casts half its light, creating illusions of brightness and darkness, while the morning haze spreads horizontally, rising into clear light. Reed banks and a single sail hang, and the sound of bells pierces the forest doors. The mountains and rivers of ten thousand miles are reduced to inches, and lying down to travel does not make one feel thirsty or hungry. The painting world has passed Guo Zhong and the clothes and hats have been restored to the ancient system. The slender and graceful woman has beautiful eyebrows. The emerald feathers and pearl sleeves dance rhythmically, and the Cao Yi Wu Dai are like real concubines. The vivid and boneless style captures the original, and the red and purple colors compete for fragrance. The phoenix curls its whiskers in the gaps, and the jade swallows steadily step on the school. The sea chart and caisson ceiling are carefully organized, and the ingenious craftsmanship cannot be applied. The ambition is focused on gathering all the wonderful things, and it is not enough to compare the north and south schools. What strange thing can one do to achieve this? Yuan You and Er Lao respect their teacher. Five vehicles are broken and the six methods are understood, and the drama traces the sky and the earth. Don't talk about unfolding the Tianzhu scroll, and storing the five mountains in the chest to explore the wonders. Bo Ye is of the same spirit and should be the leader. When the wind blows through the valley, he should be the one to respond. How can the fragmented world be restored? Hurrying to the Shu Road, crying for help. Some people carry spears and kill enemies at will; there is enough grain in the orchid ridge west of the slope. The passes are barren and cold, opening up a foreign land, with yellow sand, white grass, and red willows. Wu Liang A Kongbo stone carvings, stone caves groping for silk. Forgetting the cold and hot, taking from all sides without being tired. Mica powder and milk rabbit hair are used; cinnabar is settled and light rouge is used. Azurite gold mud are also collected, and there is nothing that can't be used to assist the eternal ink. What is this foresight, strong and brave, taking on the great task of eight generations of decline? Ignoring the Song and Yuan Dynasties, let alone the later generations, smelting the present and melting the ancient heart is hammered. The glass scene captures the tiger's essence, and the world is trending towards shortcuts, how can it not be wrong. Uniquely opening the atmosphere and marking the right direction, both heaven and man achieve meritorious deeds. From the beginning, a great name is not in vain, and the price is worth ten thousand yiks, what is surprising? Beautiful beard, not yet old, pleasing the nature and comparing to Da Chi. A thousand autumns have long been brewed out of the head, a promise does not hesitate to let the god come and wave; the object and I do not change the inexhaustible treasure, and the recluse will return to the mountains!

### Chinese Painting in the Last Hundred Years

— Chen Yishi

Zhang Yanyuan of the Tang Dynasty said: "The so-called painting is the same as the six classics, and it runs parallel to the four seasons..." The rise and fall of a generation is related to literary fortune; the prosperity of literary fortune is often reflected in painting. The "Thousands of Chariots and Ten Thousand Horses Surrounding the Pagoda Three Times" of the Baima Temple, its majestic simplicity, is enough to show the spirit of the Han Dynasty's unification of the world and the prosperity of literary fortune. Thereafter, such as the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the Northern and Southern Song Dynasties, the Ming Dynasty, and the Qing Dynasty, all had their own distinctive characteristics of the times. Looking at the end of the Ming Dynasty, people with integrity had repressed emotions and poured out their unrestrained spirit in the blue and green. This was unique, forming a style of the times, making the division between our country's court paintings and literati paintings more distinct. However, from the Qin and Han Dynasties to the Qing Dynasty, for more than a thousand years, Chinese painting has undergone several transformations, and from a social point of view, it can still be said to be a long-term fixed era. By the time of the Opium War during the Daoguang period, and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Rebellion during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, all national consciousness and social life underwent drastic changes. Academic thought, religious customs, scientific spirit, etc., directly and indirectly, had a great and significant impact on Chinese painting. Since the founding of the Republic of China, transportation has become convenient, the distance between East and West has shortened, and cultural exchanges have become closer, which has led to more schools and diverse factions in painting in the past hundred years, making it difficult to reach a consensus. The chaotic and complex situation is rare before the past hundred years. In terms of calligraphy, before the Ming and Qing Dynasties, those who studied calligraphy adhered to the Pavilion Posts. After the middle of the Qing Dynasty, scholars copied from bronze and stone rubbings. From then on, calligraphy opened a new path, and painting was greatly influenced by it. Therefore, painting had a fashion of the spirit of bronze and stone. In modern times, Wu Changshuo is one example. The complex evolution of the Chinese painting scene in the past hundred years has been described above. We can infer from this that the painting of the past hundred years has a trend of epoch-making significance, not only because it has research and sorting value in fine arts itself, but also because it can serve as a reflection of the historical era on the entire culture. The Shanghai Municipal Education Youth authorities and the art community, in view of this, during the symposium of the Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office, unanimously agreed that it is necessary to systematically study this epoch-making century of painting. We should know that Chinese painting has the glory of a long history. If we extract its advantages and analyze it systematically from the complex and diverse painting styles of the past hundred years, it will not only honor the past but also benefit the future. Mr. Zhang Binglin once said: "Confucius did not write the Spring and Autumn Annals, the predecessors could not tell the posterity, and the posterity could not know the predecessors." Therefore, I wrote a few words to show that we must not forget the great task of the Spring and Autumn period of the current painting scene.

### Japan, Japan!

— Sea Breeze

Professor Copeland, the Australian Minister to China, mentioned the Japanese issue. He said, "In the past month or two, Chinese newspapers have gradually expressed concern about the current situation in Japan. The Chinese seem to feel that Japan's current development poses a threat to China."

It has been less than two years since Japan surrendered, but how can the Chinese people not care about the tolerance and indulgence of Japan by the Allied Commander MacArthur?

Japan's foreign trade has formally recovered. In China - when all light industry and textile industry have not yet recovered two years after the war, as a news agency in Tokyo sent a telegram: "After the resumption of Japan's private foreign trade, the conflict of interest between light industrial products and China's foreign trade is the greatest."

As for the United States has allowed Japan to whale in Antarctica; opened Anga Island to allow Japan to take phosphate ore; Japanese fishermen asked to fish in the Kuril Islands; the United States, regardless of opposition from all sides, actually implemented it, not only ignoring the protests of Britain, Norway, and Australia, but also seemed not to consider China's current situation and interests, what is this for?

And one of the most absurd so-called "China experts" in Japan, Dr. Komiya Yoshitaka, a former member of the Shanghai Scientific Research Institute, even declared: "Japan will assist in China's economic recovery." His reason and deduction is that everything in China is inferior to Japan, so China has not stopped expecting Japanese leadership.

How are these remarks different from the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" advocated by Japan when it invaded China and the Far East? What are the wise Allied Commander MacArthur's thoughts on the so-called rhetoric that Japan has destroyed all militaristic ideas two years after the Allied occupation?

However, how does the United States view the post-war Japanese issue? Let's look at the remarks made by Howard, the American press tycoon among the American reporters visiting China, and we can know.

He said: MacArthur's control policy is very wise; the United States can not afford to feed Japan for a long time, so it supports Japan's small industry and allows fishing. As for fearing that Japan will make a comeback, China does not need to worry, because the United States will certainly monitor it closely.

Here, we do not want to draw conclusions, please let the reader judge for themselves.

### Desolate Artist - In Memory of Liu Baoquan

— Sikong Wuji

Among my contemporaries, the two artists who fascinated me most were Fanghua Juedai's Mei Lanfang and Liu Baoquan, who died in old age.

I once used two lines of poems to praise them. Mei is: "Occasionally competing with the world for wealth, all flowers bow to the spring breeze." Liu is: "The setting sun and the residual light, the mausoleums and towers of the Han family." The former is graceful and luxurious, and can be compared to peony. The latter is like the reeds by the Miluo River, making a rustling sound in the twilight autumn wind, which evokes a sense of desolation.

When I picked up my pen to recount Liu Baoquan's desolate life, I couldn't help but feel a lot of emotion.

It is difficult to verify the childhood of this drum king.

In short, his sandalwood board career started very early. In the social atmosphere of the late Qing Dynasty, people always looked down on actors, and those who sang big drums were even lower among the actors. As Taishigong said, "The actors are kept, and the popular customs are planted." Artists who live in this land of fame and fortune can only be insulted and damaged. I often fantasize that if the great British writer Shakespeare was born in China, his status would not be as popular as Su Xiaoxiao, a prostitute in Qiantang.

Baoquan did not have the opportunity to receive the education he should have received like the children of those high-ranking officials and dignitaries. (Today's education is no different. It is: "The school and institutions are open, and those who are ambitious but have no money should not enter.") But Baoquan rolled countless times in that bloody reality, and he experienced all the cruel humanities from real life. He has insight into the world, he has a kind and upward heart. Although he can't stand this bizarre society, he finally endured it. For life, in order to get the most basic life from the leisurely flames.

Kant said: "Genius is born. Genius cannot be purely based on learning." Baoquan is qualified in that the creation of genius cannot be expected by people.

However, people are always inseparable from the soil of reality. Genius only refers to his strong sensitivity to people.

In the smoky world, even the most upward people will inevitably have a spiritual nap. Baoquan became addicted to opium when he was famous and called Xiaoshiquan. Every era has its own different moral concepts. Smoking opium was as common in the late Qing Dynasty as smoking paper cigarettes today, and it is not enough to be criticized.

Chinese people have the most shameful habit, that is, they accept pain and misfortune from the previous generation without any change, or even more severely, and hand over the pain and misfortune to the next generation. The father slapped his son in the face, glared at him, and blew his beard and said, "Dare you not listen? When I was thirty years old, your grandfather still beat me!"

I naturally refer to this shameful habit in general. Any kind of character must jump over selfishness and be able to sacrifice oneself for others to achieve its greatness.

Baoquan had a child, and he looked back on his career, being despised in society. He didn't want to continue this father-passed profession. He hoped that his child would no longer be insulted, could glorify his family, and could step into the "upper class"; we cannot sing high praises and criticize whether this view is right or wrong, because it is natural for the oppressed to want to stretch their waists.

Baoquan's self-consciousness made him exhaust his meager income to cultivate his children.

The child grew up day by day, but he not only could not understand his father's good intentions, but even hated his "drumming" father. He thought his father's profession damaged his honor.

Education, education. Did the education of the "upper class" deprive Baoquan's son of his humanity?

Like all true stories, I have no way to describe that long and arduous life. (To be continued) Japan Promotes Hunger Exports

Exporting is called hunger, what a fresh language! I don't know who will be full when importing? According to history and geography, it should be me first?

I have the demeanor of a great country, with a wide door! It is strange that the rich make foreign money, lose their lives, and become nectar!

### Alishan Sacred Tree

— Mai Jiyu

"Sacred Tree" is not mysterious, but a miracle. It is the oldest red cypress in the Alishan primeval forest. Although this old man has been weathered, he is huge and towering, with a dignified appearance, which makes tourists feel respectful. Therefore, the Japanese call it the "Sacred Tree." I remember someone said: "If you haven't been to Alishan, you don't know the beauty of Taiwan. If you haven't been to Alishan, you don't know the greatness of Taiwan. If you haven't been to Alishan, you don't know the wealth of Taiwan." But I have to add another sentence: "If you haven't been to Alishan, you don't know the miracle of the Sacred Tree."

After the "February 28" incident in Taiwan was quelled, I decided to go to Alishan to reverently worship the Sacred Tree as a memorial. At that time, tourists were traveling because the Qing Township work had ended since Chairman Wei's arrival in Taiwan, but the perpetrators of the past were still lurking in the Central Mountain Range, occasionally shooting and killing mainlanders. Due to the lure of the Sacred Tree, I dared to gamble with my life.

On the morning of June 2nd, Mr. Zhang and I took a small train from Chiayi City to Alishan. The military rail is small, it is a special mountain-climbing train, only dragging three narrow carriages. Most of the passengers are those who bring goods and walk alone, because they can get a loan on the top of the mountain, so chickens, ducks, groceries and I are crowded together, which is very disappointing. In the whole car, only Mr. Zhang and I are mainlanders, and the rest are speaking Taiwanese, if another vendetta is provoked, we will definitely be mashed meat.

After the train passed Zhuqi, it slowly climbed uphill, gradually following the mountains and winding upwards. The deep forest and valleys are elegant and fascinating. We looked out from the window, as if riding a motorboat floating in the air. Giant rocks, small mounds, misty trees, and cloud streams are all under our feet. The price is layers of strange scenery, which is amazing. At one o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at Fenqihu, because the elevation above sea level has exceeded two thousand meters, so the climate has turned cold, and the clouds are like a large army roaring, and the layers are swallowed down. In addition to the drizzle, the train is like bathing in the sea of clouds; we passed through 63 tunnels along the way, and at four o'clock in the afternoon, we were finally pulled off the train by the Sacred Tree Station where I admired the Sacred Tree, which is only two kilometers away from the Alishan terminal.

The huge and unparalleled Sacred Tree is right next to the station, standing like an old soldier with an arrogant bone. It is protected by wooden fences all around, as if afraid that people will damage the old man's skin. The surrounding forests are lush, with red cypress, flat cypress, pine, cedar, plum, etc., towering among each other, as high as the sky, all two to three thousand years old, like giant old gods, guarding the Sacred Tree; looking at the branches and leaves of those old men from afar, they densely cover the sky, turning into various grotesque shapes, rising from the wilderness with the gray mist, is a layer of dark veil, covering the whole view of the primeval forest, and weighting it with its mystery and gloom. Vast and lush, we seem to be in the Congo of Africa.

But the most outstanding in the primeval forest is naturally the Sacred Tree; it is a 3,000-year-old red cypress, this tree is 53 meters high, the bottom circumference is 34.3 meters, and it takes more than 30 people to join hands to embrace it. In our mainland, I am afraid no one can see such a big tree!

Too excited, I knew Mr. Zhang was wandering around the old man's trunk, looking up, sometimes emotionally excited, and couldn't help but caress its scales and skin; it has been living here for three thousand years, resisting the wind, rain, earthquakes, and lightning, and standing unharmed, who of us who are fifty years old and know our fate can witness its end?

The Sacred Tree has always been silent to us, it knows too much! The world is long, we go on from generation to generation, but this old man has seen the ancients and will see the future; it is indeed the spirit of Alishan, and the disturbances of the island will be sublimated to the boundless sky with its sublimity.

### The Sorrow of Scholars

— Zhang Mengzhao

Scholars are mostly "poor," which has been the case since ancient times. It is even more so now! The so-called friends who hold pens and consider themselves cultured, though confined to small rooms, barely clothed, and without enough to eat, still rack their brains and squeeze milk all day long. However, the treatment they receive is so meager and pitiful that it is unimaginable! Many writers can hardly maintain their personal lives, let alone support their families. Since ancient times, those who reached the end of their roads were always scholars in blue robes. Who would have thought it would still be the case now! Are cultured people destined to have a "bitter life" forever? According to news reports, a cultured man named Wang Changzheng, because his income from desperately submitting articles was insufficient to live on, procured a pistol and robbed the Shanghai Bank. As a result, he was arrested, sent to court, and sentenced to seven years. According to Wang's declaration in court: "I did not want to rob money, but by committing a crime and going to jail, at least I can solve my personal life, because I cannot survive even by submitting as many articles as I can." The lament of a cultured person at the end of his road, who wouldn't feel moved and shed tears of sympathy!

The government has failed to protect the cultural sphere, and the cultural sphere has failed to help cultured people. This is a disgrace to the Chinese cultural sphere! I hope that my colleagues in the cultural sphere will work hard to expand culture and strive for survival, so as to properly end their careers and wash away their shame. Otherwise, the decline of cultured people will mean the hopeless survival of cultural undertakings! Therefore, I loudly appeal and write this article to awaken the vigilance of my colleagues in the cultural sphere.

### Ye Gongchao, This Person

— Ping

Now, perhaps we should call him "Vice Minister Ye" - but if we really called him that to his face, I know he would be unhappy. It's more appropriate to call him "Mr. Ye" in person, and "George Yeh" behind his back.

Why? Let me tell you;

Last winter, when I visited Mr. Hu Shih in Nanjing, and mentioned Mr. Ye, our Ambassador Hu smiled and said a wonderful thing - "Oh, isn't Mr. Zi already a very high official!"

At that time, Mr. Ye was the Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and now he is the Vice Minister. Following Mr. Hu's tone, he should indeed be a "higher official". However, since the beginning of China, there have been many Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs, but there is only one "George Yeh".

He is more than just a Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs!

For example, he is a Gentleman. Whether this word is translated as "gentleman" or "junzi," it is accurate for Mr. Ye. The so-called "gentleman" is definitely not just neatly dressed and courteous. Mr. Ye's generosity and sincerity are certainly beyond the reach of those who specialize in imitating Gentlemen's Gentlemen. There is a widespread anecdote about Mr. Ye at Tsinghua University: Mr. Ye has a rich collection of antiques, paintings, and books. It is said that if someone comes to his home and sees those antiques and really feels reluctant to let them go, as long as Mr. Ye sees that this person is indeed a connoisseur, he will often give them away immediately. But if you are just a snobbish vulgar person who talks nonsense, then sorry, he may give you a slap in the face.

Perhaps I can say that Mr. Ye has "three parts young master, seven parts famous scholar" air. Indeed, he often dresses impeccably, but it is not that he never appears unkempt: in winter, he wears a neat Western suit inside a fur coat (and the tie is always neatly tied); when wearing a long gown, he often does not button the collar, and recently a reporter visited him at the International Hotel and was shocked when he pushed open the door - it turned out that Mr. Ye was wearing clothes that looked like he had just been soaked in a vat! (Of course, this reporter was a "Mr." and not a "Ms."; it is said that Mr. Ye dresses for guests, and the guests were quite uneasy for a long time.)

However, if Mr. Ye sets his mind to dressing up, he can also be quite sophisticated! Not only is the whole body Immatcnlateto the last detail, but even when speaking, he does not use words carelessly. To give an example: he once said that although the Beijing dialect is quite beautiful and colorful, words like "压根儿 (yā gēnr)" seem vulgar and should be discarded.

Mr. Ye writes good prose, writes good calligraphy, and occasionally composes a few regulated poems with a strong Song Dynasty flavor when he is in the mood.

However, I cannot talk about poetry recklessly when mentioning Mr. Ye, because I know that what he hates most is "superficiality".

But, I have to talk about his English, let me borrow someone else's words -

One day, I was talking about Mr. Ye with Mr. Colin MacDonald, the former press attache of the British Embassy. Mr. MacDonald said seriously: "Mr. Ye's English is really perfect English!"
