### My Delegation to the UN General Assembly: Foreign Minister Wang and Others to Fly to America Today; Discussions on the Japanese Peace Treaty

[Our Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang and his party arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 2:45 PM yesterday. They are scheduled to depart at 6:30 AM this morning on a Pan American Airlines flight to America, with a planned stopover in Honolulu before flying to San Francisco. They will rest for one or two days before proceeding to New York. Mr. Feng Jinbai and Mr. Zhou Qianchong have already departed by ship to America yesterday. According to informed sources speaking to reporters, although the UN General Assembly session will last as long as two months, Foreign Minister Wang, due to his duties at the ministry, will return home within a month. One or two of the accompanying personnel may remain in the United States to handle all matters. During this trip to America, Foreign Minister Wang may confer with leaders of relevant countries on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. Based on the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission in June of this year, there are no significant differences in viewpoints among the countries regarding the strictness of the peace treaty. Therefore, the problem may not lie in the peace treaty itself, but in its implementation. However, after the peace treaty is established, the executor will not be the United States alone, but a regulatory body established by various countries to supervise its implementation. Furthermore, the question of whether to raise the issue of Dalian at the United Nations General Assembly has not yet been considered by us. Because the situation in Dalian is already clear to the world, and there is a lack of solutions to the problem. Raising it at the General Assembly at this time would not help in practice and may delay the speed of resolving the problem. However, everything will depend on the actual situation, and it is not yet possible to say for sure whether to raise it.

Foreign Minister Issues Statement; Supports Reasonable Interpretation of the Veto Power

[Our Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang issued the following statement yesterday:

One of the important issues to be discussed at this session of the United Nations General Assembly is the veto power. A proposal to amend the United Nations Charter related to this issue has been included in the provisional agenda of the meeting. Our government believes that the solution to such an important issue lies in establishing a generally reasonable interpretation of the veto power as stipulated in the Charter and reaching an agreement among all parties, rather than amending the Charter itself. Moreover, amending the Charter is unlikely to be realized at present. Since the establishment of the United Nations, it has not yet had a sufficient opportunity to be tested. I believe this opportunity should be given to the United Nations.

Although the Chinese government has doubts about the possibility of amending the Charter at present, it is fully prepared to respect the majority opinion of the General Assembly regarding the reasonable interpretation of the veto power in the Charter in order to restrict its use. When the San Francisco Conference adopted the United Nations Charter in 1945, the four major powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China jointly issued an interpretation of this matter when necessary. The Chinese government also intends to support proposals to change this interpretation.

As for the issue of convening a peace conference with Japan, it is clearly not within the scope of the General Assembly's authority. However, I am still willing to take advantage of my presence in New York to exchange views on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty with the leaders of all countries directly related to the peace treaty with Japan. In July of this year, the Chinese government, in response to the United States' proposal to convene a preliminary conference on Japan, stated that the Chinese government is willing to make some concessions regarding the veto power applied in that conference, if other countries can agree. However, China has clearly stated that if the Soviet government refuses to participate in the conference proposed by the United States, China will reconsider its position on this matter.

Now some people are talking about a separate peace treaty. China believes that we should not lightly abandon the cooperation of some countries and separately propose a peace treaty with Japan. The purpose of our efforts should be to conclude a treaty that benefits all the Allied countries and is jointly supported by all the Allied countries. Because only such a treaty can enable us to fully enjoy the benefits of peace. Needless to say, no country should unreasonably obstruct the realization of this goal. Regarding the organization and procedures of the agency responsible for drafting the Japanese peace treaty, I think it may be based on the organization and procedures of the Far Eastern Commission. In this Far Eastern Commission, all eleven countries that directly fought against Japan, not just China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, have representatives participating. At the same time, the four major powers of Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union each retain the veto power over the resolutions within the meeting. This method, or other similar methods, should be applicable to the preparatory meeting for drafting the Japanese peace treaty to break the current stalemate on this matter. The veto power system applied to the German peace treaty in the Foreign Ministers' Conference is indeed debatable, but we should not ignore the fact that the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland were established under the same system. In addition, in accordance with the procedures described above, the Far Eastern Commission also reached a unanimous resolution on the basic policies of the Allied countries toward Japan. Winning peace is certainly a difficult task. We should all be prepared to work hard for this difficult task. The efforts made for this should not be less than the efforts made to defeat the enemy in a hundred battles, or even more.

### British Parliamentary Delegation to Visit China; Arriving in Nanjing on October 6th

We will treat them with state guest honors

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] It is learned that the British parliamentary delegation to visit China is scheduled to depart for China at the end of September, with a planned stay of four weeks. Our government will treat them with state guest honors. The approximate itinerary in China is as follows: They are expected to arrive in Hong Kong on October 3rd, and in Nanjing on the 6th. After a brief stay in Nanjing, they will fly to various locations including Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Qingdao, Shenyang, and Taiwan on the 11th for sightseeing.

### A Rain in Kuling Signals Autumn; Tourists Plan to Return

Gu Zhengding and Zheng Yanfen Return to Nanjing

[Our Dispatch from Kuling, 5th] After a heavy rain last night, the weather here suddenly turned cold. The room temperature this morning was seventy-two degrees, indicating the arrival of autumn. Tourists on the mountain are planning to return, with more than 300 people scheduled to descend the mountain within the week. The Chairman and his wife did not go out for sightseeing on the 5th. Mrs. Chiang hosted a banquet at the official residence at 6:00 PM, inviting Mr. An Wen, the Western adviser to the Mountain Administration Bureau, and five people from Shanxi Province to accompany them.

[Our Dispatch from Kuling, 5th] Gu Zhengding and Zheng Yanfen left Kuling by plane at 10:00 AM on the 5th after being summoned to see the Chairman again.

### Handling Overseas Deposits

Will Proceed Through Diplomatic Channels

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the use of overseas deposits of Chinese citizens, the Control Yuan had previously decided to send supervisors such as Yang Nairu to the Ministry of Finance to thoroughly investigate the implementation of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. However, since the "Draft Regulations on the Declaration and Registration of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China" was passed by the Entire Economic Commission, this matter seems to no longer require thorough investigation. Whether overseas assets of Chinese citizens can be handled now depends solely on whether foreign countries will provide us with assistance. It is heard that the authorities will soon pursue diplomatic channels again to negotiate with relevant countries.

### The "Policy Guidelines for the 37th Year" Proposal; The Executive Yuan Will Not Discuss It

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] The policy guidelines for the government in the 37th year, drafted by the Central Design Bureau, were submitted to the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting for discussion on the 5th. However, the political commissioners pointed out that the current period is a transitional one, and it is not appropriate to establish the policy guidelines for the government under constitutional rule. The proposal was rejected.

### Assembly and Resident Committee Request the Government to Send Control Committee Members to Supervise Elections; Minister of Interior Emphasizes Reforming Local Politics

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] After Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng reported on internal affairs measures at the Assembly and Resident Committee meeting on the 5th, assembly members Xue Mingjian, Wu Chunwu, and others raised questions about the current handling of election affairs, focusing on election fraud and local political issues, especially regarding cleaning up local politics and reorganizing local governments before the general election. In his response, Zhang emphasized his determination to reform local governments and said that he had previously suggested to the authorities that some provincial governors be transferred in order to achieve the goal of reforming politics. At the same time, he expressed his determination to punish fraud and eliminate corruption. As for election affairs, he will ensure that they can be completed on schedule. If there are any cases of local officials covering up wrongdoing, they will be punished after being discovered. Regarding the implementation of elections in the pacification zones, Zhang said that he will submit a detailed report on the pacification zones to the National Government for instructions before the 15th of this month to facilitate the handling. Subsequently, a proposal on election supervision by Yin Shuxian and others was passed. The proposal is as follows: It is proposed that the government specially dispatch Control Yuan committee members to various constituencies to supervise election affairs in order to establish a good foundation for constitutional government. It was decided to send it to the government for prompt action.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Resident Committee of the Political Assembly held its fourth meeting at the National Assembly Hall at 9:00 AM on the 5th. After Secretary-General Shao Lizhi read a written report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Zhang of the Interior gave a report on internal affairs and answered questions. Subsequently, the assembly members raised many questions and suggestions, to which Mr. Zhang responded truthfully. Then, the discussion of proposals proceeded, and the written report submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was passed.

### Important Figures from Shanghai's Business and Industrial Circles Jointly Send a Telegram to the American Authorities, Explaining China's Situation Amidst World Turmoil; Willing to Continue Promoting Cooperation Based on Sympathy and Friendship

[Central News Agency, Our City] Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, important figures from Shanghai's business and industrial circles, including Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jilou, held a meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to discuss the situation between China and the United States after the departure of the Wedemeyer Mission. As a result, it was decided to jointly send a telegram to the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, and congressional leaders immediately, expressing important opinions. The full text of the telegram is recorded below:

The people of our country express their deep gratitude to your government for sending the Wedemeyer Fact-Finding Mission to China. What we regret is that during Special Envoy Wedemeyer's stay in China, we did not have the opportunity to present our opinions in person. We hereby represent the major industrial and commercial sectors of our country and respectfully present our views for your consideration.

We do not wish to gloss over the deeply regrettable situation in our country today. However, we believe that the situation in our country should be viewed from the perspective of the widespread post-war global disorder. Consider the United Kingdom, with its strict discipline and its territory never ravaged by the enemy during the war. What is its situation today? What about the situations in France, Italy, Greece, and other Eastern European countries? Even take the countries of South America as an example. Your President and Secretary of State just attended the Pan-American Conference and declared its success. These countries have not suffered from war and even had large surpluses of US dollars two years ago. What is their situation today?

Our country has been at war with Japan for more than four years before the Pearl Harbor incident. Two years ago today, when the World War ended, we were also tragically subjected to the destruction and rebellion of the Chinese Communists. Due to these various factors, it would be surprising if the situation were not as serious as it is today.

Chairman Chiang, with his outstanding leadership, has led China to victory in the difficult war of resistance against Japan. The people and government of our country will certainly continue to make unremitting efforts under his leadership to seek reform and progress. However, we believe that the China problem cannot be viewed in isolation and should be seen as part of the widespread post-war global illness. Making demands for perfection in an ivory tower may not be helpful in any way. Your country has always expressed broad sympathy for our country and its difficulties. We firmly believe and hope that your country will continue to maintain its friendly and supportive attitude.

Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Xu Jilou, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Du Yong, Chairman of the Joint Association of the National Cotton Spinning Industry, Li Ming, Chairman of the National Bankers' Association, Zhao Dihua, Standing Director of the National Bankers' Association, Li Renzai, Secretary-General of the National Bankers' Association, Shen Rixin, Chairman of the Shanghai Money Trade Association, Wei Zhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Trust Industry Association, Shou Jingwei, Standing Director of the China Industrial and Commercial Association, Wang Zulin, Secretary-General of the China Industrial and Commercial Association, Xu Xueyu, Standing Director of the National Shipping Industry Association, Wu YunChu, Chairman of the National Industries Association, Jin Runxiang, Chairman of the Shanghai Paper Industry Association, Cai Xintao, Chairman of the Shanghai Silk Weaving Industry Association, Pan Shihao, Chairman of the Shanghai Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, Hu Xiyuan, Chairman of the Shanghai Electrical Equipment Industry Association, and Luo Qinghua, Standing Director of the China Tea Association.

### Five Municipal Councils Again Jointly Send a Telegram to the Central Government, Requesting an Increase in the Number of National Assembly Representatives

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Qingdao Municipal Councils and the Shenyang Provisional Municipal Council had previously jointly suggested to the Executive and Legislative Yuans that "each district in the directly administered municipalities should elect one National Assembly representative, and one female representative should be allocated for every ten representatives." This proposal has not yet been approved. Therefore, yesterday, these five municipal councils again jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang and Vice-Chairman Sun, requesting that it be submitted to the State Council for adoption immediately. They also sent a separate telegram to the other seven directly administered municipalities of Peiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Dalian, Harbin, and Chongqing, seeking a unified position. The original text of their telegram to Chairman Chiang and Vice-Chairman Sun first cited four reasons, including population density and the effectiveness of National Assembly representatives exercising political power, to argue that "directly administered municipalities cannot be regarded as equal to counties and cities." It then stated, "Although the Constitution does not explicitly stipulate how to calculate the number of National Assembly representatives for directly administered municipalities, according to traditional customs, the 'district' of a directly administered municipality can be interpreted as an equivalent area to a county. The population of each district-level unit in our country's directly administered municipalities, such as Nanjing and Qingdao, averages around 100,000 people, which exceeds that of a county in the inland provinces. Shanghai, on the other hand, mostly has around 200,000 people. In fact, the population of thousands of counties across the country is below 200,000 people. Therefore, the 'district' of a directly administered municipality should be interpreted as an equivalent area to the 'county or city and its equivalent area' in Article 26, paragraph 1 of the Constitution. Having each district elect one National Assembly representative would be in accordance with the correct interpretation of the Constitution. The conference has unanimously advocated that in directly administered municipalities, each district should elect one National Assembly representative, and one female representative should be allocated for every ten representatives, requesting the Executive and Legislative Yuans to adopt it, but unfortunately, it has not yet been approved. Therefore, we are listing the gains and losses again and jointly requesting your approval. Please submit it to the State Council for adoption, and amend the current National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law and the table of allocation of seats, etc., to confirm that the 'district' of a directly administered municipality is an equivalent area to the 'county or city' in Article 26, paragraph 1 of the Constitution, and each district elects one National Assembly representative, in order to conform to the correct interpretation of the Constitution and satisfy the hopes of the citizens. We hope to receive your instructions promptly."

### Iliness Undermines Xinjiang Peace; Zhang Zhizhong Sternly Questions, Sends Letters to Ahmetjan Qasimi and Rahimjan Sabirhajiev

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 5th, Urgent Telegram] Since Deputy Chairman Ahmetjan Qasimi and Deputy Director Rahimjan Sabirhajiev left without resigning last month, the situation in Xinjiang has become increasingly serious. It is learned that General Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwestern Headquarters, sent letters to Ah and Lai, first stating that he had been faithfully implementing the central government's established policy of giving the people of Xinjiang peace, democracy, freedom, and all rights to which they are entitled since the signing of the Peace Agreement. However, the Iliness side not only showed no sincerity in implementing the Peace Agreement, but also created many tragedies and disputes. Recently, they even instigated opposition to Masud as Chairman. They also launched riots in the three counties of Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun, and pointed out the fact that they have no concept of the motherland, developing their so-called "East Turkestan" movement and instigating opposition to Han Chinese with the help of the Soviets. He then put forward five principles for future cooperation: (1) Thoroughly implement the Peace Agreement and both sides should honestly review the past rights and wrongs. (2) Promote the construction of the New Three Principles of the People based on the spirit of "guaranteeing peace in the province, upholding national unity, implementing democratic politics, and strengthening ethnic unity" as stipulated in the provincial committee's words and the provincial administration's platform. (3) Abandon factional control, achieve special political intentions, support democratic leadership, and promote the realization of democratic politics. (4) Abandon political struggles and actively carry out economic, educational, and cultural construction to meet the wishes of the people of Xinjiang. (5) Uphold national unity and promote Sino-Soviet friendship. Finally, he raised serious questions to the Iliness side: (1) Is the complete withdrawal of the Iliness members a unilateral tearing up of the Peace Agreement, declaring it invalid? (2) If the Iliness side unilaterally tears up the Peace Agreement, are they preparing for another armed rebellion, undermining peace, and are they willing to bear the responsibility for violating their oath of office to "guarantee peace in the province" and "be subject to the punishment of heaven and national law"? (3) If there is no intention of either of the above, are they willing to return to Dihua to discuss openly and seek reasonable and legal solutions to "all problems"? The full text is more than 4,000 words, with stern words and righteous meaning, but still reveals tolerance and magnanimity throughout. It is reported that this letter was sent out the day before yesterday.

### Newspapers, Magazines, etc.

Regulations Stipulate Automatic Reduction in Size

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] The regulations on saving paper for newspapers, magazines, and books, which were passed and promulgated by the Executive Yuan on the 5th, are as follows:

Article 1. Local newspapers should strive to save space in the layout of news and advertisements. Those that were originally more than one sheet should automatically reduce to one sheet after the promulgation of these regulations. Those that were originally more than two sheets should not exceed two sheets.

Article 2. The size of local magazines should comply with the following regulations: 1. Weeklies should be limited to sixteen pages per issue. 2. Bi-monthly magazines should be limited to thirty-two pages per issue. 3. Monthly magazines and above should be limited to sixty-four pages per issue. The number of pages mentioned above is calculated on one side. The cover may be four pages extra.

Article 3. Newspapers, magazines, and books should use domestic paper as much as possible.

Article 4. The Ministry of Interior may, based on actual needs, moderately adjust the number of newspapers and magazines in various places to achieve a balanced cultural development while saving resources.

Article 5. Newspapers and magazines without sufficient funds and fixed addresses should be strictly restricted from registering.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] In the regulations on saving paper for newspapers, it is stipulated that local newspapers can automatically reduce their size. Someone asked Secretary-General Gan that if this regulation is not enforced, how can it be implemented immediately? Gan replied, hoping that it can be done automatically.

### Commercial Dance Halls Completely Banned Within a Month

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] The regulations banning commercial dance halls were discussed for a long time at the political affairs meeting on the 5th. Some committee members believed that there are differences between Eastern and Western customs regarding the act of "dancing." In Europe and the United States, soldiers returning from the battlefield must first dance all night long, preferring to enjoy themselves today and die in battle tomorrow. However, it is not the same in our country. The general public's perception is quite different. Especially the atmosphere in commercial dance halls is not good. Therefore, after heated discussions, it was decided to completely ban them within one month before the end of September.

### Japanese Textile Industry Included in Reparation Materials; We Strenuously Argue to the Far Eastern Commission

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the suggestion that the Japanese textile industry must be included in reparation materials, our government has telegraphed Ambassador Gu Weijun to the United States, formally submitting it to the Far Eastern Commission and arguing for it strenuously.

### Sino-Soviet, Sino-Burmese, Sino-Korean Border Survey Teams

Scheduled to Depart from Nanjing in Early October

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] In order to carefully survey our country's defense borders, the Ministry of Interior has joined the Ministries of National Defense and Foreign Affairs to form a survey team, scheduled to depart in early October to survey the undetermined areas of the Sino-Soviet, Sino-Burmese, and Sino-Korean borders, to serve as a reference for establishing permanent borders.

### Japan Lacks Both Raw Materials and Capital; No Large Output of Goods for Export; Opening Trade is Actually Equivalent to Barter

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Responsible officials said that opening trade with Japan is not as serious as outside concerns. The Japanese side also does not have a large number of goods for overseas export. The situation is as follows: (1) This time, the Allied Headquarters only allowed foreign merchants to go to Japan and did not allow Japanese merchants to go abroad to promote goods. Japanese merchants cannot operate in the markets of other countries. (2) Japan is currently short of both raw materials and capital, and its production capacity has decreased. There are no large quantities of goods available for export, let alone dumping. Moreover, the prices of Japanese goods are strictly controlled by the Allied Headquarters, making it difficult to compete with other countries. (3) The Japanese goods that can be purchased with cash are only seafood, bamboo lacquerware, and other consumables. All machinery and important hardware materials must be exchanged for raw materials imported into Japan. Opening trade in name is actually equivalent to barter. (4) Judging from the difficult situation of barter trade between our country and Japan and the difficulty of exchanging materials in Japan over the past year, the development of Sino-Japanese trade is not very optimistic. According to the considerable barter funds that our country still owes to Japan last year, although it has not been settled this year, the amount must increase. It is not easy to purchase. Trade is different from reparations. It must first send the materials it needs and then be able to exchange them for the materials that we are allowed to import back home.

### National Austerity and Thrift to Remedy Lack of Foreign Exchange; The Executive Yuan Promulgates Five Measures Yesterday

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] The proposal to practice austerity and thrift was passed by the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting on the 5th. Gan Naiguang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, held a press conference at 6:00 PM to announce the various measures and explain the main points of implementing austerity at the present time. The measures announced today include (1) Measures to restrict the private use of automobiles, (2) Implementation measures for saving on banquet consumption, (3) Implementation measures for promoting punctuality, (4) Inspection measures for promoting austerity and thrift (all of the above are found in this newspaper's second page on the 3rd of this month), and (5) Measures to save paper for newspapers and magazines. An organizational regulation for the Austerity and Supervision Committee specially established by the Executive Yuan for the implementation of austerity was also announced. Gan declared on the spot that our government is currently short of both materials and foreign exchange. To remedy the lack of materials, we can find ways to increase production, while to remedy the lack of foreign exchange, we can only practice austerity and thrift. These measures are divided into two parts: governmental and public. In addition to the measures announced today, the rest, such as the reduction of personnel and goods in government agencies and the ban on dancing, are implemented by order. Gan emphasized his hope to cooperate and advocate with the press to reform social customs and complete the mission of saving on consumption. It is also learned that some of the measures for saving on consumption in government agencies are based on a percentage reduction of existing consumption. After these measures are formulated, each agency must report to the Executive Yuan by the 10th of this month, and then the review and decision will be made. Secondly, regarding the issue of staff reductions in government agencies, it is scheduled to be reported to the Executive Yuan before the 30th of this month, and the decision will be made after review.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Executive Yuan held its eighth temporary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 5th, chaired by President Zhang. More than 20 committee members, including Bai Chongxi and Zhu Jiahua, attended. Deputy Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on foreign affairs.

[Further Dispatch] The bandit forces entrenched in Liu'an and Huoshan are the remnants of Liu Bocheng's 36th and 2nd Columns, who fled eastward after being defeated in southern Henan. Along their path, they looted sewing machines, winter clothing materials, and other supplies, and forcibly conscripted seamstresses to accompany them, seemingly intending to use Dabie Mountain as a temporary refuge.

[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, This Newspaper, 5th] The 17th and 2nd Columns of the Communist bandits entrenched in Yiyuandian and Xuanhuadian, northeast of Lishan, have been under relentless encirclement and annihilation by our powerful forces for days. The fighting has been fierce, and the Communist bandits have suffered heavy casualties. Their independent columns fiercely attacked Lishan.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, This Newspaper, 5th] Chairman Su of the Provincial Government, Wang Gong, recently ordered all commissioners and county magistrates: The Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces have infiltrated the Dabie Mountain area. All counties bordering Anhui, regardless of whether they are north or south of the Yangtze River, must be strictly vigilant and strengthen local self-defense forces and fortifications. Any organizational elements that could serve as internal collaborators for the bandits should be eliminated in coordination with the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th] Lihuang has always been in the hands of the National Army. Currently, only small groups of Communist bandits with unidentified numbers have been discovered in the Mapu area. Their 7th Column engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army at Hekouzhen, south of Lishan, on the morning of the 4th, during which two of their regiments were routed and fled towards Waiwushan.

Liu explained to reporters the movements of the Communist bandits south of the Dahe River in Henan, stating: After Liu Bocheng's bandit forces' northward escape route across the Yellow River from western Shandong was cut off, they were forced to flee south. However, they constantly dreamed of crossing the Pinghan Railway, attempting to cross the Yellow River from western Henan and return to their Taihang Mountain bandit lair. However, due to the National Army's relentless pursuit and blocking everywhere, their troop losses were heavy, and they had no choice but to flee into Dabie Mountain. However, in order to survive, they must seek possible routes to return to the Taihang Mountains. Most of these bandit forces have now entered Hubei Province, and the remaining bandits in Henan Province can be eliminated.

### Air Force Squadrons Bomb and Strafe Communist Bandit Fortifications in Yantai, Longkou, and Other Places Destroyed; National Army to Converge in Zhucheng

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 5th] Air Force squadrons took turns bombing and strafing Yantai, Longkou, Weihaiwei, and other places on the 4th, completely destroying the Communist bandit fortifications along the coast. The remnants of the 2nd and 7th Columns of bandits outside Zhucheng and Rizhao have been under intense encirclement and suppression by the National Army for days, suffering heavy casualties.

### Youth Party National Congress Discusses Formal Proposals

[Report from This Newspaper] The Youth Party National Congress held its sixth session yesterday morning, chaired by Zuo Shunsheng, and continued to discuss political proposals. Afterwards, an announcement was issued, stating in essence: All representatives deeply feel that the prospects for realizing "political democratization and nationalization of the military" in the past Three-Party Common Governance Program are remote. Therefore, it is recommended to authorize the Central Executive Committee to designate two to five people as representatives to study the common governance policies, negotiate with the government, and promptly open up local governments and public opinion institutions, and determine effective measures to stop the "oppression and discrimination" against the Youth Party by party, government, and military organs in various places. If these requirements do not yield satisfactory results, it is planned to withdraw all personnel from the Youth Party who participate in the Fu Yuan and other institutions at an appropriate time. In the afternoon, the seventh session was held, chaired by Xia Taosheng, to discuss economic and financial proposals. It was generally believed that it is difficult to implement a free economy under the current circumstances, and that a controlled economy is prone to corruption. Therefore, it was generally advocated that the government should adopt a planned economy policy. As for the division of state-owned and private enterprises, efforts should be made to encourage private enterprises, except for certain important enterprises that must be operated by the state, to avoid competing with the people for profits. The Congress is scheduled to discuss party affairs today. If the discussion can be completed today, it will close after electing the Central Executive Committee. Furthermore, the list of candidates for general election in the Youth Party will be determined by the future Central Standing Committee, and will not be discussed at the Congress.

### Today's Siam (Continued from yesterday)

– By Our Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang

Reflecting each other with new, modern buildings are the Royal Palace and many old temples. The exterior of the Royal Palace and most of the temples are all silver and gold, dazzling in the reflection of the sun. When the reporter visited the Royal Palace, he saw many completely Chinese-style furniture and decorations. The form of the throne is like a sailing ship setting sail, perhaps indicating the first generation of Siamese. The Laotian-style White Marble National Assembly Building is an interesting contrast to the Royal Palace. This marble National Assembly Building is another architectural marvel in Bangkok, especially to show the progress and democratic spirit of Siam.

Siam's superficial modernity may be a characteristic of the Siamese government. The Siamese government, like the capital Bangkok, has all the external symbols to indicate a progressive spirit. In reality, however, despite the new constitution, the Siamese government is not enough to represent the Siamese people. The National Assembly really can only represent a small number of the Siamese bourgeoisie. As for the farmers, workers and merchants, the common people, their voice in the government is extremely rare.

During the reporter's short stay in Bangkok, he saw reports in the newspapers about corruption in government agencies. There were corrupt acts in the allocation of cloth and other administrative aspects. The reporter also learned from fellow overseas Chinese in Phuket and American expatriates that Siamese government officials were taking bribes for public purposes, and many high-ranking officials had become wealthy. Low-ranking personnel in government agencies openly accepted "tea money" and "tips" from the public.

The current cabinet under the leadership of "Thamrong," which is corrupt and incompetent, cannot solve various problems and may be reorganized. According to reports from Bangkok, Prince Nai Biri, a Siamese elder who once visited our country as a goodwill envoy, may come forward to form a cabinet. The reporter visited Nai Biri and had a brief conversation. When the reporter asked about his political policy, he replied that he had not yet decided whether he would return to political life. However, Nai Biri is indeed a capable person in Siamese politics. The current cabinet led by "Thamrong" only executes the orders of the people behind the scenes.

At the same time, there were rumors that Phibun, who was the Prime Minister during the Japanese occupation, may rise again and return to the political stage. Phibun currently lives in the suburbs of Bangkok. Although he was once a Japanese puppet, he still holds great political power in the government. The anti-Chinese movement in Siam was planned by Phibun. Once he returns to power, the overseas Chinese in Siam will suffer again. Most well-informed political observers say that Phibun will not return to office for the time being. However, he will one day return to be the dictator of Siam in the near future. At that time, our country's economic interests and the overseas Chinese in Siam will be in an unsustainable situation. (The End)

Editorial

### The Call of China's Industrial and Commercial Circles

Yesterday, following the presidents of various universities, prominent figures from Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles jointly telegraphed the American authorities, explaining that China's current distressing situation is part of the global malaise following the war. The Chinese people and government, in addition to continuing their own efforts to seek reform and progress, deeply believe and hope that the United States will, based on its sympathy and friendship, assist China. Those who signed this telegram are all representatives of Shanghai and even national industrial, commercial, and financial organizations. Therefore, this brief telegram is nothing less than the call of free individuals in China's industrial and commercial circles.

The call of the representatives of industrial and commercial circles is as important as the call of the presidents of Shanghai's universities the other day because it can at least represent three points:

(1) These figures who can represent China's legitimate industry and commerce, like the educators, are not, as stated in General Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China, "filled with a decadent defeatism," nor do they adopt "an attitude of indifference." On the contrary, they eagerly wished to await the visiting opinions of the investigation team, but regrettably did not get the opportunity, so that Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China did not even mention the name of the major city of "Shanghai."

(2) This group of free individuals in industry and commerce "do not want to gloss over the extremely distressing situation in China today" and are extremely willing to work hard to seek reform and progress. However, they still have strong confidence in Chairman Chiang's outstanding leadership and deeply resent the destruction and rebellion caused by the communist bandits after the war. As China is about to enter an era of democratic politics, the attitude of these free individuals in industry and commerce and their professional organizations is indeed worthy of attention.

(3) Although they did not, like the university presidents, believe that the eight years of the War of Resistance and the two years of being trapped in war after the war were the reasons for the deteriorating situation, they did clearly point out "the widespread imbalance of the world after the war" and that "the China problem should be regarded as part of the widespread global malaise," which should not be dismissed as the empty talk of "Chinese people are accustomed to blaming others" as said by some American newspapers.

Since World War II, people have long believed that war and peace are inseparable. When Japan invaded China in 1937, although President Roosevelt delivered his astonishing speech on quarantine in Chicago, the flames of war in Asia and Europe eventually burned the heads of Americans! Regarding the situation in China today, we Chinese people should naturally bear a major responsibility, but it is feared that no one can deny that this is a partial manifestation of the widespread global malaise. The so-called widespread global malaise, in essence, is that the people of all long-war-weary countries generally live in hardship, and everywhere they encounter ideological conflicts between the totalitarian communist system and the liberal democratic system--this conflict may unfortunately be the source of the Third World War. China is particularly unfortunate to be at the forefront of this conflict! Therefore, the situation in China must not be regarded as a purely Chinese problem.

However, the Chinese people--especially the free individuals in society--on the one hand, should remind the United States and other friendly countries to correct their attitude of watching the fire from across the river, or the perspective of scratching an itch from outside the boot; but on the other hand, they should redouble their self-reflection, accelerate unity, and intensify their efforts to fully exert their strength and urge the government to implement reforms to eliminate corruption and strengthen administrative efficiency. China's emerging industrialists and merchants are still in their infancy, and their role as the backbone of democratic constitutionalism should be no different from the historical evolution of Western democratic countries. Now that they have made their call, they should not underestimate themselves and make further efforts.

We believe that the United States will not abandon China. We further believe that the United States will be able to lend a helping hand to China when China's liberal educators or industrialists and merchants rise up to promote political and economic reforms, so as to restore China's peace, stability, and prosperity.

### Truman Declares to the Brazilian Congress: The United States Is Determined to Support the United Nations; Friendship Between the United States and Brazil Becomes Closer

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 6th Dispatch: President Truman addressed a joint session of the Brazilian Congress today, expressing confidence in the United Nations, stating: "The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance has set an example for international cooperation among free people. At present, nations are still far from peace, and the difficulty of the task is far greater than we expected. Nations must intensify cooperation and strive for common goals, namely morality and justice. Turmoil has begun throughout the world. Although our country has also made great sacrifices in the war, it has been spared from enormous destruction. Brazil and the United States must live up to expectations and fight for the freedom of millions of people. The American people place great hope in the Inter-American Conference that is about to conclude. The agreements established this time will benefit the entire world. The capital of Brazil will become a famous city in history, promoting understanding among nations and establishing law and order. Some parties have expressed disappointment with the achievements of the United Nations, but we must not give up our efforts, because the United Nations is what we need most. We must keep in mind that the task of the United Nations is not to solve problems directly caused by war, but to maintain international peace after a fair resolution is obtained. After the Charter was signed, the United Nations did not fully grow up. We should reach our goals with patience. The United Nations is by no means a temporary organization, but a hub for safeguarding the welfare and peace of the world's people. The difficulties encountered in the early stages should not discourage us. On the contrary, the United States is determined to support the United Nations with all its resources. The United States and Brazil have much in common, and both countries have confidence in basic human rights. The two countries think alike, and friendship is growing day by day."

[Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 4th] A spokesman for the White House entourage said: He has not heard that President Truman intends to fly directly from Rio back to Washington. The President's latest plan is that his special plane will be waiting in Trinidad. It is estimated that the President will travel from the capital of Brazil to Trinidad on the battleship "Missouri," and then transfer to a plane to return to the United States. The "Missouri" will travel at a speed of thirty miles per hour.

### Secretary Marshall and Senator Vandenberg Praise the Achievements of the Pan-American Conference; Canada Does Not Participate in the Declaration of Peace

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Secretary of State Marshall returned to the country today from the capital of Brazil and delivered a broadcast, saying, "The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance is sufficient to prove that if countries sincerely promote world peace and human happiness, they can achieve their wishes." Marshall also mentioned the protracted and difficult situation of negotiations with the Soviet Union, saying, "Our two years of efforts to create peace in Europe can also be completed without obstruction, delay, or disruptive propaganda." Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, broadcast that "The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance is a ray of sunshine in a dark world. What we are doing is not against anyone. If anyone suspects that we have other purposes, they are simply revealing their own thoughts. This nineteen-nation treaty does not prejudice any country's responsibilities to the United Nations. Our actions do not contain any thoughts of conquest or imperialism, but are only efforts for international truth and security." He concluded by saying that he will submit this treaty to the Senate for its approval.

[Reuters, Ottawa, 4th] The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs announced: Canada has rejected Argentina's proposal and does not want to join other American countries and the Holy See in issuing a declaration of peace principles. Canadian Foreign Minister Laurent responded to the Argentine government's note, stating that Canada fully agrees with the goals of this proposal. However, it feels that resolving world difficulties should be done through the United Nations organization.

### US Congressional Inspection Team Arrives in Berlin from England

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 4th] The US Congressional inspection team arrived in Berlin today to study the actual needs of various countries and their people. This study is part of the Marshall Plan, and the results obtained will be submitted to the relevant congressional committees, which will then propose legislation. The inspection team's final report is expected to be completed before March 1, 1948. Its scope includes Europe and Asia, but only three members of the inspection team will go to the Far East, and their stay will be much shorter than in Europe. It can be said that from the perspective of the Marshall Plan, Asia's position will be secondary to Europe.

### Wedemeyer Arrives in Lima

[United Press, Honolulu, 5th] Wedemeyer and other members of the delegation arrived in Lima and will stay at the Kirillo Military Rest Camp for a week, preparing to submit a report on China and Korea to Truman. After returning to Washington, the report will be submitted directly to Marshall.

### Sixteen European Countries Plan to Purchase Ships from the United States

Plan to Purchase 3 Million Tons in Four Years

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] A spokesman for the Maritime Transport Technical Committee of the Sixteen-Nation European Economic Cooperation Conference said: The participating countries plan to purchase 3 million tons of ships from the United States between now and 1951, worth approximately $300 million. European countries have specifically submitted a report to Washington, explaining the common needs and common plans for purchasing ships, and explaining the individual needs and plans of each country. The aforementioned figures are provisional quantities, but it is expected that there will not be much change. The spokesman also said: In addition to the ship purchase plan, European countries also plan a large-scale shipbuilding plan, with a total dry cargo ship tonnage of 39.2 million tons and a total oil tanker tonnage of 14.4 million tons expected by the end of 1951.

### US Congressman Condemns Hoover

[United Press, Washington, 4th] US Congressman Sabath recently published an article in the newspaper, criticizing former President Hoover for following the propaganda lines of Japan and the Nazis, and said that Hoover should remember that Roosevelt and Hull did their best to repel Japan.

### US Secretary of the Navy Sternly Condemns the Abuse of the Veto Power

[United Press, Cleveland, 5th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars today, criticizing cruel totalitarian leaders. It is said that the development of the United Nations organization has been hindered by the abuse of the veto power. The rule of totalitarian governments always disregards public opinion and only represents a few cold-blooded ambitious people at home and abroad. Having already controlled several countries, they now intend to apply their iron fists to other countries.

### Truman May Return to the Country Early to Approve New Measures to Aid Europe; Congress May Convene a Special Session to Pass Them

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] Sources here say: President Truman may return to Washington from Latin America early to approve the emergency aid plan for Europe that is currently under study. This plan may be passed by a special session of Congress convened in November.

Secretary of State Marshall has now begun to intensify consultations with his senior experts in the hope that he can establish a definitive system within two weeks before he attends the next United Nations General Assembly. This system is based on the view of the United States that the situation in Europe is deteriorating and will be out of control by the end of the year. Sources expect that the presumed timetable for the United States to pass a temporary emergency aid plan for Europe is approximately as follows: (1) The Foreign Affairs Committees of both the House and Senate will soon begin listening to opinions on this matter, so that key members of Congress can become familiar with the situation of the European crisis; (2) The two houses will convene a special plenary session in early November to approve 3 billion yuan for temporary emergency aid to Europe before the Marshall Plan is implemented; (3) After the temporary aid plan begins to be implemented, the legislative procedures for completing the Marshall Aid Europe Plan will be carried out immediately, so that the European recovery plan can be launched immediately after passing through the dangerous winter period. It is rumored that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have now agreed that in order to prevent the complete collapse of the European economy, the United States will need to provide no less than 10 billion yuan in assistance. The success of the temporary emergency aid plan for Europe, which was first revealed by Under Secretary of State Lovett on the 3rd, depends on the attitude of Congress, and the attitude of Congress largely depends on the results of the consultations between Secretary of State Marshall and Senator Vandenberg and key figures in Congress in the next few days.

### British Official Denies Requesting New Loans from the United States

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] A spokesman for the British Embassy denied the claim by a Washington reporter for "The New York Wall Street Journal" that Sir Iliff, a representative of the British Treasury, requested a new $1 billion loan to Britain from the United States during recent financial negotiations in the United States.

### Soviet Ambassador to Greece Dismissed

### Uranium Mine Discovered in Northern Canada

### The People's Freedom Party Reaches an Understanding; The Greek Cabinet Broadens Its Base; US Envoy Achieves Success After a Day of Negotiations

[Reuters, Athens, 5th] US envoy Henderson, Director of the Near East Division of the State Department, conducted a day of negotiations to enable Tsaldaris, leader of the Greek People's Party, and Sophoulis, leader of the Freedom Party, to reach an understanding, so as to expand the foundation of the Greek government, and has almost achieved success.

When the parliament resumed its summer recess today, Tsaldaris, on behalf of his People's Party cabinet, issued a brief policy statement, but the debate on the statement has been rescheduled, presumably because Tsaldaris believes that Henderson's negotiations will be successful. Henderson's purpose is to establish an expanded cabinet based on the People's Party and the Freedom Party. Henderson's negotiations are still continuing today, but it is not yet possible to verify the rumor that a new coalition government led by Sophoulis can be established before the next meeting of parliament.

[United Press, Manila, 4th] According to well-informed sources in Batavia, the Dutch army has decided to launch another offensive against Yogyakarta. The motive is that the Dutch side is now in an unsustainable position. On the one hand, it is determined to recover the colony so that the rich products of the East Indies can be exported to the world's urgently needed markets. On the other hand, since the Security Council ordered a ceasefire, although the Dutch army has retained the richest agricultural areas of Java and Sumatra, the continuous infiltration of Indonesian armed guerrillas has made it impossible for the Dutch to return to the farms to develop them. The Dutch can no longer wait patiently, so it is necessary to resolve the issue by military means.

### Provincial and Municipal Boundary Demarcation: Ordered to be Resolved; Qibao's Eastern Area and Dachang Entirely Under Shanghai Municipality; Subsidies Still Executed According to the 17th Year Agreement

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the boundary demarcation issue between Shanghai Municipality and Jiangsu Province, the Ministry of Interior successively dispatched personnel to conduct on-site surveys and convened boundary demarcation meetings with representatives from both the province and the municipality. After several discussions, the demarcation situation became quite clear. Based on factual needs and legal provisions, a draft demarcation line and subsidy method were formulated. Yesterday, the municipal government received an executive order for notification. The methods are as follows:

(A) Demarcation: (1) Southern Shanghai: Shanghai County retains jurisdiction over all eight districts including Beiqiao, Zhuanqiao, Maqiao, Minhang, Chenxing, Caoxing, Sanlin, and Tangwan, as well as the eastern part of Xinzhuang District and the western part of Zhoupu District. The provincial and municipal boundary line follows the original district boundaries. The eastern part of Xinzhuang District, originally under the jurisdiction of Songjiang County, is re-designated due to its proximity to Beiqiao Town, the seat of Shanghai County, making it easier to govern. The western part of Zhoupu District, originally under the jurisdiction of Nanhui County, is re-designated because it is embedded between the Sanlin and Chenxing Districts of Shanghai County, making administration extremely inconvenient. Furthermore, Shanghai County has a smaller area and population than Songjiang and Nanhui, so the re-designation is also necessary to balance the resources. The eastern part of Qibao District is designated under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality. (2) Northern Shanghai: The entire Dachang area is designated under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality. The entire Yanghang area remains under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County. The provincial and municipal boundary line follows the original district boundaries. (3) Western Shanghai: The center line of the Panlonggang, Xiaolaigang, and Zhugang rivers serves as the provincial and municipal boundary line. The natural terrain forms a straight line, with the east belonging to Shanghai Municipality and the west belonging to Jiangsu Province. Zhuzhai Town is under the jurisdiction of Jiading County.

(B) Subsidies: Should be executed according to the agreement reached by the Ministry and the province and municipality in the 17th year of the Republic of China, continuing from January of this year. The markup percentage shall be negotiated between the province and municipality. Subsequently, adjustments shall be made based on price fluctuations, and payments shall be allocated monthly. A boundary map shall also be drawn.

Furthermore, our authorities only allow it to carry over a thousand Soviet nationals returning to their country in the second batch and goods transported to the Soviet Union by our Resources Committee according to the contract.

### Self-Reliance in the Cultural and Educational Circles; Cooperative Opens Today; Pan Gongzhan Discusses the Significance of Its Establishment

The Shanghai Cultural Credit Cooperative is scheduled to open today. Yesterday, reporters specially interviewed Mr. Pan Gongzhan, chairman of the cooperative's board of directors, and Mr. Jiang Jianbai, concurrently general manager, who explained the significance of the cooperative's establishment and its future plans in detail. According to Mr. Pan, the establishment of the Shanghai Cultural Credit Cooperative has the following significance: 1. The cooperative system is the first step towards a democratic economy; the education and culture circles are in a leading position in society. If they can promote the cooperative system themselves, it can be expanded to the entire society, building the foundation of a democratic economy. The establishment of the Cultural Credit Cooperative is to lead society in promoting the economic cooperation movement. 2. Education and culture are originally social undertakings. It is most ideal to support socialized education and culture undertakings with a socialized economic cooperation system. The establishment of the Cultural Credit Cooperative is to seek self-reliance for the education and culture circles. 3. Educational and cultural undertakings rarely receive economic assistance. For example, government funding is limited to industry and commerce, and bank overdrafts are not preferential. In order to expand business facilities or improve the lives of practitioners, the education and culture circles have no choice but to resort to high-interest loans, which is a major crisis for the education and culture circles. The establishment of the Cultural Credit Cooperative is to resolve this crisis.

Business Plan

According to Jiang Jianbai, the first businesses to be launched include the following: 1. Deposits: Schools that are group members of the cooperative can deposit their school establishment funds and tuition fees into the cooperative in accordance with cooperative principles. In addition, members who operate cultural businesses or cultural organizations that have joined the cooperative can also deposit their funds or income and surplus funds into the cooperative, and they will be given preferential treatment. 2. Loans: A. Publishing loans: Cultural workers who have joined the cooperative and are unable to publish their works can apply for publishing loans. B. Production loans: Members who have cultural products, such as films from the film industry and books from the publishing industry, can apply for publishing loans if they have insufficient funds. C. Teacher assistance loans: Members who are teachers can apply for loans when they have legitimate needs. D. Student assistance loans: Children of members who are studying can apply for student assistance loans. E. Production loans: Cultural members who are running production businesses can apply for production loans when they need funds. 3. Agency collection and payment: Cultural members who establish companies and firms can entrust the cooperative to collect share funds, and schools can also entrust the cooperative to collect tuition fees. The cooperative can also be entrusted to pay funds. 4. Investment: The cooperative may participate in the investment of group members who establish cultural undertakings, depending on the circumstances. 5. The cooperative will do its best to assist members of the education and culture circles who need financing or guidance for their welfare and the development of their businesses.

They learned that it was an order from the Criminal Division of the General Bureau and took the three monks including Xuefan to the police station. Later, it was found that the informants were Liudu and Xinling, perhaps because Xuefan and Xuelei were only one word different, intentionally containing retaliatory behavior. They were also detained and will be investigated and prosecuted.

### Bai Lu's Words Became a Prophecy: Hope Vanished Like a Bubble·Eternal Farewell to the World: Family Decides to Sue the Court, Seeking to Ascertain Responsibility for the Accident

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the tragic death of Bai Lu in a staircase fall, the public prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Fang Zheng, personally inspected the International Hotel yesterday morning. In the afternoon at 3 p.m., Bai Lu's family and members of the film and theater industry met with the press at the Jin Gu Hotel to explain several points: (1) The deceased's family has decided to file a lawsuit with the court this time, with the aim of determining right and wrong and responsibility for the accident. (2) The deceased was in extremely normal health before the accident, and rumors that the main cause of her fall was mental confusion are completely untrue. (3) In the future, any compensation obtained after the civil lawsuit will be used entirely for the benefit fund of actors in this city. Subsequently, Feng Zi reported on Bai Lu's character, stating that he would, as a longtime classmate, appeal to society for justice for the deceased. Following this, Xia Yunhu, director of Kunlun Film Company, and others recounted the incident, saying that Bai Lu left the International Hotel in the early morning to fetch something from Wang Renmei's house, and Ding Ting accompanied her on her return to the International Hotel. At the time of the accident, the outer iron door of the elevator was indeed not closed. Bai Lu, in her haste to return, did not check and stepped in, resulting in the tragic accident. The elevator operator heard a scream between the second and third floors at the time, proving that the iron door was not opened by Bai Lu herself, but rather due to a malfunctioning button. Subsequently, they conducted multiple on-site tests at the International Hotel, and on the day of Bai Lu's encoffining, the International Hotel hung a "Repair" sign next to the elevator. Whether judged by common sense or reasoning, the International Hotel authorities are undeniably responsible for negligence in their duties.

Furthermore, according to Kunlun Company, another task of Bai Lu's trip to Shanghai was to film a new movie called "Hope in the World" at the invitation of the company. Unexpectedly, the title became a self-fulfilling prophecy, hope vanished like a bubble, and she bid farewell to the world forever.

### Terrible Lung Disease: Report from a Chinese Clinic Shows Sharp Increase in Outpatients

The Lung Disease Center Clinic, run by the Anti-Tuberculosis Joint Committee, has seen a sharp increase in outpatients in the past three months. The total number of outpatients in March, April, and May was 3,876, with 1,845 new patients, among whom 419 were suffering from active pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, the clinic, commissioned by the Shen Bao newspaper and other organizations, conducted health checkups, with 290 people examined in three months. Twenty-seven of them had tuberculosis, and these people had no self-awareness of the disease, accounting for more than 9 percent, which shows the prevalence of lung disease. Therefore, regular X-ray examinations are the only effective way to combat tuberculosis, in order to achieve the goal of "treating tuberculosis if present, and preventing tuberculosis if absent." The clinic's newly arrived large-scale group health checkup X-ray machine for the Health Checkup Department is being installed rapidly and will be ready for group health checkups soon.

### Not Many Volunteers Registered: Planning to Increase Family Allowance: Headquarters of the Military Service District Invites Chiefs of All Districts to a Meeting

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Tianqiao, commander of the Shanghai Military Service District, invited chiefs of all districts to the headquarters yesterday morning to discuss the issue of volunteer recruitment. Yao, chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Bureau, was invited to attend. Fu Zhengmo, commander of the division service district, addressed the meeting. The district chiefs reported on the current situation of volunteer registration in their respective districts, with about three points: (1) Volunteer registration is not enthusiastic. (2) Those who are willing to register as volunteers mostly have no guarantors. (3) The general consensus is that the family allowance of 4 million yuan is too small. Chief Yao then reported two points: (1) Registered volunteers can be sent to the new recruit conscription center first, and the meals will be arranged by the municipal government in consultation with the Military Service Association. (2) The municipal government has ordered all districts to organize committees to comfort drafted soldiers and raise additional family allowances to remedy the situation. After discussion, the following was decided: (1) Each district will convene meetings of baojia heads to strengthen military service work and discuss ways to raise additional family allowances, and actively carry out the work. (2) If the number of volunteers falls short of the quota by the deadline, it will be decided to conscript by lottery in accordance with the law, after consultation with Mayor Wu. During this period, the Military Service Association will be requested to expedite the work of exemption and deferment review, so that it will be convenient to conduct lottery conscription if necessary.

Furthermore, yesterday's newspaper reported that the registration of volunteers in this city had begun yesterday, which Chief Yao of the Military Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Bureau stated was inaccurate. It is said that the draft of the document proposing to start conscription on the 15th has been submitted to the mayor for approval, and it is currently impossible to determine whether conscription will begin as scheduled. Yao pointed out that the fact that the family allowance for volunteers has not yet begun to be collected is the reason for the delayed deadline for conscription. It is also reported that the registration of volunteers has been changed to be handled uniformly by the Civil Affairs Bureau, which is also not true.

### Director Fang of the Party Headquarters Gave Instructions to Soldiers Going to War

Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters gave instructions to the soldiers going to war in Jiangwan yesterday morning, saying: "The ancients said, 'War is dangerous,' which shows that the use of force is a last resort. We have just driven out the Japanese after eight years of arduous struggle, and the communists are taking the opportunity to make trouble, obstructing the work of recovery and reconstruction, undermining the unity and peace of the country, and preventing the people from living and working in peace. Just look at the places where the communists have gone, killing, arson, rape, and plunder are rampant, causing the people to cry out in misery. As long as the communists are not eliminated, the country will not be able to recover and rebuild, and the people will not be able to live and work in peace. In order to save the country, the nation, and our compatriots, we must thoroughly eliminate the communists. Therefore, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the country has no choice but to endure the pain and use force again to eliminate the source of chaos and complete reconstruction." After his instructions, Director Fang inspected the barracks and inquired about everything.

### Fourth Court in the Yu Case: Widow Brings Orphans to Court·Tearfully Requests Return of Gold Bars

[Report from Our Newspaper] The U.S. Military Tribunal opened court at 9 a.m. yesterday to continue questioning witnesses in the murder case of Yu Shengxiao. First to testify were Wu Genhui, owner of the Fada Tailor Shop, and Ke Shanqing, a clerk at the shop. They testified that at 3 p.m. on the day of the incident, Yu Shengxiao brought five gold bars to the shop, saying that Que Li wanted to buy them from him, and a friend immediately warned him to be very careful. After Que Li arrived, Yu Shengxiao left with him. Wu Genhui also described Que Li as an obese man with a mustache and fierce eyes. Next to testify was Lu, wife of Yu Shengxiao. Lu entered the court with her young children, saying that the day before the incident, her husband came home and said that Que Li would pay the gold price in U.S. dollars, and he brought back five gold bars that night, which he weighed. The next morning at 9 a.m., he went out and never returned. She also said that on the evening of July 31, her husband told her that the other party in this transaction was a high-ranking military officer, and mentioned the name Zhu Ti Que Li. Lu, in tears, also said that after her husband's death, the whole family had nothing to live on, and she requested the court to help her maintain her family's life and retrieve the gold bars. At this time, Colonel Palermo replied that this matter was outside the scope of the military tribunal, and it had no power to allow it, nor did it have the right to make this suggestion, and hoped that the victim could make a request to the competent authority.

Three Orphans Have No Savings

Lu appeared in court with tears streaming down her face, looking very sad, saying that there were three orphans and the deceased had no savings, and their future life was worrying. The court then summoned a staff member surnamed Sun from the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road, who said that when Yu Shengxiao was sent to the hospital on August 1, he had suffered three injuries and had died. He then briefly explained his injuries. Then, the court invited forensic doctor Wang Shizhi, the judge, the prosecutor, and the defendant's defense attorney to study the photos taken during the autopsy. Forensic doctor Wang repeatedly said that he was too busy at the time, so he no longer remembered the injured parts of the deceased. If the court needs formal autopsy photos, they can be retrieved from the archives. The court then summoned U.S. Navy sailor Qu Lunbei. Qu had witnessed Malay in the New Lishu Bar on the evening of August 1. He claimed that he did see Malay and a friend of his together in the bar that day, and heard Malay asking how much U.S. dollars a gold bar could be exchanged for.

Finally, a U.S. Army Medical Officer was Summoned

Finally, U.S. Army Medical Officer Major Xu was summoned. Xu, a Chinese American, was fluent in English. He gave a detailed report in court on the autopsy process, saying that all this was recorded in his notebook and a formal report had been sent to U.S. Headquarters. At this time, the defendant's defense attorney stood up to question, saying that after a person had died for fourteen days, an external autopsy was performed without dissection, and whether the conclusion was reliable. Major Xu replied that after the chest of a person had been shot twice, the chance of survival was very small. There was no doubt that Yu Shengxiao's death was due to gunshot wounds. What was now worth studying was the direction of the bullet holes on the corpse. In his opinion, the bullets entered from the front and exited from the back. At this point, the judges raised questions one after another, speculating on the cause of Yu Shengxiao's death in various ways, but no new discoveries were made other than the gunshot wounds. At 4:40 p.m., the presiding judge announced the adjournment and scheduled to reopen at 9 a.m. this morning.

### The Wind and Rain of Yancheng

[Report from Our Newspaper, Dongtai, 2nd] Since the recovery of northern Jiangsu a year ago, it has been shrouded in gloom. On this fertile plain, the communists have never relaxed their grip on running rampant, creating struggles, and slaughtering in order to expand their rebellion and raise capital. People under the shadow seem to have a premonition - a storm is unavoidable in northern Jiangsu!

On August 1st, the communist army held a "high-level cadre meeting" in Xiaohai (one of the central Jiangsu base areas, 60 li from Dongtai). The attendees included Guan Wenwei, commander of the central Jiangsu military region, and the heads of nine counties: puppet Xinghua, Huangning, Jianyang, Sheyang, Hebei, Dongtai, Zishi, Tong, and Yandong. The meeting opened in the afternoon and closed at 5 p.m. In the three hours, the resolution to "attack Yancheng" was decided.

The communist forces involved in this battle included the 11th and 12th columns, about fourteen regiments, plus two attached mountain artillery companies, carrying eight mountain guns, plus other local bandits, totaling more than 30,000 people. Guan Wenwei was appointed commander, Cao Diqiu (commander of the 11th communist column) was appointed deputy commander, and Xu Jincheng, head of the "special task force of the central Jiangsu military region," was appointed chairman of rear-area operations. Each puppet county government was ordered to collect 5,000 stretcher bearers by August 5th, and Yinshuigou (50-odd li from Yancheng) was designated as the rear-area concentration point.

On the night of August 5th, the prelude to the war began. The communists launched an offensive toward

Yancheng's outlying strongholds: Nanyang'an, Shanggang, Wuyou, Gangmen, and Xinxingchang. The troops stationed in Yancheng at that time were the ××× division of the ××× army group. Due to the importance of the city's defenses, reinforcements were impossible. The local self-defense forces fought bravely but were overwhelmed, and by the afternoon of the 6th, the outlying strongholds had fallen one after another.

The flames of war were approaching Yancheng step by step. Yancheng was in a precarious situation, surrounded on all sides, and extremely tense. All sectors of the city formed a strong command structure, launching efforts to rush repairs on

street-fighting fortifications and preparing for consolation and relief.

The passion and desire for survival inspired the sense of justice and responsibility of everyone. The whole city comforted every soldier preparing for battle and every worker with their limited food, cigarettes, and daily necessities. The Jiangsu Provincial Bank, the China Farmers Bank, and the Yancheng office of the National Treasury temporarily allocated 150 million yuan for military labor.

This misfortune finally befell Yancheng. Late on the 10th, a few cannon sounds came from the four suburbs, seemingly telling people that the communist army had begun its "siege."

At that time, the city's defense was as follows: the west gate was defended by the people's self-defense force and four platoons of the reorganized ××× division, and the other three gates were defended by troops under the ××× army group, and their morale was very high.

On the 11th, the communist army used earth to attack fiercely all day, launching fourteen assaults, but failed to succeed. However, the isolated city was trapped and all external aid was cut off. At dawn on the 13th, the defending troops were exhausted, and the communist army took the opportunity to break in from the

south gate, carrying out a large-scale massacre. Public servants of various agencies and some of the people retreated with the troops to the fortifications of the provincial Yancheng Middle School in the north city, making a final resistance in an attempt to save the situation. However, when the nest is overturned, can there be any intact eggs? The stronghold was broken by the communists at 12 o'clock, and many heads of agencies and key personnel committed suicide on the spot.

After the communists entered the city, they began looting, and all the city's materials were looted. More than a thousand public servants and innocent people were killed, and more than 10,000 people were captured and escorted to communist bases such as Dazhongji and Nanyang'an, suffering greatly. (Among the government personnel who have been confirmed to have been killed, the secretary-general of the party headquarters, Wang Qidun, was shot and killed, and Liu Jianqiu, director of the Youth League, drowned in the river).

The city spent nine days in the midst of red terror. On the 21st, it was recovered. This surprise action by the National Army prevented the communist army from fully realizing its planned work. (According to the communist army's estimate, the National Army's reinforcements would not arrive within two weeks.) According to people from the ruined city, if the National Army had arrived one or two days later, Yancheng, even if recovered, would have become a pile of rubble. (The communist army's plan was to retreat without resistance when the National Army arrived, but to set fire to vent its anger.)

At present, everything in Lin City is not yet on track, but the order is very stable. The small wheel between Dongtai and Yancheng resumed sailing on the 29th of last month. The highway between Dong and Yan,

with the cooperation of the military and civilians in rush repairs, can also be opened to traffic within ten days. However, Yancheng is already an empty city (the materials have been robbed by the communists). Only a few women, children, and the elderly remain (the young and strong have been captured by the communists). What they look forward to is the government's ability to provide them with large-scale relief.

A storm nightmare has passed, and the people of northern Jiangsu are preparing to welcome the lovely blue sky and white sun! (Reporter Ling Songsou)

### Loopholes in Words: Communist Bandits Secretly Set Up Communications Station: "Station Master" and Others Arrested, Remaining Gang Members Pursued

[Report from Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 4th] Last month, the port district office moved itself to Xishiqiao to carry out a crackdown. On the 29th, Zhang Qinda, from Santangqiao, Qianzhou Township, was found in the city buying cloth in a cloth shop with his sisters, but failed to obtain credit. Qin Da visited friends at the district office, and his words revealed loopholes. Tang Shaoyun, an attached member of the self-defense force, discovered that it was a communications station of the bandits, and immediately arrested Chen Yinkun, Zhang Ruimin, and Miao Qinda. Chen Yinkun admitted to being the station master. On the morning of the 2nd, the self-defense force raided Zhang Ruimin's home and found firearms and three hand grenades.

### Nantong Military Engineering Repairs Roads and Soil Conservation Association to Be Established Immediately

The association will be located in Shanghai, and the engineering office will be located in Sanxing Town, Changyinsha.

Commander Li previously ordered the military engineers to repair the roads because the city roads were badly damaged. Starting from August 1st, it took 28 days to repair more than 2,500 meters of road. The daily participation of military engineers reached 1,000 people. If calculated by wages and food, it would cost more than 700 million yuan, plus material freight and other expenses, it would reach more than 1.2 billion.

Yang Kaicun, a villager and old goods dealer from Xueyan Township in the First District, was suddenly strangled to death by thugs late one night. The case is under investigation.

All sectors of this county celebrated the second anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the grand meeting to support total mobilization to suppress the rebellion and build the country on the morning of the 3rd at the Guangchang of Nantong College.

### Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group: First Announcement Yesterday of Cases Accepted: Grain Trucks Carrying Smuggled Goods and Discrepancy in Grain Amount: Wang Dekuan and Tan Yanpei Suspected and Awaiting Trial

[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] The Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group announced the cases accepted for the first time today: The Jidong Grain Department's military grain convoy for the Ministry of Grain carried a large amount of printing materials, and it was also found that the amount of grain returned differed greatly from the original amount. The Ministry of Grain previously entrusted the Northeast Economic Commission to purchase 3.57 million catties of military grain on behalf of the province. Three months ago, Wang Dekuan, a member of the Jidong Provincial Government, and Tan Yanpei, director of the military grain collection warehouse of the Tianliang Department, went to escort the army. According to reports, due to the impact of the war, only 480,000 catties of the original grain remained. When the convoy arrived in Tianjin, the Military Transportation Department inspected and found that the grain trucks were carrying 25 boxes of ink, more than 10,000 kilograms of lead bars, and six bundles of water pipes, which were detained. Wang Dekuan claimed that the transported printing equipment was under the order of the Baoding Pacification Office, and the responsibility was delayed for more than three months. Recently, it was secretly reported, and the Supervision Group found that Wang Dekuan was the chairman of the "Great Wall Printing House," and initially determined that he and Tan had major suspicions. He has now sent a letter to the Jidong Provincial Government and Tianliang Department to send the two to the court for investigation, and at the same time, to investigate the responsibility for the discrepancy in the amount of grain.

[Another dispatch] A financial institution responsible for industrial and commercial loans has also been secretly reported for using loans for fraudulent activities, and the Supervision Group has found clues.

### "Land to the Tiller" - The Farmers Bank of China Holds Land Loan in Wuhu

Monthly Interest at Four Percent, Limited to 25 Mu

[Special Dispatch from Wuhu, This Newspaper, 2nd] The land policy of "Land to the Tiller" has been initiated on a trial basis by the Farmers Bank of China in the rice-producing area of Wuhu. In April of this year, the Land Finance Division of the Farmers Bank of China dispatched Director Lu Liangyue and Dai Hongqiang to Wuhu to pioneer this new undertaking throughout Anhui Province. Tenant farmers who paid rent to landlords every year regarded the Farmers Bank of China lending them money to buy the landlords' land as a joke. However, after Lu Liangyue and others went to the countryside and genuinely completed dozens of such loan cases for tenant farmers to buy land, the villagers expressed surprise at the spirit of the current government being able to do things for the most impoverished people.

In the past four months, in Wuhu's Dufeng Township and Ruinan Township, a total of 76 tenant farmer households, including Cao Zhiwang, Chen Dajiang, and Yuan Yunsheng, received land purchase loans from the Farmers Bank of China and acquired land. They borrowed 4 million yuan in some cases, and 2 million yuan in others. The amount of land they purchased was limited to the tenant farmer's cultivation capacity, currently capped at 25 mu per household. These land loans had a monthly interest rate of only four percent. Principal and interest are to be repaid in full within two and a half years, in five installments. All seventy-six families, who have become self-sufficient farmers, repaid most of their loans this harvest season because the proceeds from the sale of rice from each mu of land could offset half of the land purchase loan. (They mostly bought land at a price of 200,000 yuan per mu; at present, the rice harvested from each mu is worth over 100,000 yuan.)

The Farmers Bank of China plans to provide 1 billion yuan in land loans to tenant farmers to buy land within a year. Following the business of buying land for farmers, the Farmers Bank of China is also cooperating with the Agricultural Extension Institute to promote improved rice varieties, firstly on the farmland purchased by tenant farmers, in order to improve agricultural production and increase yields. Chen Renjie and Shu Xiao, the managers of the Wuhu branch of the Farmers Bank of China, hope to achieve some success in Wuhu before extending the program to other areas of Anhui.

This is a nascent step towards the land policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood. In 1942, the Farmers Bank of China first launched this policy on North Sichuan Road, and the results were excellent. All provinces are selecting areas to implement the policy through the Farmers Bank of China, with the aim of achieving the goals of "Land to the Tiller," "Making full use of land, and making full use of human power" held by the land finance business.

After the meeting began, representatives from each delegation continued to report on the Christian situation in their respective regions. Wang Zongjing, the representative from Malaya, reported in detail on the Christian education situation at all levels in the Federated Malay States, noting that education for both natives and overseas Chinese was quite developed. Dick Shee, the representative from Nepal, reported that the implementation of Christian education in his country was progressing smoothly. After Wynes, the representative from Australia, reported, Sayidin, the representative from India, raised questions about education for the indigenous population. Wynes replied that the indigenous population was a nomadic society, making education extremely difficult. Sayidin stated that he had recently traveled to Australia and had some understanding of the indigenous people's lives and education, expressing hope that the Australian government would pay more attention. After Batsoni, the representative from New Zealand, reported, Wu Yifang, the representative from China, raised questions about the percentage of students advancing to higher education and the allocation of education funds. Subsequently, Chairman Hang announced the revisions to the conference agenda and the General Affairs Committee's recommendations regarding the special group. The task of this special group is to discuss the "Outline of the Basic Education Experimental Zone Plan" drafted by the Preparatory Committee (see separate dispatch) and to formulate a work plan for a "China Demonstration Design Zone." This group consists of representatives from the Joint Education Organization, Chinese experts, and other representatives with special interest in the issue. It is scheduled to meet on the afternoon of the 9th, and its report will be submitted for discussion at the plenary session on the 11th. Both Hang and Professor Louis, the representative from the Joint Education Organization, emphasized the importance of this work. The results of the research will be submitted in the form of a memorandum to the Regional Research Conference of the Christian Education Conference to be held in Mexico City in November and to the Second Plenary Session of the Joint Education Organization. They hoped that all representatives would actively participate to gather wisdom and contribute insightful contributions to the global Christian education work. The attendees accepted this proposal and established the special group. Finally, they passed a reply telegram to Indian people's leader Gandhi to express thanks and adjourned the meeting at 12:30 PM.

Full Delegation Split into Groups for Visits

At 3 PM in the afternoon, all representatives gathered at the Academia Sinica on Beijige and departed in two groups for visits. Group A included Wynes (Australia), Yi Wan (India), Wang Zongjing (Malaya), Dick Shee and his son (Nepal), Batsoni (New Zealand), Sekuan (Thailand), Hubbard, and Aygillan (Joint Education Organization). They were accompanied by Yu Qingtang, Wu Yan, and Wang Chengxu to visit the Langya Road Central National School and the workers' and children's welfare work in Xiaguan. Group B included U Ba Luan, U Che (Burma), Fleming (Malaya), Dickson (Sarawak), Nelson, and Adkins (Singapore), Louis (Joint Education Organization).

When Group A first arrived at Langya Road Elementary School, a class of students was attending a lesson on "Younger Brother Riding a Bamboo Horse." All representatives observed the lesson and carefully studied the teacher's teaching methods. Upon leaving, everyone was murmuring, "Younger brother riding a bamboo horse." Later, at the Xiaguan New Life Movement General Association, the Women's Guidance Committee, and the Child Welfare Station, they first observed the children's performance of the "Little Teacher System" and solo and chorus performances. All representatives congratulated them greatly. They then listened to a report by Zhang Niangzhen, the executive director of the Guidance Committee.

'Education for all' is not only an inherent ideal of China but also a principle jointly upheld by countries around the world today. However, the equality and universality of educational opportunities must be realized under the leadership of a great statesman.

### The Municipal Government Plans to Convene Private School Representatives to Resolve the Issue of Overcharging Tuition. The Student Academic Protection Association Has Been Strictly Banned by the Municipal Government.

[This Newspaper Report] Mayor Wu stated to reporters yesterday morning at the Municipal Government regarding the issue of tuition standards for private schools: The tuition standards for private schools and the in-service training fees for municipal school teachers have been approved by the Education Subcommittee of the City Council on the 4th. There are two purposes: (1) To reduce the burden on parents so that students from poor families have the opportunity to study; (2) To increase teachers' salaries to stabilize their lives. Those who arbitrarily overcharge tuition like a provincial school shop will be severely banned. The government will protect schools that are well-managed and have transparent finances. The Municipal Government is continuing to solicit donations for poor student scholarships, and donations pledged from various parties have already reached 5.1 billion yuan. The review method is being discussed with various schools, and representatives from the Municipal Government, City Council, Education Bureau, and the Liaison Association of Teachers and Staff of Primary and Secondary Schools will be appointed to jointly form a review committee. Schools that overcharge tuition without the approval of the Education Bureau will be strictly banned. To date, no school has applied for approval. The Municipal Government has scheduled a meeting for the responsible parties of private primary and secondary schools on the afternoon of the 8th of this month (Monday) to discuss the matter of some schools issuing tuition notices and failing to comply with the standards before the tuition standards have been decided. The goal is to ensure that the overcharged tuition is immediately refunded by each school. Finally, Mayor Wu reiterated that the so-called "Student Academic Protection Committee" has recently been publishing announcements and selling student aid badges without the approval of government agencies. Such conduct, which abuses public power for private gain, is inappropriate and has been ordered by the Police Bureau to be strictly banned. The organizers are being investigated. He hopes that citizens will assist the government and report any violations.

### The Director of the Education Bureau's Supervision Department is Concurrently Held by Xie En

Chen XuanShan, the Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau's Supervision Department, was ordered to go abroad for inspection, and his vacant position has been assigned to Xie EnGao, the Director of the Secondary Education Department.

### Hu Shih Suggests a Ten-Year Education Plan to Chairman Chiang

[Exclusive Interview with This Newspaper] Dr. Hu Shih, the President of Peking University, participated in the preparatory committee for the election of academicians of the Academia Sinica in Nanjing. At the end of last month, he braved the summer heat to come south despite being ill. At that time, in a corner of the International Hotel, he refused to answer reporters' questions about the content of his conversation with Wedemeyer in Beiping. He said that even his wife could not be told.

The doctor will be returning to Beiping by air tomorrow morning. He just arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and is staying on the 13th floor of the International Hotel. From morning till night, guests are constantly visiting, making him tired of dealing with them. In the echo of the telephone operator, he asked reporters to see him "a little later."

In the evening, reporters went as agreed. Dr. Hu Shih was wearing silk pajamas and was sitting peacefully on the sofa reading the evening newspaper. At the very beginning, the doctor smiled and said, "There is nothing to talk about."

Under the condition of not talking about "Wedemeyer," we still talked.

The doctor started with his participation in the preparatory committee for the election of academicians of the Academia Sinica. He said: The first review meeting will be held on the 15th of next month to decide on the list of candidates and announce it to the public. The first review meeting will be held next spring to elect 80 to 100 academicians. Afterwards, the academicians themselves will elect 15 academicians each year. After ten years, the country will have more than 200 academicians. The doctor believes that this is a major event for the country.

The Far Eastern Christian Conference currently being held in Nanjing was not attended by the doctor. He said that we are a civilized country, but with the most illiteracy. Basic education includes compulsory education and vocational education. Now it is really necessary for us to gather with foreign experts to discuss and promote our own efforts. He hoped that after entertaining experts from various countries on tours of Jing, Hu, and Hang, the government would also invite them to Beiping to take a look.

From a wisp of smoke, he said: Wang Anshi was the most selfless scholar, but he argued that the first thing a scholar should do is to be selfless, which is to fully develop himself, and then do things for others after being selfless. The country has been unlucky to this day, and it is definitely not possible to overcome difficulties by shouting slogans, posting signs, or striking. Today, the country lacks science, lacks industry, and education is backward. Young people must be able to blame themselves and strive to develop themselves. Ibsen said: "The most important thing for young friends is to be able to cast themselves into vessels." Whether they are scientists, philosophers, or poets, they must always create a "vessel" from the material that their parents naturally give them. I said this thirty years ago, and I still say it now.

At this point, he told reporters: This time in Nanjing, he provided Chairman Chiang with a ten-year education proposal: In the next ten years, in the first five years, the government will concentrate its efforts and use large amounts of funds to develop five universities that already have a foundation. In the next five years, it will develop five other universities to make them top-notch universities in the world. The five universities in the first five years are Peking University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University, Central University, and Wuhan University. The five universities in the next five years, he said, are not yet visible, and it depends on the efforts of each school. If the national universities do not work hard and have no academic achievements, it is very likely that several church universities will replace them. The doctor believes that instead of spending vast sums of foreign exchange every year to send state-funded students to study abroad, it is better to use this money to develop domestic universities. After the Meiji Restoration in Japan, it concentrated its efforts and enriched the achievements of the two universities "Tokyo" and "Kyoto," which is an excellent precedent.

Now there are many schools, and the strength is scattered, and there is absolutely no way to achieve results. At this point, the doctor made a prediction, which should be a warning: Not long after, China will have tens of millions of students going to Japan to study abroad, which is extremely shameful!

Can Chairman Chiang accept your suggestion? The doctor smiled and I said goodbye. (Qi Rong)

### Resolution of the National Cotton Mill Association's Board Meeting: Member Mills Withdraw from the Industrial Association; Too Few National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Seats for the Cotton Textile Industry; Dispatching Three Representatives to Beijing to Request an Increase

[Our Newspaper's Report] The 23rd joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the National Cotton Mill Association was held yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM in the conference room of the China Textile Construction Company. Du Yong, Tang Xinghai, Wu Kunsheng, Shi Fengxiang, Rong Erren, Zhang Jianbai, Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, and others attended. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM. Key points of the discussion are as follows:

(1) Regarding the government's allocation of seats for the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan, the national textile industry received only four seats in the National Assembly and two seats in the Legislative Yuan. Considering the importance of the cotton textile industry within the textile industry, and its significant contribution to the nation and the people's livelihood, the number of seats should be increased. It was decided to dispatch three representatives, Wu Weijing, Liu Piji, and Zai Zhuyi, to Beijing next Monday to petition the Executive Yuan's Assembly and Organization departments, requesting that the number of National Assembly seats be increased to four and the number of Legislative Yuan seats be increased to two for the national cotton textile industry alone. (2) The import of industrial raw materials is currently managed and distributed entirely by the Industrial Association. However, the textile industry is vast, so the industrial raw materials needed by the textile industry should be allocated independently. (3) The National Cotton Mill Association should immediately notify its members to withdraw from the Industrial Association in order to maintain the independence of the National Cotton Mill Association. (4) The National Economic Commission is currently convening a group meeting to discuss the cotton yarn regulation plan. It was decided to dispatch Wu Weijing, Liu Jingji, Rong Erren, and Shi Fengxiang to Beijing to participate in the discussion.

The cotton yarn market situation yesterday: at the opening, due to unrest in the Hubei and Henan regions, yarn transported to Wuhan was returned, and the lower negotiated prices set by the Textile Construction Company caused a sharp decline in market sentiment. Towards closing, retail investors slightly absorbed the lower prices, and prices rebounded slightly. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 17,300,000 yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was down 300,000 yuan, Light Double Horse yarn was down 350,000 yuan, 16-count Guangming yarn was down 100,000 yuan, and other yarns also continued to fall by varying amounts of up to 300,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth Market Weak

The cotton cloth market situation yesterday: few merchants were making purchases, and news of goods transported to Wuhan being returned from Nanjing further dampened sentiment. Cloth stores on this street, such as Xie Tai Xiang, were not buying and were instead selling. Imported Japanese goods flooded the market, and prices continued to decline. Ultimately, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 479,000 yuan, a further drop of 7,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other grades of fine cloth, bleached cloth, twill, and blue cloth also fell by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Only Shilin cloth remained at its original price.

Also, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Cai E wheel, returning from Qingdao to Shanghai, transported a large batch of over 2,300 pieces of cotton yarn, in addition to raw oil and soybean oil. There were also over 200 pieces of cotton cloth, which are currently being unloaded at the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong.

Cotton Market Turns Weak

The spot cotton market turned weak yesterday due to the decline in cotton yarn prices. Prices were slightly softer than the previous day, with a total of approximately 1,300 bales traded. The opening prices for various grades delivered to factories were: Henan Fine at 2,090,000 yuan, Fire Machine at 1,775,000 yuan to 1,800,000 yuan. The warehouse delivery prices were: Lingbao at 2,270,000 yuan to 2,280,000 yuan, Bairo at 2,220,000 yuan to 2,250,000 yuan, Henan Fine at 1,960,000 yuan to 2,000,000 yuan to 2,040,000 yuan, and Zhoupu Seed Cotton at 335,000 yuan.

### Kerosene Rationing Price Increased: 1,440,000 Yuan Per Barrel

The kerosene rationing price, as determined by the Price Evaluation Committee, will be implemented at the new price starting today. The price for each barrel with a capacity of 200 liters is 1,440,000 yuan, and the retail price is 4,000 yuan per half liter. All wholesale and retail merchants in the city must sell at the prices agreed upon above.

### Consolidated Bonds Stable; Foreign Stocks Steady

Although government bonds fell yesterday, the process has gradually stabilized, with only slight fluctuations. Consolidated Bond C opened at 14,800 yuan, rose from 15,000 yuan, and closed at a low of 14,300 yuan. Rooms 503 and 555 both made gains, while rooms 538 and Runde both sold. As a result, Consolidated Bond D alone was flat, while Bonds A and B fell slightly by 100 yuan, and Bonds C and E fell by 300 yuan each. Turnover was no less than 6 million yuan.

Foreign stocks were stable yesterday, with mixed results and varying fluctuations. Ewo Yarns opened at 83,000 yuan, reached a high of 86,000 yuan, and hovered around 84,500 yuan at noon. Cantonese investors were buying, while foreign merchants and securities firms were selling. As a result, paper stocks rose by half a percentage point, while Hall & Holtz and Jardine Matheson were flat. Ewo Yarns, British American Tobacco, Ewo Brewery, steel stocks, and telephone stocks rose slightly, while Jardine Properties fell slightly.

### Cigarettes Rise Again

The cigarette market situation yesterday: due to the high cost of raw materials, increased wages, and adjustments by the manufacturers, merchants were eagerly buying, and prices rose again. In the afternoon, there were more buyers than sellers, and the market was further hyped. Finally, ten-packs of British American Tobacco cigarettes were hyped up to 16,600,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 750,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes also rose by 650,000 yuan, to 14,500,000 yuan. Ardath cigarettes were also hyped up to 13,200,000 yuan, with a large volume of transactions. Among Chinese-made cigarettes, the Meili Golden Mouse brand was the only one that weakened due to upcoming shipments. Other brands, such as Bai Wan, Golden Crest, and Red Golden, all rose by 2,000 to 4,500 yuan.

Also, daily necessities such as soap and matches rose in price due to the surge in cigarette prices. The prices of various brands of soap also rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and matches also rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Fluctuates

The various domestic teas that sellers have long sought to raise in price, after finally being driven up a few days ago, sellers in the market yesterday reverted to their old ways and attempted to drive up prices. Unfortunately, due to limited sales from local streets and merchants, momentum remained weak, making it difficult to improve the situation. As a result, prices merely fluctuated at high levels. Looking ahead, there are more opportunities than risks. As for the foreign trade tea market, exporters remained on the sidelines, but supply was also very limited. As a result, there were few transactions, and the situation was fair.

It is understood that several export companies are still frequently trying to acquire this year's new black tea, but the goods have not yet arrived in this city. To meet urgent needs, it is said that old Anhua tea from last year will be re-inspected in the coming days.

### Yarn Merchants Request Extension of 7-Day Delivery Deadline for Warehouse Receipts

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Yarn Merchants Association recently reported to the Textile Adjustment Committee that its members are experiencing difficulties with the Textile Adjustment Committee's requirement that cotton yarn warehouse receipts purchased from the association must be delivered within seven days. The contents of the report are as follows:

(Omitted heading.) The cotton yarn traded by our yarn merchants is mostly sold in bulk to merchants from various regions for transshipment, in addition to a small amount supplied to retail stores. Since the implementation of transshipment control measures, the procedures for applying for transshipment permits have been very complicated. From the application to the issuance of the permit takes a long time. As an example, the application procedures for transshipment of cotton yarn in July of this year were not approved until August 30. After receiving the approval notice, it is necessary to wait for the ship schedule, customs declaration, and other procedures before obtaining the permit and officially shipping the goods, which takes a considerable amount of time. Furthermore, transshipment applications are only accepted once a month, limited to the 20th of each month. Whether or not the application is approved depends on the allocation and approval of the specified quota. Requiring that the warehouse receipts be delivered and shipped within seven days is not feasible.

### Chinese Stocks Oversupplied, Buying Interest Declines Further

The buying interest in Chinese stocks declined further yesterday, with continued oversupply and many investors continuing to liquidate their positions. In addition, yarn prices fell again significantly, and most of the telephone orders from outside the market were cancelled. Sellers became more active, gradually lowering prices, causing Wing On to close at a low price without any resistance.

The market opened low in the morning, with forward Wing On opening at 242 yuan. After Nos. 111 and others sold, it fell to 237 yuan. Nos. 126 and others bought, rising to 241 yuan. Nos. 97 and others sold, and Nos. 36 and others, as well as scattered buyers, made offers. No. 50 made a strong purchase of current Wing On, and it rebounded to 243 yuan. Nos. 111 and others sold, falling to 239 yuan.

After 10:30 AM, the interest rate outside the market opened low at 1.35 fen and 1.8 fen, and No. 65 was still buying, so it was slightly stable. However, yarn prices were reported to be much lower, and Nos. 94 and others sold. Nos. 107 and 99 strongly sold current Wing On. Near noon, scattered buyers were eager to liquidate their positions, causing sellers to gain the upper hand. Without any resistance, forward Wing On closed at 227 yuan and 233 yuan. After the close, quoted prices were slightly stable.

As a result, current delivery stocks Sino-British and Qunxing fell by about half a percentage point. Wing On, American Asiatic, Huafeng, and Jingfu fell slightly. Sino-French, Xinhua, Wing On, and Xingguang were flat. Chinese Silk rose slightly, Datong fell by 10%, and the rest fell slightly. Among forward delivery stocks, Wing On, American Asiatic, Sino-British, and Huafeng fell by half a percentage point. Xingguang, Wing On, and Jingfu fell slightly. The situation of old stocks outside the market was slightly weak.

### National Bank Asks Executive Yuan for Instructions on Foreign Exchange Settlement for Self-Funded Students

[Our Newspaper's Report] The National Bank is asking the Executive Yuan for instructions on whether to settle foreign exchange for self-funded students at the official exchange rate or the market exchange rate. However, for those who had applied and been approved before the amended foreign exchange control measures were announced on August 18, and who had paid legal tender to the National Bank's Business Bureau and obtained foreign exchange settlement documents, foreign exchange settlement will be permitted at the official exchange rate. The rest must wait for instructions from the Executive Yuan before a decision can be made. Also, from August 18 to the present, the National Bank's Non-Import Foreign Exchange Examination Committee has examined 364 foreign exchange applications.

### Social Bureau Stores Rice for Sale as Food Prices Rise for Days; Early and Thin Rice Breaks 500,000 Mark

Rice prices have been rising recently due to rising prices in the producing areas and scarce supplies, leading to rampant inflation. According to the person in charge of the Food Section of the Social Bureau, in addition to the Social Bureau cooperating with the Economic Police of the Police Bureau to conduct inspections in the market at any time, they stated that reports that the policy of resuming sales of stored rice would not be implemented at present, for the following three reasons: (1) To prevent the reverse flow of grain. (2) New grains are about to enter the market, and if rice prices are rigidly regulated, it may affect future supplies. (3) Currently, the prices of mid-grade and low-grade rice have not fluctuated drastically.

However, the person in charge solemnly stated that selling stored rice is the established policy of the Grain Bureau of the Trust Bureau and the Social Bureau, and the Social Bureau is storing rice in preparation. If it becomes necessary, it will legally sell large quantities to the market.

Furthermore, it has been learned that the reasons for the recent fluctuations in rice prices are: (1) Smuggling has not been curbed, with thousands of dan being transported directly from producing areas such as Wuxi and Jiangyin to bandit areas every day, and another party is manipulating the external transport of large quantities of rice. (3) The impact of the Wuhan war has prevented rice from Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces from being transported smoothly.

Scarce Arrivals Lead to Price Increases

Also, yesterday a total of 5,200 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets. The gap between early and thin rice being new and old caused prices to continue to soar by 20,000 yuan, breaking the 500,000 mark. Japonica rice also rose by more than 10,000 yuan. New japonica continued to rise by 10,000 yuan. White Yin Yuan stood firm, while Indica rice was abundant in supply, with both new and old arrivals, and the situation was relatively moderate, with high-quality goods showing a slight rise, while mid-grade and low-grade goods remained mediocre.

The price of flour remained temporarily fixed, and the price of rationed flour remained unchanged. Standard flour showed a slight rise, while miscellaneous brands remained fixed. Wheat bran supply and demand were not strong, and there were no fluctuations. Soybean cake continued to be supplied from Taiwan, and the situation remained firm. Soybean prices rose in the producing areas, and the supply was not abundant. Merchants on local streets and oil factories were trading, and the underlying sentiment was firm.

Tea beans were slightly picked up in Southeast Asia, with high prices and sluggish lower grades. Garden peas were purchased in Shantou, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sorghum was also inquired about in South China, and local merchants were converting stocks, gradually rising, with another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan increase. Red sorghum from Qingdao was being actively processed, with a continued rise of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and the market was active. Corn was slightly improved from the North Sea, weakening in the morning but firming in the afternoon, with no significant gains or losses. Sesame seeds were returned by foreign companies and could not be re-exported. Local merchants were casually accepting them, with high-quality goods stable and mid- to low-quality goods falling by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were in a slump, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. New raw peanuts continued to plummet by 60,000 yuan, with no hope of recovery.

The price of rationed goods in Shantou remained unchanged, and the market experienced mixed gains and losses. Clear oil was scarce and stood firm, rising by another 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Raw oil was sluggish, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Soybean oil was flat, rapeseed oil fell slightly by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and sesame oil was dull and inactive.

Cedar Wood Stable

Cedar wood prices in the producing areas of Fujian Province were affected by hurricane damage, so the price was around 2,100 yuan. The Shanghai market was tight on credit, and buyer interest was slightly weak, but the underlying sentiment was quite stable.

### Non-Quota Imports Will Be Carefully Reviewed

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Yang Hengtan, the newly appointed director of the Non-Quota Import Review Department of the Import and Export Management Committee, the review work of the imported goods in Schedules 1 and 3A under the department's jurisdiction will be handled carefully in the future. For example, for imported goods in Schedule 1, those engaged in production and public utilities should be entitled to apply for foreign exchange. In the future, the types of imported goods will be specified, and applicants will in principle be limited to direct users of the goods. Each applicant will be registered. If there are too many applications, the relevant authorities such as the Capital Commission, the Industrial Association, the National Federation of Commerce, and the Industrial and Commercial Counseling Office will be asked to jointly review them to ensure transparency. Furthermore, importers belonging to Schedule 1 who have their own foreign exchange will be given special consideration. The situation for imported goods in Schedule 3A is more complicated, and Li Gan, the deputy director of the Import and Export Management Committee, is currently studying a reasonable solution. It is reported that in order to protect the rights and interests of consumers, the profits of importers will be regulated.

Furthermore, the South China Import and Export Management Committee has not yet been established despite a period of preparation. It is reported that the date of the committee's establishment will be decided after Jia Jiao, the director of the Import and Export Management Committee, inspects Pengnan.

Many private and public shipments have arrived from Hong Kong, and Japanese goods are also in good supply. Factories such as Yinfeng, Zhanghua, and Xinhua have also launched large quantities of products, as their wool materials were fixed at a previous official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan, making the weaving of flannel extremely profitable.

### Telegraph Q&A

Answered by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau.

[Question from Wu Xinhai, No. 123 Yu Hang Road] (1) The fee for telegraph registration at your bureau seems too high. For the sake of developing business, you should strive to reduce it. Also, why are registered numbers often unavailable? (Answer) The registration fee is 120,000 yuan per year, which is collected in accordance with regulations. If you want to save money, you can apply for short-term registration, which is 30,000 yuan per term for three months. Telegraph registration at this bureau is limited to four-digit numbers (from 0001 to 9999), which is insufficient to meet demand. However, there are no restrictions on English registrations, which can be used at any time and are also applicable to Chinese telegraphs. We are planning to create five-digit number registrations soon, which will be available in large quantities. (2) Why doesn't your bureau compile and print a new telegraph codebook itself? (Answer) A new telegraph codebook is being compiled and printed and will be available for public sale soon. (3) Can telegraphs be sent and received via telephone? (Answer) The method of sending and receiving telegrams via local telephone has been in practice for a long time. If you wish to use it, please apply for registration at the business section of this bureau. (4) Is there a time limit for telegrams? Why is the time limit often exceeded? (Answer) There are regulations regarding the time limit for telegram delivery. Express telegrams are one and a half hours, urgent telegrams are four hours, and ordinary telegrams are eight hours. If the time limit is exceeded, it is generally due to obstacles on the telegraph lines. (Question from a billing account customer) Billing telegrams were originally established for the convenience of customers, but your bureau's billing telegrams are only received from 9:00 AM and stop at 10:00 PM. Can this be extended? (Answer) The general business office of this bureau can receive billing telegrams from 8:30 AM to midnight every day. However, billing telegrams before 9:00 AM and after 10:00 PM are handled concurrently by on-duty telecommunications staff.

### On Kunqu Opera

— Hu Shanyuan

I once said dogmatically: "It is a shortcoming to study art without understanding some Kunqu opera. Especially for those who study Chinese literature, if they have not read Kunqu opera, I think they are not qualified to talk about Chinese literature. For those who study music, dance, and drama, if they have not seen a performance of Kunqu opera, it is really their greatest loss."

The reason I consider myself "dogmatic" is because I only stated my conclusion in a general way without explaining my reasons in detail. Perhaps it is not only "dogmatic" but also somewhat contradictory, because I have always advocated new literature and opposed old literature. Kunqu opera is old literature, so why do I value it so highly?

However, I am neither dogmatic nor contradictory, and I can explain my reasons.

First, let's talk about Chinese literature. Traditionally, only prose, parallel prose, poetry, and lyrics are considered literature, while novels and operas are not included. In particular, pedantic people simply regard the Four Books and Five Classics as literature, while novels and operas are absolutely excluded. Since Wang Guowei and others took a different view of Kunqu opera, many orthodox scholars have gained some understanding of it and given it some value. First, Kunqu opera occupies an important position in the history of Chinese literature. Each era has its own literary characteristics, and Kunqu opera is the characteristic of Yuan Dynasty literature, as well as the main supporting role of Ming and Qing Dynasty literature. A history of Chinese literature that does not pay attention to it, or that pays attention to it but fails to provide appropriate commentary, is incomplete. Second, Kunqu opera occupies an even more important position in Chinese literature. This can be proven by Wang Guowei's words on Yuan Dynasty opera. He said: "What is the beauty of Yuan Dynasty opera? In a word, it is naturalness! All great literature, ancient and modern, is superior in naturalness, and none more so than Yuan Dynasty opera." He also said: "The beauty of its writing can also be summed up in one word: intent! What is meant by intent? It means that when writing about emotions, it penetrates the heart and spleen; when writing about scenery, it is before the eyes and ears; when narrating events, it is as if they came from the mouth. Excellent ancient poetry and lyrics are all like this, and so is Yuan Dynasty opera." Third, Kunqu opera has an even more important relationship or influence on modern Chinese literature or new literature. We can see from it the traces of the evolution of Chinese literature and deduce that the emergence of modern new literature is an inevitable result, so that those who cling to the past and have a fondness for antiquity will make fewer meaningless objections. It can also let us know that the path that modern new literature should take is popularization, and its ultimate goal is to make the public artistic, because Kunqu opera is precisely popularized and aims to make the public artistic. Wang Guowei said: "In ancient literature, when describing things, ancient language was generally used, and there were hardly any uses of colloquial language; moreover, the number of words used was not very large. Only Yuan Dynasty opera, because it allowed the use of filler words, often used many colloquial expressions or described things with natural sounds. This is unprecedented in ancient literature." This is the explanation of Kunqu opera's relationship with the masses.

Therefore, I say that those who have not read Kunqu opera are not qualified to talk about Chinese literature, and perhaps this can avoid the charge of dogmatism. Moreover, Kunqu opera is especially in line with the spirit of modern new literature, so my high regard for it may not necessarily contradict my advocacy of new literature! Originally, my opposition to old literature was only against those traditional old literatures, while old literatures with new spirits that coincided with modern new literature, I was in favor of. It is only because this kind of old literature, which can be called new, is very rare, and most of them are antique, affected, and utterly useless old literatures, that I often have to reject them in general. Moreover, Kunqu opera has always been looked down upon by orthodox literati and was not originally within the scope of orthodox literature. My opposition to old literature is only against orthodox literature, and Kunqu opera was originally not included. The reason why my words are neither dogmatic nor contradictory is because of these reasons, although I feel that I have not explained it in detail enough.

Next, let's talk about music and other arts. What was called "comprehensive art" before the war is really appropriate and does not need much explanation. The most important thing about Kunqu opera is its performance. Kunqu opera may as well be called drama, and the solo singing of Kunqu opera can be regarded as poetry. In addition, ancient poetry also combined expression and dance, and originally had the same source as drama. Therefore, perhaps it can be said that drama and Kunqu opera are originally the same thing. When moved to the stage, it is drama; when placed on a desk to read, it is Kunqu opera. And opera becomes a mixed and reasonable name. Yuan Dynasty opera is Yuan Dynasty drama, and Ming and Qing Dynasty legends are now Kunqu operas and dramas, so there is no problem. Is Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasty opera Chinese doubt?

The singing and performance of Yuan Dynasty opera have mostly been lost. The singing and performance of Ming and Qing Dynasty legends, since Wei Liangfu of Kunshan in the Ming Dynasty first created the "water-grinding tune," became popular for a time, and the world followed it. Until now, the word "Kunqu opera" has become the representative name of Chinese opera, especially referring to its singing and performance. Therefore, Kunqu opera is the "comprehensive art" of China, and it is by no means an overstatement. Don't you believe it? Then you might as well go and see or listen.

However, if you have preconceived notions and think that it is just nonsense to watch and listen to Kunqu opera, then of course you will be incompatible with it. Even if you have no preconceived notions and do not have much understanding of art in general, you will gain nothing from watching and listening. Finally, if you have artistic cultivation but cannot correlate the art of Kunqu opera with the art you understand, then I say that your gains will be few. In my opinion, as someone who has no artistic cultivation and only a superficial understanding of Kunqu opera, the singing of Kunqu opera has its unique features.

The singing of Kunqu opera is a fusion of phonology, harmony, and composition. Its highs and lows, speed and slowness, are just right for the needs of us Orientals, especially Chinese people, to express various emotions. Although Kunqu opera has declined, Peking opera and various local operas have flourished, and their singing methods are mostly derived from Kunqu opera, but with simplification and ease. I am unwilling to say that Chinese music, especially singing, is completely useless compared to Western music. If there is still its due value and status, then we must respect the Kunqu opera, which is the culmination of all.

Among the accompanying musical instruments in music, Chinese gongs, drums, and stringed and wind instruments will always be immortal. And the best tunes or combinations of these instruments, no matter when or where you hear them, are all preserved in Kunqu opera.

Dance in art also occupies an important position in drama, because it can represent the actions of the singers and performers. The actions of the singers and performers, even in the most recently popular spoken drama, are by no means our casual daily actions. They always have some rhythm and conform to the melody of the music, similar to dance. This is known to everyone. Opera must have dance. I say that all kinds of inherent Chinese dances are also preserved in Kunqu opera. A single gesture or step in Peking opera often wins loud cheers from the audience, but who knows that in "Kunqu opera" (this is an untenable name, commonly used in relation to Peking opera), the "sound" and the body movements, every word and every expression, are all dance from beginning to end! One person singing is a solo dance, two people singing is a duet, a confrontation dance, and many people singing is a group dance, a collective dance. To look at the actions of Kunqu opera with the eyes of dance is to understand it. Even the fighting scenes, which are the most misunderstood or opposed, are actually just a kind of dance. Although the fighting scenes in Kunqu opera are not as fiery and tense as in Peking opera, their beauty and elegance are undeniable.

The various positions taken during dance, especially during fighting and group dances, are also very good patterns in art. From patterns to painting, then, the various costumes and decorations of the singers and performers, based on their centuries of experience, gradually improved by removing the dross and keeping the essence, have reached the point of perfection today. Don't underestimate the facial makeup, thinking that it is just a vestige of barbarian tattooing. In fact, it is also a noble art. All in all, Kunqu opera initiated various kinds of dramatic techniques, and even now, the most beautiful, elegant, and appropriate conditions are still preserved in Kunqu opera.

The various elements in drama, which are in line with the various elements in art, such as posture being in line with sculpture, do not need to be discussed. In other words, the various elements in Kunqu opera, which are in line with the various elements in art, do not need much further explanation.

The study of art, the study of music, dance, and so on, should originally start with the modern, and its ultimate goal should be to create new things. But new things cannot be born without roots, and especially cannot be copied entirely from the West. The old, especially this Kunqu opera, can make many contributions to the new. I wonder why you are unwilling to take a look at it? Isn't this the greatest loss? By taking a look at it, we can appreciate it more and add noble and proper entertainment to life. It seems that we have no reason to ignore Kunqu opera.

Therefore, I feel that by giving up the opportunity to study or learn various arts and to watch Kunqu opera performances, I am suffering the greatest loss. Is this not dogmatic? And I am also strongly advocating new art. Now, I only advocate that this kind of old art, the singing and performance of Kunqu opera, needs to be preserved, referenced, and appreciated. Is this also not contradictory?

Then, Kunqu opera today, whether it is the Kunqu opera on the desk or the singing and performance on the stage, we can regard it as follows: preserve it, refer to it, and appreciate it, because it has its own undeniable value! As long as we are not poisoned by the ideas it leaves behind, such as traditional feudal consciousness and superstition, then it will be fine!

(Postscript: On September 13th and 14th, there will be two large-scale joint performances by Kunqu opera amateurs at the Lyceum Theatre. The purpose is to raise scholarship funds for Soochow University. Those who love Kunqu opera or want to see what "Kunqu opera" is all about may wish to use it as a reference to this article.)

### Lakeside Night

— Pei Yin

That night, there was no moon, no stars.

I stepped out of my house, walked through the alley, and came to the street. After passing through streets with colorful neon lights, I arrived at the quiet lakeside. The park by the lake appeared dim, floating with some mysterious air.

I strolled peacefully, following the path along the lake.

On the green painted wooden benches with backs placed along the lake, couples were leaning against each other. Some who arrived late sat on the soft grass. They talked in low, affectionate tones, and their various intimate attitudes revealed their mutual passion.

Let the darkness cover their shame; the darkness made them bold...

The lakeside at night is a paradise for lovers.

### Ma Liuquan's Lament for Selling His Son

— Zhu Wen

Ma Liuquan's lament for selling his son: "Poor families also cherish their children, How can one bear to abandon the heavy bond of flesh and blood? Unable to ensure survival from hunger and cold, I sell my son into servitude. When will we meet again after this separation? I caress my son's body and lick his face, If fate allows, I will redeem him in a year of abundance, If not, I will embrace eternal resentment in the nine springs. I implore my son not to worry about his parents, Worrying will make you sick, who will take care of you? Holding each other's heads and stamping their feet, their cries were cut off, The mournful wind whistled, the sky was vast and hazy." This work is very much in the style of the old Du Fu.

### Literary Men's Love for Cats

— Shou Juan

——From Miscellany in a Violet Box

The cat is the most docile domestic animal, and also a wonderful ornament in the family. People in the old days regarded it as a good companion, not only for catching mice. My family originally had a tortoiseshell cat, which we had kept for three years. It was good at catching mice, did not steal food, and had a fixed place to relieve itself, so the whole family loved it. Unexpectedly, it has changed recently. It is lazy all day long, often dozing on the stove, stealing food when it sees it, and no longer relieves itself in a fixed place. It also often scratches the carpets and chair cushions with its paws, which makes me very hate it, but there is nothing I can do. Unexpectedly, I found it dead in the garden the day before yesterday morning. I don't know how it died. Fortunately, it has given birth to two kittens, so it is not extinct, and I have no worries about the future. We gave away one and kept one. Its fur is yellowish-red with deep black, and its abdomen and four feet are all white. It is more beautiful than its mother and can be considered a captivating creature.

Most Chinese literati and men of letters love cats, so there are often poems and lyrics praising them. Qian Baofen, a Qing Dynasty lyricist, wrote a poem about a cat called "Snow Lion Cub" and solicited rhymes from his fellow lyricists. Famous people such as Zhu Zhuyi, Wu Guren, and Li Fanxie all responded. Zhu's three lyrics are elegant and graceful and can be called a connoisseur of cats. The first one says: "How many ounces of Wu salt? To hire a cat, when bathing silkworms. The silk ribbon is traceless, kneading fluff into a mound. The poet Huang Jiu, also does not hesitate to buy fish and thread willows. He especially loves to live beside the hibiscus and peony flowers. A clear painting after the midday dream returns. Contracting its double eyes, it suddenly stands up, drowsy and still. Surprised, it leaps onto the rattan stool, mother and child holding each other for a long time. Will the parrot come? Arousing several embroideries paused in the spring boudoir. Heavy curtains tempt. Please warm your hands by the stove again. " The second one says: "Better than butter entering snow, who in front of people, does not call you ungrateful? All day long, on the heavy steps, constantly teaching the young ones secretly. Foolish children and silly girls, do not pull the colorful silk reins. Let it eat fish and catch sparrows, watch bees and spy on mice. It can cross a hundred-foot red wall. Asking Tan, thanking Yuan, where do you sleep in spring? Beside the golden embroidered shoes, its twin pupils are always focused. The jade beauty turns her steps. You must listen carefully to the attentive instructions. Empty room curtains, do not mistake the cicada." The third one says: "Grinding its teeth and licking, resembling a tiger, its yellow eyes and whiskers are distinguishable. The hot weather is long, test the coolness of its nose. Incense ash is dark. It cannot catch even a single cricket. Further searching towards the purple mustard under the fence, the red amaranth on the stone ridge. Drunk, the lotus root trembles frequently. Surprised to scratch its head and pass its ear, the eternal mark is initially cleansed. The news of the husband's return, do not break it with a jade whip. Spreading throughout Pingling. Asking who fastened the golden coin lock? The wind turns. Canyon butterflies are startled and fly in confusion."

Not only Chinese literati love cats, but also many famous figures in the Western literary world have a cat obsession. For example, the French literary giant Victor Hugo would feel depressed and lost if he did not see his beloved cat in the room. The novelist François Coppée loved cats to the point of being obsessed, and he spared no effort in collecting famous breeds year after year. He had several Persian cats, which were extremely valuable. The novelist Théophile Gautier also kept many cats, loving them all. He gave them Eastern names, such as Chabi Deb, Zobeidah, etc. One female cat was named after the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. Another cat, the most beautiful one, had a red nose and blue eyes. He loved it the most and always took it with him wherever he went. He called it Mrs. Ciphil, as Ciphil was his own name. He simply treated it like a beloved wife. In the English literary world, there were also several famous figures who loved cats, such as the novelist and poet Walter Scott. He was originally obsessed with dogs and did not love cats, but in his later years, he underwent a change and developed a great fondness for cats. He wrote in his articles: "The greatest progress I have made in age is discovering that I love a cat, a creature that I originally hated." The poet William Cowper always had his beloved kitten by his side when he was at home. He wrote to a friend: "This is the most sensitive animal covered in cat skin." Other famous writers such as Samuel Johnson, Oliver Madox Brown, and Horace Walpole were also famous cat lovers, who were friends with cats on a daily basis and were unhappy without them.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"You're calling that 'deliberate ignorance' ... You child, ... alas!" Yaoqun sighed.

"Don't you readily have many foreign medicinal powders? Using them is both convenient and doesn't harm people ... Why do you need this thing?"

"Isn't this thing very durable?" Yaoqun's face immediately took on a layer of sadness, like faded flower petals.

"No, Aunt Ji ...!" Little Tiger opened his bright eyes wide, imitating an adult's attitude, preparing to argue with Yaoqun: "Durable? As long as this thing is used on your hands or body, I remember Grandpa Qiu said that as long as it's used once, it not only changes color, but also causes fire boils for a lifetime - extremely poisonous! ..."

Yaoqun suddenly shed a few tears.

Grandpa Qiu was an old-timer in the village, with a belly full of the Three Teachings and Nine Streams, and a belly full of bizarre anecdotes. When chatting idly, he told the story of a young lady escaping from disaster; this young lady was as beautiful as Chang'e in the moon. Fearing that the long-haired rebels would notice her, she used "mao cao gen" (a type of grass root) to boil water for bathing, ruining her beautiful appearance. After washing her snow-white skin with this poisonous grass, it turned scorched yellow and swollen, and she had fire boils constantly for years. Yaoqun, out of curiosity, remembered the name of this grass, and fearing that Grandpa Qiu was just joking, she secretly asked him again. Grandpa Qiu took out the Compendium of Materia Medica to verify his story. Little Tiger probably remembered this story when he bought the medicine back.

Why did Yaoqun need to disguise herself? She had new-style disguise skills, why resort to using this poisonous grass? Having decided to do so, why was she so sad and shedding tears?

Yaoqun herself had said that spies rely on disguise, which shows that they are not capable; unless they meet two conditions: First, they want to impersonate someone and infiltrate that person's social circle to obtain secrets. Second, their own appearance has been recognized by a certain social organization, and they also know their duties and goals, but due to certain relationships, they have to personally participate in this society or organization to obtain secrets. Apart from disguise, there is no other way to achieve their goal; only then do they need to change their appearance.

However, Yaoqun's work at this time did not seem to fall within these two conditions. So, why did she need to disguise herself, or even disfigure herself?

### America is Feeding the "Japanese Tiger"

— Authored by David Conde, Translated by Zhengming

Editor's Note: MacArthur's "Victory Day" address was full of praise for the current state of Japan; and he said that a lenient policy should be adopted for the peace treaty with Japan. However, Japan still retains the soul of militarism. MacArthur's views are a major concern for China and the world.

This article offers a stern critique of MacArthur's current policies, and may serve as a reference for the current "peace treaty with Japan."

It should be clear to everyone now that the United States has changed its original policy toward Japan. Observers in Tokyo saw this about-face happening as early as April 1946, but the implications of this reversal for peace in Asia have only become clear now.

In the initial months, the original policy guiding the occupation forces was perhaps the last evidence in the Pacific of Roosevelt's New Deal confronting a defeated aggressor with a hard-line approach. The joint guidance of the U.S. State Department, War Department, and Navy Department in September 1945 had planned to permanently eliminate Japan's threat to its neighbors and the world.

This could only be accomplished by eliminating Japan's military forces, stripping warlords and proponents of aggression of their power, ending the stranglehold exercised by monopolistic giants to prevent them from becoming the economic and industrial machinery for launching wars again, and allowing the Japanese people political freedom so that they could establish a government of their own choosing.

Any sovereign nation has the right to change its policies at any time, and any supreme commander has the right to urge changes to such policies whenever he deems it necessary.

If people or nations are persuaded or encouraged to believe that the original U.S. policy toward Japan has been implemented, then this is not only a big mistake, but also a dangerous thing for all the people living in the Pacific basin.

Japan remains the strongest industrial power in Asia. Japan's economy has not been democratized, and the Japanese people have not achieved effective political democracy, capable of wielding any significant control over Japan's vast war-making potential.

Airfields and military installations still dot the Japanese countryside. Fortifications and obstacles have not yet been demolished. Even the flatlands upon which these fortifications and defenses were built have not been converted into much-needed farmland.

Underground caves used as shelters for factories and military command posts during the war can still be seen from Kyushu to Hokkaido, which seems highly inappropriate in a land that has implemented a new democratic constitution and has forever vowed to renounce war.

Apart from the vast demobilization bureau, Japan's navy, army, and air force have been demobilized, and almost all military weapons have been destroyed. However, Japan still retains every necessary element to create a great war machine. The only thing missing is raw materials.

"Anti-Communist Bulwark"

Since General MacArthur has given Japan the role of an "anti-communist bulwark" in Asia, the issue of raw materials will not remain a problem for long. A "bulwark," if it is to have any value, must be strong economically and militarily. It must be given loans and technical assistance to play a key role. Japan must be guaranteed areas for doing business to earn money to pay for imports and support its population. If the former colonies cannot be returned, then it must be guaranteed access to raw materials.

While reparations goods are being removed from Japan, she is still able to maintain steel, chemical, and shipbuilding industries, and Japan still retains a skilled labor force.

Recently, someone asked MacArthur how Japan could "protect" itself after the occupying forces withdrew. He replied, "One way is to backtrack and allow them to have a small military establishment," although he felt that the United States should take on this task on their behalf.

Such a policy could only be considered meaningful if Japan were a democratic country, if the Japanese people had some significant control over their own destiny, and if there were some evidence to guarantee that Japanese leaders would never exploit Japan's key position to play great power politics among the three major powers—China, the United States, and the Soviet Union—using the familiar method of pitting barbarians against barbarians to once again dominate Asia.

However, there is no such guarantee.

Repeating Historical Mistakes

General MacArthur undoubtedly feels he has many legitimate reasons to explain his change in attitude toward Japan. He has changed from a policy of completely demilitarizing Japan and fully democratizing it economically to a policy of turning Japan into an "anti-communist bulwark" and helping it achieve economic recovery.

Isn't the same mistake made with Germany after World War I now being repeated with Japan? Many thoughtful observers believe that the United States is doing exactly this foolish thing. (Translated from the Millard's Review)

### Thoughts on a Letter from Tokyo

It seems like a serendipitous encounter. Today, I received a postcard from Tokyo, sent by a Japanese friend. As I gazed at the postcard, the following thoughts arose, which I would like to share with the readers of "Free Talk":

(1) Currently, the peace treaty with Japan has not been concluded, and Sino-Japanese transportation has not resumed. It is said that Japan can directly send letters to China, by American ships or airplanes, but China cannot directly communicate with Japan by mail, except for official channels, of course.

(2) The postcard had a total of fifty sen worth of postage stamps. In addition to the fifteen sen printed on the card, the sender affixed one fifteen-sen stamp and two ten-sen stamps. The fifteen-sen stamp features a portrait of General MacArthur, which shows that the Japanese indeed revere MacArthur as a "holy general," which is not wrong at all. The two ten-sen stamps boldly bear the words "Great Japanese Empire Postal Service," which demonstrates that Japan's "democratization" and MacArthur's "spiritual revolution" are completely hypocritical.

(3) The postcard refers to China as "Shina," which indicates that the Japanese cultural elite still hold the "Shina view" of China, and the views of other people can be imagined.

Originally, this was a small matter, but it allows us to truly understand Japan today.

### Thrift

— Xiao Kangshi

The sound of thrift echoes on the Shanghai Bund,

The opera and dance halls moan in misery;

Not to curb extravagance by imposing levies,

But to make the gentry set an example themselves!

The newspaper reports that Article 7 of the "Outline for the Implementation of Measures for Thrifty Consumption" states that "Entertainment venues are limited to closing at 11 PM." This city has implemented it starting from the third day, but the theaters in this city have no shows, and 11 PM is the time when attendance is at its peak. Now that the order is to close early, the owners of general opera and dance halls are all "groaning in misery." In fact, they are subject to "limited expenses" in terms of time, but cannot truly achieve savings in material terms. How can they "shift the trend of extravagance?" But looking back at the gentry, their "pride, luxury, licentiousness, and dissipation" are a hundred or a thousand times greater than the consumption of ordinary people. Therefore, if we want to "implement thrift," it would be more practical to start with the "gentry setting an example themselves," which would be much more beneficial.

### Love Imperfection

— Zhu Mei

The Louvre in Paris houses Rodin's sculptures. The "Venus de Milo" is one of the most famous sculptures in the world. However, to us Chinese, who love complete and happy endings, this is truly an imperfection. Why should such a beautiful woman be missing an arm? Although we all love completeness, fate has destined that mankind cannot have completeness. We often see that a family has a good wife, but the husband is not good; a husband with a good temper, but the wife is terribly fierce. The father is a successful and established great man, but the son is often a spendthrift. The poor were originally rich, and the rich of today will be the poor of tomorrow. Some people do not like to watch tragedies because tragedies are imperfections in life, but tragedies are constantly being performed. Marguerite wanted to live and die with her lover, but as a result, she sacrificed herself for another kind of love, causing herself to die in a state of imperfection. Imperfection is indeed a sad thing. For example, if a person wears a beautiful and clean white suit, and someone drips a drop of oil on their clothes, that oil stain is an unspeakable imperfection. People live in imperfection. If people want to live, they must get used to imperfection. The moon cannot always be full. It is only in darkness that we know the beauty of light. Without darkness, how would we know the preciousness of light? If people are content with imperfection, then imperfection becomes perfection. Those who do not grieve do not know the taste of happiness. Everything cannot and will not last forever. Although the "Sacred Tree" (note) of Alishan has lived for three thousand years, I dare say that it cannot live forever. Although three thousand years is long enough, time is even longer than that, and it cannot avoid being destroyed along with time. We should love imperfection, love everything, for there is nothing in the world that is not lovable. (36, 8, 25, in Qingdao)

(Note) There is a tree on Alishan in Taiwan that the Japanese call the Sacred Tree. It has a circumference of 32 meters and has lived for three thousand years, making it the second oldest tree in the world.

Announcement: Summer vacation has passed quickly, and schools (while arguing about the amount of tuition fees and training fees) are about to open again.

Tomorrow, this journal will collect several articles on the issue of tuition fees, which can also be considered as a welcome address for the opening of various schools. (Editor)

### Miscellaneous Notes on a Trip to America

— Xu Shu

American Private Military Schools

The United States is only a newly emerging country of over a hundred years. In terms of seniority, it is our great-grandson three thousand generations removed. However, their education, industry, economy, and everything else are above us. Even military science, which has been fighting internal wars for two thousand years since the Warring States period, must seek advice from this younger generation. It's not that we're backward, it's just that they've progressed too quickly. A reader who gloriously resisted Japan wants to go to the United States to receive military education, but has no idea where to start in choosing a school. I think this is something worth discussing publicly. Military education in the United States is divided into formal and informal. Formal schools include West Point, Virginia Military Academy, Staff School, and various specialized schools of the military. Before the war, except for "West Point," these schools did not accept foreign students, and "West Point" only accepted students sent by the Chinese government, limited to two students per term. Wang Geng was a veteran student of "West Point," and I heard that Wen Yingxing was also a graduate of West Point. Graduates from previous terms were usually sent to the United States for military training. However, due to the "West Point" requirement of two students per term, they all entered other private military schools to complete their studies. Therefore, most of the military veterans who have studied in the United States in our country are graduates of private military schools, while West Point graduates are truly rare. Private military schools are at the high school level and aim to train reserve officers. They are located everywhere, numbering in the thousands. Enrollment is not necessarily restricted. Local newspapers publish advertisements openly recruiting students. Tuition and accommodation fees are more expensive than ordinary high schools, and most of the students are from wealthy families. The cost of a set of military uniform is always around one hundred US dollars, and the students of these schools are generally splendidly dressed in military uniforms (with gold thread), with swords gleaming (command swords), and extraordinarily heroic, still retaining the vestiges of the British Guards. During the study period, students have official ranks, from private to colonel, and their official ranks are also prominently printed on their business cards. Therefore, there is no need to be surprised to encounter a fourteen or fifteen-year-old colonel on the road, and it is by no means impersonating a military officer. However, after graduating and entering a formal military school for training, their rank is still that of a private, but after completing the training period, they are promoted to formal officers. Even if they do not pass the graduation exam, they still retain the qualification of reserve officers. All universities in the United States have a Department of Military Sciences, with courses focusing on military technology, such as surveying and mapping, military communications, espionage and counter-espionage, foreign languages, and horsemanship. The instructors are mostly active or reserve senior officers, with colonels, major generals, and lieutenant generals undertaking the training work. The aviation departments of some universities have their own airplanes and airfields. The scope is comparable to any military flying school. The aviation departments in these universities are the main bases for training civil aviation personnel, and also the source for replenishing military aviation personnel. Therefore, once a foreign war breaks out, the government can mobilize millions of well-trained elite soldiers without much effort. One characteristic of American soldiers is that they are scholarly, as most of them come from the doors of universities. After demobilization, they can all obtain better positions in society. As for those who lose their jobs due to the armistice and file lawsuits, it is like looking for a needle in a haystack. (4)(9)
