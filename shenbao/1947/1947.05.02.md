### Zhang Qun Attends the Legislative Yuan to Report and Clarify Future Policy Objectives: Domestic Disputes Can Be Fundamentally Resolved

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Premier Zhang attended the Legislative Yuan for the first time on the morning of the 1st. While answering questions from legislators, he repeatedly emphasized that the new government will strive in many ways to bring a swift end to the military measures that the government was forced to take due to the suppression of the rebellion, so as to fundamentally resolve domestic disputes and restore unification through political means as soon as possible. Zhang pointed out solemnly that politics and economics are mutually cause and effect, and cannot be clearly distinguished. If political problems are not resolved, it will be difficult to achieve a balanced budget, currency reform, and price stabilization. Peace and unification are one and the the same, and democracy and the rule of law are also indistinguishable. In the future, the Executive Yuan's measures will give equal importance to both economic and political matters. The Cabinet will faithfully and bravely implement the resolutions of the State Council, make every effort to do so, and is willing to adopt opinions from all parties as a reference for policy making. Zhang assured the entire Legislative Yuan that the executive and legislative branches will be in a complementary relationship in the future. The Executive Yuan is willing to accept legal constraints, absolutely respect the principle of checks and balances, and will never disregard legislative matters. Zhang denied that the current government is merely a transitional institution from political tutelage to constitutional government, and used an analogy to explain: the government is like a car entrusted with transporting the blueprint for constitutional construction to the National Assembly, to serve as the foundation for the future construction of a constitutional and democratic government. Regardless of the car's mechanics, the driver's skills are limited to this, and there are many obstacles along the way. From departure to the destination, the driver must not only repair the car along the way but also pave roads and build bridges. The meaning of "transition" may be just like this. Zhang believes that China's economic construction should be based on self-reliance and should not rely solely on external assistance. Zhang said in a confident tone: "Our material resources are abundant, and our financial resources are rich. If we can unleash our potential and be self-reliant, it is not difficult. Heaven helps those who help themselves. Relying solely on external forces, as if there is no other way without foreign debt, this kind of dependence should be eliminated as soon as possible." Zhang believes that the past emergency economic measures were very effective in overcoming the economic crisis in February of this year. Without these measures, today's situation might not be like this. However, he pointed out that the authorities are paying attention to the current difficulties in the lives of civil servants. It is said that since the adjustment of the salaries of public school teachers and staff in December of last year, five months have passed without an increase. The reason for this is that since the implementation of the emergency economic measures, the cost-of-living index has been frozen. At the same time, the authorities have also implemented a ration system, which may compensate for a portion. Although prices are still rising, the main item is rice. The rationing of other items such as oil may solve a portion. The authorities do not intend to adjust salaries, but when considering this issue, they are also thinking of the following points: (1) the salaries of soldiers, (2) whether the salaries of public school teachers and staff at all levels other than the central and provincial levels should be adjusted at the same time, (3) the salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises are better than those of other civil servants, but the difference is still significant compared to employees of general private enterprises, and this should also be taken into account. The authorities are currently collecting this type of material for reference in future adjustments.

Currency Reform Will Be Implemented Sooner or Later; Emergency Measures Being Considered for Revision

Regarding the currency reform proposed by the legislators, Zhang believes that all countries must reform their currency systems after a major war, and China is no exception. Therefore, currency reform is inevitable sooner or later. The current question is when to implement it and to ensure that it is effective. This matter should be realized as soon as possible, because opening up financial and economic difficulties should be premised on currency reform, and stabilizing currency value should be a prerequisite for currency reform. Zhang also stated in response to questions that the government attaches great importance to credibility and will not easily lose the trust of the people. At the same time, it will pay special attention to the "making the best use of talent." Zhang's attitude was sincere, and his speech was sonorous and forceful. He behaved throughout like a statesman and a man of action, without any affectation, leaving an excellent impression on the entire Legislative Yuan.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan attended the Legislative Yuan meeting for the first time on the 1st and reported on the policy guidelines, stating that emergency economic measures are insufficient to cope with the current economic situation, so the government's economic authorities are reviewing them. This measure is like an economic martial law, and its harsh nature cannot be tolerated by the people permanently. The government will thoroughly study this measure and then decide whether to revise or abolish it. When the emergency economic measures were implemented, they were able to temporarily curb the rise in prices, but they ultimately failed to freeze prices and maintain the salary standards of civil servants. The government has considered adjusting the salaries of public school teachers and staff while ensuring that prices are not affected.

### Full Text of Premier Zhang's Report

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Premier Zhang Qun, who attended the Legislative Yuan for the first time to report, gave a penetrating elaboration on the relationship between the executive and legislative powers in his speech, which lasted about 25 minutes. He also emphasized and called for cooperation between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan. Zhang first put forward the key points that should be paid attention to in current policies, as well as the actions and styles that must be adopted in economic and general administration. He said: In this stage of transition from political tutelage to constitutional government, the task of the Executive Yuan is to faithfully and effectively implement the national policies determined by the State Council in accordance with the highest guiding principles of the Three Principles of the People, based on the spirit of the Outline for Peaceful National Construction and the policy guidelines of the new government jointly agreed upon by the various parties. This is evident from the provision in Article 5 of the policy guidelines of the new government that "the Executive Yuan shall be fully responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of the National Government Committee." Of course, in the process of implementation, we sometimes have to draft bills or budgets to be submitted to your Yuan, sometimes we have to formulate some implementation rules ourselves, sometimes we have to take into account the environment, distinguish priorities, and determine the implementation steps, and sometimes we have to make suggestions to the State Council based on practical needs or difficulties, requesting decisions, or requesting your Yuan to discuss them, but all of these are only the processes that should be had when implementing national policies. From a legal point of view, the mission of the Executive Yuan is still how to faithfully implement national policies, that is, how to thoroughly implement the laws formulated by your Yuan in accordance with national policies. The Executive Yuan cannot and should not take any action beyond the established national policies and existing laws, because if it does not do so, it is not democracy, it is not the rule of law. The so-called "the virtuous cannot exceed their authority to do good, and the unworthy cannot go beyond the law to do evil," these two sentences can well explain the spirit of the rule of law, and they can also fully explain the position of the Executive Yuan, so I am willing to declare responsibly that faithfully and effectively implementing the decisions of the State Council in accordance with the law is the rule and criterion for our future policies. We are willing to self-discipline ourselves with this, and we also want to use this spirit to supervise administrative organs at all levels across the country.

Explain Key Points of Policy and Promote Production and Construction

Regarding the key points of policy, Zhang reiterated the points he broadcast to the people across the country on April 23. Regarding economic issues, he put forward the short-term and long-term solutions that he broadcast, and further explained that, whether short-term or long-term, we believe that there is a need to establish a comprehensive one, because regular administrative organizations are divided according to various specialized administrative businesses or technologies. Among the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, there are as many as seven or eight units whose duties are related to economic matters. This is of course not a problem in the handling of regular government affairs or individual businesses, but when it comes to important, urgent, and broad-ranging issues such as stabilizing prices and promoting production and construction, every measure involves several ministries and commissions. For example, when it comes to controlling prices, it is related to at least the ministries of food, finance, transportation, social affairs, and economy. If there is no organization to strengthen the close ties between the various ministries and commissions, it will not be easy to achieve consistency in their actions, and the result will inevitably affect the implementation of policies. As for the work of promoting production and construction, this kind of coordination is even more important. Therefore, in today's extremely serious economic situation, we must bring together experts in various relevant businesses or technologies in society and the competent authorities in the government so that they can work together in an organization, under a certain policy, and under the principle of division of labor and cooperation, pooling wisdom and working seamlessly to achieve our goals. Although this organization is proposed by the government, the focus is on the industrialists and businessmen and specialized economic talents in society. If we do not do so, it will be difficult to cope with the current serious situation, and it will be even more difficult to talk about planned reforms. The Executive Yuan previously proposed the establishment of a National Economic Commission. We believe that this organization is necessary, and we hope that you will support it and pass it as soon as possible.

The Executive Yuan's Task is to Faithfully Implement Decisions

Zhang then raised general administrative issues, saying that in today's preparation for the implementation of constitutional government, what I think is most important is to establish a system, exert the role of checks and balances, and promote the spirit of respecting the law and being pragmatic. I have already reported to you earlier that in the current stage, the mission of the Executive Yuan is to faithfully and effectively supervise and implement the decisions of the State Council in accordance with the law. Here, we cannot but admit frankly that in the past, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the implementation of laws and regulations, due to the lack of material conditions and the instability of the lives of civil servants, as well as various other internal or temporary relationships, was not 100% thoroughly implemented. Therefore, it has aroused some criticism from some quarters. Everyone knows that the execution of national policies, after the completion of legislative procedures, becomes a technical problem. In other words, after national policies are made into laws, the next step is execution, and in the execution, the focus is on the method, and attention should be paid to how to execute it in order to effectively achieve the purpose of national policies. A slight mistake in the measures is enough to reduce the prestige of the law, or even hinder its implementation. Since we are responsible for the execution, we should make our best efforts to overcome all unfavorable environments in order to effectively and thoroughly implement national policies and laws. If, due to the evolution of the situation, the law becomes divorced from reality, and the administrative organs are unable to overcome its difficulties, then of course we must request the State Council to reconsider the decision itself, or request your Yuan to supplement or revise it in terms of law, so as to meet the needs of reality and avoid the indifference or perfunctoryness of lower-level governments to the law caused by impracticality.

The Relationship Between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan is Complementary

He then explained the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, saying: Many people think that the two Yuans are opposed to each other. On the 24th, a certain newspaper said in a headline "Sketch of the State Council Meeting": "Sun Ke and Zhang Qun sat opposite each other, symbolizing that future politics is the intersection of representative government and responsible cabinet, and the two will inevitably argue tit-for-tat." From the usual terminology, the so-called "opposition" or "tit-for-tat" may cause some people to misunderstand, but from the point of view of the political principle of checks and balances, the two Yuans are in fact complementary to each other. The two agencies are parallel, not opposed, because when the Legislative Yuan discusses the proposals of the Executive Yuan, in order to understand the motive of the proposal and its possible effect, it must of course repeatedly study it in order to decide whether it should be established. As for the law after it has been promulgated, the original legislative organ cannot but pay attention to its implementation, so as to provide a reference for future legislation or revision, because only in this way can the society develop respect for the law and the spirit of the rule of law. Frankly speaking, the Executive Yuan should absolutely accept the restraint of the law, and at the same time, it also hopes that your Yuan will understand its difficulties and trust its experience and sincerity. We attach absolute importance to the principle of checks and balances, and are willing to maintain the close relationship between the executive and the legislative branches in accordance with the provisions of the final paragraph of Article 5 of the policy guidelines of the new government.

He said at the end: In short, in the next eight months, the government must complete the preparations for the implementation of constitutional government on the one hand, and at the same time, it is even more anxious to restore national unity and stability and solve the current serious financial and economic problems. The administrative work is really extremely difficult, and we will ask you for advice and assistance at any time in the future. The current price problem is extremely serious, and the members must be very concerned, and they must have good opinions, so today we have invited the heads of the ministries and commissions related to economic problems, especially price problems, to attend at the same time, and we hope that they will not hesitate to give us guidance.

### Questions Raised by the Legislators Focused on Politics and Economy; Harmonious Atmosphere Paves the Way for Democracy

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] At the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 1st, the questions raised by the legislators to Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various departments mainly focused on politics and economics. Some also inquired about the current military situation. The legislators spoke on behalf of the people and placed great expectations on the new Executive Yuan. They expressed their gratitude for Zhang's willingness to attend the Legislative Yuan, reversing the past practices of those in power. What the legislators are most concerned about is the nature of the new Executive Yuan. Legislators such as Zhong Tianxin believe that the new Executive Yuan is a political government and is only allowed to succeed in politics, not to fail. They hope that it can use 80% of its efforts to seek the realization of peaceful unification. If peace can be realized, other problems will be easily solved. Jian Guansan attaches importance to economic issues, believing that this is the most important test for the new government. He hopes that the new government will not be afraid of offending the powerful and will not compromise with the wealthy and powerful. Chen Guyuan and others appealed for the general public school teachers and staff and students studying abroad. Lu Fu hoped to respect the people's personal freedom and earnestly implement the provisions of Articles 2 and 8 of the Constitution and compete with each other in the implementation of democracy. Members such as Situ De also put forward opinions on political and economic issues and said that the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan are mutually supportive and are both responsible to the people and should work together and not be in a position of opposition. Today, the legislators spoke calmly and peacefully. Premier Zhang also said that he would come to the Yuan from time to time to listen to their teachings. The atmosphere in the meeting was harmonious, and applause was heard from time to time. It is generally believed that the relationship between legislation and administration will be like milk and water in the future, paving a smooth road for our country's democratic constitutionalism.

### Admiral Kirk Tells Reporters: There Are No US Military Bases in China; Qingdao is a Chinese Port and the US Navy Has No Right to Close It

[News from this newspaper] US Navy Admiral Kirk held a press conference at the Cathay Hotel yesterday, and reporters from various newspapers asked questions, which Admiral Kirk answered one by one. The important ones are recorded as follows: (1) The rumor that the US Navy will close the port of Qingdao is untrue. Qingdao is a Chinese port, and the US Navy has no right to close it. (2) Of the ships recently donated to China by the United States, 97 ships are donated to the Navy, all with radar and complete weapons. Another 136 small ships are for customs use and must be paid for by the Chinese government. The handover of warships has no definite date, as it is still awaiting the completion of training of Chinese naval personnel. Some of these ships are now being used by the Chinese side. It is believed that in the near future, there will be detailed measures for the transfer of these ships. The US Navy in Qingdao is still assisting in the training of the Chinese Navy. The Chinese Navy Training Corps in Qingdao has made great progress. Kirk continued that foreign countries had mistakenly called Qingdao a US naval base, which is not true. The US Navy has no base in China. In Qingdao, it is only assisting in the training of the Chinese Navy. (3) He does not believe the rumor that weapons have been smuggled from Qingdao to the Communist area. (4) Regarding Moscow's accusations that the US Navy in Qingdao insulted Soviet expatriates, Kirk explained that it was because the US Navy took back some houses occupied by Soviet expatriates for the residence of naval families and personnel training the Chinese Navy. These houses were previously allowed to be occupied by Soviet expatriates by the Allied forces, but the term has long expired. (5) The US Navy in Peiping has been completely withdrawn, but the ground troops have not yet been completely withdrawn due to transportation problems. After Admiral Kirk finished speaking, he held a cocktail party at the Cathay Hotel to entertain the press and US Navy personnel in Shanghai, and introduced the new US Navy Public Relations Officer in Shanghai, Major Duffy, to meet with people from all walks of life. The original Public Relations Officer in Shanghai, Major Author, is about to leave the military. The meeting was pleasant, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. It was adjourned at 6:00 p.m. Admiral Kirk is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Qingdao on the morning of the 2nd.

### The Situation in Shanxi Province Gradually Becomes Serious: Yan Xishan Claims Communist Forces Plan to Attack Taiyuan; Fierce Battles Break Out Outside An'yi and Yuncheng

[Special Dispatch from Beiping to This Newspaper, 1st] The situation in Shanxi is gradually becoming serious. Official sources state: The Communist forces are using the Zhongtiao, Lüliang, and Taihang Mountains as shields. Communist forces from northern Shaanxi, western Hebei, and northern Henan are continuously entering Shanxi. They are using the Yanmen Pass to prevent Fu Zuoyi's troops from moving south, controlling Niangziguan in the east to prevent the Guomindang forces of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters from advancing west, and attacking various locations along the Yellow River in the southwest to control the river crossings, preventing the Guomindang forces of Shaanxi and Henan from moving north, thereby isolating the four strategic points of Taiyuan, Linfen, Datong, and Yuncheng. According to military statistics, the Communist forces have deployed approximately seven military districts with twenty-two divisions, totaling about 150,000 men, in the Shanxi border areas. They may launch attacks from eight directions along the Zhengtai Railway, the northern and southern sections of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, and from northern Shanxi, western Shanxi, southern Yanmen, northwestern Shanxi, and southeastern Shanxi.

[Dispatch from Beiping to This Newspaper, 1st] Taiyuan dispatch: Yan Xishan announced in a morning meeting on the 1st that it is now proven that the Communist forces plan to besiege Taiyuan. We began preparations after the restoration and are aware of the possibility of a surprise attack and encirclement of Taiyuan by the Communist forces. He called for a general mobilization to eliminate the attacking Communist forces using the methods prepared for defending central Shanxi. Yan met with Taiyuan Mayor Bai Zhiyi and others on the morning of the 1st and immediately convened a joint military-civilian anti-traitor conference to implement house-by-house and person-by-person inspections.

[Dispatch from Taiyuan to This Newspaper, 1st] The Communist forces have begun deploying to besiege Taiyuan and are conducting large-scale mobile warfare in eastern Shanxi. Shanghu was captured at 6:00 AM on the 1st, cutting off the railway transportation between Zhengtai, Yangquan, and Yuci. On the evening of the 30th, two brigades attacked strategic points such as Qinquan Station. The Sixth Field Brigade has infiltrated Xiaodian, a hundred miles northwest of Taiyuan. Yao Zhe, the commander of the Sui-Mongolian Military Region, has been transferred to commander of the Lüliang Military Region, leading the new Fifth Brigade of Wang Chijun's forces. The remaining forces retreated from northern Shanxi to the Xinzhou area, while another brigade retreated south from northern Yanmen to Jixian County. In addition, five Communist brigades are attacking An'yi and Yuncheng, and fierce battles have broken out in the suburbs. Telephone communication with An'yi and Yuncheng has been cut off. The Communist forces besieging Dingxiang were repelled.

[Dispatch from Beiping to This Newspaper, 1st] The Communist forces in southern Shanxi have approached the edge of the Yellow River. After the fall of Yongji, the Communist forces continued to press south towards Zhaocun and Fenglingdu. The situation in that area is unclear. Yuncheng and Anyang are currently under siege by the Communist forces. On the morning of the 30th, the Communist New 27th and 28th Regiments and the Southern Shanxi Liberation Army assault teams surrounded Pinglu from three sides and are engaged in fierce fighting. Seven regiments of Communist forces in Gaoping, southeastern Shanxi, also invaded from the southern Zhongtiao Mountains yesterday.

[Dispatch from Beiping to This Newspaper, 1st] On the 29th, Communist forces in Yicheng advanced to the Zhangli Railway Station, forty miles south of Linfen City. Fierce fighting is taking place. It is rumored that the Communist side has appointed Wang Tang as the commander for the attack on Linfen. The morale of the Guomindang forces in Linfen is high, and the city has enough food and ammunition to last for six months.

### Guomindang Forces Control the Heart of the Mountainous Area; Communist Forces in Shandong Retreat Eastward; A Major Battle is Expected Around Laiwu

[Dispatch from Jinan to This Newspaper, 1st] The main force of the Communist forces in Shandong retreated eastward again, east of the railway line, and the center of the battle also shifted eastward to Laiwu and its surrounding areas. Although the Communist forces that invaded west of the Jinpu Railway have re-entered the cities of Pingyin and Ningyang, they are aware that the Guomindang forces in southern Shandong are advancing into the heart of the Yimeng Mountains with unstoppable momentum. In addition to the Guomindang forces attacking Juxian and Yishui having advanced to the southern areas of each city, and having recovered Mengyin and Xintai, the Guomindang forces are continuing to advance victoriously towards Laiwu and Yangliudian. The Communist forces are deeply concerned about losing their base. Since the 30th, except for the First and Sixth Columns and part of the Fifth Column, which are still stationed west of the railway line, the remaining troops have retreated east of the railway line in an attempt to block the advance of the Guomindang forces. Therefore, it is generally observed that the real main battle may unfold in Laiwu and its surrounding areas in the near future.

[Dispatch from Jinan to This Newspaper, 1st] According to pre-determined steps, the Guomindang forces abandoned Ningyang. The Communist forces rashly advanced and have now been surrounded by the Guomindang forces from three sides. It will not be difficult to annihilate all the Communist forces in that area. In addition, the Guomindang forces advancing west from Xintai have recovered Yangliudian, a key point between Xintai and Tai'an, and are currently advancing towards Tai'an.

[Dispatch from Jinan to This Newspaper, 1st] The Guomindang forces automatically abandoned Pingyin on the 30th. The battle is now continuing near the north of the city. There were only minor skirmishes between Jieshou and Wand of north Tai'an on the 30th and the 1st. It is reported that the Communist forces have completely destroyed the city walls of Feicheng and Tai'an.

[Dispatch from Xuzhou to This Newspaper, 1st] After the Guomindang forces recovered Xintai, the heart of the Yimeng Mountains has been completely occupied by the Guomindang forces. This sharp sword is about to cut and dismember the Communist forces in Shandong into several parts. The Guomindang forces in Xintai continued to mop up the surrounding mountainous areas on the 1st, successively capturing Jindoushan, four kilometers north of the city, and Yushan, four kilometers northeast, and annihilating two Communist companies.

[Dispatch from Xuzhou to This Newspaper, 1st] The Guomindang forces advancing along both banks of the Yi River towards Yishui and Juxian engaged in fierce fighting with the remnants of the Communist Eighth and Tenth Columns in the area north of Jiehu Town and east of Xiazhuang on the 1st. In the afternoon, the Guomindang forces on the left flank advanced five kilometers northeast of Jiehu Town, and the Guomindang forces on the right flank recovered Shijiatun, six kilometers northeast of Xiazhuang. The capture of Yishui and Juxian is imminent.

[Dispatch from Xuzhou to This Newspaper, 1st] The Guomindang forces mopping up east from Mengyin engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist forces at Huangdoushan and Dingshan, ten kilometers east of the city, all day on the 30th. The remnants of the Communist Fourth Column were almost completely annihilated.

[Dispatch from Xuzhou to This Newspaper, 1st] The entire Communist First Column, with more than 25,000 men, launched a full-scale attack on Ningyang on the evening of the 30th. On the morning of the 1st, Guomindang reinforcements arrived and surrounded the Communist forces from both flanks, inflicting heavy casualties.

### Editorial: Observing the Jiangsu Provincial Administrative Conference

The first plenary session of the Jiangsu Province’s 36th year administrative conference opened yesterday in Zhenjiang. Administrative inspectors from various districts and county magistrates from across the province traveled to the provincial capital to attend the conference. The session is scheduled for five days, during which they will discuss issues related to civil affairs, finance, food administration, education, construction, public welfare, people's livelihood, public security, conscription, and local autonomy. Chairman Wang Maogong emphasized in his opening address that political affairs should align with the military recovery, striving for the restoration of local security and order. Chairman Chiang, amidst his busy schedule, also issued a written exhortation, encouraging all provincial administrative officials to "promote production, maintain security, advance local autonomy, and prepare for the implementation of constitutional governance." This indicates the convening of this provincial administrative conference holds extremely significant meaning. Though we are situated in the city, and recently because of the entangled and unresolved national affairs and the repeated upheavals in international politics, our gaze often turns to the developments in domestic and international situations; however, our hearts constantly remember the localities, especially the politics of Jiangsu Province, which is of utmost concern to us. Therefore, we not only attach great importance to the convening of the Jiangsu Provincial Administrative Conference, but also hold great expectations for it.

Jiangsu Province, whether observed from a geographical, economic, or cultural perspective, can be divided into two distinctly different areas: Subei and Jiangnan. These two regions are separated only by the Yangtze River, yet they share few similarities and are almost two unrelated entities. After the victory against Japan, the problem of the Communist Party further transformed Subei and Jiangnan into two distinctly different worlds. In Jiangnan, though devastated after eight years of war, under the rule of the government, as long as it can encounter honest and wise local officials, with clear political measures and allowing the people to rest, it would not be difficult for Jiangnan to gradually awaken from the ashes of war. However, in Subei, although the war was won, Subei was not yet recovered, still suffering from the poison and devastation of the Chinese Communist Party, even exceeding the ravages of the enemy. Now, the national army has finally recovered it, and the sun and moon shine again, but looking out over Subei, it is a scorched earth with scars everywhere. How can the administration of each administrative region and its counties align with the military recovery? And how can the kind and innocent compatriots of Subei be rescued from their deep suffering? According to Chairman Wang Maogong’s report: “If the bandit atmosphere in Shandong Province is not quelled for a single day, the danger in Subei will not cease for a single day. Therefore, the sixth and eighth administrative inspectors were unable to attend the meeting.” The situation in Subei remains extremely serious to this day, as can be seen from this simple report.

From this perspective, the local administration of Jiangsu, due to the differences between Subei and Jiangnan, absolutely needs to implement measures that are "adapted to local conditions." Considering the needs of the current actual situation, Subei should strive to coordinate politics with the military recovery to restore order and security. In Jiangnan, efforts should be made to promote the prosperity of the local economy. Chairman Wang, at the administrative conference, loudly proclaimed security as the top priority, which seems too biased towards Subei. We cannot help but point out here that if Jiangnan still cannot be stabilized and continues to emphasize security as the top priority, then Jiangnan is indeed too pitiable. Wang Maogong has been in charge of Jiangsu's administration for nearly two years. If, for the administration of Jiangnan's counties, he still focuses on security, then his achievements over the past two years are self-evident. It is precisely because we value the administration of Jiangsu Province, and precisely because we are particularly concerned about the future of Jiangsu Province, that we cannot help but take advantage of the provincial administrative conference's discussion of the administration of various counties to briefly describe our observations on the local situation, hoping to provide a reference for the local officials attending the conference.

Firstly, how should the local administration of the recovered areas in Subei align with the military recovery? We believe that the most important thing is to win back the hearts of the people. In today's democratic era, if an opposition party wants to seize power, it must win back the hearts of the people. Only after gaining the support and love of the majority of the people can it seize power. This is the only rule of democratic politics. Even the ruling party, if it wants to consolidate its acquired power, must also be able to maintain the hearts of the people, so that they do not collapse. Reflecting on ourselves regarding the occurrence of the Chinese Communist Party problem, we cannot help but admit our own lack of progress, which allowed the Communist Party to use corruption as a tool for propaganda to the people. The administration of areas under the control of the CCP may not necessarily be very brilliant, but the average people are ultimately not easy to distinguish. Now, the people of Subei, after being governed by the CCP, have returned to the rule of the government. Those who are subject to the governance will definitely be able to see the quality of the politics like fire. The people of Subei are all kind, patriotic people. When they were under the CCP's rule, they longed for the rule of the central government. Now that they have been recovered, their hopes have been realized, but the local administration after the recovery must not disappoint them again. Therefore, the success or failure of Subei's administration is not only related to Jiangsu Province, but also to the overall political situation. But how to win back the hearts of the people? It is definitely not effective to simply restore order and security. We hope that the Jiangsu Provincial Administrative Conference will pay attention to this point.

Secondly, Jiangnan has always been a rich and fertile area with abundant resources. Although it has been devastated after eight years of war, restoring its vitality is certainly not an easy task. But it depends on human effort. Jiangnan relies on its natural resources, as long as the local officials can all love the people like their own children, deeply understand the suffering of the people, and in the active aspect, encourage production and maintain security, so that the people can live and work in peace; in the passive aspect, allow the people to rest and do a few fewer things that harass the people. In this way, Jiangnan will not find it difficult to restore its old appearance. As for the local improvements and reforms that should be undertaken, they must be handled according to their urgency and priority. It is absolutely necessary to avoid being ambitious and unrealistic, so that any improvements and reforms are measures that are not beneficial to the people's livelihood. The administrative inspectors of various districts and the county magistrates have all come from the people and deeply understand the hardships of the people. Regarding the matters of local improvement and reform, they will naturally not engage in empty talk and be out of touch with reality. At present, the most urgent task of local administration is to seek the people's peaceful and prosperous life, thereby cultivating the people's vitality. If the people's livelihood is revived, then local prosperity will naturally follow.

Thirdly, this year is the year of constitutional implementation in our country. The constitution passed by the National Assembly will be implemented on December 25th of this year, and the foundation of constitutional governance lies primarily in local autonomy, especially the county, which is the grassroots organization of the autonomous unit. Therefore, if local politics are not handled well, then constitutional governance is equivalent to building castles in the air. The National Assembly representatives and legislative members will soon hold general elections, and candidates have already begun preparing for the elections. But if the people of each locality do not know how to exercise the four political rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum, then the true meaning of holding general elections will be greatly discounted, and our empty talk of implementing constitutional governance will be of no benefit to true democratic politics. Therefore, we believe that localities, during this transitional period of constitutional implementation, should actively prepare for the implementation of constitutional governance, so as not to fail Chairman Chiang's expectations of "promoting local autonomy and preparing for the implementation of constitutional governance."

In short, Jiangsu is the leading area of our country. Those in charge of Jiangsu Province should build Jiangsu into a model province for the whole country. Its success or failure is not only related to Jiangsu Province, but also has a very close relationship with local politics throughout the country.

### UN Steering Committee Discusses for Ten Hours: Arab Group's Request Rejected, Guo Taiqi Supports the Positions of Britain and the United States, Hoping for a Just Resolution to the Palestine Issue

[United Press, New York, 1st] The request by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia for the UN Special Assembly to hold an open debate and decide on Palestinian independence has been rejected by a resolution of the Assembly's Steering Committee. Today, according to Arab spokesmen, the Arab countries will request the Special Assembly to overturn the Steering Committee's resolution. However, the British and American delegations are confident that the Arab countries will not be able to obtain a two-thirds majority in favor. During the vote on the debate over Palestinian independence in the Steering Committee, only Egypt voted in favor. Of the Arab countries with representatives on the Steering Committee, only Egypt was present. China, Britain, the United States, France, Ecuador, Canada, Sweden, and Honduras voted against it, while Czechoslovakia, Brazil, the Soviet Union, Poland, and India abstained. The Steering Committee engaged in intense debate for ten hours, and Egypt tried to prevent the committee from voting, but to no avail. The Indian representative expressed sympathy for both Arabs and Jews, and ultimately abstained during the vote.

[Agence France-Presse, Flushing Meadows, 30th] The Steering Committee of the UN Special Assembly held a meeting at 7:15 PM today, chaired by the Brazilian representative, Aranha, and invited Arab representatives to participate in the discussion. The Chinese representative, Guo Taiqi, spoke, firmly opposing the demands made by the Arab representatives, and said that he did not believe that Palestinian independence was the only solution to this problem. Only proposals that are beneficial to the countries of the United Nations and the countries concerned can be thoroughly discussed. The UN Assembly should wait until the Fact-Finding Committee submits its report, and then hold a plenary session in September for thorough discussion before passing a resolution. Therefore, I cannot support the Arab representatives' request to include their proposal in the agenda of the Special Assembly.

[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] Guo Taiqi told Chinese reporters today that he believed that this meeting would be limited to discussing the organization of the Palestine Investigation Committee and its terms of reference. Guo continued, saying that many countries' delegations agreed with China's opinion that it was not yet the time for the Assembly to discuss the substance of the Palestine issue, as this kind of issue is extremely complex and requires careful and objective research. Guo said that, as far as China is concerned, the Chinese delegation supports a fair and peaceful solution for both the Jews and Arabs in Palestine, as well as other relevant parties.

### UN Security Council Decides to Publish the Staff Committee Report: Whether an International Police Force Can Be Established Remains to Be Consulted

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 1st Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council today unanimously passed a resolution to publish the first report of its Military Staff Committee on the establishment of an international police force. The publication date is this Saturday, to be seen in newspapers on Sunday. The committee believes that this report is not confidential, so it has decided to make it public.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 1st] According to informed sources, the report of the United Nations Military Staff Committee lists the various differing views of the five major powers on the strength of the future United Nations forces, but because some issues involve political relations, the Security Council will be left to make decisions on these points of disagreement. The five major powers unanimously agree on the necessity of forming an international force, but the Soviet Union believes that each country should determine the amount of its participation in the international force based on the weight of its responsibility, which should be proportional to its military strength. As for the location of the international force, the five major powers have three different views on this: (1) China, Britain, and the United States believe that the international force may be stationed in any place where all countries participating in the international force can legally go; (2) the Soviet Union believes that the stationing location of the international force should be limited to the territories and territorial waters of former enemy countries; (3) France believes that the international force should not only be stationed in former enemy countries and trust territories, but also, through freely established agreements, be stationed within the territories of some United Nations member states. In addition, France also suggested that strategic zones should also be occupied by international forces.

### US Foreign Relief Bill: The House Passes an Amendment, Reducing $350 Million to $200 Million

[United Press, Washington, 30th] The House of Representatives today, by a vote of 333 to 66, passed an amendment to the Foreign Relief Bill, reducing the relief funds from $350 million to $200 million. It has now been sent to the Senate for discussion. The government hopes to restore the original amount. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has unanimously approved the full appropriation of $350 million. The amendment passed by the House stipulates that the countries receiving relief should generally be limited to China, Italy, Greece, Austria, Hungary, and Poland. Any government dominated by the Soviet Union cannot receive relief unless those countries agree to strictly control the relief goods and supervise the actual distribution. $15 million of the relief funds will be used for relief in Trieste and other places. Another $15 million will be allocated to the United Nations Children's Relief Fund. At least 90 percent of the relief goods should be purchased in the United States. Countries that draw compensation from current production are not allowed to receive US relief. American newspapers have the right to report on the distribution of relief goods, without censorship. The administration of relief distribution matters will be managed by an independent foreign relief agency, rather than by the State Department.

### Indian Constituent Assembly Passes Ban on "Untouchability": Guaranteeing Basic Human Rights Is Internal Reform

[United Press, New Delhi, 30th] The Indian Constituent Assembly has just passed provisions in the Constitution of the Indian Union guaranteeing people's freedom of speech and publication, as well as equal opportunities.

[United Press, New Delhi, 30th] The Constituent Assembly yesterday passed a ban on "Untouchability," guaranteeing basic human rights. It stipulates that anyone who practices this doctrine constitutes a criminal offense, and this clause will be recommended for inclusion in the new Indian Constitution. According to recent census results, 49 million Hindus belong to the so-called "Scheduled Classes," those who are prohibited from contact with ordinary believers are included within this and the exact number is unknown. The untouchability doctrine only applies to the lower classes of people who perform extremely menial jobs, such as sanitation workers. They are not allowed to enter ordinary temples. Touching or approaching an Indian of worth is considered disrespectful. It is especially strict in the South, and even "sight" is also prohibited. Some areas stipulate the distance that must be maintained on public streets between them and higher-caste Indians, and they must notify them in advance when approaching. Social and religious privileges cannot be enjoyed. They live in villages, forming their own districts, isolated from the outside world. The majority of them have converted to Christianity or Islam because of the impartiality.

### US Aid to Greece Plan: The Term Should Be Extended to Five Years, Argues the Head of the US Economic Delegation

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] The head of the US Economic Delegation to Greece, Porter, who went to Greece to investigate the country's economic situation, has long suggested a five-year extension to guarantee the country's future. Although Greece has received $700 million worth of foreign aid in the past two years, it still faces many difficulties if it wants to continue to survive. He hopes that the United States will not need to directly assist Greece after the loan expires in June 1948, but can still provide assistance in another way, either by the United States itself or by United Nations agencies. In order to support the morale of the Greek people, I propose that the United States should express its opinion to continue to assist Greece.

As for the United States organizing a committee to be responsible for monitoring the distribution of American aid, I believe that the number of people on this committee should be kept to a minimum. The purchase of goods from abroad by Greece should be the responsibility of the governments of both the United States and Greece, as well as American merchants and Greek importers, under the control of the American government, but the monitoring committee should also obtain broad powers. As for the military committee, it must be completely aligned with the Greek army and the British garrison, and should maintain contact with both the US Army and Navy.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] The head of the US Economic Delegation, Porter, estimated that the five-year plan to revive Greece would require approximately $335 million, and then suggested that other countries could share $140 million, and estimated that maintaining appropriate military equipment alone would cost approximately $180 million next year.

### French Cabinet Faces Another Crisis: Workers' Demands for Pay Raises Cause Division

[United Press, Paris, 30th] France's latent political crisis has now surfaced again. The cabinet discussed the Renault auto factory labor strike problem today, and the five Communist Party cabinet members, failing to support the workers' pay raise demands, angrily walked out of the meeting. A majority of members of parliament expect that the Communist Party will announce its withdrawal from the government at a special cabinet meeting to be held tomorrow night. One member of the Radical Socialist Party said that US President Truman's aid plan for Turkey and Greece has triggered an attempt by the anti-communist faction in France to exclude the Communist Party and form a new government, and a cabinet crisis seems inevitable.

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] Reliable sources say that the Communist Party cabinet members intended to resign from Prime Minister Ramadier's office this morning. After persuasion, they agreed to wait for French President Auriol to return to Paris from French West Africa tomorrow before taking definite action. Official announcement: An emergency cabinet meeting is scheduled to be convened tomorrow evening, presided over personally by the president. It is heard that the reason given by Communist Party leader Thorez for the resignation of the Communist Party cabinet members was only a few words: "The Communist Party has changed its price and wage policy." Prime Minister Ramadier still insists on the official policy of the cabinet, which is to maintain price stability and not allow general wage increases.

### Report on the Moscow Conference Proceedings - Full Text of Marshall's Speech (Continued)

Wide Discrepancy Between US and Soviet Views on German Reparations

The issue of reparations... This issue is of utmost importance, as almost all other issues will be affected by it. The people of several Allied nations who suffered from German occupation and whose homes and cities were ravaged by German troops attach great importance to this issue.

The experience of the Versailles Treaty of 1919, which based reparations on cash payments, and the difficulties encountered by the Reparations Commission after the Yalta Conference in discussing the cash value of reparations in kind, led President Truman and his advisors at the Potsdam Conference to believe that in order to avoid continuous friction and animosity, a different basis for determining reparations must be adopted. As a result of their discussions, they agreed on a principle of reparations, which was to pay reparations from capital assets, that is, to move German factories, machinery, etc. to the Allied nations concerned.

However, at the Moscow Conference, Soviet officials completely disagreed with President Truman and Mr. Byrnes' understanding of the wording of this agreement. On this point, the British opinion was largely the same as that of the United States.

We believe that the original intent of the Potsdam Agreement did not include obtaining reparations from current production. The Soviet Union strongly opposed this view. They believed that the previous Yalta Conference agreement had allowed the Soviet Union to obtain billions of dollars in reparations from current production. This would mean that a portion of the factories in Germany that are constantly producing would continue to pay reparations, which would prolong the period for Germany to restore its self-sufficient economy. The US government had planned to revitalize the German economy within three years and end US economic assistance to the residents of the occupied areas. In this way, the US government's plans and hopes would be shattered.

This is an extremely complex issue. The four powers have expressed their desire to see Germany become an economic whole. We must reach an agreement on this point.

However, there have also been general agreements among the Allied nations, such as reviewing the factories and equipment that can be moved from Germany as part of the reparations. They understand that the result of excessively weakening the German industrial organization will not only make it difficult to achieve Germany's self-sufficiency plan, but also hinder the economic recovery of the entire Europe. Some factories have already been designated for compensation and removal, but current needs require them to remain in Germany. For these types of factories, the United States has indicated its willingness to begin studying the possibility of obtaining limited compensation from current production, but one condition must be established: the payment of compensation from current production must not increase the financial burden of the powers carrying out the occupation tasks, nor delay the repayment of loans granted by the Allied nations to Germany to avoid the collapse of the German economy. The Soviet government has not responded to this proposal. (To be continued)

### Minister Gu Sympathizes with Workers' Demands - Recognizes Index as a Reasonable System - To Convene Labor and Management Representatives from Various Industries Today and Tomorrow to Collect Information - To Provide Central Government with Reference for Decision-Making After Returning to Beijing

[Report from this Newspaper] Minister Gu Zhenggang of the Ministry of Social Affairs visited the financial community in this city yesterday, including Chen Guangfu and Xu Jijing, to solicit opinions from all parties on the unfreezing of the cost-of-living index. Labor and management representatives from various industries will be convened separately today and tomorrow to collect relevant information. According to Mr. Gu's statement to this newspaper's reporter last night: I personally sympathize with the workers' demands for improved treatment. However, when advocating for improving the lives of workers, attention should also be paid to the overall economic situation. Using the cost-of-living index for salary is a reasonable system. The stability of Shanghai's production sector in the past year should be attributed to the adoption of the cost-of-living index. Currently, there are many factors contributing to the economic downturn in industry and commerce, such as outdated machinery, improper management, and excessive interest rates, which cannot be blamed on high wages. In fact, in terms of today's prices in Shanghai, wages cannot be said to be too high. The real issue today is how to improve the productivity of workers. When I was in Beijing, I paid attention to the materials on the living conditions of workers. After arriving in Shanghai, I collected more information from various sources and studied it in detail. After returning to Beijing, I will put forward suggestions for the central government to refer to for decision-making. The implementation of differential subsidies benefits group workers and disadvantages technicians. I recently met with people in the banking industry, and their opinions on whether the index should be unfrozen are quite divided. I believe that the lives of workers must be stable in order to increase production. I hope to stabilize wages by stabilizing prices, otherwise, even if wages increase, workers will not receive real benefits. On the other hand, workers should also understand that the treatment of public school teachers and soldiers at the front is even worse than theirs. They should adopt an attitude of patience, and once the national economy is stable and progressing, the lives of workers will be greatly improved. (The above picture is of Minister Gu, photographed by this newspaper.)

### Annual Meeting of the Textile Society Opens - Zhu Xianfang Delivers a Speech Presenting Three Hopes - Papers to be Read and Topics Discussed Today

The 12th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Textile Society opened yesterday morning at Yiyuan on Fuxing Middle Road. More than 300 members of the society and guests, including Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chief Secretary Xie, and representatives from various bureaus, attended. Zhu Xianfang, Luo Yangzhi, Gao Shiheng, Zhang Jiuqian, Wu Shihhuai, and others served as the presidium. First, Chairman Zhu Xianfang delivered the opening speech, reporting on the society's affairs over the past year, stating briefly: After the victory, the textile industry has gradually come to life with the takeover of textile and dyeing factories of enemy assets throughout the country. In total, there are currently 4.6 million cotton spindles, 480,000 yarn spindles, and 28,000 looms in the country. The takeover portion is large-scale and is operated by the China Textile Construction Company organized by the government. Since its establishment, it has been very profitable and effective. It is hoped that the wise authorities will fulfill their responsibilities and use future profits for the revival and construction of the textile industry. For example, 70-80% of the profits could be used to purchase machinery and equipment, 10-20% to improve raw materials, or to be used for cultivating specialized talents and research funding. It is estimated that fifteen years later, it will be possible to realize the National Father’s proclamation of "providing clothing for the people." In addition, it is hoped (1) to organize a textile industrial zone survey team, select experts, and survey and determine the construction of cotton, wool, silk, and hemp factory areas based on the conditions for establishing factories, so as to avoid the past regret of concentrating in one corner, making procurement and transportation inconvenient. (2) State-owned textile factories should produce more exports and compete in the international market in order to overcome the Japanese textile industry and eliminate its own threat. (3) Manufacture machines suitable for China's environment, and improve work and management techniques. Next, Speaker Pan, Chief Secretary Xie, Shu Yunzhang, and others delivered speeches separately. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. After a group photo was taken, the Textile Management Committee hosted a luncheon. The meeting continued at 3:00 PM to discuss the society's affairs, revise the constitution, and re-elect directors and supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Today, it will continue for one day at the original location. Papers will be read and topics discussed in the morning, and members will give speeches. In the afternoon, visits will be made to the Textile Construction Company, printing and dyeing, wool spinning, and silk factories.

Chairman Jiang Approved Transfer to the Municipal Government for Thorough Investigation - Police Bureau Transfers Case File to the District Prosecutor's Office

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai German National Management Committee was previously secretly reported to Chairman Jiang of the National Government for taking bribes to release German nationals suspected of being pro-enemy.

According to the prices at that time (i.e., the 35th year of the Republic), the value was estimated at more than 50 million yuan. The police bureau ordered an investigation, and it has recently come to an end. The entire file was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling yesterday.

Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan delivered speeches successively amidst the enthusiastic applause of the workers calling for suppressing prices and unfreezing the cost-of-living index. Mayor Wu said: (1) The country needs to be restored and unified, and transportation needs to be restored so that life can be stable. (2) In order to stabilize life, in addition to labor-management cooperation and the government stabilizing prices, workers should also strive to increase production.

### Trial of "Shemale," a Woman Faints - The Drug Portion of the Case Concluded and Sentenced - Four Female Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment Separately - Unanimously Denied Drug Use and Requested Re-examination, Which Was Not Approved

[Report from this Newspaper] The drug portion of the "shemale" case was directly tried in court by the District Court in accordance with the special criminal case litigation procedure at 2:00 PM yesterday. After the debate ended, Judge Shao Renjie announced the verdict in court: "Shen Junru is sentenced to three years of imprisonment for smoking opium and three years of imprisonment for helping others smoke opium. The sentence should be executed for five years, and he is ordered to quit drugs within four months. Zhou Shuzhen is sentenced to two years of imprisonment for smoking opium and two years of imprisonment for helping others smoke opium. The sentence should be executed for three years, and she is ordered to quit drugs within four months. Wu Fan Yanheng and Wang Ding Baoshu are each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for smoking opium. Xu Aqiao and Zhang Xiuzhen are acquitted and each pays a written guarantee of 2 million yuan." The requests for bail from the first, second, third, and fourth defendants were rejected, and they were still returned to custody. The portion of the case involving obscenity will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The decision on whether or not to hear the case will be made after the disposition.

The "shemale" case has attracted close attention from the society since it was announced by the police bureau. The District Court decided to hear the case especially early yesterday morning. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Judge Shao of the Second Criminal Court took the seat and signed for the six defendants, including Shen Junru, to be brought to court. After the roll call, the two maids were questioned first. According to Zhang Xiuzhen: 44 years old, from Suzhou. She came to work at Shen's house (Wu Fan Yanheng's house) through the introduction of a maid in Chen's house on February 26th of this year. She is in charge of rough work such as washing and cooking and does not enter the room. Therefore, she has no way of knowing whether the owner has smoked opium.

According to Xu Aqiao: 24 years old, from Changshu. She has only been in Shen's house for more than a month and is in charge of cleaning the room. Xu also denied that the owner smoked opium. The court then questioned Ding Baoshu. According to the testimony: He is from Shandong, 47 years old. He moved to Shen's house because of a family dispute in Zhou Shuzhen's house. He heard that he was not feeling well, so he went to visit him. He met Shen Junru in a friend's house before the war and is not very friendly. He smoked opium five or six years ago, but he has already quit. When the police bureau came to search, he was in the living room. The court continued to question, according to the police report, opium was found in your handbag. Since you don't smoke, what do you need this drug for? He stammered and replied: "I never hid opium in my handbag. I don't know what's going on."

Hiding Her Face with a Handkerchief to Avoid Photography

At that time, a photographer pulled out a camera and aimed the lens, intending to take pictures of the four defendants. Ding and Zhou, etc., were standing in the defendant's bar and could not escape, so they quickly covered their faces with handkerchiefs and were very shy. Only the "shemale" Shen Junru was fearless.

Judge Shao then questioned Wu Fan Yanheng. According to the testimony, he had previously smoked opium because he had kidney disease and high blood pressure. He no longer smokes now. He does not go to Shen's house every day. He also does not know whether Shen Junru and others smoke opium. Fan was wearing a blue silk cheongsam and a black coat, and looked haggard. He often stroked his head with his right hand during the trial. Zhou Shuzhen was questioned again. According to the testimony: She is from Nanjing, 48 years old. She smoked opium in Chongqing because she had bronchitis, but she stopped smoking after coming to Shanghai. The court took out opium lamps, opium pipes, and other items. Zhou said: These smoking utensils are all mine. I used them before, but I have put them aside. He pointed to the opium lamp and said: This is an "air raid lamp" for boiling water. He left home due to a family dispute and is temporarily living with Shen Junru. Ding and Fan are all friends who came to visit me. Judge Shao then began questioning the "shemale." Shen Junru had changed into women's clothing, wearing a blue Shilin cloth cheongsam and a black coat. He was thin and tall, with his hair parted on the left and right, in a male style. He testified: He tried smoking opium ten years ago because he suffered from high blood pressure, but he has long since quit. Zhou Shuzhen is a friend of mine, and she came to live with me after leaving home. He only rented the house at Elizabeth Apartments for two months. He used to live in Wu Fan Yanheng's house at 73 Sofa Garden. It is a false accusation to say that I smoke opium.

Wu Fan Yanheng Faints in Court

Judge Shao instructed: According to the forensic examination, all four of you have slight signs of drug use. The pills and medicines seized also contain opium ingredients, which proves that smoking opium is a fact. He also announced the start of the debate. At that time, Wu Fan Yanheng suddenly fell out of the defendant's bar and fainted on the ground. Judge Shao ordered the bailiff to help him up and immediately summoned a forensic doctor to the court to treat him. Seeing that his pulse was still normal, he was allowed to sit down and continue the interrogation. There were many family members of the defendants in the audience. After Wu Fan Yanheng fainted, there was a commotion in the audience. Fan's family also called a doctor, intending to inject Fan with morphine to relieve the pain, but was reprimanded by Judge Shao. Six defense lawyers for the defendants all argued that although the defendants held smoking utensils and the forensic doctor found slight signs of drug use, it was still insufficient to determine that the defendants had committed the crime of smoking opium. They requested a re-examination and applied for bail. All were not approved by the court.

### Yingshi University Relocation Movement; Student Representatives Petition Minister Zhu; All Professors Have Offered Positive Support

[Our Newspaper, Jinhua Special Dispatch] Yingshi University has recently fallen into an atmosphere of unease and anxiety due to the issue of its location. In recent days, slogans have been posted everywhere on campus, and meetings have been held everywhere. All members of the university are unanimously demanding to move away from Jinhua. The factual background is as follows:

The university was established during the war and wandered around Yunhe Xiaoshun and Taishun Liguang in southern Zhejiang. For several years, there was no equipment and it was difficult to form a scale. When Chen Lifu was the Minister of Education, the Executive Yuan passed a resolution that the university should be relocated to Shanghai and Wuxing after the war, one to commemorate the martyrdom of Mr. Yingshi and the other to make up for the university's congenital deficiencies. Therefore, as soon as victory arrived two months later, the university took the lead in moving to Wenzhou to reorganize and receive orders for recovery. Later, in order to adjust the national education program, the Ministry of Education suddenly changed the location of Yingshi University to Jinhua in eastern Zhejiang. Last year, there were many accidents on campus and the situation was not stabilized. The university hurriedly moved to Jinhua. Unexpectedly, after arriving, all that was seen was dilapidated tiles and broken walls, and there was no school building to settle in. Later, although the university spent a lot of money to requisition and repair all the broken temples, ancestral halls, temples, and prisons in Jinhua to provide temporary use, it was difficult to accommodate everyone due to the narrow space. Moreover, after the destruction of the various wars in eastern Zhejiang, the local culture has been generally devastated. All bookstores, sports fields, and even entertainment venues are simple and pitiful. All teachers and students of the university have no place to go outside of class and reading, and there is nowhere to go. Therefore, three months ago, all teachers and students of the university jointly held a general opinion test on the issue of relocation. The result was that 97% of the people advocated relocation. President Yang Gongda promised to go to Nanjing to discuss with the Ministry of Education. At the end of February of this year, he set off, but after two months, not only was nothing accomplished, but President Yang himself was also granted permission to resign due to an asthma attack. All teachers and students of the university were shocked by the news, so on the 25th of last month (April), the student unions of the four colleges of Arts, Science, Law, Agriculture, and Engineering jointly established the "Relocation Movement Committee," and all professors offered positive support, sending a telegram to the Ministry of Education, requesting understanding of the current situation of Yingshi University and relocating it away from Jinhua. Unexpectedly, during this period, Acting President Zhou Shang also resigned from his position as "unable to bear the burden," which left the school in a state of leaderlessness, causing panic among teachers and students. Meetings have been convened everywhere in recent days to discuss the aftermath, and normal classes have been affected as a result. The students all hope that the two issues of the location and the president can be resolved at the same time as soon as possible to avoid escalation of the situation.

It is reported that eight student representatives from various colleges of the university took a car to Hangzhou on the 28th of last month (April), specifically to visit Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education and request a solution to the location and president issues.

### Datia Prepares for School Anniversary

Chairman Sun Zhesheng Will Return to School to Preside

June 1st of this year is the 23rd anniversary of the founding of Datia University. The school authorities have appointed Wu Haoran, Shao Jialin, Su Xishi, Tao Yuchuan, Han Zhongqi, Song Chengzhi, and Wang Yuanxin as members of the school anniversary preparation committee. It is reported that it has been decided to hold a grand celebration for two days, and the program is arranged as follows: The first day (June 1st), a memorial ceremony will be held in the morning, and the men's and women's dormitories will be open and cleaned. Various halls and the College of Science and Engineering will open or hold exhibitions. In the afternoon, there will be track and field competitions, and in the evening, there will be recreational performances and dramas.

### The National Assembly Will Discuss the Issue of Abolishing National Textbooks; The Seven-Organization Joint Office is Worried About Expired Books

The future of the national textbooks is becoming increasingly bleak. Recently, the new curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools have been revised by the Ministry of Education and are expected to be officially announced before the summer. The national textbooks compiled in accordance with the old standards will soon become obsolete. It is also learned that the National Assembly will hold a general meeting on May 20th, at which the retention or abolition of the national textbooks will be a topic of heated debate. Educational figures generally predict that the Ministry of Education will have to abandon its established opinion of maintaining the national system in accordance with the public opinion of democratic politics. The decree on opening copyrights may be changed as a result, and a textbook review method may be adopted instead. At this time of change in administrative regulations, the publishing industry is hesitant to move forward. It is reported that the Seven-Organization Joint Office is also worried about the expiration of the books. Due to printing delays, there were many books in stock this spring, and the Ministry of Education was requested to purchase all the books in stock in accordance with the previous agreement terms and Minister Zhu's promise to reduce losses. If this matter does not have a satisfactory result, in addition to resorting to law and public opinion, the Seven-Organization Joint Office plans to auction off the books scattered across the country at a low price in advance to avoid excessive temporary losses.

### Youth-White Iron Union Army Will Fight on Star Island Today; Game Starts at 5:00 PM Unless it Rains

The Hong Kong Star Island soccer team has come to Shanghai to observe soccer skills. They have already played two games in Shanghai. In the first game, they drew 0-0 with the Korean Seoul team, and in the game against the Jews the other day, they won 8-1. The third game against Youth-White was originally scheduled to be held yesterday, but due to some reasons, the Football Committee changed it to today at 5:00 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium. However, due to the incessant rain yesterday, whether the game can be held today will be decided at 11:00 AM this morning. Fans can listen to the report from Shanghai Radio Station at 12:00 noon.

If it is possible to hold the game today, tickets will go on sale at 1:00 PM, and the gate of Yiyuan will open at the same time. Tickets are still sold for 5,000 and 8,000 yuan. The game will be held at 5:00 PM.

Because many players in the Youth-White team are injured, it will be difficult to form a complete team at that time. With the consent of the Sports Association, it was decided to send the Youth-White Iron Union Army. The lineup of Star Island and the list of the Youth-White Iron Union Army have already been announced yesterday, and are recorded below:

Youth-White Iron Union Army Zhang Qu

Yue Renxiao Yan Shixin Wu Qixiang

Xue Peiran Zhai Shuifu Gao Baozheng Zhang Lingen

Li Zhuang Luo Shoufu Xiao Ziwen Li Yichen Gu Yisa Lu Qingxiang Fei Chunhua

Star Island Team

Yu Yaode

Liu Tianshen Hou Rongsheng

Feng Kunsheng Song Sheng Liu Songsheng

Cao Qiuting Li Zhaorong Zhang Jinhai Zou Wenzhi He Yingfen

(New Blood) Zhu Yongqiang Tan Jiangbai

The Union Army, since being formed by the joint efforts of Youth-White and the Railway, has been well-equipped. However, Meng Yiliang injured his foot inadvertently in a small soccer game the other day, so it will be difficult for him to play today, so Gao Baozheng was replaced as the central defender. Zhang Qu will be the goalkeeper, and Wu Yan, a pair of iron gates, can be called the most ideal in Shanghai. Zhang Lingen and Afu will serve as the forwards. Baozheng's central defender won unanimous praise for his dead-on ordering of Li Zhaorong last year. He will definitely perform even better today.

Star Island Captain Xu Jingcheng injured his ankle in the last game against the Jews, so the lineup has been slightly changed today, but the strength is still very strong. When he meets Youth-White one day, it is expected that there will be many wonderful scenes.

### College Games; More Than Ten Schools Participate

The conference program and athlete number cloths will be distributed at the conference room of the gymnasium at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. It is hoped that representatives from each participating school will be sent to collect them at that time.

### Government Continues to Sell Rice; Purchases Limited by Household Registration Certificate

Mayor Wu Talks with Rice Merchants to Suppress Grain Prices

[Our Report] After attending the National Price Conference in Nanjing, Mayor Wu returned to the city and met with reporters yesterday morning, stating: The government has decided to continue ordering 140,000 tons of foreign rice to replenish rice supplies. The price difference between rice in this city and the Wuxi production area has also been set at 20% by the Price Conference. The Jiangsu Provincial Government convened a meeting of county magistrates in Zhenjiang on the 1st to discuss suppressing rice prices in the production area. This move will have a significant impact on this city.

At 11:00 AM yesterday, Mayor Wu convened a meeting with rice merchant representatives Xu Songren, Cha Baosan, Gu Yisheng, Hu Wenan, Zhai Zhenhua, Zhang Xichao, Hu Hangang, and others at the municipal government. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau also attended. The rice merchant representatives recounted the recent rise in rice prices in the Su-Xi production area, and the difficulty of procurement by the city's grain merchants, which greatly affected the city's grain supply. Although the city government sells 9,000 bags of rice daily, totaling more than 11,000 piculs, many rice shops in the city have no goods to sell. The reasons for this are nothing more than the general public's rush to purchase and store rice, and the profiteering of scalpers. Mayor Wu and Director Wu decided that, starting today, the following temporary restrictions will be placed on the purchase of government-sold rice by citizens of this city:

Regulations for Purchasing Rice with Certificates

(1) Citizens of each district should bring their household registration certificates to purchase rice from rice shops within their district. The rice shop will stamp the date on the back of the household registration certificate and keep a detailed record of the purchasing citizen's district, baojia, and name for verification.

(2) Each person is limited to one dou per purchase. Each household is limited to a maximum of five dou per purchase. Rice can be purchased once every half month with a household registration certificate.

(3) The retail price of white rice is 16,800 yuan per dou, red glutinous rice is 13,200 yuan per dou, Saigon rice is 12,500 yuan per dou, and Siamese rice is 16,800 yuan per dou.

Retail Price of White Rice Limited to 200,000 Yuan

The rice merchant representatives also stated the difficulties of transportation and requested consideration for their hardships, allowing a wider margin for the price of rice transported to Shanghai by merchants. The mayor instructed that the maximum retail price of white rice sold by merchants themselves should be temporarily limited to 200,000 yuan per picul. The government must sell rice according to the above methods and price limits, and must not adulterate or degrade the quality.

Black Market White Rice Reaches 240,000

Rice prices continue to rise due to the influence of the production area. The black market price of white rice reached 240,000 yuan, and white glutinous rice exceeded 260,000 yuan. Goods are completely unavailable in the Nanshi market, and only 726.5 piculs arrived in the Beishi market. Transactions could not be conducted, and the market quotation list became a blank sheet of paper. The Social Affairs Bureau still sold 9,000 bags of white rice and Siamese glutinous rice.

70,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Arrive

According to news from the Central Trust Bureau: The foreign rice ordered by this bureau from abroad is based on the quota of the International Emergency Food Council and was originally 240,000 tons, of which 30,000 tons were allocated for other uses, totaling 210,000 tons, ordered from Siam, Vietnam, and other places. From January to April of this year, 70,000 tons have already arrived, and 140,000 tons are still awaiting transport. It is decided that all of them will be transported in before the end of June of this year. 70,000 tons will arrive this month, including 30,000 tons of Siamese rice. There will be no problem with the supply of rice in June, July, and August of this year.

Rice Shops Raising Prices Detained for Three Days

Recently, rice prices have repeatedly soared, due to the machinations of rice parasites. Therefore, in addition to doing their best to clear the sources and stepping up the sale of rice, the relevant authorities are determined to severely punish illegal rice maggots. In the past week, many cases of illegal rice shops raising prices or hoarding rice have been investigated and dealt with. It is learned that the Yimiao Police Station of this city received a tip from citizens yesterday that the Tongxin Rice Shop at No. 116 Luxiangyuan Road, Nanshi, was raising rice prices without authorization, selling it at a high price of 190,000 yuan per picul. Furthermore, the Taifeng Rice Shop at No. 77 on the same road was exploiting the poor by charging a retail price of 2,000 yuan per liter, seeking illegal private gain. The police station sent police to investigate and found it to be true, and immediately detained the owners of the two rice shops, detaining them for three days as a warning. The stored rice is monitored by personnel from the police station and sold at the limited price.

### Unified Bonds Slightly Weak

Government bonds were slightly weaker yesterday. The opening price of Unified Bond C in the morning was 16,200 yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Buying Spree

The buying frenzy of foreign stocks was even more intense yesterday. Ewo Yarns soared from a low price of 61,500 yuan in the early morning. It ended in the afternoon at a high price of 67,000 yuan. The Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraph reported news of contraction, and the black market was rampant. Securities firms first sold and then bought, and the Guangdong and Northern gangs competed to buy. Retail buying also showed signs of activity. Steel and British-American Tobacco were the most popular. As a result, compared with the previous close, steel rose by 25%, British-American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, Wheelock Marden, Paper Industries, Ewo Brewery, and Kailan Mining all rose by 15%, and the remaining stocks also rose by about 10%.

### Chinese Stocks Remarkably Scarce; Successive Rises Reached Limits

Chinese stocks were stable then strong yesterday. During the switching of contracts, some instability was inevitable, but in the end, foreign stocks were stimulated by the Hong Kong exchange rate and rose sharply, and rising prices also affected people's hearts, leading to a buying frenzy. The number of stocks reaching their limit was remarkably scarce, reaching 80-90%.

The morning opening saw China General Edison and Wah Feng flat, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco and Wing On Yarns showing slight increases, China Silk and New China reaching their limit. Wing On Yarns was immediately subject to arbitrage sales by banks and fell to 5,400 yuan. Numbers 107, 153, 226, and 97 came in to buy, and New Asia reached its limit, rising to 5,500 yuan.

Near noon, delivered Wing On Yarns ended outside 5,700 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Wing On Yarns, China General Edison, Wing On Company, King Fook, and Keen Hing each rose by a strong 50%, Wah Feng rose by a weak 50%, New Kwong rose slightly, China-France was slightly lower, and New China and American Asiatic reached their limit. Only half a day of trading took place on delivered contracts the day before yesterday, so the increase was greater.

For example, Match Factory, China Silk, New China, American Asiatic, New Asia, and Dah Chong successively turned red. Numbers 131, 102, 142, 215, 154, 133, 199, 95, 232, 183, 223, 152, 153, 14, 13, 185, 35, 112, and 129 jointly bought, gradually pushing up the price. Keen Hing, Wing On Company, Commercial Press, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco, New Kwong, King Fook, King Lun, Cement, Wah Feng, Existing Wing On Yarns all announced that they had reached their limit. Delivered Wing On Yarns also reached its limit near closing. Numbers 117 and 94 competed to sell with great effort, and it closed slightly flat. As a result, compared with the previous close, Wing On Yarns, China General Edison, American Asiatic, New Kwong, King Fook, Keen Hing, Wing On Company, and New China reached their limit, Wah Feng rose by 10%, and China-France rose by 50%. For delivered contracts, Wing On Yarns rose to its limit and then retreated slightly, American Asiatic, New Kwong, Wah Feng, Wing On Company, King Fook, and Keen Hing reached their limit, China General Edison rose to its limit and then retreated slightly. Among the cold stocks, China Textile, Tung Yi, Dah Chong, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco, China Silk, Match Factory, King Lun, Cement, Nine Luck, New Asia, and Wing On Enterprise all reached their limit. Five Harmony and Wing Fung each rose by about 50%. All stocks outside the market were even more popular, each rising by more than 10%.

Arbitrage Lively

The difference in arbitrage transactions for existing and delivered contracts was quite large yesterday. The switching of contracts for Wing On Yarns started from 240 yuan and rose all the way to 290 yuan. The bulls included Numbers 223 and 154. They rushed to post, and the combined daily interest rate reached about 2 jiao and 1 fen. The banks then came in to post, and it quickly fell back, retreating to 200 yuan near noon, with the combined daily interest rate between 1 jiao and 4.5 fen. China General Edison had a low price of 100 yuan, a high price of 160 yuan, and a final price of 120 yuan. American Asiatic rose from 1,400 to 1,500, with a final price of around 1,200. The interest rates for various small stocks ranged from 6 yuan to 10 yuan. The combined daily interest rate ranged from 1 jiao and 6 fen to 2.5 jiao.

New Kwong Shows Its Colors

Also, according to news, in the morning session yesterday, it happened to be the switching of contracts. "Red Kwong" closed at one jade and seven, and "White Kwong" closed at 148. At the beginning of the afternoon session, it was rumored on the market that the North China Exchange would open. "New Kwong" also appeared. In addition, with the positive news in the political and economic aspects, the factory contacted the bank to heavily buy in, the amount of securities was increased, and there was enthusiastic buying after the switching of contracts. The chips suddenly felt exhausted, and the market price soared. Red and white successively reached their limits, and the future is still considered promising.

### Hong Kong Stock Market Stands Out

[United Press, Hong Kong, 1st] Due to the concentration of a large amount of floating capital, the completion of some real estate transactions, and the increase in dividends, the Hong Kong stock market was booming today. The Hong Kong government is drafting legislation to lift restrictions on the transfer of stocks. Since the announcement of the above news, the market expects stocks to be even more popular. Some stocks have risen by 25% in April. The market believes that many companies have developed their business and their real value is above the nominal value of the shares, so they are unanimously bullish on stocks.

### Edible Oil Slightly Retreats; Grain Prices Rise Step by Step; Foreign Vermicelli Called for 140,000 Yuan

Shenji soybean cake is 59,500 yuan, up 4,500 yuan. Changzi soybean cake is 60,500 yuan, up 4,500 yuan.

[Another Report] The Qingdao goods in the oil market saw 6,000 to 7,000 dan arrive, and the rise stopped and turned down, suddenly softening. Crude oil fell back by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, and soybean oil fell back by 10,000 yuan, trending towards large increases and small retreats.

### China Textile Construction Allots Cotton Yarn; Four Provisional Measures Set; Sales Scheduled Three Times a Week

[Our Report] In order to regulate the supply of cotton yarn, the China Textile Construction Company will allot cotton yarn starting from May 1st, and will temporarily handle it according to the following four measures:

(1) The monthly allotment of cotton yarn to various manufacturers will be based on the number of machines actually started as reported by each manufacturer on the registration card, taking into account the current possible supply of yarn, and setting the maximum monthly yarn purchase limit for each user. Each time, the quota will be determined separately by grade. After the limit is reached, the allotment will be stopped, and will be continued at the beginning of the next month.

(2) Cotton yarn will be allotted three times a week. Manufacturers in various industries may submit purchase requests according to the following three provisions: (A) Monday: Dyeing and weaving industry grades A, B, C, D, E, and F, knitting industry electric socks grades A, B, and C, electric weaving grades B, C, D, and E, underwear industry grades A, B, and C, towel and bed sheet group. (B) Wednesday: Knitting handkerchief industry grades D, E, and F, underwear industry grades C, D, and E, canvas industry, towel and bed sheet industry towel group, handkerchief industry, yarn count, and other industry associations. (C) Friday: Dyeing and weaving industry grades A, B, C, and D, wooden yarn, mercerized yarn, knitting industry electric socks grades A, B, C, and D, hand weaving grades B, C, D, and E, bed sheet group.

(3) The production of cotton yarn is currently limited. The number of newly added or newly started machines will not be allotted yarn for the time being, and will be allotted when the production of cotton yarn increases.

(4) Starting from the 5th, manufacturers should obtain a work status form from the investigation department of the company, fill it out in detail, and return it to the investigation department before the 20th of this month for reference in future allotments. If any false information is filled in, once discovered, appropriate action will be taken depending on the severity of the circumstances.

### Cotton Cloth Re-export Issue; Development Expected Soon

Since the Executive Yuan announced measures to stabilize yarn and cloth market prices and balance supply, the re-export of yarn and cloth in this city has been suspended. The dyeing and weaving and cotton cloth industries have repeatedly submitted requests to the Textile Control Commission, requesting that both production capacity and the difficulties of commercial transport be taken into account. Yesterday morning (May 1st), in addition to telegraphing President Zhang to inform the Textile Control Commission to adopt the opinions of the industry and make comprehensive and proper arrangements, the persons in charge of the two associations also met with Mayor Wu, requesting that he, in his position as concurrently the chairman of the Textile Control Commission, take into consideration the livelihood of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises in this city. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Mayor Wu also invited Pan Shihao to discuss the matter, and inquired extensively about the true situation of the market and the re-export situation. He also expressed that he would, within the scope of implementing the central government's policies, accommodate the opinions of the industry associations as much as possible. He agreed to consider the two points of limited quota allocation and reduction, and limited categories. Pan also went to the business office of the Textile Control Commission for a cordial discussion. It is heard that there may be a meeting in the next two days to discuss the matter together. More than 2,000 companies in the dyeing and weaving and cotton cloth industries are currently worried about the seriousness of this issue. However, according to Pan, Mayor Wu will definitely make proper arrangements. The current state of stagnation is expected to return to normal soon.

### Unified Import Management Measures; Temporary Measures in South China Canceled

[Our Report] The Executive Committee of the Temporary Import Management Committee held its 30th regular meeting on April 29th. Director Mai Zuoheng of the Guangdong District Office came to Shanghai to attend. According to the report, the current status of issuing import permits in the district is as follows:

(A) The temporary permits issued by the Guangzhou District Office are generally settled with foreign exchange sold by designated banks. The temporary permits issued by the Kowloon Branch Office and the Gongbei Customs do not settle foreign exchange.

(B) There are 342 registered and qualified importers with Schedule (2), and 551 with Schedule (3) A.

(C) For food and fertilizer, 6,000 Hong Kong dollars may be applied for each time. For building materials and paper, 4,000 Hong Kong dollars may be applied for each time. For goods in Schedule (3) A, each company may apply for a maximum of 2,000 Hong Kong dollars per day. For goods in Schedule (2), the application per company per week must not exceed 12,000 Hong Kong dollars.

(D) The import locations for permits issued in Kowloon are Guangzhou, Wuzhou, Jiangmen, Zhanjiang, Beihai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou. The permits issued by the Gongbei Customs are limited to the use of the Gongbei Customs only.

The above situation is the temporary measure implemented in South China. Because Hong Kong and Guangdong are separated by water, the situation is special. When the government announced the revised trade measures, in order to avoid a complete standstill of trade, the above temporary measures were taken. Now, after repeated discussions by the Executive Committee, it is believed that the South China region should also be handled in accordance with national measures to ensure uniformity. Director Mai is currently in consultation with the Quota Allocation Department and the Non-Quota Review Department to discuss practical measures. Once the arrangements are in place, the aforementioned temporary measures will be canceled immediately.

### Piece Goods and Dyed Yarn Shipped to Guangzhou

[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyue ship sailed south yesterday, loaded with a large batch of yarn and cloth, totaling 3,120 pieces of piece goods and 820 pieces of cotton shirts, destined for Guangzhou. It is heard that after the export of yarn and cloth, permission must be obtained from the Cotton Textile Products Management Committee before customs declaration and shipment can be carried out.

### Cotton Cloth Market Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions saw a gradual decrease in supply to customer locations after the export of yarn and cloth was restricted. The price difference with the Shanghai market was significant, so customer groups were buying in bulk. Market quotations continued to rise. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose from 273,000-274,000 yuan to 283,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 13,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Five Happiness fine cloth also rose to 275,000 yuan, an increase of 17,000 yuan. The remaining brands all rose from 5,000-6,000 yuan to more than 10,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen yuan serge and Gold Seal rose from 250,000 yuan to 255,000 yuan. Northern cotton cloth is more than 40,000 yuan higher than the Shanghai market, so northern merchants are very active in purchasing. China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual. The price of 20-count extra-fine cloth increased to 200,300 yuan, and unbranded Caiqiu fine cloth was 218,000 yuan, limited to manufacturers' purchases.

### Stimulated by High Prices, Newsprint Rises

[Our Report] The newsprint market firmed up yesterday as the prices of various goods rose. Victor Hsiang Company newsprint was 175,000 yuan per ream, up 5,000 yuan. Canadian newsprint was 171,000 yuan, up 6,000 yuan. Soviet Wangzi newspaper was 168,000 yuan, up 8,000 yuan, and full-size newspaper was 165,000 to 168,000 yuan. It is reported that the highest grade newsprint once reached 190,000 yuan on the 24th and 25th of last month. However, most of it was quoted price, and transactions were rare, so it gradually weakened again from the 26th. People in the industry said: After all, newspapers are different from yarn and cloth, and it is not easy to sell them off when the market is sluggish. The fundamental reasons for this gradual rise are the small domestic production and the small foreign supply. However, the recent reason is actually the stimulation of the general rise in prices.

### Tea Market Still Lacking Improvement

The foreign-owned tea market, which has been weak for a long time, still felt unable to recover yesterday. The reason is that buyers continue to stand by and watch, and people's hearts are difficult to stir up. Various domestic sales teas are still inquired about by people in this street and nearby villages, and the market is still not deserted. However, as colleagues do prices with each other, the prices in and out are similar, so there is little difference. The 35th year's Bai Lin black tea, which has dried up its inventory, is about to run out after the Yingkou merchants suddenly became active in purchasing. Therefore, although there is still demand in that area, transactions have stopped.

### The Importance of Tuberculosis Prevention

— Fan Shouyuan

In the realm of modern medicine, there remain three major ailments for which there are no fundamental cures: (1) leprosy, (2) cancer, and (3) tuberculosis. Thus, these three illnesses are universally recognized as formidable adversaries to human health and life. Among them, tuberculosis is particularly widespread and deeply rooted in its harmful effects. This is because the opportunities for transmission are exceptionally numerous, and in terms of treatment, not only are there no definitive solutions, causing doctors to shake their heads and frown, but also, dealing with this disease has a close relationship with an individual’s profession and finances. There are countless instances of tuberculosis patients missing the opportunity for treatment due to professional constraints and economic pressures.

Because of the various difficulties in treating tuberculosis, everyone is paying attention to and emphasizing "prevention." Originally, the value of "prevention" in modern medicine is universally acknowledged, and it is especially significant for tuberculosis. Everyone knows the harm that tuberculosis causes to humans, but it is not impossible to reduce its harm and scope through human preventive measures. We see that in European and American countries, tuberculosis and various similar infectious diseases are gradually decreasing! This is due to the progress of their science, the development of sanitation, and the effectiveness of diligent prevention efforts. Looking back at our China, all diseases—especially infectious diseases like tuberculosis—seem to be spreading and rampant everywhere; the reasons are certainly complex, but the main reasons are nothing more than the backwardness of science, the immaturity of sanitation, and the lack of attention and effort in prevention work. Alas, looking at others and looking at ourselves, we truly feel ashamed and even more heartbroken!

Now that we know that the effectiveness of "prevention" is so important in the rise and fall of tuberculosis, how should we pay attention to and emphasize this crucial tuberculosis prevention work?

Since the importance of tuberculosis prevention is as described above, what is the meaning of its work? The meaning of its work can be summarized into two points:

(1) For healthy individuals who have not contracted the disease, find ways to prevent transmission and avoid becoming ill.

(2) For patients who have already contracted the disease, find ways to prevent mild cases from becoming severe and severe cases from becoming critical; at the same time, find ways to prevent them from infecting healthy people.

How can we make this crucial tuberculosis prevention work effective? The first is "publicity work." So-called publicity means awakening the general public's attention to and understanding of tuberculosis; making them aware of the dangers of tuberculosis and understand the importance of "tuberculosis prevention."

Tuberculosis is extremely prevalent in China, spreading everywhere, which is an undeniable fact. The reason why it has become so widespread and allowed to spread so rampantly is due to the people's lack of hygiene, which is also well known. But if we ask why the people do not practice hygiene, in other words, what is the reason why they do not practice hygiene? We must say that it is because of the people's lack of knowledge—especially the lack of hygiene knowledge! Because of the lack of hygiene knowledge, they cannot understand that practicing hygiene can improve health, avoid disease, and prolong life; and that unhygienic practices can harm health, attract disease, and shorten life. Because of the lack of hygiene knowledge, they do not know that sputum often contains many tuberculosis bacteria that can kill. They know to avoid being killed by a knife, but they do not realize that sputum can kill. The fundamental reason is still because they do not know that a knife can kill, and sputum can also kill, right?

Therefore, I say: to make this tuberculosis prevention work effective, the first step is publicity. Whether it is direct lectures, oral publicity, or indirect written publicity, all can exert the publicity effect of tuberculosis prevention and achieve the working effect of tuberculosis prevention. We should come up with various methods to spread all kinds of knowledge about tuberculosis to the public, either with pleasant language or with popular and vivid writing, so that they understand the dangers of tuberculosis and know the importance of tuberculosis prevention. For example, if they thoroughly understand that sputum can transmit tuberculosis, how difficult it is to cure tuberculosis, and how it endangers life, they will gradually change the bad habit of spitting everywhere. They know how tuberculosis is transmitted, so they will pay attention to the implementation of prevention in peacetime before getting sick. Knowing that tuberculosis patients have difficulty in curing, especially the hopelessness of late-stage treatment, they will pay attention to early medical treatment. This is the highest goal of tuberculosis prevention. If tuberculosis prevention work can achieve this stage, it will be a great success of "tuberculosis prevention"!

### Suggestions on the Chinese Naming of BCG

— Liu Yongchun

BCG was first used for human inoculation in France in 1921. Seven years later (in the 17th year of the Republic of China), the Health Construction Commission of the Nanjing National Government proposed manufacturing this vaccine to prevent tuberculosis. Although there have been occasional famous figures in the medical field, such as Mr. Song Guobin, who have continued to respond, it has not yet attracted the attention of the Chinese people. Now that scholars from various countries have proven its excellent results, the Chinese medical community has also praised BCG; and the health authorities are planning to promote it on a large scale, which is truly good news for tuberculosis prevention and is gratifying! The author believes that since this vaccine will be widely used, its Chinese naming must be standardized. The matter of translation is extremely difficult; it can be translated phonetically, semantically, or both. My humble opinion is that directly calling BCG "Tuberculosis Prevention Vaccine" is too broad. Perhaps it can be named "Bixi Liao" by translating both phonetically and semantically; however, the drawback is that it sounds like a proprietary medicine. Is this appropriate? I hope my colleagues can provide further guidance.

### The Mystery of the New Chinese Medicine (End)

— Hong Guanzhi

For example, the phenomenon of nerve reflexes and the reaction of blood cell agglutination are both manifestations of "matter." If we do not understand the principles of all "reflexes" and "agglutination" first, we will naturally think that this phenomenon is a mysterious life force, a supra-material thing. Therefore, even the action of bacteria is regarded as supra-material and attributed to the Six Evils, resulting in nonsensical talk loaded with ghosts. Even now, we still cling to dead bones and feel complacent, which is truly lamentable! Looking at his article, he also quoted a passage from the Japanese Kojima Sakai, saying: "No one can guarantee that medical laws are absolutely correct. Even Newton's laws of mechanics have been modified by Einstein's theory of relativity. Medical laws are no exception and must be thoroughly examined." Then, Mr. Mou made a grand statement, saying: "Since all the theorems and creeds of today cannot be fully believed, the only thing we can rely on is the facts of experience. Therefore, today's Chinese medicine should not blindly agree with Western medicine and be done with it, just because it is a valuable fact. We must know that the theories of Western medicine are constantly progressing and being revised. Can we also follow along every day and be a backward old doctor for the rest of our lives?" Haha! I think Mr. Mou's statement is really stubborn to the point of being astonishing. It turns out that Mr. Mou wants Chinese medicine to always stay in one place and not progress, or that knowledge that is "constantly progressing and being revised" is not worthy of our imitation. Therefore, we have to find a new path and can only seek from the experience of the dead. This path is indeed a good place to go and can lead to a good ending. (To be honest, it is a dead end.) The treatment records of Chinese medicine are not worthy of being called "empirical." I have already said this in the previous article, and in the literature of Chinese medicine, no matter how great your ability, it is impossible to dig out valuable treasures. I do not know how many people have tried this work, and the result is nothing. It used to be said: "Looking at it for seven days, chaos remains the same," it is just wasting effort. Digging and digging can only dig out a pile of skulls (contradictions and unreliable results). Other than that, there is nothing at all. Mr. Mou said that the method of communication in Mr. Ye Juchuan's "Collection of National Medicine Prescriptions" is not good. Although this method is not a proper solution and does not contribute much to the unification of Chinese and Western medicine, his thinking is always correct. He wants to unite Chinese and Western medicine, to put Chinese medicine on the track of science, not to separate and confront Chinese and Western medicine. So no matter what the outcome, their starting point is always correct. Unlike Mr. Mou, who harbors an ambition to find ways to make "Chinese medicine" permanently independent and immortal, and to add a "scientific" coat borrowed from a corpse to decorate and be done with it! In addition, Mr. Mou also cited many examples of "absorbing foreign culture, integrating it, and forming its own system" to show that Chinese culture has the ability of "broad and profound digestion." He should know that the exchange and integration of foreign culture is also limited to a certain part. Its ideological nature must be similar and in the same era to be possible. If you want to crossbreed the "empty" "metaphysical theory" with the "empirical" "science" to produce a good new species, it is an impossible thing, as ridiculous as an ordinary person dreaming of marrying a goddess of the ninth heaven. With such an unreasonable person, also talking about "science" and "historical process," how can it not be chilling? I really did not expect that people in the Chinese medicine community who advocated the integration of Chinese and Western medicine never dared to do or say what they are saying now; now there is this strange person who makes this delusional thought to play this trick. I do not know what the advanced or junior members of the Chinese medicine community think of it? The so-called "on the one hand, firmly grasp one's own inherent theories, and on the other hand, absorb and integrate foreign scientific knowledge," "we oppose passive and blind Westernization. We should automatically rise up and absorb foreign scientific knowledge." I really do not understand this. Mr. Mou does not want "Westernization," but wants to absorb and integrate foreign "scientific knowledge." What exactly is going on? Since you do not recognize Western medical knowledge that is constantly progressing, and you want to oppose it, what else is there that is truly foreign "scientific knowledge?" Do you know that all "foreign scientific knowledge" is also "constantly progressing and being revised?" In my opinion, it is better for you not to absorb it, otherwise you will inevitably "be a backward old doctor for the rest of your life"! There are thousands of layers of obstacles and boundless evil seas. Turning back is the shore. Think deeply and wake up!

There is also the most wonderful paragraph in Mr. Mou's article, which is also his masterpiece. He said: "Because all the tissues of the human body are interconnected by blood vessels and nerves, there is absolutely no truly local disease. All local lesions affect the whole body." I am afraid that not only scientists will laugh at you for not understanding things, but even Chinese medicine practitioners - not just Chinese medicine practitioners, even rural women and children, will say that you do not understand medicine and laugh your teeth out. The so-called "absolutely no truly local disease," I really do not know how you can say such a bold statement. In Chinese medicine books, you can never find a "scripture" that says that all diseases belong to the whole body. Lung abscesses and intestinal abscesses are only called lung abscesses and intestinal abscesses. They are not confused with "five internal organs and six intestines," nor are the diseased parts expanded and directly called "human abscesses," because these are all local lesions and cannot be exaggerated. In addition, although the more abstract diseases are not as precisely analyzed as Western medicine, they are all specific to their location. Headaches are called headaches, and rib pain and back pain are also called rib pain and back pain. They are not called whole body pain to distinguish them from true whole body pain. However, Mr. Mou always likes to argue forcefully, and this is how he gets to the point of distorting right and wrong. Is it not heartbreaking! Such "Chinese medicine," such "science," is this the so-called modern "Eastern culture"? Alas, I want to say nothing.

Conclusion

The current Chinese medicine camp can be said to be extremely chaotic. Those who are a little smarter are secretly using Western medicine and falsely claiming secret recipes. In fact, they have gradually changed in nature. To put it bluntly, it is plagiarism of new methods. However, there is no denying the fact that it is equivalent to surrender. There is another group of people who only use stethoscopes and thermometers to decorate their storefronts, which is completely a disguised advertisement. They should be discussed separately. In recent years, what we can especially see in society, especially in the inland, is that there are a small number of unlicensed Western doctors who were originally stopped by the health authorities due to changes in the rules, and the issue of examination and inquiry has not been resolved rationally to this day. Among them, some have joined the Chinese medicine camp in order to obtain legal status and then carry out their Western medical business. In fact, they do not fully understand Chinese medicine, and sometimes they even stand up and praise Chinese medicine. Is it not laughable and pitiful? However, the "orthodox" school of Chinese medicine is deeply rooted and still has the belief of the majority of people. You think that a specialized free profession can actually be stirred up to this point, and they are still singing high the praises of "preserving Chinese medicine." It is simply like sleepwalking. We know that improving Chinese medicine is definitely not a matter of plagiarizing new methods and applying Western medicine. We must start from the academic foundation, and all ideas of valuing the ancient and belittling the present must be fundamentally eliminated. Otherwise, even if we can accept the achievements of science on the surface, it is still a self-deceiving act. Recently, some self-proclaimed new Chinese medicine practitioners think that this is the scientificization of Chinese medicine. This makes people who are fascinated by science but do not have a sufficient understanding of medicine sometimes fall for their tricks. In fact, it is as superficial as writing a few new medical terms on a child's writing board, as I said in the previous article. After saying it all, it is still not enough, because they have not accepted the basic theories of new medicine at all!

Western medicine is a "scientific" product. Other than that, of course, there cannot be another "scientific medicine." The so-called scientific medicine is Western medicine, which is very clear. But what we mean by "scientificization of Chinese medicine" refers to the "people" who are professional Chinese medicine practitioners, not the "theory" of Chinese medicine, nor the "literature" of Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine literature should be organized by historical methods and studied by scientific methods. As for the methods of organization and research, it should be discussed in a separate article. Chinese medicine theory is a "metaphysical theory" and cannot be scientificized. Our hope is that Chinese medicine practitioners will also learn Western medicine, because Western medicine is also medicine. This is what most Chinese medicine practitioners do not deny, and the scientificization of Chinese medicine is also enthusiastically advocated by most enlightened members of the Chinese medicine community. What needs to be said here is that, in order to avoid lengthy text, it is limited to the method of "scientificization." In other words: the way out for "new Chinese medicine practitioners" in the future. I think it is always a good thing for a person to have dual knowledge. I guess no one would object to that, right? To put it bluntly, the path of scientificization of Chinese medicine in the future is really only to gradually move towards full Westernization and use Chinese medicine as one way. All the basic clinical knowledge of scientific medicine should be fully accepted. Only in this way can it be called true scientificization and have a new way out. As for the valuable part of the old experience of Chinese medicine, it can still be preserved and promoted, because if we value knowledge and prepare it in one person, then integrating it will not be difficult. As long as the new Chinese medicine practitioners have the courage and determination to fully accept scientific medicine, the future will naturally be bright. This attitude of only asking about medicine and not asking about Chinese or Western medicine is the most necessary. Do not have a psychology of self-importance, cling to the old and remain unchanged, and do not seek progress; or even want to make Chinese medicine permanently independent and exist forever in the world. This kind of thinking that violates the general rules of historical evolution will only lead to self-destruction. To put it bluntly, not only is there no treasure to be unearthed in Chinese medicine theory, but there is also no other way to improve Chinese medicine except for full scientificization. All the methods of improvement have been done by predecessors, and no matter what, they have all failed. This is an undeniable fact. Do not repeat the mistakes of the past, and please sit down and think deeply, and do not have any more delusions! If you do not believe me, you might as well wait and see the consequences!

Finally, I must repeat again that there are indeed many Chinese medicine practitioners who have already embraced science and are willing to turn around and seek a way out. We must give them a chance to turn around and point out a correct way out so that their hard work will not be buried, which is also very important. Those who advocate medical revolution always criticize Chinese medicine for not working. When some Chinese medicine practitioners have already realized this and want to seek a way out, the result is that they have no way to enter. Some health authorities sometimes want to ban them and not allow them to approach scientific isolation, which is also disappointing. Therefore, the establishment of scientific training institutions for Chinese medicine is absolutely necessary. I hope that in the future, the health authorities and people in the Western medical community will open the door of kindness and pay attention to support! (March 1, 1947, in Shanghai)

### A Brief Discussion on Rabies

— Chen Jindou

On March 28th, the "China-America Evening News" had a medical journal edited by the Chinese medical community, which contained an article entitled "Discussion on Rabies." One passage in the article was a description of Chinese medicine confessing its mistakes: "The treatment of rabies by doctors can be said to be mostly speculation, with no accurate basis or certainty. They only use prescription secret medicines to forcibly act recklessly, regardless of life or death, and use strong medicines such as wind-drying, purgative, and blood-breaking… cutting off people's vitality… If people with weak constitutions have no poison, they will inevitably develop other diseases instead. Everyone who takes these prescriptions, whether they have poison or not, will inevitably see blood in their urine, have abdominal pain like a knife, and have black diarrhea, treating human life as a child's play and human organs as a battlefield base." It also said: "Poison is also a kind of gasification, which is not rare and not very terrible." The author's knowledge is shallow, and I have no specialized research on infectious diseases, but after reading this article, I am frightened and dare to make a public and popular introduction to the common knowledge about rabies.

Rabies originally occurs in animals such as dogs, wolves, foxes, cats, cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep; the term rabies, according to the meaning of its Greek original Lyssa, means a state of frenzy and spasm, so it is named after the pathological symptoms. If a person contracts this disease, the vast majority are directly due to being bitten or licked on exposed wounds by an already diseased rabid dog, so the virus in its saliva can enter the human body through contact with the wound. This virus is currently also called a filterable virus (FiltrierbarcsVirus). After the virus enters through the wound, it travels along the local nerves directly to the brain and spinal cord system; in other words, it uses the peripheral nerves as a pathway to introduce it into the central nerve, and then the structure of the nerve ganglion cells in the brain and other parts is destroyed, and the function changes, and various symptoms appear. Because dogs are the most common and have more opportunities for contact among diseased animals, this disease is generally called rabies (also called hydrophobia).

Whether human or animal, after suffering from this disease, there must be symptoms such as neurological disorders and muscle cramps. Every time they see water, or even want to drink water, the muscles of the pharynx and respiratory tract will have a sudden spasm, which leads to difficulty breathing and suffocation and death. Therefore, patients with this disease have great fear of water, so the name hydrophobia is also considered a pseudonym for this disease. (To be continued)

### Strolling in Chengdu

— Ye Dingluo

Bamboo Clapper Ballads and Miscellaneous Arts

The "Bamboo Clapper Ballads" of Jia, the Blind Man, are said to be a famous art form in Chengdu. I was twice dragged by friends to appreciate this art. The name "Bamboo Clapper Ballads" sounded new to me, but I didn't know what kind of musical instrument it was. Later, I learned that it was the "fish drum" and "bamboo clapper" used in singing "Taoist Ballads" in the past, exactly the things held by "Zhang Guolao," one of the Eight Immortals in paintings. People in Chengdu call it the Bamboo Clapper Ballads.

A small attic in a teahouse was partitioned into a small tea room, which could accommodate dozens of small tea seats. In the middle was a small stage, like a small podium in a school. On the podium, a glass sign resembling a small archway was erected, reading "Jia Shusan." That was the scene of the place. Most of the people who come here are refined people who love to listen to Bamboo Clapper Ballads, so they all sit politely and there is no noise. With a loud shout from the waiter, Jia Shusan appeared on stage. He was a blind man wearing dark crystal glasses, a top hat, a gray silk robe, and a black vest, holding the bamboo clapper ballads. After sitting for a while, wiping his face, and drinking tea, he quietly played the bamboo clapper ballads and sang.

This seems to be a distinguished form of singing. He only sings two selections each time, with a five-minute intermission in between, taking up an hour of the audience's time. In terms of the lyrics, his words are quite popular and elegant, but the soft tone reminds me of the storytelling songs that used to be popular in my hometown. The lyrics sung in Wu dialect with a three-stringed instrument have the same feeling as this tone. In people's thoughts and emotions, I feel that Chengdu friends have something in common with Suzhou people: eating snacks, sitting in teahouses, telling witty jokes, and putting on a pretentious front. It is fitting that they appreciate such soft and decadent music. This is created by a superficial culture. Historically, due to inconvenient transportation, it is fitting that Sichuanese people have a strong sense of conservatism. Therefore, even the talented and intelligent are limited to a few literary figures. Apart from Sima Xiangru, Su Dongpo, Li Taibai, Yang Xiong, and a few modern literati, it seems that no earth-shattering figures have emerged. These few friends have tasted the bitterness of displacement, but the people of their hometown have boundless admiration and worship for them. Therefore, the style of valuing literature is no less than that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but the richness of cultural relics is far inferior to that of Wu and Yan. Since the transportation line is located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, it is only natural that all its customs become a dependency of the former "Su-Chang." When people come to Chengdu, they have the feeling of arriving in the "Chinese Concession" of Shanghai in the past, probably for this reason.

In addition to Bamboo Clapper Ballads, there is the so-called "Yangqin" entertainment, also in a teahouse. It is an ensemble using drums, huqin, and a musical instrument originating in Guangdong, with a few copper wires stretched on a wooden board and beaten with two bamboo pieces. There is more than one singer, with roles of male, female, painted face, and clown. Because it is more complex, it tends to make people feel more energetic when listening to it. The singer playing the young female role also wears a pair of dark glasses and sings in a cat-like voice, which is a bit flirtatious. The reason for wearing dark glasses is probably because she feels embarrassed. There are more listeners here, and some rush over, whispering in agreement. Finally, there are people who applaud loudly. I really envy my Sichuan friends for having such good leisure and spare time.

Chengdu only has one Peking Opera theater, performing Peking Opera in the Shanghai style. The actors are not so much selling their art as selling their charm. There are many local operas, which are "Sichuan Opera." I think the Sichuan Opera performers still sing according to their traditions, properly and respectfully. They don't "mess around" too much. "Jia Peizhi" is a leader among Sichuan Opera actors. He is a famous red-faced male role. I went to see his Guan Yu specifically. Sichuan Opera is completely the same as all old Chinese operas in terms of movements, but the singing is low and soft, with many low and high-pitched voices. The melody lacks variation and uses several single tones, repeatedly revolving, and finally slightly dragging the sound. The instruments and spoken lines often separate, and only add accompaniment at the end of the singing. Different tunes are used to supplement the pauses in the spoken lines. After a particularly passionate singing line, the people backstage join in the chorus. In the history of drama, this can be said to be an ancient singing method.

Wuhou Temple

The "Wuhou Temple," described by Du Fu in his poem, "Where to find the Prime Minister's Shrine? Outside Jin Guan City, the cypresses are lush," is located outside the South Gate of Chengdu, less than a few miles away. On the right side of the avenue, a large courtyard and two halls are hidden among the towering green cypresses. These cypresses have been praised by the Tang people, and one can imagine their antiquity. The towering halls and walls must have been repaired by countless people. The general public calls it "Wuhou Temple," but the plaque "Zhaolie Temple" hangs high at the entrance. However, the hall of the late emperor is in front, and the hall of Zhuge Liang is in the back, which is a case of the guest overshadowing the host. Looking at the architecture of the front and back halls, one is solemn and complex, and the other is simple and unadorned. It can be seen that later generations have a special affection for the Prime Minister. As for why the hall of the First Emperor must be in front of the Prime Minister's Hall, and the entrance is marked as Zhaolie Temple, it probably expresses the meaning of "a subject does not insult his ruler." Since the Prime Minister is qualified to build a shrine, the First Emperor should also put on a show. The Prime Minister, who was entrusted with the heavy responsibility of entrusting the orphan and exhausted himself to death, repaid the kindness of his mentor with a sincere heart. This design was retained on his behalf. However, I always feel that Zhuge Liang suffered a great injustice. This extremely smart fool who was deceived until his death is indeed a tragic figure. Zhuge Liang really had no need to confront Cao Cao. As for wanting to repeat the "desert land," he could just paste a bigger map at home and write some nice-sounding words on it. Why not just be a self-sufficient farmer in Nanyang and work for others?

But Wuhou Temple is really a quiet place. I like to sit in the water pavilion on the right side of the hall, drink tea, look at the towering ancient cypresses and the layered halls, and listen to the strange calls of the eagles on the treetops. Looking around at the front of the temple, which has been turned into a school where naughty children are playing basketball, and some old monks and tea drinkers, I feel that this place has also become a place that is both ancient and modern.

Bibamen Alley

There is the Xue Tao Well in the so-called "Bibamen Alley," on the bank of the Jin River outside the East Gate, near a certain university. It is said that the water in this well was once used by Xue Tao, one of the famous courtesans in history, to wash paper. Therefore, the well is named after the person, and people think of the person when they look at the well. To visit Xue Tao Well, one can pass through a willow embankment. Behind the rows of willows, on the outskirts, stand neat, half-Chinese and half-Western-style houses of the university. Pairs of young men and women stroll or read books on the outskirts and the willow embankment, but it seems that there are more people whispering side by side and fewer people studying seriously. Xue Tao Well has become a park. There are stalls at the entrance, and tea seats inside. Some young people who like to read sit here, sipping tea and reading magazines and newspapers. The sky-covering green bamboo, evergreen in winter and summer, washes away the dust that has been brought from the city all year round.

Reading Xue Tao's short biography and looking at the stone-carved image of Xue Tao on the inkstone, one can recall Xue Tao's life. She followed her father, who was an official traveling around, to this place. After her father died and she was stranded in a foreign land, she had to come out to serve wine in order to support her mother. Fortunately, she was able to write poetry and gained the sympathy of literati, so she did not become a minor star but a "proofreader." The suffering in her heart was a hundred times greater than that of today's socialites. After her beauty faded, she dressed as a Taoist, turned away friends and guests, and lived alone in a small building, spending her twilight years. One can also imagine her tragic life and inner loneliness.

"Wangjiang Tower" is also here, but I didn't want to climb the tower and look at the river, because I have experienced crossing mountains and ridges and crossing oceans. Climbing a restaurant-style not-so-high tower and looking at a not-so-wide river that looks like a small stream is really not satisfying. The beauty of Sichuan is entirely in the mountains outside the city. I have had no connection with these places where a group of people sit in a small park, drink tea, leisurely read other people's poems and essays, and talk nonsense about world changes for many years, because it is really too elegantly vulgar, too quietly noisy, too peacefully verbose, and too comfortably boring.

Qingyang Palace

"Qingyang Palace" is outside the South Gate, almost in the countryside. It is a Taoist temple on the edge of the city. Here, a flower fair is held every spring. Various exotic flowers are sent from all over the countryside to compete here. It is a lively gathering. As I see it, it can be said that China originally had no religion. After the Han and Tang dynasties, Taoism was a religion created by the Chinese themselves. However, it is far less powerful than Buddhism, which came from foreign lands, because Taoism really has no consistent theory, and its claims are entirely mythological, so it can only deceive fools and women. To the average person, Buddhism also seems to be advocating superstition, but because it has many classics, no matter what sect it is, the main thing is to promote personal cultivation and to achieve altruism as the ultimate goal. So it seems to be a passive attitude, but it is actually applicable to any aspect, and can harmonize every individual and the masses, and not raise selfish thoughts. Therefore, although it has been slandered by some corrupt scholars, it has been promoted by many true intellectuals and occupies the first place in Eastern religions. I have traveled to many places over the years and know that Taoism is not as powerful as Buddhism, especially in the south, where Taoism is even more declining than Buddhism. This is because since the Jin and Southern Dynasties, the nation moved south, and Buddhism also multiplied to the Yangtze River basin along with political power. Therefore, although this Qingyang Palace is a large temple, it can really be said to be quite old. The front of the temple has been used as a military and police agency. What preserves the atmosphere of religion and art is only a large hall in the back and a Bagua Pavilion in the abandoned garden. Because the past architecture was quite exquisite, it still retains its beauty and majesty to this day. But the name Qingyang really doesn't know what it's based on. The main deity in the main hall is Lao Jun. The two bronze sheep on the left and right are incomparably beautiful art treasures. The bronze models, the same size as real sheep, have been smoothed by people over the years and are really cute. They are really two good antiques. For these two bronze sheep, I lingered in the temple for a long time, and I didn't feel bored. It was much better than sitting in a restaurant drinking dishes.

On the side of the main hall, there is a courtyard, which is the dormitory of the Taoist priests. The paper windows and wooden walls are so simple that they are almost like they were from the Ming Dynasty. I think it would be very comfortable to live here, read books, and write. However, this happiness has already been taken by the Taoist priests here. No matter where I go, I am always unfortunately in the city, which is really hateful.

Seven Killing Stele

The "Seven Killing Stele," a relic of the roving bandit Zhang Xianzhong at the end of the Ming Dynasty, is inscribed with "Heaven produces all things to nourish man, but man has no virtue to repay Heaven. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill," at "Thatched Cottage Temple." Browsing through Qing Dynasty anecdotal novels, there are many records of Zhang Xianzhong's story; it is said that he was so cruel that he cut off women's small feet and piled them up like mountains, which shows how many people he killed. Thinking of the historical tragedies and seeing the current situation, I am really extremely terrified.

### Crying for Fu Tienian

— Ma Gongyu

Hengyang shakes with talented scholars, lives in humility with emptiness,
carves words to explain profound meanings, presents vitality to display brilliant words.
Our acquaintance has lasted over twenty years, he was always at my side, older than me by five years;
knocking the bowl to thank the butterfly, flying the brush to create rice-grain tigers;
painting is exceptionally outstanding, as are the bitter gourd and Tianchi;
the three perfections are commonly praised, his strong integrity is rarely known in the world.
For eight years, he lived in solitude, upholding virtue and chanting Mingyi,
how could he be buried after the recovery, a slave to the court, bitterly suffering?
Heaven's heart has not tired of disaster, not sparing an old man to leave behind;
in chaotic times, writing is cheapened, how can I bear to read his posthumous poems (you once sent me a poem, with the line "in chaotic times, writing is cheapened")!
Old friends are withering away day by day, I am not crying for my personal loss.

### Sea Fever by John Masefield – Translated by Zhenqin

I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,
And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,
And a grey mist on the sea's face and a grey dawn breaking.

I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,
And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.

I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,
To the gull's way and the whale's way where the wind's like a whetted knife;
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,
And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.

[John Masefield was a poet laureate. He lost his parents at a young age and wandered around, working as a cook, carpet worker, waiter, and sailor. One evening, he accidentally read the poems of Chaucer, a great English poet of the 13th century, and decided to become a poet. His masterpieces are the long poems "Everlasting Mercy", "Dauber", "The Daffodil Fields" and "The Widow in the Bye Street". His early wandering life is reflected in the collection of short poems "Salt-Water Ballads", from which "Sea Fever" is translated, which is one of the author's most outstanding short poems, and is included in almost every modern European and American poetry anthology. - Translator]

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 500

— Ye Jingfeng

In addition, there is a legendary saying that the Korean comrades who stayed in Shanghai at that time, in order to avoid the Japanese invaders' lewdness and abuse, many young female patriots were dressed as men, which also facilitated their work. Perhaps this Korean representative who met with Tsurumi was one of the women disguised as men?

In short, regardless of whether this Korean patriot is male or female, I cannot escape the guilt of negligence for omitting the person's name. I sincerely apologize to this comrade with a thousand apologies, and wish him or her eternal peace in heaven! In addition, I also pray for these Korean patriots, and hope that the blood they shed for their motherland can be transformed into a solid and glorious cornerstone, laying the foundation for the eternal prosperity of Korea!

Special No. 2, Li Ming, (during the fall of Shanghai, he was in charge of the mobile secret intelligence radio, but unfortunately, he was captured by the enemy's special agents on the eve of the Japanese surrender in July 1945 and sacrificed heroically - the author pays sincere respect!) He came from a military background; although he was only about thirty years old, he had a full beard; his eyes were sharp, shining with cold light, yet his language was gentle and his thoughts were delicate; so he was ordered by his superiors to take on this delicate and risky work.

(Normally, in general society, if three or five young people like this gathered in a room in this kind of inn, we could easily guess the wonderful programs they had for "entertainment": if they weren't impatiently playing a sixteen-round "anything goes" mahjong game, it would definitely be "sand crab"; if not, it would definitely be Russian dominoes. At the same time, they would definitely bring out each other's "dear friends," whether picked from the dance hall, caught at the movie theater, or discovered by the guide company for no reason, etc., etc., like competing for treasures at Lintong, they would boast and boast about each other's gains.

If you accidentally stepped into this room at this time, I can guarantee that the first thing you would notice is a room full of smoke, and the light laughter and scolding would fill your ears. If you grabbed a handful of the air in this room and put it in a bottle, and asked a biochemist to analyze it, I think that in addition to the obvious smells of smoke, alcohol, farts, sweat, and flesh, it probably also contains all kinds of toxins and bacteria.

I think that if the authorities suddenly came up with such a tyranny, and, according to what was said above, made such a few rooms in the same style, and wrote outside the door, "There are all kinds of odors, all kinds of toxins and bacteria inside, and every citizen must pay a certain amount of money to 'entertain' inside for two to eight hours," do you think you would feel resentful towards this authority? I think that if this really happened, undoubtedly, all parties and factions, non-party factions, and even Ying Xiaoliuzi included, would have to rise up against this harsh government; in addition to spreading leaflets and speeches, they would move to marches and demonstrations, wouldn't they?)

At this time, Tsurumi Shouichi and the other four were all preoccupied, eating and drinking a little, and at the same time concentrating their thoughts to discuss the secret of "0915," each with his own guesses and each with his own opinions, but none with a definite conclusion.

Not long after they discussed, the hotel waiter suddenly called up, saying that a Japanese soldier had specifically asked to speak to a certain Yamamoto Masa iwa. It turned out that this person was the car driver that Masa iwa had asked to come to inquire about. At this time, he was wearing a private first class army uniform, neatly dressed, as if he was coming to attend a banquet. Tsurumi didn't look down on him either. After Tsurumi explained his identity, he immediately politely asked him to sit down and drink wine. The guy twisted and turned for a while, and then confessed his guilt severely before he was willing to sit down.

### Snow Clearing After the River and Sky

Free Talk

### Gift

— Liu Meng

Washington Central News Agency, 26th: President Truman issued an executive order today, ordering Navy Secretary Forrestal to transfer 271 surplus US Navy ships and their necessary floating docks to our country without any cost. After reading this, I can't help but be flattered. This is the honest truth, just like a friend gave me a pair of exquisite rice bowls, which have been put aside and never used, because people are not in pairs, how can you break up the rice bowls? It's better not to use them and treat them as collectibles. Although I have inevitably failed my friend's good intentions, I have no other choice. The United States gave me 271 naval ships, how can we let empty ships come and go? I said I was flattered, and that was the honest truth.

Reading the content of the President's order in detail, it said: "These ships and floating docks should be repaired, equipped, and allocated to China for use, and China should pay for the various materials required for maintenance in cash." Under the circumstances of living on borrowed money, how can "this expense" be raised?

But when people give gifts, they always have to reward the messengers who carry the gifts. This is "human nature," who doesn't understand? So, if people really give us a large number of ships, how can we be embarrassed to ask the giver to bear the cost of repairs and other materials? Of course, we have to pay for it out of our own pockets!

Let's put these questions aside. In any case, the implementation of this order is still subject to Secretary of State Marshall's "final decision," and there is still a considerable amount of time before the "formal transfer." Taking advantage of this time, how do we complete the preparatory work for receiving? We still have to put in a lot of effort.

People care about us and hope that we can stand up in East Asia. We should sweep away the past habits and use this opportunity to embark on the road to revival.

### "Counter Lions"

— Li Quan

Prices are rising without limit, and the salaries of employees are stuck in their original positions. Even if they cannot live with the burden of their wives, children, and parents, how dare they ask the employers for a raise? Let the union negotiate with the employers, but they must come forward themselves. Moreover, the task of the union is to mediate, and it is difficult to conceal the names of the applicants from the employers; therefore, even if the salaries can be adjusted as a result, their jobs are bound to be seriously threatened.

If it could be: (1) Compulsory membership of employees, which can be requested from the police station for execution, and if the execution fails, the police station will send it to the court for sanctions. (2) The employer shall not employ non-members of the industry union, otherwise the union may request the court to adjudicate. (3) The treatment of employees in various industries should be stipulated in detail in the labor-capital agreement concluded by the industry association and the union. (4) When the labor-capital agreement is violated, the association or union of the injured party does not need to apply for handling, and may automatically investigate and negotiate at any time, or request the court to adjudicate. Then the labor movement will have a solid position, and the employees will get reasonable protection.

However, the above hope is a "what if" dream. Therefore, the suffering of the labor movement cannot be eliminated at present; that is, the sorrow of the employees has not yet reached the time of relief. This group, known as "counter lions," is also a cell in the life of the country and a powerful link in the social organization. They are kind and law-abiding people, but they are abandoned by everyone. (To be continued)

### Art and Literature Scene

The Article Supply Agency has set up its office at No. 190, North Sichuan Road, Shiqing Road, and has now begun to supply various creations and translations. Authors and editors are welcome to contact them. The revival issue of "Literary Youth" has been published a few days ago. In addition to the editorial, the main articles include many novels, essays, essays, and poems, all of which are works of young people. Each book is only sold for 1,500 yuan, which is a good reading material for literary youth.

"David Copperfield," the most powerful representative work in the life of Dickens, a great realist writer of the nineteenth century, is now translated into vernacular Chinese by Xu Tianhong and published by the Cultural Life Publishing House. Before the war, Lin Shu had a classical Chinese translation of the book, renamed "A Survivor's Tale," which is now out of print. The entire book has 1,500 pages, divided into three thick volumes, and is only sold for 46,000 yuan.

### Shanghai Radio's Broadcasting Programs

— Chengwen

As of now, there are about 30 radio stations in Shanghai, including privately owned, publicly owned, and state-owned radio stations. In terms of quantity, it can be said that there are many, but in terms of quality, it is pitifully poor.

The broadcasting industry in Shanghai has also had more than 20 years of history, but until now, not only has there been no necessary progress, but it has deteriorated, which is heartbreaking.

Looking at the world, it has already progressed to the use of electrified education. And what about us? We are still broadcasting all day long obscene, boring, and sexually suggestive jazz songs and popular ditties, and outdated old opera records, etc. Or some low-level, meaningless storytelling songs, Shanghai opera, Shaoxing opera, comedy, and ghost stories, etc.

And the only educational programs, except for the fact that the entire radio is teaching English early in the morning, other educational programs, such as Chinese, science, mass literacy teaching, and various knowledge, etc., are simply rare, it can be said that they are almost non-existent. Especially in the evening, when everyone is off work, there are no educational programs at all, and the radio is filled with all kinds of low-level and boring entertainment programs.

I hope that the heads of the radio stations should think about the country and the public, and not only be calculating for money. They should establish practical educational, social, and children's programs (especially in the evening) so that everyone can obtain various knowledge from the air.

At the same time, I also hope that the telecommunications authorities will strictly control the broadcasting programs of the radio stations. Educational programs should account for at least 30% or more, especially in the evening, there must be educational programs.

### Shaw's Famous Work "Caesar and Cleopatra"

— Sima Hua

Empress Cleopatra's palace now appears extremely chaotic. It is said that Roman soldiers have penetrated deep into Egypt, and Caesar is leading his troops and is about to arrive. At this time, Cleopatra, rather than being an empress, is more like a child because she is terrified. She has fled to the desert, hiding at the foot of the Sphinx.

At this moment, the night is misty and the cold wind blows. She suddenly encounters a kind old man. She tells the old man how fearful she is of the hideous face of the conqueror Caesar. This old man accompanies her back to her exiled desert palace, telling her not to be afraid, for if she is afraid, she is not like an empress. Seeing that Cleopatra is listening to him, he tells her that he himself is Caesar. After hearing this, she is first surprised, then ecstatic. She accepts Caesar's friendship, acknowledging him as her friend, and Caesar promises to teach her how to overcome fear and become a true empress.

Cleopatra's brother, Ptolemy, ascends the throne in Alexandria, supported by many ministers. Caesar then brings Cleopatra to the city of Alexandria. Behind Ptolemy are also Roman troops who, a few years ago, came to Egypt to resolve the issue of succession to the throne. These Romans and Egyptians, under the command of General Achillas, unanimously support this "puppet emperor" in order to maintain their own power.

They are single-mindedly trying to curry favor with Caesar by assassinating Pompey, Caesar's already defeated enemy. However, to their surprise, Caesar regards this act as a brutal assassination. Caesar then tells them, "Regardless of how you conspire here, my troops have already marched into the city in great numbers, surrounding the palace like an iron barrel. If you do not leave immediately, I will detain all of you as prisoners."

These ministers and generals, seeing that the situation is unfavorable, leave dejectedly. This departure allows Cleopatra to happily ascend to her brother's throne, and Caesar teaches her how to be a true empress. (To be continued)

### Ethics in the Attic

— Ji Gan

In the past few days, newspapers have been continuously publishing news of heinous crimes against family ethics, causing readers to sigh at the great change in moral principles. Originally, we were a country that particularly valued human relationships, but now we are witnessing such absolutely opposite evils, which naturally leads to endless sighs.

The great changes in human relations are mostly attributed to the decline of morality, but we do not believe that the people of Shanghai have fallen to such a degree. Compared with compatriots in other parts of the country, the people of Shanghai are really no different. The only difference is the environment.

Speaking concretely, all family tragedies mostly originate from the family environment. The difference between the family environment of Shanghai people and other places is that they often have only one room per family. This room is naturally large or small, but it is always a place of "congregated living." Parents, siblings, spouses, children, sisters, mothers-in-law, etc., all eat, live, and reside in one room. Each person's temperament, likes and dislikes, habits, and occupations are all different, yet they must practice the most narrow form of communal living. Isn't that too difficult?

In the Tang Dynasty, there was a Zhang Gongyi, who lived with nine generations of his family. Emperor Gaozong asked him about the way to live together peacefully, and he wrote a hundred "tolerance" characters. It can be seen that only when each member of a large family is determined to endure can they get along. Endure if you can, and endure even if you can't. The pain in this is imaginable. However, in the former large families, the objective environment was still relatively spacious, and there was never a phenomenon of fathers and daughters or fathers-in-law and daughters-in-law living in the same room. Now, the intimacy of Shanghai families is far greater than that of former large families, so the "tolerance" they need should naturally be increased by dozens or hundreds of times compared to the past. This is indeed impossible.

The most serious crimes in incest cases are murder and adultery. Shanghai is a place where the temptation of wealth and lust is greatest, and many people are in contact with each other in one room day and night. There is no possibility of privacy for any daily activity, no distance to retreat, naturally all kinds of conflicts can arise from this, and all kinds of incestuous behaviors can be caused by this. All of the above can be said to be a problem of housing. If the housing problem is not resolved, then human relations will continue to change greatly, unless they are ideal great sages. Otherwise, it is not easy for all ordinary people to be crowded in an attic and asked to talk about great principles of human relations.

### Chronicle of a City in Crisis

— Qin Shouou

Lan repeatedly expressed to Old Zhu that her refusal to ride in Xu Shaoming's car did not mean that she had to ask Old Zhu to find a car for them; she was willing to go out and try hard, and perhaps find a suitable opportunity by spending more money. But she was wrong! Completely wrong! She had no power, and she really couldn't afford to spend money. In the market these days, from Guilin to Liuzhou, the fairest price is 500,000 yuan per person; many are priced in gold ingots. From Liuzhou to Guiyang, asking for four or five big bars of gold is not uncommon. The driver must also be given two or three small yellow fish as a token of respect, otherwise he might abandon you halfway. How much money does Lan have? A wedding ring of less than two qian, and it's still imitation gold. Who wants it? So until this time, this problem has not been solved. Lu Qian is certainly not very clear about these twists and turns.

"If Old Zhu is willing to let them go with us, I think it will be beneficial to the theater troupe," Zhang Chang said, waving his beloved harmonica, as if giving a speech, "Mrs. Hu's astonishing calmness and gentle character is at least a strong encouragement to us!"

"But what about our car? Alas!" Lu the cripple sighed long as usual.

Their car is being worked on by Old Zhu with great patience. While they were lying on the floor, chatting, Zhu Zhaonian was sitting alone in the waiting room of the Transport Department of the War Zone Commander's Headquarters.

In the past three days, he had been here seven times, each time sitting in this rectangular small room; the shortest time was about one hour, and the longest was four hours and thirty-six minutes, from early in the morning until lunch. These seven times of waiting like waiting for the drum to beat at the yamen gate had made him not only recognize the shape of the room and the interior furnishings, but also be able to tell the number of small holes burned by cigarette butts on the gray-white tablecloth, and the amount of sugar he consumed in each waiting period was also increasing day by day.
