[Special Dispatch from Moscow, Central News Agency, 31st] TASS published today the contents of the letters exchanged by Molotov, Marshall, and Bevin on the China issue. Bevin wrote to Molotov stating: The British government cannot provide any intelligence regarding the implementation of the Moscow Resolutions, as the withdrawal of troops stationed in China is the obligation of the American and Soviet governments. He also stated: The British government strictly supports a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Bevin expressed opposition to holding a meeting regarding the implementation of agreements related to China at the Moscow Conference.

[Special Dispatch from Moscow, Associated Press, 31st] It was learned today that the United States has submitted a document to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov regarding the fulfillment of its obligations in China.

(3) The state-owned enterprises and enemy-puppet industries designated as collateral for the principal and interest fund of short-term treasury bonds should be designated to a certain number of units. The Ministry has also submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Economic Ministry, the Resources Committee, and the Enemy-Puppet Industry Handling Committee to consult with the fund supervisory committee as soon as possible to determine the units and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then to the National Government for official designation. (4) Article 8 of the US Dollar Public Bond Regulations stipulates that "The principal and interest of this public bond shall be prepaid by the National Government, instructing the Central Bank to allocate an equal amount of US dollar foreign exchange from the bank's foreign exchange fund six months before each principal and interest repayment date for storage." The first tranche of this public bond is due at the end of September this year, and the second tranche of the first tranche of bonds and the first tranche of the second tranche of bonds are due at the end of March next year. The Ministry has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan today to instruct the Central Bank to prepay the funds in accordance with the above regulations. Subsequently, each repayment and prepayment of funds should be handled in the same way without delay. (5) The solicitation and sale of short-term treasury bonds and US dollar public bonds have been entrusted to the Central Bank. Before the formal treasury bond bonds are printed, the Central Bank may issue reservation certificates. Once the Central Bank has prepared all the procedures, the bank will announce the start date of the sale so that the people can purchase them.

### Large Amount of Idle Funds Returns to Peiping; Commercial Bank Deposits Reach 50 Billion; Cleaning Up of Puppet Banks Not Yet Complete

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] The recent economic trends in Peiping are as follows: (1) Since the implementation of emergency economic measures, speculation in Peiping has subsided slightly. In mid-March, the wholesale price index in Peiping showed a trend of large increases and small declines. Idle funds had nowhere to go and temporarily returned, lying dormant in the financial sector. Statistics show that deposits in Peiping's banking industry were more than 29 billion in January, increasing to more than 33 billion in February. In March, there was a large increase, and commercial bank deposits are expected to reach around 50 billion, an increase of about two-fifths compared with the previous month. Whether this good phenomenon of idle funds returning can be maintained for a long time after the gold and silver industry resumes business is being closely watched by the public here. (2) The work of taking over and cleaning up various enemy-puppet banks in Peiping has not been fully completed in the past year and a half, because each bank still exists, and the situation of branches in various places is too complicated and involves too much. It is reported that the puppet Jidong Bank was cleared up last month and is in the process of being formally dissolved. The puppet Korean United Bank and other banks still have many remaining tasks, and it will take at least next month to complete them all. The Mengjiang Bank still has no good cleaning up plan. Although the Central Bank recently announced measures for the return of deposits from the Peiping branch of the Mengjiang Bank, no one has yet come to inquire about them, because the puppet currency is returned at a rate of five to one, and prices are high, so previous deposits are now worthless. In order to complete the cleaning up work as soon as possible, a new institution may be established recently.

### Shipping Line Between Hankou and Changde Had an Accident; Yongfeng Vessel Exploded and Sank; Overloading Caused the Disaster; 17 Crew Members Killed and Injured

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 31st] Confirmed information: The "Yongfeng" vessel, owned by the Hunan Civilian Shipping Bureau and operated by Changjin Shipping Company, sailed from Hankou to Changde on the 25th. When it arrived near Yanziwo, downstream of Jiayu, at noon on the 26th, the vessel's boiler suddenly exploded, killing eight crew members and injuring nine. The vessel sank immediately. After the Shipping Administration Bureau sent personnel to investigate, the company falsely claimed that it was returning empty to Hunan. After many investigations, it was learned that the cause of the accident was that the vessel towed four ships in the middle of the journey (shipping regulations only allow two), resulting in overloading. The vessel's boiler pressure exceeded the approved limit, so it could not bear the burden and an explosion occurred. The bureau decided on the following penalties: (1) The Changjin Company's vessels are prohibited from sailing on the Hankou-Changde route for three years; (2) The vessel's captain Cha Chailian and chief engineer Fu Jinsheng are prohibited from employment for three years; (3) The criminal part is transferred to the court for handling.

Editorial

### The Issuance of US Dollar Bonds

The issuance of 300 million US dollar Treasury bills and 100 million US dollar government bonds, half of which begins today, is of great significance, as this newspaper pointed out in an article on the 28th, and various other analyses have been quite detailed. However, we feel that there are still two points that need to be further elaborated.

The first concerns the credit of our national bonds. There is little doubt about the creditworthiness of our national bonds. However, (1) since the beginning of the War of Resistance, the currency has gradually inflated, and the value of the currency has fallen daily. Whether public or private bonds, the creditors have suffered too much hidden losses, which has discouraged the interest of general investors. (2) All original government bonds are still repaying principal and interest according to the old rules. The rumors circulating in the securities market about repayment at several times the original value have ultimately proven to be just rumors. Therefore, there is inevitable apprehension about investing in government bonds. (3) The four-fold gold deposit contribution during the War of Resistance dealt a significant blow to national credit. After the victory, there was an unusually large amount of floating capital, and at the same time, the financial situation was extremely difficult. Many people advocated issuing government bonds to make adjustments. However, the government has always taken it seriously and has been reluctant to try it lightly. This is due to these reasons.

Since the decision to issue US dollar Treasury bills and US dollar government bonds, the government has made great efforts to remedy these past weaknesses. First, it decided to use the US dollar as the standard to strengthen public confidence. When repaying principal and interest, although the Treasury bills are still paid in national currency, it is stipulated that they will be converted according to the central bank's US dollar exchange rate on the payment date. For government bonds, the National Government specifically stipulates that they will be paid in US dollar foreign exchange. This measure will naturally dispel the general public's concerns about the value of the currency. Moreover, (1) a fund supervision committee is organized, and representatives of civil groups are specially permitted to participate, (2) guarantees are designated and deposited in advance, and (3) repeated statements are made to respect credit. Finance Minister Yu also assured the Legislative Yuan in his capacity as Finance Minister that the organization of the fund supervision committee will be as open and sound as possible. The purpose of these measures is clearly to restore national credit and consolidate the inherent value of the bonds themselves. The impact of this will not only be that the US dollar bonds can be expected to achieve good results, but also that the public's confidence in the country can be expected to increase as a result. If this intangible income can be calculated in currency, we believe that it will definitely not be less than 400 million US dollars. This is worth mentioning solemnly.

Secondly, concerning the issuance, the authorities have repeatedly stated that the above-mentioned bonds will be purchased freely by the public and that no quota system will be adopted. This point is particularly important. Since our country has had public bonds, in fact, it is probably not true that it has completely broken ties with the word "quota." Whether central or local, all public bonds are somewhat related to quotas or forced solicitation. It is relatively polite to use righteousness to persuade people to purchase them, but sometimes it is also heard of people being sealed off and detained, extorted in every way, and having certain crimes added to them if they respond a little late. Because these methods are too reluctant, the two words "public bonds" have been deeply shrouded in a black shadow, making it difficult for people to develop a good impression. Therefore, this time, we only use the method of promotion and do not use coercive methods. We actually do the work of solicitation and do not use compulsory methods. On this point alone, we already believe that it is a great success in finance, and there is no need to ask what the result of the issuance will be.

The state issues public bonds, in most cases, it is always out of financial purposes. In other words, all citizens have the responsibility to contribute their strength and money in terms of morality. The reason why we emphasize the phrase "free subscription" is, of course, that only in this way is the government's approach reasonable and legal, and only in this way is it worthy of the style of democratic politics. Therefore, on the day of the initial issuance, we would like to add a few words to wish the issuance success and to hope that this reasonable and legal path will be earnestly extended to the entire financial system and even the entire political system.

### Completion of the Constitutional Grand Law

The ten major laws and regulations concerning the implementation of the Constitution, after careful discussion by the Legislative Yuan for nearly a week regardless of festivals or holidays, were all completed in the legislative process at 8:00 PM on the 30th. Among these ten types of laws and regulations, four are election and recall laws, and six are organizational laws. The National Assembly Organization Law was first completed on the 25th, and the National Assembly Delegate Election and Recall Law and the President and Vice President Election and Recall Law were passed on the 28th. The Legislative Committee and Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law and the Organization Law of the Five Yuan were also completed in the legislative process on the 30th. Within this short period of time, the legislature was able to complete the legislation of these ten major laws concerning the implementation of the Constitution as scheduled. We express our infinite respect to the members of the Legislative Yuan for their loyalty to the country and their tireless work under the leadership of President Sun. Since these ten major laws and regulations concerning the implementation of the Constitution have been formulated, there will be guidelines to follow regarding the implementation of the Constitution in the future, which is actually opening a great road for the constitutional rule of our country.

Looking at the formulation of these ten major laws and regulations as a whole, although it adheres to the spirit of the constitution and our country's established national policies, there are also some changes to the existing system. The abolition of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Food, and the establishment of the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Water Resources, are examples. In addition, the regulations on the number of seats for professional groups and women are also attracting attention from all parties. Professional and women's groups have repeatedly appealed for the allocation of seats, but the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan have not adopted these appeals. From the perspective of the normal path of the nation, the nation, and democratic constitutionalism, the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan, while complying with the established national policy of allowing representatives of professional and women's groups, place their emphasis on the entire people, which is indeed a wise move. We have not seen the abolition of representatives of professional and women's groups in the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan, only that the number of seats allocated may not have satisfied the hopes of the professional and women's groups. This is already a result of compromise. In theory, if we refer to the precedents of British and American democratic politics, it is already a great privilege to specifically allocate seats for professional and women's groups in our election law provisions. Our election law has already adopted both regional elections and occupational elections; the adoption of occupational elections was originally intended to supplement the shortcomings of regional elections. Theoretically speaking, the election law passed by the Legislative Yuan this time does not seem to be a misstep and should be unanimously embraced by the people.

Speaking of the revision of the system, the Ministry of Food was originally a wartime institution, and now it is abolished, which is also fully justified. The functions of the Ministry of Social Affairs are extremely unclear, some belonging to the Ministry of Interior and some belonging to the Ministry of Health. The organization of people's groups should originally be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior; as for training, that is another matter. Now, the Administrative Yuan Organization Law passed by the Legislative Yuan abolishes the Ministry of Social Affairs and establishes a Ministry of Labor to focus on the welfare of farmers and workers, which is also a wise move. What we feel is regrettable is the establishment of the Ministry of Border Affairs. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee had a resolution, and there was also such a proposal at this Legislative Yuan meeting, but it was rejected due to a lack of majority support. In addition, the organizations of the Control Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Examination Yuan have also been repeatedly revised; in adhering to the spirit of the Constitution, a solid foundation for constitutional government is established. From now on, the implementation of constitutional government will have a track to follow. The completion of the legislation of these ten major laws and regulations concerning the implementation of the Constitution is truly an unprecedented event in our country's legal history.

### Beginning Review of Core German Issues - Foreign Ministers' Conference Nearing Decision Stage - Stettinius Arrives in Moscow, Will Meet Stalin

[Dispatch from the Taiwan News Agency, Moscow, 31st] The Foreign Ministers' Conference has now touched upon the central issues of the German question. Today's debate on economic issues may reveal whether the conference has reached a fundamental decision on the German question.

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 30th] Foreign sources close to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference stated today that the success of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is likely to be determined next week, as the Four Foreign Ministers will resolve the most important points of the German peace treaty within the next week. The attitude of the United States has changed, but Secretary of State Marshall's eagerness to return home is a problem that all parties attach great importance to. It is rumored that the Four Foreign Ministers may continue the conference for five or six weeks. Stettinius, a Republican candidate for the US presidency in 1948, has arrived in Moscow. This trip is clearly unrelated to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, but according to American sources here, Stettinius immediately requested a meeting with Marshal Stalin after arriving here. It is also possible that Marshall will also request a meeting with the Marshal.

[Dispatch from Reuters, England, 30th] Observers believe that the success or failure of the Moscow Conference will be revealed in the next three or four days. For the past three weeks, the conference's work has focused on presenting the positions of the Allied countries on the German economic system and other issues. Starting tomorrow, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will enter the most important stage of discussion, studying the following three issues that have been agreed upon as the most important: (1) Germany is regarded as a whole economic unit, and the level of German industry and the issue of reparations are reviewed. (2) Eliminate Germany's military power. (3) The form and powers of the German Provisional Government. The general opinions of the four powers on the German question are now clear. From now on, solutions will be proposed to allow the parties to agree on their opinions. Observers expect that the four powers all have a plan in mind, but they are unwilling to reveal it in advance. Now all parties admit that in order to issue work instructions to the Allied Control Council, some compromises must first be made. The question is when and on what matters can compromises be made. German economic unification does not seem possible for the time being, and there are also vast differences between the opinions of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union on the issue of extracting industrial products as reparations. As for the future constitution of Germany and the elimination of German military power, there seems to be hope for compromise. Observers also expect that an agreement can be reached at the Moscow Conference on the issue of convening a German peace conference and consulting the opinions of other allied countries. The hope that the Austrian treaty can be discussed and completed in Moscow has weakened again due to the stalemate between the powers on the definition of German funds in Austria. It is expected that the Soviet Union will only be able to make concessions on German funds in Austria after it is satisfied with other reparations in Germany.

### Tito's Speech Accuses the United States

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 31st] President Tito, in a speech to the Yugoslav National Assembly today, accused the United States of attempting to dominate all of Yugoslavia. He stated that the US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Patterson, should be held responsible for the deterioration of US-Yugoslav relations and that Greece has become the foundation for imperialists to threaten peace in the Balkans and the world. Tito also insisted that the Austrian province of Carinthia should be ceded to Yugoslavia.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 30th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic, en route from Belgrade to Moscow to present his views to the Council of Foreign Ministers, spoke to reporters in Rome today, commenting on the importance of Yugoslavia's participation in a peace conference with Germany and the US refusal to aid Yugoslavia. He stated, "We are going to Moscow not to propose any new suggestions, but only to reiterate the suggestions we made to the Council of Foreign Ministers in London. We will insist on these suggestions because the peace treaty with Germany constitutes an important issue for us."

### The Three Major Aspirations of German Workers

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 30th] The General Assembly of German Trade Unions was held here yesterday in the Grand Theater, attended by 435 representatives from all walks of life.

### Marshall Watches a Soviet Ballet

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 31st Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall attended a performance at the Starry-Eyed Ballet this morning. He expressed great admiration for the principal dancer, the multi-talented young ballerina Plisetskaya. Mr. Marshall was accompanied by Ambassador Smith, Foster, Dulles, Murphy, and several other dignitaries to watch the performance. After Plisetskaya finished her performance and came to the front of the stage, a large flower basket adorned with Mr. Marshall's calling card was sent to the stage to express his admiration for her youth and talent. The youthful dancer repeatedly bowed to the guest box to express her gratitude and sent flying kisses.

### Soviets Strictly Forbid Journalists from Taking Pictures

[United Press, Berlin, 31st] The Soviets have only one major objection to photojournalists: their photography. During a period of more than two weeks that journalists spent in Moscow, the Soviets allowed them to visit the meeting room of the Council of Foreign Ministers for only two minutes. We were not allowed to photograph almost anything in the city, not even the hotel where we were staying. Every time we went out for a walk, we were followed by a tall secret police representative and uniformed police officers. When a reporter took out a camera in the Moscow market, a policeman ran over, shook his finger, and the reporter was arrested. However, he was finally released an hour later.

### Czech Ministry of Defense Expresses Willingness to Pledge Allegiance to the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 31st] Czech Defense Minister Svoboda delivered a speech to coal miners today, welcoming the recently signed treaty with the Soviet Union. He stated that this could be seen as a security protection system established by Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union to prevent German aggression. In the future, we will implement a foreign policy of cooperation with all countries that love democracy, freedom, and peace in the world, especially to work together with the Soviet Union. Our country is located between the Soviet Union and Germany, so we should determine our entire foreign policy based on this fact. The Soviet Union protects our country and guarantees our freedom and peace, and we should be loyal to the Soviet Union.

### US Aid Plan to Greece and Turkey: The Focus is on Turkey; US Ambassador to Turkey Reports to the Foreign Affairs Committee

[United Press, Washington, 30th] After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee secretly heard opinions on the aid to Greece and Turkey last week, it was learned that the key to taking action to prevent the spread of Communism in the Mediterranean is Turkey, not Greece. Government officials stated today that it was expected that some members would publicly oppose aid to Turkey, but even among those who support the President's plan, there is still a lack of enthusiasm for Turkey. During the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's secret hearing, US Ambassador to Turkey Wilson attended and presented his views. Most of the details are expected to be released in the future. According to a senator who spoke to reporters, Wilson's attendance was noteworthy, and he concluded that the President's proposal was based more on military considerations than on political considerations. Wilson also stated that Turkey is currently the last strong government in the Mediterranean resisting the Soviet Union. Once Turkey falters, Iran, Iraq, Arab countries, and others will be forced to submit to Communist forces, opening up the Middle East and allowing the Soviet Union to enter. Although Turkey is currently capable of coping, it is feared that it will not be able to sustain itself for long. A large standing army is not only depleting its finances but also exhausting its manpower. The Soviet troops stationed on the Turkish border, although not directly threatening it, have forced Turkey to maintain a large army.

### US Senator Wiley Suggests Forming a European Democratic Federation; The Soviet Union and Other Countries Should be Excluded

[United Press, Washington, 31st] Senator Wiley suggested today forming a European Democratic Federation with the United Nations, excluding the Soviet Union and its "satellite states." According to Wiley, he will recommend to Congress that the State Department facilitate a European Federation to protect the political, economic, social, and religious freedom of each country from interference by the Soviet Union and its satellite states. Wiley continued that the Soviet Union and other countries should be excluded because it is difficult to expect them to cooperate with democratic countries. His suggestion is in accordance with President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey.

### De Gaulle Breaks Silence: Calls for Cooperation between Britain and France, Dissatisfied with the French Constitution; Prime Minister Ramadier Retorts

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] General de Gaulle, breaking six months of silence, spoke to the French people today on a small hill on Brunval beach, twelve miles north of Le Havre, where British and Canadian commandos, supplied with intelligence by French underground operatives, raided and destroyed German radio equipment on the night of February 28, 1942. De Gaulle said that divided opinions, a symbol of decline, have overshadowed the interests of the country. He strongly called for the unity of France and cooperation between Britain and France, hoping that one day the French people would abandon their struggle in the dark. About 10,000 people were present at De Gaulle's speech, including British Ambassador Terfur Cooper and Canadian Ambassador Vanier. De Gaulle also personally laid the foundation stone for a monument to the British and Canadian commandos. After De Gaulle's speech, the crowd repeatedly shouted "De Gaulle in power."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] General de Gaulle's speech was almost entirely devoted to praising the work of the French Resistance. Only at the end did he directly mention French domestic politics. When he mentioned that France was struggling in an unhealthy system, he was clearly referring to the Constitution. In De Gaulle's view, the current French Constitution cannot lead to France's revival. This is why De Gaulle is unwilling to agree to a comeback under the current Constitution, even if advised by the government. But it is clear that De Gaulle is now waiting for his moment. Prime Minister Ramadier has decided to respond immediately after receiving the full text of De Gaulle's speech, which is of great significance. Ramadier delivered a speech in Gatineck today, emphasizing that the Republic is the only political system that can lead to France's revival, stressing that the unity of France's strength is forged by a common concept, not by the temporary brilliance of one person. According to political observers, the arguments in Ramadier's and De Gaulle's speeches are completely opposed. But how this opposition will develop and what the consequences will be will not be clear until De Gaulle delivers another speech in Strasbourg.

### The United States May Return the Korean Issue to the Four Powers for Joint Resolution

[United Press, Washington, 30th] State Department officials recently declared that, after being disappointed in seeking an agreement with the Soviet Union on the Korean issue, the United States may decide to return the issue to the four powers that signed the agreement on Korea in Moscow in December 1945 for resolution. It is said that General Hodge, commander of the US occupying forces in South Korea, also proposed this approach during consultations in Washington last month, saying that seeking an agreement with the Soviet side in Korea is futile and that it would be better to talk directly with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. It is understood that the main policies of the United States towards Korea are as follows: (1) To continue to urge the Soviet Union to fulfill the Moscow Agreement; (2) To provide economic assistance in South Korea to strengthen democratic politics and gradually return power to the Korean people.

Hodge's Transfer Rumors Denied by the State Department

[United Press, Washington, 31st] Lieutenant General Hilldring, Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Occupied Territories Affairs, stated today that, to his knowledge, the report by a certain radio station that Lieutenant General Lee Qiwei, the US representative on the United Nations Military Staff Committee, will replace Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US forces in Korea, is completely inaccurate. "I have not heard of this matter. If this were true, I would know about it." Radio commentator Pierson had stated that, due to the increasing difficulties in Korea, Lieutenant General Lee Qiwei would replace Lieutenant General Hodge, so that if MacArthur returned to the United States, Lee Qiwei could take over his remaining position. At the same time, Fan Xuande, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the State Department, also said that he had not heard of this plan. According to well-informed sources, high-ranking officials here have decided to order Hodge to return to Korea to implement the economic and political plans for aiding South Korea that have been formulated in Washington.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st Dispatch] According to well-informed sources close to General Hodge, commander of the US occupying forces in Korea, the United States will take a tougher stance towards the Soviet Union on the Korean issue and may even launch an economic offensive. Hodge's trip to Washington was responsible for changing US policy towards Korea. The United States is about to launch an economic offensive against the Soviet Union, lending six hundred million US dollars to South Korea within the next three years, or even demanding that the Soviet Union also work to promote the revival of North Korea while the United States lends money to South Korea.

Large numbers of Locomotives Shipped to South Korea in Batches

[United Press, Seoul, 31st] US military authorities announced today that the US government loan to Korea has arrived in Korea on the British ship "Paine." One of them has already undergone safety testing and road testing twice and will soon begin operation. The remaining twenty-nine will be tested near Busan. There are also six ships carrying locomotive engines from Germany at the same time as the "Paine."

### Finger Transplant: A Marvel of Surgical Skill

[Reuters, Birmingham, 30th] After a young worker in Birmingham had his four fingers on his right hand severed, a doctor transplanted a finger from his left hand to his right hand, and his right hand was able to function again.

### Rampant Jewish Terrorists: Six Oil Depots Set on Fire in Haifa

[United Press, Jerusalem, 31st] British troops are again conducting a major search in the Holy City for "Stern Gang" terrorists who destroyed the Haifa oil pipeline. This morning, six oil depots in Haifa were destroyed and burned, with black smoke rising into the sky. Buildings near several oil depots were completely burned, with losses amounting to four million pounds. In addition to the military police assisting firefighters in their full efforts to put out the fire, a large number of guards were deployed to impose martial law to prevent further accidents. Residents were strictly prohibited from entering or leaving the Jewish quarter of the city.

[United Press, Port of Haifa, 31st] While British troops were escorting a batch of illegal Jewish immigrants to Cyprus today, an explosion occurred in this port, and flames shot into the sky. The fire spread to the vicinity of the mixed oil refinery and the Bright Brand Oil Company's facilities. These illegal immigrants, a total of 1,600 people, attempted to sail into Palestine yesterday on the smuggling ship "Molletz," but were intercepted by British warships. Also yesterday, a British police officer was ambushed and killed by Jewish terrorists.

### Busy Security Council

[United Press, Lake Success, 31st] The United Nations organization has entered a busy week. The Palestinian issue is expected to be formally raised this week, and the US plan to take over the Japanese-mandated islands will also be put to a final vote. Regarding the latter, US officials are confident that the Security Council meeting on Wednesday can be put to a vote. In fact, the only countries that directly oppose the US plan are New Zealand, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, whose five votes are still an obstacle. New Zealand suggests that the agreement for the United States to take over the islands should not be considered final until after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet Union suggests that the Security Council has the right to amend the agreement. The United Kingdom demands that all United Nations countries have equal economic rights on these islands.

### Indian Governor-General Mountbatten Meets with Gandhi and Jinnah

Disturbances Break Out Again in Bombay; Situation is Serious

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 31st] Mahatma Gandhi arrived here today, planning to stay for a few days before resuming his walking tour in Bihar province, intending to reconcile local Hindu and Muslim residents.

[United Press, Tokyo, 31st] The new Japanese political party, the "Democratic Party," was established today. It has 143 prominent members in the current Diet, two more than the largest Japanese party, the Liberal Party. Some observers predict that the competition for second place between the Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party in the April elections will be very fierce, while the first place will undoubtedly belong to the Liberal Party. Because of its long history in politics, the Liberal Party is expected to continue to win a majority of the seats.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] The Japanese Parliament last night, under the combined pressure of the Liberal and Progressive parties, passed the long-debated amendment to the election law by a vote of 170 to 53, defeating the opposition of the Social Democratic Party. This amendment, which stipulates the use of single-name voting and small electoral districts in future elections, has greatly strengthened the power of the two conservative parties and will create a decisive victory for the two parties over their opponents.

### Japanese Police Arrest Koreans Illegally Entering the Country

[United Press, Tokyo, 30th] It is said that Koreans who attempted to enter Japan illegally were verbally requested to apply for assistance from the bureau.

### Considering the Livelihood of Former Employees of the Ex-Concessions After Retirement, Decision to Request the Executive Yuan to Allocate Funds for Emergency Relief: The Clearing Committee Held a Preparatory Meeting Yesterday, Agreeing on Six Points; Date of Payment to Await Central Government Approval

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Committee for Clearing the Official Assets and Obligations of the Former Public and French Concessions held a preparatory meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the City Hall Auditorium. In attendance were Gu Chunfan, Zhu Ping, Hu Wenyuan, Zhao Zengjue, Tang Xingyi, Zha Liangjian, He DeKui, Zhang Fuyun of the Ministry of Finance, Chen Guolian of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others, with Mayor Wu serving as chairman. Participants exchanged opinions, and the meeting adjourned at 5:45 PM. Afterwards, Mayor Wu told reporters that the issues were very complex and that there was still no comprehensive or concrete solution. The committee will convene a formal general meeting on April 3rd. In order to consider the livelihood of various retired employees, the meeting resolved to immediately submit a document to the Executive Yuan requesting the advance allocation of a portion of funds for emergency relief, amounting to approximately 11 billion yuan. Regarding the issue of repayment multiples, Mr. Wu stated that the principle would be not to exceed the current multiple of civil servants' salaries. The final decision rests with the central government, as the municipal government lacks the funds to repay.

The matters discussed at yesterday's meeting were mostly based on the draft resolution of the previous Small Group Committee on the Rights and Interests of Retired Personnel from the Former Public Concession under the Finance Bureau. After discussion and research, the committee reached the following agreements: (1) Regarding the following four items: savings, salary savings, service excellence bonuses, and retirement pay, an initial temporary payment should be made first. Pensions for personnel who retired on or before December 31, 1941, must also be paid immediately and all arrears should be paid accordingly. (2) Calculation Cutoff Date: The aforementioned four rights and interests shall be calculated up to the end of December 1941 and paid in full. (3) Foreign Currency: Sums payable in foreign currency or sums in national currency that the former Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) regulations specified should be converted to foreign currency at the exchange rate should be paid in foreign currency. (4) National Currency: Sums payable in national currency shall be increased and paid according to the salary multiple and other additional factors of municipal government employees at the time of payment. (5) The aforementioned items should be paid in the shortest possible time and should not be delayed without reason. (6) The payment of the aforementioned four items in accordance with this agreement is an initial temporary payment on account and is not a final determination of the total amount due, nor shall the method of calculation be regarded as fixed and unchangeable. This agreement does not resolve the issue of interest and subsidies arising from dismissal. This agreement does not confirm that employees after December 31, 1941, shall not be entitled to compensation.

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, representatives of Chinese employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department, Shen Yaoting, Wu Xucheng, Lang Haiqing, Ren Zhigang, Chen Tingju, Lu Jiandong, and others went to the municipal government to hear the response. More than a thousand employees gathered in the Children's Garden on Suzhou Road and collectively surged to the front of the municipal government building to petition. Upon hearing the news, the mayor was extremely angered and ordered them to disperse immediately, otherwise, the matter would not be handled and the matter would be reported to the central government for cancellation. The petitioning crowd immediately obeyed the order and dispersed, leaving representatives to await news.

After the preparatory meeting adjourned, Mayor Wu immediately met with the petitioning representatives in the conference room and informed them that the committee had decided to submit a document to the Executive Yuan within days, requesting an allocation of 11 billion yuan for compensation. The representatives inquired about the date of payment. Mayor Wu replied that he had no authority to decide and that it would depend on the approval of the central government. The mayor also expressed great dissatisfaction with the repeated gathering of crowds for petitions despite warnings, claiming that the municipal government had done its utmost. Some of the representatives immediately stated that they were senior officials of the former Shanghai Municipal Council and also valued their dignity, and did not wish to show their faces in public. It was only because since the victory, there had been no definite news of compensation, and most of the employees were struggling to make a living, so they were eager to know the exact date of payment. However, the mayor refused to answer the question about the date and immediately rose and left.

### Zhengtai, Biochemical, and Dachina: Gold Purchase Case Dismissed; Loans Had Legal Contracts, Not Constituting Fraud

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the case of Zhengtai Xinji Rubber Factory, China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory, and Dachina Paper Factory using production loans to purchase and hoard gold and US dollars, suspected of disrupting finance and fraud, the District Prosecutor's Office Prosecutor Li Mingshan has completed the investigation and believes that the defendants, Hong Fumei, head of Zhengtai Rubber Factory, Ni Shuzu and He Yichao, heads of Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory, and Liu Xingsun, Dai Huantang, Zhou Shuhua, and Wang Wende, heads of Dachina Paper Factory, should be prosecuted. At the end of last year, Zhengtai and other three factories had problems with capital turnover. After being approved by the Provisional Review Committee for Production Loans of the Four Banks Joint Office, all used 70% of the estimated value of finished products and raw materials as collateral. Zhengtai obtained 800 million yuan, Biochemical obtained 500 million yuan, and Dachina obtained 500 million yuan. The contracts all stated that the loans were specifically designated for purchasing raw materials and increasing production and should not be used for other purposes. Later, Dachina Paper Factory purchased 750 taels of gold on January 7, and Biochemical also purchased 370 taels of gold and 6,635 US dollars on January 20. Zhengtai also purchased more than 500 taels of gold on the 21st and 31st. After being discovered by the roving audit team of the Four Banks Joint Office, the matter was reported by the Supervisory Committee to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on suspicion of disrupting finance and obtaining loans by fraudulent means. Regarding the part of disrupting finance, the prosecutor believed that the principle of law does not apply retroactively is the principle of criminal legislation. The defendants purchased and sold gold before January 31 of this year. At that time, the Economic Emergency Measures Plan had not been promulgated, and the gold was allocated and sold by the Central Bank. Even if the defendants' actions had an impact on financial fluctuations, there was no explicit provision in the law at that time to punish them. We can hardly punish them in law. Regarding the part of fraud, the production loan is a civil pledge contract between the government and the commercial factories. The government lends funds, the commercial factories pay interest, and goods are used as collateral. Moreover, the Four Banks Joint Office had carefully reviewed the contract before signing it. Therefore, the defendants' acquisition of loans did not involve any fraud. Moreover, the purchase and sale of gold and US dollars were legal at that time. Even if the defendants profited from purchasing gold with loans, it was not an illegal acquisition. It does not meet the constituent elements of the crime of fraud. The defendants also presented the accounts of their respective operating manufacturers, proving that all the production loans had indeed been used to purchase raw materials, and that the purchase of gold and US dollars was actually to repay debts. Based on the above facts and reasons, Prosecutor Li acquitted them in accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Xun, the former captain of the Supplement Team of the Third Brigade of the Pseudo-Zhejiang Provincial Security Force, who was previously sentenced to death by the High Court, has been returned by the Supreme Court for reconsideration. The case was reopened for investigation and interrogation in the High Court on February 14. It was continued yesterday afternoon. Liu was wearing a gray wool tweed jacket and spoke with a Hunan accent. Judge Qiu showed the defendant the reply from Wu and the local court, which was investigated and replied by Wu Benli, the head of Lian Shi Town, and others, proving that Liu Dong did commit rape, looting, and murder while stationed in Lian Shi Town. The defendant still tried to deny it, claiming: I run a cigarette shop in Lian Shi Town. When the Third Brigade of the Pseudo-Zhejiang Provincial Security Force was stationed in Lian Shi Town, the team commander He Jianzhang was a fellow villager from Hunan, so I hung a team adjutant title in the supplement team. I left Lian Shi Town in February 34 and went to Shanghai. The informant Qian Minxing was eyeing my property. Wu Benli, the head of Lian Shi Town, gave false testimony because he failed to borrow money from me. I don't know the victims at all. It's purely Wu Benli and Qian Minxing framing me. It's really a grievance. Finally, I requested the court to summon witnesses Zhou, the manager of the Changsha Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Zhou Axiang, a resident of Lian Shi Town, and Sun Fengshun. At this point in the trial, it was decided to postpone the interrogation again and the defendant was sent back to custody.

### Average Price Difference of Six Kinds of Daily Necessities in March: Social Bureau Announced Yesterday; Actual Subsidy of 73,000 Yuan

[Our Newspaper's Report] The average market price difference in March compared with January for the six main daily necessities of municipal workers was officially announced yesterday by the Social Bureau, totaling 72,863 yuan, which will be issued at 73,000 yuan. Every worker in this city who is paid based on the cost of living index will receive a salary in March, in addition to being calculated based on 7,945 times the worker's cost of living index in January and 6,614 times for employees, and the factory will subsidize each person 73,000 yuan. This number is the same as the difference in February (the actual amount in February was 72,965 yuan, which was also calculated and issued at 73,000 yuan). The reason is that the market prices of the six main daily necessities in March, compared with the market prices in February, only coal balls and bean oil rose slightly, while Xian rice, table salt, sugar, and cloth all fell back. Therefore, the actual difference is still 102 yuan smaller compared with February. The detailed difference between March and January is listed as follows:

### Case of Accusation of Killing Cousin: Gu Minyuan's Trial Concluded Awaiting Judgment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Gu Minyuan, the head of the militia team of Guminqiao Township, Haimen, who was accused of killing his cousin Gu Minjiu (the local Communist Party's financial and economic assistant), was tried in the District Court yesterday. The plaintiff, Gu Dechun (the victim's father, the defendant's uncle), stated: On January 19 of this year, the defendant invited Minjiu to gamble at home. At midnight, the victim's wife suddenly heard loud voices outside the room, and stray dogs were barking. She heard her husband cry out "Help!" and then heard the defendant say: "I'll beat you to death." Soon, everything gradually quieted down. Gu Minjiu's wife, Zhang Peiyu, rushed out to investigate and saw that her husband's body was pierced with sharp knife holes, covered in blood, and had died. At that time, because Gu Minyuan was the head of the militia team and had 36 militiamen under his command, they ran rampant in the village, and no one dared to reason with them. On February 13 of this year, Gu Minyuan was also squeezed out by Communist Party members and could not stand his ground, so he fled to Shanghai, which led to his arrest. The defendant, Gu Minyuan, stated during the trial yesterday: He joined the Communist Party at the age of sixteen and was devoted to socialism. His cousin Gu Minjiu, who served as the financial and economic assistant, was sentenced to death for violating party regulations due to embezzlement of public grain and other corrupt acts, but he was not the one who killed him. He now feels that the Communist Party's words and deeds are inconsistent, and donating land and money is too meaningless, so he came to live in Shanghai. After the debate, the court concluded the trial and scheduled the verdict for April 4.

### Shen Bao Red Cross Hospital Co-sponsors Free Childbirth Assistance for Poor Women

Cooperation method is handled in accordance with the simple rules agreed upon between this newspaper and Renhe Hospital. This newspaper, in view of the fact that many poor women in general often damage the health of themselves and their babies due to their inability to afford childbirth expenses, deeply feels that providing relief for "childbirth assistance for poor women" is a pressing task. Therefore, at the beginning of February of this year, it jointly organized the "Free Childbirth Assistance Movement for Poor Women" with Renhe Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital at No. 36 Xiangshan Road in this city. Since it began on February 9, the number of pregnant women applying for assistance in February alone has reached over a hundred. After investigation by this newspaper, except for a small number whose family circumstances are still good, the assistance was temporarily deferred, and all were approved. All approved pregnant women went to the hospital for a physical examination at the designated time and were hospitalized to await delivery. All miscellaneous expenses were waived. On average, each pregnant woman stayed in the hospital for ten days and was treated according to the latest methods, so fortunately, no unfortunate events have occurred, which is also gratifying. Since this newspaper launched the movement, all sectors of society have expressed deep concern, and letters providing opinions have arrived daily. Recently, this newspaper received a letter from the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Huashan Road in this city, responding to this movement and expressing its willingness to join in cooperation and serve the community together. The letter stated in brief: "Regarding the method for poor women to apply for childbirth assistance, our hospital can refer to the method agreed upon between your newspaper and Renhe Hospital for cooperative handling." The people of this newspaper were deeply admired after reading it. It is now decided to formally cooperate on free childbirth assistance matters from today. From now on, all applicants residing in the Western District will be sent to the hospital to await delivery. It is found that this childbirth assistance movement is in its initial stage, and we have been misguidedly encouraged by all circles. We hope that all enthusiastic people and philanthropists at sea will donate more to support this grand undertaking, which will not only be fortunate for poor pregnant women but also a blessing for the country and the nation.

### Letter of Correction

Having read the news about our college in the Wuhu correspondence published in your newspaper on the 20th of this month, it does not correspond with the facts. Upon investigation, our college does not have a "Purge Committee" and Cheng Tiao Fan has never been appointed as the Director of General Affairs. The alleged student strikes and shootings are even more unfounded. During his year as president, President Cheng did a lot of planning and building in a difficult environment. His integrity, moral character, and literary talent are highly respected by all teachers and students in the college. Since last year, President Cheng has repeatedly resigned to the provincial government due to illness, but has not been approved. Recently, after Chairman Li came to Wuhu, he resigned again, and Chairman Li could not retain him and reluctantly granted his request. Chairman Li and all the teachers and students of the college expressed deep regret. Remote rumors are inaccurate. We hereby request that you correct the errors. Secretariat of Anhui College (March 28th)

### Central Bank Rediscount and Loan Committee Holds Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; President Zhang Hopes to Establish a New Financial System

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank Rediscount and Loan Committee held its inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday in the conference room on the third floor of the bank. President Zhang, Vice President Liu, Committee Chairman Qin Runqing, Vice Chairmen Pan Shouheng and Wu Kejia, Committee members Xu Guomao, Li Daonan, Luo Qinghua, Ju Yihong, Shen Rixin, Lu Shuchen, and Wang Zishuang attended. The following were discussed: (1) Amendments passed to the General Rules for Shanghai Commercial Bank's Rediscount Loans. (2) Submitted the list of the Industrial Loan and Export Material Loan Review Committees, to be appointed by the Central Bank. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

According to the Central Bank, its rediscount business has always been conducted through the Four Joint Offices and handled for national banks. Last year, the measures for rediscounting and re-pledging were established, and commercial banks applying to the Central Bank for rediscounting, re-pledging, and re-discounting of foreign exchange were organized by banking syndicates or limited to designated banks handling foreign exchange. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable results. Recently, after President Zhang took office, in order to further strengthen the cooperation between national banks and commercial banks, and to fully supply production funds, with a view to coordinating with the emergency economic measures plan and the economic reform plan passed by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, it was decided to expand the rediscount business. In addition to continuing to handle business for national banks through the Four Joint Offices, a Rediscount and Loan Committee was created within the Central Bank to handle the review of Shanghai commercial banks' applications for rediscount, re-pledging, and re-discounting of foreign exchange.

Two Loan Review Committees Established

At yesterday's meeting, President Zhang read out the articles of the Rediscount Regulations and explained them item by item. The main points of his explanation are excerpted as follows:

(1) The new method establishes a Rediscount and Loan Committee with representatives from the China Communications Bank and commercial banks, as well as representatives from the Clearing House. An Industrial Loan Review Committee is also established, with representatives from the industrial sector and bankers with experience in industrial loans. In addition, an Export Material Loan Review Committee is established, with representatives from the export industry and bankers with experience in export loans, so that the Central Bank and national banks, commercial banks, and the financial sector and the industrial and commercial sectors are integrated into an organic financial and commercial organization. Like the arm being used by the body, and the fingers being used by the arm, they are not only interdependent but also mutually disciplined and jointly bear the mission of economic revival.

(2) The applications submitted by commercial banks or syndicates will first be reviewed by the committee, and after being approved by the President and Vice President of the Central Bank, they will be submitted to the Business Bureau for rediscount, re-pledging, or re-discounting of foreign exchange. The Central Bank's handling of this rediscount business is based on the majority vote, so as to ensure its fairness and reasonableness.

(3) In the past, commercial banks applied to the Central Bank for rediscounting through banking syndicates, and the syndicates applied to the Central Bank. The new method takes the application by the bank alone to the Rediscount and Loan Committee as the principle. Only if the Rediscount and Loan Committee considers it necessary to form a syndicate to handle the application, will the syndicate apply, so that each bank can exert its effectiveness and avoid the drawbacks of procrastination caused by the organization of groups.

(4) In the past, commercial banks were limited to 200 million yuan for each rediscount and re-pledge and 300 million yuan for each re-discount of foreign exchange according to the banking syndicate method. The new method stipulates that the total amount of the original loan applied for by each bank for rediscount, re-pledging, and re-discounting of foreign exchange shall not exceed the bank's paid-up capital and the total amount of deposits at the end of last month (excluding the total amount of statutory deposit reserve), which is wider than in the past. In particular, using the bank's total deposit amount as the standard can further promote banks to devote themselves to attracting deposits.

(5) What the industrial sector currently finds most difficult is that in the intermediate process from purchasing raw materials to manufacturing products, it is impossible to obtain financial accommodation. Exporters also have the same predicament, that is, it is not easy to obtain financial accommodation in the intermediate process from purchasing raw materials to manufacturing finished products that can be loaded for export. The new method stipulates that factories need working capital for packaging, transporting to the destination for sales, and exporters need operating funds for purchasing export materials, sorting, refining, or transporting to ports for export. In this way, sound factories and export industries can avoid wasting energy and time on solving financial difficulties, and concentrate on increasing production and exports.

A Glimpse of the Advantages of the New Method

(6) The new method stipulates that the total amount of the original loan per household shall not exceed: 1. 50 million yuan for discounting, 2. 500 million yuan for pledges, and 3. 1 billion yuan for foreign exchange. The maximum total amount of loan items applied for by the original loan applicant in each syndicate or bank shall not exceed 8% of the bank's deposits. That is, on the one hand, the limit of the loan is relaxed, and on the other hand, restrictions are appropriately added according to the size of each bank's strength.

(7) The new method stipulates that the collateral for the original pledge loan shall be valued at 60% of the value of raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products. The remaining 40% may be pledged at 40% of the value of machines and factory buildings after completing notarization procedures. The 40% of the machines and factory buildings that can be pledged is to encourage commercial banks to imitate national banks and promote the use of machines and factory buildings as collateral to solve the difficulties of factories.

(8) The new method stipulates that the original loan interest rate shall not exceed 3.6% per month, and the Central Bank only takes 1.8%. The intention is to gradually reduce the interest rate and allow producers and exporters to get rid of the shackles of usury.

(9) The new method stipulates that if manufacturers have achieved significant results in increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs, they will not be subject to the loan limit. In other words, more loans can be given to enable sound and progressive manufacturers to receive practical encouragement.

President Zhang concluded: Whether the Central Bank can fulfill its mission as a bank for banks, and whether national and commercial banks can fulfill their mission of assisting the country and promoting production, all depends on whether the rediscount policy is sound. We hope that we can work together to establish a new financial system. Furthermore, the relationship between the Central Bank and commercial banks will be changed from a loose state in the past to a close one, laying the foundation for cooperation between public and private financial institutions in the future. Finally, he also said: This rediscount method will be first implemented in Shanghai, and then resolutely promoted to major cities across the country, in order to achieve broad results and assist in the economic recovery of the country.

### Floating Short-Selling of Government Bonds Downstream

Government bonds yesterday were mostly closed due to profit-taking, triggering floating short-selling. After opening at 14,200 yuan, the unified C bond repeatedly declined. There was a lot of struggle in the middle, and near noon, it finally collapsed, falling to 11,200 yuan before slightly rebounding. As a result, compared with the closing price, A and B bonds each fell by 2,500 yuan, the unified C bond fell by 2,300 yuan, D bonds fell by 2,200 yuan, and the unified E bond also fell by 1,900 yuan. The turnover was more than 10 million yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors of maintaining the credit of unified bonds, and the price was shouted up to 15,000 yuan, but people were divided, and the turnover was not large.

### Mobile Funds Pouring in, Foreign Stocks Rise Smartly

Yesterday, in general, mobile funds poured into foreign stocks. There was a shortage of supply, and major investors from the securities and cloth industries competed to buy again. Ewo Silk started at 25,200 yuan in the early morning and rose to 28,000 yuan. It was once suspended due to the authorities' investigation. In the afternoon, the bulls in the securities industry took profits, and the price fell slightly after rising. As a result, compared with the closing price, British Ewo and Lian Silk each rose by about 45%, and the rest rose by 5% to 10%.

### Central Textiles' Prices Rise Steadily; Coarse and Fine Yarn Equally Popular; Local and External Buyers' Demand Both Improve

The yarn market has suddenly become strong because Central Textiles has recently been raising yarn prices with each period. Yesterday, the price of 20-count yarn was increased by 80,000, arousing the appetite of various buyers. In addition, the price of yarn in North China was reported to be high. Yesterday, Tianjin merchants actively absorbed "Angel" and "Red Helmet" brands in the market, and other merchants followed suit. As a result, the price of 20-count yarn of various brands rose by 120,000 to 200,000, and 42-count double-strand and 32-count yarn also jumped by 200,000 to 300,000. People's sentiment is high, and the trend is very firm, it is said.

Textile Construction Sells Yarn

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Company sold textiles on behalf of the Textile Management Committee as usual, selling a total of 1,903 pieces, including 256 pieces to manufacturers, and 339 pieces of yarn. A total of 1,493 households applied, including 1,155 manufacturers and 338 yarn households.

### Early Thin Rice Falls

Yesterday, more than 13,000 piculs of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets, with Southern Japonica rice being the most abundant. Therefore, the price of early thin rice fell sharply by 2,000 yuan across the board, and Northern Japonica rice also fell by more than 1,000 yuan. Indica rice was also reduced by 1,000 yuan. The arrival and sales of white yuan and cloudy yuan were balanced, and there was no increase or decrease for the time being. Flour is trending firmly, foreign flour has risen slightly by 300-500 yuan, domestic flour is stable, and bran has increased slightly by 200-300 yuan. Soybean cake from Shantou continues to arrive, advancing by 1,000 yuan, but the trend is fluctuating and difficult to grasp.

There are not many incoming goods in the oil market, and retail sales are still strong. Soybean oil is very scarce, barrel of unrefined peanut oil increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while barrel of unrefined peanut oil rose by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Sesame oil is stable, and clear oil is firm.

The source of soybeans from Northeast China has decreased, and there is also a rumor of a ban on exports in a telegram from Hankou. Both peas and soybeans have rebounded by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and broad beans are firmly priced. Mung beans remain at their original price, and red beans are firm. Wheat is stable, corn has risen slightly by 1,000 yuan, and broad beans are showing a firm and stable trend. Raw peanuts are very sluggish in foreign shops, and downstream demand continues. The price has fallen by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, and sesame seeds are ostensibly stable but actually tight.

### Representatives of the Wool Textile Association Petition to the Import Management Committee

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Cheng Nianpeng, Chairman of the Wool and Velvet Textile Industry Association of this city, and Secretary Yang Liren, yesterday brought a petition from the association requesting a relaxation of the wool import quota, as well as statistical forms, and visited Director Li Han of the Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee. Director Li was away on official business, and Hu Jiaju, a specialist from the office, met with them instead. Mr. Hu stated that the office had no authority to decide on the relaxation of the quota. He would forward the requests to Director Li. It is now heard that the wool textile industry will also submit petitions to the Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee and the National Economic Commission, requesting a relaxation of the quota. In particular, they plan to request that the quota for wool imports in the next quarter should be relaxed as much as possible.

### Interest on the First Tranche of US Dollar Bonds to Be Calculated Starting Today

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance has officially ordered the Central Bank to handle the issuance of the first tranche of US dollar treasury bonds, totaling US$200 million, starting today. However, relevant authorities at the Central Bank stated yesterday that they had not yet received any orders from the Ministry of Finance, nor had they received any pre-sale coupons. However, according to a responsible person, the commencement of issuance today actually refers to the technical aspect. That is, today is the date on which interest begins to accrue on the first tranche of bonds. All bonds in the first tranche will accrue interest from today, regardless of the actual date of underwriting, and this is unrelated to whether actual trading will commence today. Furthermore, although the Fund Management Committee has decided to be located in this city, the list of members has not yet been announced. It is said that eleven people have been hired as committee members, including Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Luo Qinghua, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Li Fusun, Shen Rixin, Xu Jibin, and Qin Runqing.

### Fine Cloth Dye Factories Make Progress

Tianjin Merchants Search for Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji

The cotton cloth market opened steadily yesterday. Then, Tianjin merchants searched for "Four Gentlemen" Yuan Biji, pushing the price from 158,000 yuan to 160,000 yuan. Moreover, the Textile Construction Company had not listed prices for two consecutive periods, leading to a positive shift in sentiment. Dye factories for white cloth took advantage of the low prices to absorb stock. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose by 2,000 yuan compared to before the closure, reaching 157,000 yuan. Other cloths such as "Blue Chicken," "Blue Phoenix," "Yang Crane," and "Zhenzhong" also did well, rising from 1,000 to 4,000 or 5,000 yuan. Bleached cloth and coarse cloth sold well and were in good condition. The markets for other aniline dyes and colored cloth were stable.

### Sugar Prices Are Consistently Firm

Yesterday, the sugar industry made progress, and the market situation remained tight. White sugar fluctuated more, with a difference of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Peruvian sand even reached 10,000 yuan. The association set the price for Peruvian fine sand at 237,000 yuan at first, then reduced it slightly by 1,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 242,000 yuan, then to 3,000-4,000-5,000-6,000 yuan, then from 8,000 yuan to 7,500 yuan, and finally to 240,000 yuan, similar to last Saturday. Medium-grain white sugar rose by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan due to a shortage of goods, and four-and-a-half carts of white Chao goods rose by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The price of three-and-a-half carts of white sugar barely changed. Taiwan red sugar rose by nearly 10,000 yuan, and local sugar also rose by 4,000-5,000 yuan to 1,000-2,000 yuan. Shantou Qing sugar opened at 144,000-5,000 yuan, Shunde Qing sugar at 140,000 yuan, and Diao Qing sugar at 131,500 yuan to 2,000-3,000 yuan. Xing red sugar was 140,000 yuan for high-quality goods and 134,000-5,000 yuan for ordinary goods. 600-700 pieces were transacted.

### The Bituminous Coal Market Is Even More Sluggish

Yesterday, the sentiment in the bituminous coal market was weak, and individual households continued to sell off. Small amounts of coal from Fengcheng blocks (Jiangxi), Po Le Tong (Hubei), and Chenshan dregs (Jiangxi) were also transported, leading to a further weakening of the market. The arrival of high-quality white coal blocks was minimal, and the market price remained firm. Low-quality Guibaoqing blocks and Shantou blocks were soft. The charcoal market was also sluggish. Charcoal merchants were promoting sales to robust wholesalers by offering concessions.

### Pre-Qingming New Longjing and Wenzhou Goods May Be the First to Be Offered

According to fellow merchants, the pre-Qingming new Longjing tea, which is regarded as a treasure by Chinese people, is developing in all production areas as the weather warms. It is said that Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, will be the first to arrive in Shanghai with new tea in a short time. However, it is expected that the selling price will not be low due to the large expenses of all kinds of taxes. As for various types of domestic old tea, the sales of this street and foreign merchants are still scarce. However, those who hold the goods are waiting attitude, so the process continues to support the tea market. The sound of selling is becoming more and more intense, because this year's new tea will soon be on the market, so the holders are very eager to sell the old tea. Unfortunately, the importers are still hesitant, so the market presents a state of oversupply, and the market trend is bleak. Transactions are also in dire straits.

### Fir and Western Pine Arrive in Shanghai

Weak Actual Sales Lead to a Return to Softness in the Market

Recently, the source of local timber has become more abundant. 8 million feet of fir arrived before, and another 3 to 4 million feet have arrived now. There are also many arrivals of Western pine. Due to the tightening of transportation lines, the arrival of Hangzhou timber has decreased compared to before. Actual sales are sluggish, and the market is returning to weakness. Western pine is priced at 3,700 yuan per foot, and five-cent sawn pine planks are priced at 75,000 yuan. The asking price for Hangzhou timber is 300,000 yuan per pair. It is heard that the highest price in Hangzhou is 170,000 to 180,000 yuan, so the price is also entering a weak state. The selling price of large fir logs is 960 yuan per foot, and small logs are 860 yuan.

### The Import Temporary Management Committee Adjusts Its Internal Structure

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Import Management Committee has been formally reorganized by Zhang Jia'ao, Chairman of the Executive Committee, since April 1st, as follows:

(1) Li Gan, Director of the Quota Allocation Office, is responsible for the allocation and review of the quota for goods listed in Annex (II). (The first five items in Annex (II) are still subject to review by the Imported Goods Management Office.)

(2) Yu Yingjie, Director of the Non-Quota Import Review Office, is responsible for the review of imports of goods listed in Annex (I) and Annex (III) A.

(3) Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Imported Goods Management Office, is responsible for the allocation and review of imports of the first five items in Annex (II), and for issuing import permits for all items in Annexes I, II, and III A.

(4) Yang Heng, Director of the Secretariat, is responsible for the registration of import applications and liaison between various departments.

(5) Xu Jiyi, Chairman of the Special Committee, and members Zhang Fuyun, Chen Changtong, Gui Zhongshu, and Yang Heng, are responsible for general appeals and matters relating to changes in the goods listed in the various annexes.

In the future, all applications for import documents can be directly contacted with the relevant departments according to the nature of the goods, so as to avoid the past twists and turns of delivery. However, special application documents from government agencies are handled by the Secretariat.

### Huzhou Wool Rises

Huzhou wool, the market continued to be strongly sought after yesterday, and the price rose again, to 150,000 yuan per Sima dan. Goat wool also rose to 60,000 yuan per dan. The price of Shandong wool remains at its original level.

### Palys Is Scarce and Expensive; Hot Weather Has Triggered Actual Sales

Due to the warm weather, actual sales of Palys have been triggered, and merchants from other places are purchasing more actively than those on this street. Palys suits are still quite popular in other places. Due to the lack of stock in the Shanghai market, sales are average, resulting in demand exceeding supply, and prices have generally become firmer. Yesterday, the wholesale price of Grade 1 goods was 160,000 yuan per yard, Grade 2 was 140,000 yuan, Grade 3 was 120,000 yuan, and Grade 4 was 95,000 yuan.

### The Oil Pressing Industry Hopes That the Authorities Will Supply Soybeans at a Fair Price

[Reported by Our Newspaper] According to sources in the oil pressing industry, based on the current market price of 90,000 yuan per dan of soybeans, the net cost of pressing soybean oil is about 400,000 yuan per dan. The current negotiated price of soybean oil is 250,000 yuan per dan, which is far from enough. However, relying solely on adjusting the negotiated price cannot fundamentally solve the problem. Each time the negotiated price is adjusted, the raw materials for oil pressing rise again. As a result, the production cost is not enough again. Therefore, the thorough solution is still to ask the authorities to supply soybeans at a fair price, so as to maintain the production of edible oil. Recently, various private factories have stopped pressing soybean oil due to a shortage of soybeans. However, the source of cottonseed is still sufficient, so the production of oil has not been interrupted.

### The Pharmaceutical Industry Association Sends a Joint Telegram to the Chairman to Pay Respects

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Recently, Chairman Chiang has observed that the pharmaceutical industry is related to national health and the future of national defense. The other day, he personally instructed the competent authorities to provide as much support and facilitation as possible for its revival. The 83 member factories of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city were greatly encouraged upon hearing the news, and specially sent a joint telegram to pay their respects, and also expressed their gratitude to the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Health.

### Daylily Production Price Rises

The production price of daylily has been rising for days, increasing by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. This trend follows, and the market price was particularly high yesterday, calling for more than 500,000 yuan for high-quality goods, and 410,000 to 420,000 yuan was also needed for ordinary goods.

### Limited Trading After the Holiday; The Chinese Stock Market Is Stable

The Chinese stock market was firmer in the middle of yesterday's trading, due to the news that US dollar bonds were being offered for free subscription and that yarn prices were rising. However, there was limited trading. After some long positions were closed, the market declined slightly again at the end. The market opened strong in the morning due to good sentiment, and Di Yong Yarn Nos. 186, 97, 151, 89, 47, 223, 219, and 179 all advanced.

### The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Has Been Revived!

— Hangzhou News on March 26th, Our Hangzhou Correspondent Huang Xing Tian

On the morning of March 25th, as the spring sun shone on the shores of West Lake, a black locomotive slowly pulled a few simple passenger and material cars south from the station building of Chengzhan Huabao. Although those tourists who came to Hangzhou to visit West Lake didn't even look at it, it undoubtedly bears a huge responsibility for the economic value of Southeast China.

Road Administration Takes on a Heavy Responsibility

Before the Japanese army surrendered, the Jiangbian to Jinhua section, 185 kilometers long, had been repaired and opened to traffic by the Japanese army, and heavy rails were laid to meet their military occupation requirements. Later, the war situation evolved, becoming increasingly unfavorable to the enemy. In the summer of 1945, the Japanese army began to dismantle the tracks, and locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars were gradually transported to the Jinghu and Jinpu lines. By the eve of victory, only the Hangzhou to Zhuji section, 77 kilometers long, remained, with three locomotives, nine passenger cars, and fifty-nine freight cars. After victory, it was ordered to be taken over. At that time, the Hang-Ji section was under the "Central China Railway Management Committee." Under the "Management Committee," the "Hang-Ji Section General Office" was established, and it was received on October 1st. The "Management Committee" was then dissolved on March 1st, and reorganized into the Jinghu District Railway Administration. The "Hang-Ji Section Office" and the Nanxun Section were ordered to be handed over to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for takeover. In April, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau was formally established.

After the Hang-Ji section was taken over, the speed of the trains was very slow due to years of disrepair, averaging only 20 kilometers per hour. Due to the problem of material supply, it could not be improved. The re-railing work on other sections was even more impossible to start. For example, the Japanese army spent only 20 days to lay tracks and open traffic on the 108 kilometers from Zhuji to Jinhua, but we could not start construction due to various difficulties. In the twelve months after the victory, the progress of the repair work was very slow. The Jiangshan to Quzhou section was finally opened to traffic on New Year's Day this year.

Bridge and Culvert Projects Are Repaired First

The most difficult part of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway repair work is the bridge and culvert project, followed by steel rails, sleepers, and funding. For more than a year, many projects have been repeatedly delayed under the predicament of waiting for money and materials, and there is also a little bit of human influence. As for the lack of vehicles, the number is even greater. According to statistics, there are currently only 19 locomotives, 28 passenger cars, and 251 freight cars. It is estimated that 88 locomotives, 131 passenger cars, and 846 freight cars are needed for phased opening to traffic; if the whole line is opened to traffic, 140 locomotives, 296 passenger cars, and 1,250 freight cars are needed.

The slow restoration of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has a significant impact on the livelihood and economy of the entire Southeast region, and it is urgent to re-rail the entire line. In view of this, the central government urgently sought to speed up the repair, and appointed Hou Jiayuan as the director of the Railway Bureau on New Year's Day this year. Mr. Hou is a senior figure in the engineering field. Before the war, he presided over the construction of the Yuping section and made great contributions. Now he is in charge of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway administration, and the expectations of all parties for him are also very high. After Mr. Hou took office, in order to speed up the repair of bridge and culvert projects, he specially divided the large bridges above 100 meters on the entire line into three bridge construction zones. The first bridge construction zone is located in Jinhua, supervising the construction of large bridges such as the Jinhua River, Yishan Port, and Dongyi River between Jinhua and Hengxian; the second bridge construction zone is located in Liangjiadu, supervising the construction of large bridges such as the Shangwan Port, Dengjia Port, and Fuzhou River tributary between Shangrao and Nanchang; the first and third bridge construction zones are located in Zhangshu, supervising the construction of large bridges such as the Shanxi, Shanqian, Ganjiang tributary, and Yuanshan bridges between Nanchang and Pingxiang. The foundation project is scheduled to be completed before the spring flood. On the other hand, six engineering offices were established in Zhuqu, Qurao, Raoxiang, Nanxun, Nanping, and Pingzhu to be responsible for repairing and re-railing projects. At the same time, the transportation undertaking of the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan this year also takes the restoration of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway as a major work item; and in order to ensure the responsibility of the work and simplify the procedures, relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Communications, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, and the Provincial Government were invited to form a special committee to be responsible for the storage, transportation, and distribution of materials.

The Progress of the Engineering in Various Sections is Urgent

Among the engineering projects in various sections, the Zhuji-Jinhua section has been completed first. The section is 108 kilometers long. Construction has started day and night since February 1, with a fast speed of 204 to 2.4 kilometers of track laying per day, achieving surprisingly good results. With the concerted efforts of all employees, the track laying was completed on March 17, and the entire section was opened to traffic on the 25th, more than one month ahead of the scheduled opening date, creating a new record for the repair of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.

As for the progress of other sections of the project, the following is the information: (1) The road art and bridges on the 23-kilometer Jinhua to Lanxi section have been largely repaired. If materials can be supplied, traffic can be opened at the end of this month; (2) The track-laying project on the Nanxun section was previously blocked by the Saihu Bridge, which is 20 kilometers away from Jiujiang. The bridge project is about to be completed, and the Ministry of Communications has set a deadline for restoring traffic by the end of April; (3) The bridge between Shangrao and Nanchang has now started; (4) The survey of Baitang to Pingxiang has also started; and the Pingxiang to Zhuzhou section has started paving, and is expected to open to traffic on the 10th of next month. As long as the Railway Bureau can continue to work with the spirit of building the Zhuji-Jinhua section, the reporter believes that the opening of the entire line is not far away.

Future Plans to Supplement Equipment

In the future plans of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Railway Bureau plans to gradually revive and supplement the equipment of this only transportation artery spanning the southeastern provinces in order to cooperate with the development of the national railway construction and transportation plan, so that it can appear on the Southern Plains with a new look. This is the hope of the Railway Bureau and the hope of the people of Southern China. Currently, the largest project that the Railway Bureau is undertaking is the construction of the Xiaoshan Locomotive Plant. In order to cooperate with locomotive affairs, strengthen transportation efficiency, and seek self-sufficiency in spare parts and accessories, a large locomotive plant with a area of 500 mu and capable of accommodating more than 1,000 workers is planned to be built in Xiaoshan. A plan and budget have been prepared and are ready to be approved before construction begins. As for the machinery and equipment of the locomotive plant, the budget for the first phase is US$6,046,276,000, US$148,789,200 for the second phase, and US$109,840,000 for the third phase. The total number of machines is 165 types, with a tonnage of 122,035 tons. The estimated cost of small tool equipment for the locomotive plant is US$4,401,308. After the completion of the entire plant, the repair capacity will be 54 locomotives, 380 passenger cars, and 1,000 freight cars per year, 500 tons of castings, 200 tons of pigs, and 60 tons of other standard accessories and tools, so as to supply other plants and sections for application. As for the relocation of the locomotive plant during the war, 80 tons of large and small machines were taken away by the Third Branch of the Ordnance Industry Department, and they have now been recovered and transported from Nanping to provide existing temporary machinery and businesses in Xiaoshan for the purpose of manufacturing vehicles and generating electricity.

Few Vehicles are Asked to be Increased

At present, the Hang-Ji section has only three vehicles and three alternative passenger vehicles; now the length of the Hangzhou-Jinhua section is more than doubled. Although merchants have been recruited to build six passenger cars and a part of the freight cars have been approved and allocated, they are still insufficient to cope with the current crowded passenger and freight transportation. Therefore, a telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Communications to increase the allocation. As for the lack of locomotives, two locomotives have been rented from the Jinpu Railway at a price of 600,000 yuan per month to solve the temporary needs. If the entire line is opened to traffic, more vehicles will be needed. In March of this year, the Ministry of Communications convened a meeting of directors of railway bureaus from all regions across the country and decided that the Longhai Railway would allocate 56 locomotives and 600 freight cars, but they have not been allocated for a long time. Now, because the three sections of Hangzhou-Jinhua, Nanxun, and Zhupi will start traffic one after another, the demand is urgent, and it has been discussed with the Longhai Railway to transport the vehicles in two phases: (1) via the Jinpu and Jinghu lines to Hangzhou for the use of the Hangzhou-Jinhua section; (2) via the Pinghan line to Hankou to load ships to Jiujiang for the use of the Nanxun section; (3) via the Pinghan and Yuehan lines to Zhuzhou for the use of the Zhupi section. The Ministry of Communications has been asked to transfer the allocation as soon as possible, and the Ministry has first allocated United Nations-bound freight cars to Shanghai, including 10 cars with 40-ton low sides and 4 cars with 20-ton high sides, which have been used in the Hang-Ji section.

Expand Business and Protect Safety

In terms of transportation business, such as planning to restore passenger and freight trains in various sections, it is planned that the Hangzhou-Jinhua section will run five round trips per day, the section will run three round trips, the southern section will run four round trips, and the Ping-Zhu section will run into the decision, and two-class cars will be added to improve the passenger train facilities and add various equipment. It is also planned to increase the allocation of freight cars and restore the responsible transportation of goods to facilitate merchants and protect safety. The business of paying freight, collecting freight prices, sending tickets, and handling bills of lading will also be restored item by item. In order to find a way to attract large cargo transportation, a special price for goods will be set, and the classification table of goods set by the Ministry will be implemented to achieve its rationalization.

The development of railway transportation originally sought to promote the prosperity of industries along the line; and the prosperity of industries depends on the convenience of transportation. The quantity of paper, porcelain, tea, tobacco, salt, rice, fruits, livestock, coal, etc. produced along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and transported to other places every year is very large. The Railway Bureau also plans to maintain close contact with the industrial and commercial circles in various places, such as assisting in improving product packaging, improving manufacturing technology, promoting product sales, transmitting business information from various places, and financing turnover, so as to develop industries along the line. In order to facilitate merchants and travelers in various places, it will cooperate with the transportation offices directly under the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications, as well as railways such as Jinghu, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Yuehan to carry out joint passenger and freight transportation. The Hangzhou-Jinhua section is now open to traffic. Personnel have been sent to negotiate the joint transportation between Shanghai and Jiangxi, and it will be realized as soon as the method is decided.

In this way, on the one hand, the implementation of modern railway management can be compared with the railways of other countries, and on the other hand, the combination of north and south railways constitutes a tight transportation network. The value of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is significant. Under the new measures of Director Hou, the full opening of the stack is just around the corner, and how many southeastern compatriots will be cheering for it!

### Taipei Incident Turns Clear After the Rain (Continued)

— Pai Ya

The government having completely accepted the demands of the citizens, this matter should have been peacefully resolved. However, the public continued to make unsystematic proposals, which the government tried its best to adopt. On the 2nd, Director Chen again met with representatives of the people to listen to their opinions and made four additional decisions: (1) Those who participated in this incident will not be prosecuted; (2) Arrested people can be claimed by their parents from the military police; (3) Compensation will be provided for the dead and injured, regardless of whether they are from this province or other provinces; (4) The handling committee will add representatives from all sectors of the people to accommodate the opinions of the majority of the people. Director Chen broadcast to the public at 3 PM on the 2nd, solemnly announcing the above four measures. However, the results were still ineffective. The rioters continued to run rampant, becoming even more extreme. The handling committee added representatives from all sectors of the people, and the hooligans took this opportunity to form large groups. As a result, more and more proposals were made. Originally a local matter due to the suppression of opium, it eventually brewed into political reform.

Fearing No End to Chaos

Speaking of the organization of the February 28th Incident Handling Committee, as the name suggests, its task was only to assist the government in handling this February 28th anti-smuggling incident. However, the purpose of the committee members was not this. They wanted to use this incident to overthrow the Governor-General's Office and change it to a provincial government, and demand that positions of director be filled by people from this province. The intention of Sima Zhao is obvious to everyone. Because of their ill motives, they not only failed to dissuade the hooligans who were killing and setting fires, and the emotionally charged people who lacked reason and echoed them, from quickly restoring social order, but even occupied the broadcasting station, openly inciting the public to rebel, fearing no end to the chaos, in order to achieve their ulterior motives.

The Sharpness of Ambitious People

In addition to a small number of committee members who were sent by the government to participate in the organization, most of the rest were so-called people's representatives. These so-called people's representatives were mostly people with no national concept, who did not understand national laws, who were parochial, and blindly followed others. They occupied the broadcasting station all day long, arbitrarily expressed their opinions, stirred up unrest, formed illegal organizations, and used alarming words to confuse the public. They even praised the hooligans who specialized in killing unarmed people from other provinces, and who were killed, as revolutionary martyrs. This is truly the greatest joke in the world, and a clear sign of betraying the country. However, in order to achieve a peaceful solution, the government did not want bloodshed to occur, and explained the greater good, and reluctantly accepted their demands. It also strictly ordered the police and military police not to fire on the rioting people. Therefore, after the incident, many police officers had their firearms confiscated by the hooligans, and were beaten and injured or killed. Who knew that they not only could not understand the government's difficulties, but became even more extreme. The opium suppression case originally only occurred in one corner of Taipei City, but they took the opportunity to notify all 17 counties and cities in the province to establish February 28th handling committees, planting their own party members everywhere, and echoing each other from afar. Their intentions can be imagined. As the organization gradually grew larger, their rebellious hearts became more and more determined, and their demands became even harsher and more unreasonable. For example, demanding the disarming of the military police and the abolition of the Garrison General Headquarters, and demanding that the National Army surrender its weapons, were all treasonous intentions. They also organized a loyal and righteous service team, whose members were mostly hooligans, responsible for maintaining local security. At the same time, students from Mt. Ali Middle School also organized a so-called autonomous youth alliance, expressing their opinions and participating in maintaining security, occupying institutions everywhere, calling it taking over. Even students in their teens participated in the actions. Such absurdity is truly an unprecedented wonder.

The first institutions to be taken over were those in Taichung City. The only power plant in the province and the Railway Committee were also occupied and controlled by them. All public officials from other provinces in Taichung City were concentrated in the former Japanese concentration camp, given a bowl of sour rice a day, and arbitrarily insulted, glorifying it as protection. Taipei City's Da Ming Bao newspaper published a sensational article, reporting that the price of rice fell after the people from other provinces were concentrated. They used large headlines to gloat over this unreasonable behavior. Let's calm down and think about it. There were only a few hundred public officials from other provinces in Taichung City. Before they were concentrated, the so-called rice consumption was extremely small. How could they be the main reason for the rise in rice prices? Moreover, Taichung is the most abundant grain-producing area in Taiwan. In fact, this time, all parts of the country were affected by the economic impact of Beijing and Shanghai, and prices rose endlessly. To prevent this phenomenon, the authorities in Jiangsu Province took emergency measures, prohibiting the trading of gold and registering grain. These landlords and capitalists, seeing that they could not manipulate the situation to make illegal fortunes, were unwilling in their hearts. Therefore, they used the February 28th opium suppression incident as an excuse to instigate a group of hooligans who had always been supported by them to create trouble and cause chaos. The treacherous party also took advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to participate in inciting discord, resulting in this act of betraying the country. It is heartbreaking to talk about!

Since the February 28th incident in Taipei occurred, the storm spread from the 1st and 2nd to Keelung in the north and Kaohsiung in the south, with huge waves and storms rising in every corner of the province. Although the government made many concessions, it still could not satisfy their desires. For a time, it almost fell into a state of anarchy. Trains stopped running, ships stopped sailing, postal services were interrupted, shops were deserted, institutions were closed, etc. The losses to the public and private sectors, and the suffering of the people, were countless.

Selling Dog Meat While Hanging Up a Sheep's Head

The organization of this handling committee was fundamentally a gathering of foxes and dogs. It was called demanding political reform, but in fact, they all wanted to compete for official positions, demanding that county and city officials be elected by the people, and that all senior and junior personnel should be from this province. If it was necessary to use people from other provinces, it should be approved by the handling committee. Director Chen, believing that they were sincere in participating in the reform of the province's politics, agreed to change the Governor-General's Office to a provincial government, and to use as many people from this province as possible for the positions of director of each department. He also notified them to submit a list so that they could be recommended to the central government. Each county and city put forward three candidates for county and city mayor so that they could be selected. However, internal strife broke out at this point. They all wanted to seize the opportunity to have their names listed on the list. However, there were few official positions, and many people wanted to become officials. There were too many monks and not enough porridge, and it was fundamentally difficult to distribute. As a result, everyone began to attack each other. Flyers attacking Chiang Wei-chuan, Lu Bo-xiong, etc., flew all over the streets. Those who were attacked had spent a great deal of effort to create this incident, so how could they be defeated? As a result, everyone began to conspire against each other and submit opinions to the Governor-General's Office, hoping to be registered. The true political reform, the suffering of the people, and the aftermath of the opium suppression case that should have been discussed, had been thrown to the winds. Were they patriots or traitors? This is clearly visible.

From beginning to end, the government sincerely accepted the demands of the people, adopting everything within the legal scope. However, these unreasonable and ambitious people were hypocritical. On the one hand, they still instigated hooligans to loot warehouses and attack military institutions everywhere. They were deeply incited by traitors and were completely unaware. They regarded the government's leniency as incompetence. In Taichung and Tainan, they disarmed the government's weapons, took them away, and slaughtered domestic compatriots, recklessly doing whatever they wanted! The bad habits left by Japanese fascism still existed!

Chairman Chiang and Director Chen believed that Taiwan had been separated from the motherland for more than 50 years, and had suffered greatly from the ravages of Japanese invaders. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was returned to the motherland, and leniency was shown everywhere. Regarding the occurrence of this incident, Chairman Chiang clearly stated during the Central Memorial Week, and Director Chen also broadcast three times to the people, declaring the government's attitude. The Supervisory Yuan also sent Yang Liang-gong, the supervisory envoy of Min and Taiwan, to Taiwan to investigate. Based on this, if they were truly demanding political reform, they should have made requests to the authorities in a legal and reasonable manner, and the government would have accepted them.

Forced to Sing Japanese Songs

Who knew that these ambitious people incited a large number of hooligans to attack the Keelung Fortress Headquarters and the Taipei Garrison General Headquarters at 11 PM on the 8th, attempting to occupy them. The sound of gunfire that night was like a string of firecrackers, rarely interrupted. It was said that the number of traitors was very large, hoping to take them down in one fell swoop. That night, in the cold wind and heavy rain, everyone had been living in uncertainty for several days. Suddenly hearing the fierce gunfire, they were all frightened, their faces showing the color of death. This shows the intensity of the hooligans' attack that night, and the fact that they were betraying the country was even more obvious. The Governor-General's Office and the Garrison General Headquarters, seeing that these ambitious people were so stubborn and had no sincerity in reforming the government, and that they were carrying out their rebellion, imposed martial law on the 9th in order to maintain local order and protect the good people. When the storm reached Taichung, the area was also full of hooligans. Under the call of ambitious people, they swarmed up and attacked warehouses, confiscated weapons from the military police, and insulted people from other provinces. The heads of all institutions (people from other provinces) and public school teachers from other provinces were all concentrated and monitored, losing their freedom. Among them were men, women, old and young, who were forced to sing Japanese national songs. However, some small business owners bribed them with money and were recognized as "good citizens." After issuing a "good citizen certificate" written in Japanese, they were released. Isn't this a strange thing! Huang Shi, the design section chief of the Kaohsiung Port Bureau, was detained in the so-called concentration camp after taking a train south to Taichung on official business. He took the opportunity to escape. This is what Huang Shi experienced firsthand.

Xie E's Righteousness is Inspiring

When the province was in extreme chaos and the public was in turmoil, Ms. Xie E, a representative of the National Assembly of Taiwan Province, tried to persuade them not to go beyond the norm and to act rationally. Not only did she fail, but she was also beaten and insulted by rioters, and her personal property, equipment, and medicines (Ms. Xie's hospital) were completely destroyed. Although Ms. Xie knew that under the collusion of ambitious people and local hooligans, the situation was out of control, she stood up to stop them out of righteous indignation for the country and the nation, unafraid of violence. Her spirit and courage are truly a disgrace to men. On the other hand, there were many representatives of the National Assembly, councilors, provincial and county councilors, and self-proclaimed social elites whose status and reputation were no less than Ms. Xie's. They all wanted to fish in troubled waters, push the boat along, and do everything to get the flower. They occupied the radio station, spoke loudly, incited the public, printed Japanese extra editions, and incited the hearts of the people, hoping to emerge as leaders. This is truly "Ah Q's rebellion," with nothing to add.

High-Ranking Officials and Large Armies Arrive

After the central government received the report of the turmoil in Taiwan Province, the Supervisory Yuan immediately ordered Yang Liang-gong, the supervisory envoy of Min and Taiwan, to come to Taiwan to investigate and comfort the people. Supervisor Yang took a warship from Fuzhou to Taiwan and arrived in Keelung on the 8th. The handling committee used the excuse of welcoming him and led a large number of people to greet him, with ulterior motives. At that time, Supervisor Yang's motorcade consisted of several cars, led by military police and attendants. He himself was in the last car. On the way, the car was intercepted and attacked by traitors. Some of the attendants were injured. Fortunately, the military police provided strong protection and he was able to escape. Their poisonous intentions, attempting to assassinate high-ranking officials and betray the country, are beyond reproach!

According to reports from the central government, the priority was to attack military institutions, attempting to disarm them and openly carry out actions to betray the country. This was no longer an ordinary legal political demand. Therefore, the 21st Division of the Army was sent to Taiwan to maintain security, stabilize social order, and protect the good people. It arrived safely in Keelung on the 9th, landed and stationed in Taipei City, and then advanced to various counties and cities.

The so-called February 28th Incident Handling Committee, which was illegally organized, was now deserted. Knowing that their actions were wrong and would be punished by the country, they all fled. The hooligans scattered. The young students who occupied the police stations and the illegal takeover committees of various institutions also fled. Everything was deserted, and no one dared to be as arrogant and showy as they had been a few days ago. It is true that evil cannot prevail over good. In an instant, the atmosphere that had permeated the entire island of Taiwan for several days gradually dissipated, and the sun shone again.

Since the 9th, after the national army successively entered the counties and cities, illegal groups were resolutely disbanded, traitors and criminals were eliminated, and the good people were comforted. All order was immediately restored to normal. All institutions resumed normal operations. The chimneys of various factories and fields also began to smoke again. The people from other provinces who had been concentrated in Taichung City also regained their freedom. All sectors in Taitung County sent a telegram to the province to retain County Magistrate Xie Zhen to continue his term. All sectors in Taichung City sent a telegram to the provincial government to retain Mayor Huang Keli. The Hsinchu City Council sent a telegram to Director Chen to pay their respects and sent personnel to Taipei to welcome County Magistrate Zhu Wenbo back to his post. The Penghu County Council also sent a telegram to Director Chen to pay their respects and report on the situation in the county. All counties and cities reported that order had been restored, trains were running north and south without obstruction, prices were gradually falling, ships to and from the south and north began to sail, and everything returned to its former state. However, in order to thoroughly eliminate traitors and criminals, the authorities will conduct a census in order to protect the good people. For more than ten days, the 6 million people of the province were shrouded in gloom, barely able to breathe. After the 9th, everything returned to normal. Order was restored, the streets were lively, shops were open, and pedestrians were crowded, all showing joy. It was also a great spring day, the weather was clear, and the peach and plum trees were competing for beauty, presenting a picture of prosperity. Finally, we hope that all compatriots in Taiwan, after this painful experience, will thoroughly understand the country and the nation, and work with the government to build our beautiful Taiwan into a model province! Be alert! Fellow Taiwanese!

Reply to Mr. Bu Zaitisheng: Regarding your letter asking about the standard of secondary education fees in Jiangsu Province, we have recently received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education stating: "The regulations for the collection of student fees by provincial, county, city, and private secondary schools in this province for the 36th year have long been submitted to and approved by the 77th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. Subsequently, the Provincial Boy Scouts Council sent a letter requesting that primary secondary schools increase the collection of 3,000 yuan for Boy Scout activity equipment fees, which was also approved by the 84th meeting of the Government Committee, and orders were issued separately for compliance. We are now sending a copy of the fee collection regulations for provincial, county, city, and private secondary schools for your reference." The three copies of the regulations sent are very long, and this column is limited in space and cannot be published in full. Since you have been notified that orders have been issued, please consult the educational institutions nearby for information.

Spring and Autumn

### Getting Together - Continuing the Dream of Yangzhou XIII

— Hong Weifa

In the article "Tea Gathering," the author mentioned the demeanor of some old tea drinkers in Yangzhou tea houses in the past. In addition to these tea drinkers, there were of course many others who, although not regardless of heat and cold, and not regardless of sunny or rainy days, were sure to go to the tea house every day, but if they had free time, they always enjoyed spending a few hours there. According to Yangzhou customs, sending invitations, inviting guests, sitting in restaurants, clinking glasses, and using this as a way to get together to reminisce about the old days, etc., were not very popular. But they especially liked inviting people to tea gatherings. When they met relatives and friends they had not seen for a long time, after exchanging greetings, they would invite each other to tea gatherings without exception. Even if they met often, they would invite each other to tea gatherings from time to time. This is called "getting together" by Yangzhou people. The so-called "getting together" means a tea gathering. The sound of "getting together" was very easy to hear in the past in Yangzhou, in various social occasions and even in front of alleyways.

Getting together can be said to be a very popular and common way for Yangzhou people to socialize. Most of them were oral agreements, rarely written notes, and even less formal invitations. In terms of procedure, it was very simple. In terms of cost, it was very economical. Moreover, in these gatherings, no one had the intention of returning the favor, and no one calculated how many times each other had acted as the host, probably because it didn't cost much!

Moreover, these gatherings were really too pleasant in the past. The tea house allowed people to eat snacks and temporarily not pay, but to be recorded on their own account. If you wanted to drink alcohol and needed to order additional wine and food, the tea house could handle it on your behalf, and you could also temporarily not pay, and have it all recorded on your account. Also, if you came by rickshaw, the tea house could also pay the rickshaw fare on your behalf, and record it on your account as well. So everyone could gather without bringing a penny. This was because whoever liked to go to a certain tea house was a customer of that tea house. If a customer had an account, it could attract more business. In the past, price fluctuations were very small, and the tea house owner didn't care about cash transactions. Moreover, cash transactions were mostly passers-by or people who didn't often go to the tea house. Ancient Yangzhou had long lost its former prosperity, so how could the tea house business flourish without relying on these customers? Everything was recorded on account, which provided convenience for the customers. The tea customers who recorded on account were the people most sincerely welcomed by the tea house owner. Thus, A opened an account in a certain tea house and got together with B. When it came time to settle the bill, the waiters could understand the owner's intentions and absolutely follow A's instructions, take out the nth volume of the account book, and let A personally write down the amount owed that day. Even if B took out banknotes and snatched to be the host, or even scolded the waiter to be the host, it would be ineffective. Even for the author, although I was born in Yangzhou, I spent more time outside. In the past, whenever I returned home on vacation, because it was difficult to be the host, I would temporarily open an account in one or two tea houses. This way, we could both record on account, and whoever was sharp-eyed and quick-handed to get the account book could be the host.

In addition, a certain tea house was the place where a certain group of people often gathered. Going there often would inevitably result in meeting many like-minded friends. Therefore, people who had been away from home for a long time would always go to the tea house to move around after returning home. There, they could meet the people they wanted to meet, and they would no longer have to visit each other one by one. Therefore, in the past, when I returned home in the morning, I would definitely go to the tea house in the afternoon. When I returned home in the afternoon, I would definitely go to the tea house the next morning. When I went, the waiter would tell me that someone was here, or that someone had already left, and would also tell others on my behalf that I had returned, or that I had come. The waiter had a mental account of who belonged to which group, and whose whereabouts had to be told to whom. Going there was much more useful than placing an advertisement in the newspaper. Moreover, since friends were gathered there, you could talk to Zhang, and then talk to Li. There were many people and many words, and you could handle things with ease. This was much more enjoyable than visiting each other one by one!

However, there were some differences in meaning between getting together in the morning and getting together in the afternoon. Because there were more people coming and going in the tea house in the morning, it was always noisy. The afternoon was relatively quiet. Therefore, the morning focused on eating snacks, while the afternoon focused on chatting.

### The Night of High Winds and Dark Moon

— Wang Yide

Under the sharp wind, the moonlight was like smoke and gauze, the reeds in the wilderness rustling and shaking.

In the hazy night, a whistle swept past, piercing the lonely sky with a mournful sound; from the dark depths of a bramble bush, a dark figure leaped out, dressed entirely in black.

He turned his face towards the distance, pursed his lips, and made a circle with his fingers at his mouth; hee-lee-lee – he let out a sharp cry, and immediately the echo reverberated throughout the fields.

"Hey! Is everyone here yet?" The dark figure raised his voice and spoke into the wind, then raised his hand to shade his eyes, peering into the darkness.

"We're all here, just waiting for your word, Little Mao!" A voice replied from the front, hoarse, almost like a duck calling for spring.

"Alright, lads! Let's take a count—" the black-clad figure spoke again towards the front.

"Four, four people—Zhang Mazi, Zhao Laoda, Xiao Niu, Liu Quezi." A string of names was carried over from the wind; the voice was still the same hoarse one.

"Oh, that's everyone! Including yours truly, Little Mao, that makes exactly five. Tonight, we'll pick the one belonging to the Five Families Ancestor, west of the bridge—the newly built one. Do you lads understand?"

The five people moved silently in the darkness, their footsteps very light, not making a sound. If anyone happened to cough, it would immediately shatter the surrounding quiet.

The sharp wind swept past in the high sky.

——"Tomb of Mr. Wang Gong Liuquan"—— The green stone tablet stood in the night wind, like a dozing giant; taller than in the daytime, more mysterious than in the daytime.

The five people looked up and scrutinized it, running their palms over the inscriptions.

"That's it! Bring the tinder," someone suddenly spoke in the darkness, and the others silently obeyed his orders; in this kind of situation, words were few, and what was said was easily effective.

"Eagle's beak pickaxe," another hoarse voice asked someone for the tool to break the earth, and the person next to him silently passed it to him in the same way.

The tinder lit up briefly, and the mouth of the pickaxe plunged into the soil; and so, a muffled sound began to emanate from behind the tomb, and suddenly it was easy to believe that it came from the depths of the earth.

After a while, there was a scraping sound, which was the shovel removing the yellow earth. This sound seemed very crisp, and the sharp wind immediately carried it away.

After a long time, the soil had been dug into a huge hole, revealing the stone slabs buried inside.

"Iron crowbar, bring the iron crowbar! Let me test the position of the stone slab!"

The speaker took the iron crowbar and inserted it, using force to loosen the soil on the stone slab.

The heavy stone slab moved, and several people used knives to pry it off; they were covered in sweat, but when they put it down, they did so gently, afraid of crushing someone's foot.

The coffin was embedded in the stone vault, with its glossy, black lid exposed.

"Time to open the treasure chest, lads, stand firm!"

Everyone stuffed mugwort leaves tightly into their nostrils and rinsed their mouths with liquor; they rubbed their hands, feeling both frightened and excited.

Thump! Thump! The one who carried the axe began to chop at the coffin lid; each strike made the coffin emit a hollow cry.

Gradually, a crack appeared along its edge, not wide but very deep. The iron crowbar was inserted all the way in, one end pressed down by manpower, and the other end acting as a lever.

"Apply force!" The hoarse voice shouted, and the wood creaked.

Suddenly, as if giving no time to prepare, there was a thunderous sound out of nowhere; the coffin lid separated from the coffin, tilting unevenly.

Two people walked to either end, struggling to lift it and put it aside.

People's expressions were tense, reaching their peak!

The "wind lantern" was lit, illuminating the edge of the coffin; a piece of rag was used to cover the face of the deceased—it was a habit, those who stripped the corpses never allowed themselves to see the faces of the dead; it was said that people had died of fright if they didn't do this.

"Your Lordship, please listen to a word: We five youngsters are driven by poverty; there is no way to Heaven, no door to Hell, we are forced to take risks, but we fear our strength is not enough. After much thought, we have no choice but to offend Your Lordship and borrow a little. Tomorrow, we will burn incense, kowtow, admit our guilt, and express our gratitude..." The black-clad figure muttered, and after finishing, he knelt down and kowtowed. But as soon as he stood up, the people around him immediately gathered around, their eyes like flickering will-o'-the-wisps.

A chaotic search, a chaotic search! Hands were wet and slippery, and the stench of decaying flesh filled the air.

The clothes of the dead were stripped off, the colors mottled and terrifying.

They felt around the corpse, searching for any unexpected valuables.

"Hey! What's this?" Someone found a hard object, heavy but not shiny.

"Jade!" The black-clad figure coldly glanced at it and called out the name.

With skillful movements, the corpse was searched from head to toe, and everything that could be turned into money was taken away!

The wild wind swept past, and the "wind lantern" sputtered.

Suddenly someone reported the time! "The Big Dipper is slanting, dawn is near!"

"Lads! Let's call it a day, leave something for His Lordship himself!" Someone said again.

With a whistle, the "wind lantern" was extinguished, and the five figures began to move. Leaving the corpse in the tomb staring blankly at the sky.

"Heh heh, another full haul!" The hoarse voice sounded like a duck calling.

Under the sharp wind, the moonlight was like smoke and gauze, the reeds in the wilderness rustling and shaking.

### Test

— Chen Yintan

How do you strike a match?...How do you look at your fingernails?...When asked to look at a corner of the room, how do you look?...How do you drink a glass of water?

Try it out with yourself and your friends to see if these can test whether you are male or female.

A woman strikes a match outwards? A man strikes it towards himself.

When a woman looks at her fingernails, she looks at the entire hand; a man bends his finger and only looks at the nail.

When a woman looks at a corner of the room, she always scans the entire room first; a man looks directly at the corner.

When a woman drinks water, she always looks at the person opposite her from above the glass; a man looks into the glass.

### The Suicide of Lion and the Life of an Artist

— Xu Xinqin

It's funny to die when you weren't born at the right time

Lion has committed suicide!

When the War of Resistance first started, Lion didn't die in the Shanghai Real People's Theater, didn't die imprisoned in Nanjing after being falsely accused, didn't die in the whirlpool of Huang Qiuyue, didn't die in the Battle of Northern Hunan when he fell off his horse on a cliff edge, didn't die behind enemy lines in a commando unit, didn't die when Guilin fell, in the raging fire of the Jincheng River, didn't die on the Dushan Road beneath the precipice, didn't die in a plane crash between Chongqing and Kunming, didn't die watching the front lines in the severe cold of the Northeast, but quietly, upon returning to Shanghai today, he actually chose suicide?

How can I bear to see Lion, active in the arts, soaring on the battlefield, enthusiastic about his career, end his life with such despair? But the evidence, both human and material, gives me only ironclad facts. Last night at six o'clock, I invited Lion to accompany a friend to a small literary and artistic gathering for dinner. Apart from me, no one arrived at seven-thirty. Urgent telegrams flooded in, from the arts community, newspaper offices, and various locations, but no one knew of his whereabouts. Then, a member of his household sent a note, urging me to rush to Ward 308 of the × Ji Hospital to visit a patient in critical condition, and to apply for an emergency loan on his behalf. I still cannot believe that it was Lion. The hospital also did not know who he was. They only found my name card and a suicide note in his pocket, which the director recognized, so he telephoned his home to inform them. Is it real? Is it an illusion?

Lion is certainly a good drinker, and always gets drunk when he drinks, but he can still ride his bicycle home alone. Now, why would he abandon his bicycle by the Baidu Bridge, and throw himself into the water, his clothes soaked through? Fortunately, he was blocked by wooden piles under the bridge, stopping a tram, and causing the ticket collector to cry for help. Boatmen gathered and got him to the Erbai Bo Wharf, where he was admitted to the × Ji Hospital and placed on a stretcher. Blood splattered on his leather jacket, and he remained unconscious for several hours without coming back to life.

His suicide note was only a hundred words long. The first section said: "Modern cultural figures cannot survive. They dare not take a bold risk, yet they are unwilling to change their principles halfway, so they become pessimistic and commit suicide..." Then there was a little poem:

"Rembrandt 'Saintly devotion to books,'

Xu Zhimo 'Quietly departed!'

If Qu's 'The moon also carries tearful traces of light,'

Xiao Jian is 'Entrusted to painting, unbearable to depict,'

Zhang Ziyi only leaves behind beautiful lines,

Ai Xia and Ying Yin are already forgotten!

I myself will always be like a fish trying to steal away on the water!

A beast running in the forest.

Failing to paint a tiger, a fish making trouble,

Born at the wrong time, dying is also funny!"

The familiar Lion, inevitably like Rembrandt, full of resentment towards the world, also inevitably devoted to love, like Qu and Xiao Jian, how could they not be? Zhimo was even more so! Only enjoying life is something that artists cannot avoid, and those who do not understand will think that he is being hypocritical, and so he had to say such pathetic words of self-deprecation!

Alas, Lion is still in critical condition, unable to confide his secrets to his close friends. The situation is urgent. Apart from cabling Qian Mei in Changsha; I sincerely pray that Lion will not die after the emergency treatment! However, the old friend I am watching over has a face as white as paper, and is breathing weakly. I shudder as I write this record, and cannot help but shed tears! (1947, March, 30th, 12 midnight)

### Still Life

— Cézanne

Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) was not only a major figure of Post-Impressionism, but also the greatest painter produced in the nineteenth century. He never attended art school, nor did he study under a teacher, but achieved great success through his own dedicated research. However, he was greatly influenced by Impressionism. His works not only focused on the analysis of light, but also on a profound study of the "quality" and "quantity" of objects. It can be said that no modern famous painter has not been directly or indirectly influenced by him, so he has become the watershed between modern and contemporary art. Historians revere him as the "Father of Modern Painting." (Lion)

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 300

— Ye Jingfeng

This reason was very convincing to himself. But there was another, more sufficient reason; this, perhaps, was the most reliable explanation of all the above reasons: for example, the youth had been caught by him, or had stopped when greeted. However, since he had come with a plan, could his answer to your questions really satisfy you? In other words, even if you sent him to the military headquarters, would he be willing to tell the truth?

Tsurumi Tensei was somewhat stubborn, and very young, so of course he had a kind of inexplicable arrogance, which was normal; at that time, he did not take the youth's actions seriously, he believed that he had the ability to get to the bottom of the matter, and did not need the violent reactions of ordinary people when dealing with events.

But how should this "0915" be explained after all?

This number made him think of all the codes of intelligence: old-fashioned, new-fashioned, ones that he had spent a lot of effort creating himself, but he couldn't think of any connection. It was a mysterious thing. The number was only four digits, very simple, but the more he thought about it, the more his mind was filled with it. Every little nerve was tied with a piece of paper, and on each piece of paper, there was such a simple "0915."

The sound of knocking on the door startled him. Tsurumi realized that he had dozed off; the piece of paper, which he had been holding in his hand, had now fallen to the ground. He flipped his wrist and saw that it was already twenty past ten.

"Huh!" Tsurumi was a little surprised, surprised that Pingzi hadn't come to wake him up earlier. Maybe he had slept too soundly, and Pingzi had already come?

"Please come in!" His vocal cords were relaxed, somewhat hoarse; a sign of being too tired.

Tsurumi thought that when Pingzi came in, she would laugh at him, saying, "In the end, men are not as durable as women." But when the door opened, it was not Pingzi who came in, but the maid from the inn. The impression of this maid had left a faint, peculiar shadow in Tsurumi's mind when he first entered Wansui Hall. He hadn't analyzed it carefully, he only felt that this maid was a little peculiar. Perhaps he had asked Pingzi to have this maid wake him up because he intentionally wanted to observe her actions more.

"Master Tsurumi!" The maid bowed, with a maiden's shyness. She didn't seem like an old hand; "A guest has arrived, he has been waiting for a long time..." She was also holding a formal-looking envelope in her hand, and respectfully handed it to Tsurumi.

"Oh," Tsurumi seemed surprised to hear that there was a guest, "Where is Miss Pingzi?"

"Miss went out at eight o'clock and has not returned... When she left, she instructed the guest to come back at twenty past ten. Now the guest has come back a second time and insists on seeing you, Master!"

Tsurumi looked at the envelope, which was printed with the words "Consulate General of Great Japan in Shanghai," etc., but the recipient was "Nakamura Pingzi." He felt the envelope with his fingers and sensed that there seemed to be a smaller envelope inside.

"What kind of guest is it? Please ask him to come in..."

"It is a young soldier, he said he is your subordinate..."

"Oh, I see... Quickly, ask him to come in!" Tsurumi waved his hand repeatedly.

### Casual Chats from Solitary Mooring

— Wang Cong

People with lung disease are afraid of hearing others mention lung disease.

Old maids are jealous of lively and beautiful young women, and are annoyed by titles such as "Madam" and "Young Mistress." They often hope that others also lack the good fortune they do not have.

They are very generous in wishing to give pain to others. They deliberately get close to other people's mouths when they have lung disease and are speaking; they deliberately misuse bowls, chopsticks, and teacups.

Drowned ghosts forget the cause of their drowning, and do not sympathize with the pain of others. They are only planning to find a "replacement" every day.

Mencius said: "People must first insult themselves, and then others will insult them; families must first destroy themselves, and then others will destroy them; states must first attack themselves, and then others will attack them."

He also said: "The reason why Jie and Zhou lost the world was because they lost the people." I am willing to solemnly copy these old sayings and hang them in the halls of power, as a mirror for all ages.

A friend told me that this story happened in Annam.

A Chinese man and a French man, both speaking French, argued over a small matter. In the end, they both cursed each other.

The Chinese man was furious and began to curse in his native Chinese dialect: "Your mother's ×, × your mother's ×..."

The French man stared blankly for a while, unable to understand what the other was saying. After another Chinese man translated it, he suddenly understood and couldn't help but burst out laughing.

"That is my mother's problem, you can deal with her directly. Try to get her consent, this is not a curse..."

If this story is true, it can be used to understand the different views of China and France on honor and shame.

Only people who share the same rational concepts can have dignity. Many religions have their own different worship rituals. These behaviors cannot be pondered in detail.

Try to take a king, strip him naked, and exile him to a deserted island. I think his sense of dignity will be removed at the same time as his clothes.

### Every Day is April Fool's Day

— Old Farmer

Any nation that lacks a sense of humor and does not understand integrity, the best thing to do is not to talk about April Fool's Day. Such a nation can only follow the old examples: Lantern Festival with lights, Qingming outing, Dragon Boat Festival races, Qixi begging for skill, Mid-Autumn Festival moon appreciation, Double Ninth climbing, Laba porridge, Twenty-third sending off the stove god, etc., to ensure a safe passage through life without any accidents. Adding an April Fool's Day is absolutely impossible, and also unnecessary!

Why is that?

April Fool's Day, I must first warn you: it is a day of cunning. You see, on this day, Westerners can make jokes and have fun, and use rumors to confuse the public. Therefore, it doesn't matter if you publish in the newspaper that Stalin has died in Moscow, or tell everyone that Truman has suffered a stroke in the White House, others will not say that you are spreading rumors or call you crazy. If you were in China, you would very likely be dragged into the police station, court, or prison. To avoid trouble, please keep your mouth shut, so that you can safely get through April Fool's Day!

To be honest, April Fool's Day is only applicable to the West, and 100% incompatible with the national conditions of China. Empty promises and bouncing checks are considered everyday occurrences in China. Adding another April Fool's Day would only increase the opportunities for spreading rumors and fraud. In other words, every day is April Fool's Day, so what's the need to specially designate one day as April Fool's Day? Is it necessary to legalize spreading rumors, cunning, and deceit? Is it that a face full of Confucian virtues, a stomach full of benevolence and morality, but in reality, a large group of male thieves and female prostitutes, spreading rumors and acting cunningly, is still not thorough enough?

I am not against April Fool's Day. April Fool's Day has an undeniable side. Originally, integrity is important in life, morality is essential, and humor is also necessary. Of course, loyalty is allowed, and deception is not, but year-round integrity and all-day loyalty are too serious, perhaps even too rigid. Among the three hundred and sixty-five days, setting aside twenty-four hours to make harmless jokes and create unimportant rumors is very free, without the constraints of ethics, with a fresh sense of humor, and from this, you can truly experience how much the virtues of integrity, morality, and loyalty are worth cherishing.

My conclusion is: In China, April Fool's Day should be renamed "Integrity Day." If anyone deliberately violates this, "they will be killed without discussion."

### April Fool's Day

— Er Bi

It's April 1st again. April 1st is "April Fool's Day." As usual, newspapers in various countries will fabricate a few sensational news stories, and social circles will inevitably spread some unfounded gossip, doing their best to make people half-believe and half-doubt. When things become almost a real situation, they will suddenly reveal the truth: "Today is April 1st!" Everyone laughs it off.

Some people also call this day "Telling Lies Day." On this day, telling lies seems to be something that no one has to take responsibility for.

But, apart from this one day of "telling lies," are we always telling the truth at other times?

From international negotiations to relationships between friends, how many people dare to be honest with each other at all times, and never tell lies? Anyone who believes that there is still such a thing as "morality" in the international arena is also naive to the extreme—so naive that they will probably never understand international news in their lifetime.

What about personal interactions? The so-called "getting along" in society, the so-called understanding of "human relationships" and the word "honest" are so far apart! Look at the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Lu Su is known as "honest," but this man specializes in being deceived and scolded!

Therefore, the number of people who are fooled on April 1st is actually not too many. And if there are still people who think that they can only tell lies on April 1st, then this gentleman is a little too naive himself—in my opinion, he is quite "foolish"!

### News with Mixed Feelings

— Wang Shuchang

The newspaper reports: "The three universities of "St. John's," "Soochow," and "Hangchow" in this city will be merged into a joint university. The campus will be located at St. John's in this city, but in view of the insufficient campus space, Wang Shuchang will reclaim the "Zhongshan Park," which is the school's property, for his own use, so as to rebuild the school buildings, which can be completed within three years."

This piece of news, which is neither too big nor too small, although it cannot attract people's attention like the Jin Chao case or foreign tigers, I still have to pay a little attention to it. Because every citizen is somewhat related. If we speak from the standpoint of education, reclaiming property, expanding the campus, and increasing the number of students is worth praising. However, the school's property is the parkland of all citizens of Shanghai, and in Shanghai, where every inch of land is precious, it makes people feel that the parks are getting fewer and fewer, so Mayor Wu is also racking his brains about this and cannot make a decision.

Recalling when the Japanese soldiers occupied Shanghai, the Japanese side wanted to forcibly occupy the school as a barracks. After several negotiations, it was spared from being ravaged, which was also fortunate.

### God Bless You

"John," the boss said to the clerk, "Did you mix the glucose into the syrup?"

"Mixed."

"Did you add sand to the sugar?"

"Added."

"Did you soak the lettuce and mushrooms?"

"Soaked."

"Did you pour water into the milk?"

"Poured."

"Good, you can say the prayer."

### After Listening to Chinese Musical Works

— Ni Qiuping

On March 30th, there was a concert of Chinese works at the "Lyceum." Although it wasn't full, there were many listeners. It started with a Pipa solo "The Hegemon Bids Farewell to His Concubine," followed by Zhao Jingshen and Li Xitong's Kunqu opera, which I didn't seem to be interested in. Then there was an Erhu solo "Sickbed Lament," and another piece, I don't know if it was "Birds in the Empty Mountain." Following that was a Guqin solo "Flowing Water." Although those three solos had some technical variations, their musical value wasn't very high. Moreover, the timbre of the instruments was poor, the volume was insufficient, and there was noise. Although the instruments were amplified with loudspeakers, they were ultimately not perfect. If they cannot be improved, then they will be eliminated in the future, or only be loved by a part of the people who want to preserve the national essence.

After the break, there were all solos. Originally, there was a piano solo "Shepherd's Flute" (counterpoint by He Luting), but because the person didn't arrive, it wasn't performed. In terms of solos, there were works by Huang Zi, Zhao Yuanren, Liu Xue'an, and Chen Tianhe, among which Zhao Yuanren's "Selling Cloth Ballad" (lyrics by Liu Dabai) is quite suitable as a singing material for schools. Huang Zi's "Peasant's Joy" and "Searching for Plum Blossoms in the Snow" were also not bad. In my opinion, composers should have an international perspective, and not be too nationalistic, what must have a Chinese flavor or oriental color. Excellent pieces of music cannot be distinguished by German style or Russian style. The works of musicians are not used to represent a country; they represent all living and even non-living things. What everyone expresses sympathy for is true music. Chinese music is just starting to sow seeds, I hope it will produce the spiritual food that the people of the world need, because we Chinese people are a nation rich in emotions. This is my only hope after listening to this concert of Chinese musical works.

### Anecdotes of Gu Hongming

— Husband

When the Anfu clique was in power, a new National Assembly election law was promulgated. A portion of the senators had to be elected by the Central Electoral College. All professors from national universities, or those with degrees from foreign universities, were eligible to vote. Consequently, many returned students with bachelor's and master's degrees offered their diplomas for sale. The individuals didn't need to be present; others would take their diplomas to register and vote. It was said that the going market price at the time was 200 yuan per diploma for temporary use. And it was only required to show the qualification. (At that time, 200 yuan was worth at least four million yuan today.)

An insignificant politician actually wanted to win over the old gentleman, Gu Hongming. He asked Mr. Gu to vote for him. Gu said, "My diploma has long been lost." The little politician said, "Who doesn't recognize you, sir? You don't need a diploma as long as you come to vote in person."

In his later years, Gu had already seen through everything in the world and found amusement in life. He said to the politician, "People sell their votes for 200 yuan each. I, old Gu, must sell mine for at least 500 yuan."

The politician said, "Others are 200, but for you, sir, 300." Gu refused to budge. He insisted on selling his vote for at least 400 yuan, and the politician eventually agreed.

The day before the election, the little politician indeed brought 400 yuan in banknotes and a ballot admission ticket to Gu's residence. He repeatedly urged Gu to go to the polling place the next day. As soon as the person left, Gu immediately went out and took the express train from Beijing to Tianjin that afternoon. He spent all 400 yuan on a courtesan in Tianjin named Yizhihua. After two days, when the money was gone, he went home.

The politician heard that Gu had returned and rushed to Gu's house, cursing him for being untrustworthy. Gu picked up a stick and pointed it at the politician, saying, "You're blind! How dare you use money to buy me! You even talk about integrity! Get out of here, and don't ever come to my door again!"

The politician, seeing Gu's stick, was so frightened that he obediently fled. The 400 yuan, which is equivalent to eight million today, was wasted by Gu Hongming on Yizhihua.

### The Fastest Development

— Lu Qing

What is the shortest possible time for a photograph to be developed and printed, from shooting to completion?

Some photo studios in Shanghai offer "express photography" services, delivering photos within an hour. News photos in newspaper offices are developed even faster, taking only a few minutes. Recently, a new ultra-fast photography technique has been invented, completing the entire process from shooting to development in just fifteen seconds!

This ultra-fast photography is a new invention by Eastman Kodak in the United States and is also a military secret. The complete set of equipment includes a specially made camera, a set of developing equipment, and a projector. During shooting, a special flash is used, exposing the film at a rate of one ten-thousandth of a second. Then, using a special powerful chemical solution, the development process is completed in nine seconds at a high temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit (ordinary film development temperature cannot exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit). Finally, the photo is dried with hot air, and the enlarged image is projected onto a screen using a projector. The entire process can be completed in fifteen seconds. This new invention was publicly demonstrated once on October 15th last year. The photos taken of a group of invited editors and reporters as they walked into the restaurant were clearly projected on the screen before they even reached their seats.

This new invention will undoubtedly attract attention from all walks of life, especially from photography reporters.

### Chronicle of a City in Peril

— Qin Shouou

But Lan didn't have time to pay attention to her. In the bright moonlight outside the cave, she had already spotted a familiar slender figure on the path to the left, rushing towards her like a charge; the figure appeared particularly tall. Closer now, Miao could already see that Old Zhu was carrying the short and plump Feifei on his shoulders.

"Mom! Brother! Mom! Brother!" Feifei was already shouting wildly from afar.

Xiao Rong immediately slipped out of Xiao Shen's hand, running up like a ball.

"Sister! Where's Rabbit Dad? Where's Rabbit Dad?"

Lan also unconsciously began to run like mad.

"Feifei! Feifei!" She shouted, disregarding everything, hot tears streaming down her face like broken threads.

"5111, 5271, 5144, 321712..." Old Zhu's whistle was loud and skillful, like a choir of soldiers singing a triumphal song.

"Damn it! This monster," Xiao Shen, lagging behind, felt a surge of rage rising in his heart, his tongue tasting a strong sourness.

July 2nd of the same year.

Japanese planes had bombed Guilin for three consecutive nights. The "Midsummer Night's Dream"-like good news from Xiangbei over the past ten days had also been completely shattered. Late last night, news leaked out from the banking circles that Baoqing had already fallen. Therefore, from the time the sky began to turn white this morning, there was great commotion again on every street in the city. The psychology of "when the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact" frightened every small citizen, and everyone was eager to leave this city, now threatened by enemy cavalry, as soon as possible.

Zhu Zhaonian, who lived on the upper floor of a small school in Dongjiang, was awakened by the disturbances in the alley outside at around six o'clock in the morning. He lazily rolled over on the bamboo bed, stretched his long legs, and was just planning to doze off again, but the noise from the wall was getting louder and louder, making it impossible for him to calm down and rest.

"Damn it! What is it again?" He sat up abruptly, cursing in his heart. (31)

### Eating Tiger Meat

— Xin Shui

A newspaper in Nanjing said, "A visitor from Shanghai reported that a tiger meat stall has been set up on Shanghai Middle Road, displaying a live tiger in a cage and selling the meat of two dead tigers in pieces. Each tael costs 20,000 yuan, and each catty costs 320,000 yuan. Customers are scrambling to buy it. Most of the chefs have no cooking experience, causing them a great headache."

When I first read this news, I suspected that the so-called tiger was the result of the "tiger hunt" that had been making so much noise a few days ago, and everyone was "sleeping on its skin and eating its flesh." Later, I remembered that the so-called golden tiger had not actually been caught, and only became a rumor like "three men make a tiger," and then I realized that I was wrong. Now, what is being eaten is genuine tiger meat hunted by hunters, a tribute from small mountain villages. The people in the mountains know that the people of Shanghai have always been timid and weak. It is said that eating tiger meat can strengthen their courage and strength. It is hoped that after becoming brave and strong, they can truly defeat the rampant tigers, like Zhou Chu who shot and killed the white-browed tiger in the mountains. That would be the good fortune of the people.

Someone said, "A tiger's head and a swallow's jaw, flying and eating meat, this is the appearance of a marquis." Tiger meat should only be eaten by those who are ennobled. Common people do not have this kind of good fortune. If you don't believe it, just look at the fact that in Shanghai, "most chefs have no cooking experience, causing them a great headache," and you can verify what I said.

As for the "tiger hunt," it has long become "a tiger's head and a snake's tail." Ordinary people can only "feel anxious and endangered, as if treading on a tiger's tail," secretly crying out in danger. How can we talk about universally eating tiger meat?
