### Unified Organization of Party and Youth League; First Meeting of the Central Executive Committee; Amendments to the Organizational Regulations of the Central Departmental Committees

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The first meeting of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee after the unification of party and youth league organizations was held at 9 a.m. on the 18th. President Chiang personally presided over the meeting. Song Ziwen reported the donation of all his personal investment shares in the China Construction Bank as a fund to relieve the families of party members who died in the war of resistance and the suppression of bandits. The entire audience applauded unanimously. Song's report was read by Secretary Zhang Shou Xian. The President greatly appreciated Song's actions. Following this, the committee discussed the proposal by Committee Member Song and 40 others at the Fourth Plenary Session to organize the Chinese Kuomintang Comrades Mutual Aid Association, raise mutual aid funds, and promote the work of rescuing comrades. It was resolved to hand it over to the Finance Committee to formulate specific implementation measures and submit them to the next Standing Committee meeting. The following were then passed: (1) Amendments to the Organizational Outline of the Central Executive Committee, (2) Organizational Regulations of the Youth Department, (3) Organizational Regulations of the Theoretical Research Committee, and (4) General Rules for the Organization of the Central Departmental Committees.

Finally, the President proposed the appointment of Chen Xueping as the Minister of the Youth Department and Liang Hancao as the Chairman of the Theoretical Research Committee, which was unanimously approved by the entire audience.

[Another dispatch] A reporter today interviewed the newly appointed Minister of the Youth Department of the Kuomintang, Chen Xueping, to inquire about the department's future work direction. According to him: The focus of the department's work is on training. After eight years of resistance against the war and the armed rebellion of the communist bandits, the country is in a precarious state, society is unstable, and the economy is impoverished, causing young people to feel frustrated and painful. How should we guide young people to recognize the current situation and their own responsibilities and work together for a new China of the Three Principles of the People? This is the department's top priority. Chen has served in the education field and has been teaching at Peking University for 17 years. He was originally the Dean of Students at Peking University.

### Report by Standing Committee Member Song Ziwen on Property Donation; Detailed Account of the China Construction Bank's Situation

Chairman, fellow comrades, at last week's Fourth Plenary Session, the President had already announced that Ziwen and others initiated the raising of funds to relieve the families of party members who died in the war of resistance and the suppression of bandits. He also mentioned that Ziwen had decided to contribute all the shares in the major investment projects of the China Construction Bank, such as the Huainan Mining and Railway Company, the Po Le Coal Mine Company, the Yangtze Electric Company, and the Hankou Jiji Hydroelectric Company, for this fund.

Today, at this meeting, I will submit a report on the operations of the China Construction Bank, because the outside world is mostly unaware of the situation of the bank, and there may even be misunderstandings.

In 1933, after I resigned from the position of Minister of Finance, I engaged in industrial and commercial enterprises, because at that time I was concerned with two issues. First: How can we encourage the inflow of large amounts of foreign capital under conditions acceptable to the Chinese people, and how can we obtain assistance from foreign technology management? Second, how can we promote the development of the domestic capital market? Without these two, our country's industry will not be able to make large-scale progress.

In the past, almost all of our country's foreign debts had to be secured by tax revenues, such as customs duties and salt taxes, which were managed by foreigners due to loan relationships. As for railway loans, there were often provisions for foreign supervision or joint management. The Four-Power Banking Consortium was still unable to succeed in lending to our country, and at that time, the company organization of our country's industry and commerce was in its infancy. Most industrial and commercial enterprises were operated in the form of private individuals, families, or partnerships. Once personnel changes occurred, the enterprise would decline. A true capital market was still lacking. All enterprises relied almost entirely on short-term loans for turnover, without the convenience of a long-term bond market.

In order to solve the above two problems, with the support of comrades in the party and friends in the banking industry, I launched the organization of the China Construction Bank to become the first true investment company in our country. Until the start of the War of Resistance, the bank had made many contributions to attracting foreign capital and establishing a domestic capital market.

### In the Past, Foreign Capital Was Attracted and Industrial Construction Was Promoted

Foreign capital is willing to participate in our country's market as long as our country has a credible partner to cooperate with, jointly participate in its investment, protect its interests, and share its operating risks, that is, willing to abandon the conditions that have damaged our country's sovereignty in the past. Since the establishment of the China Construction Bank in 1934, it has been adapting to this need.

In 1936, the China Construction Bank cooperated with the British-Chinese Bank and the HSBC to establish the British-Gold Loan for the completion of the Hangzhou-Ningbo section of the railway. Before the War of Resistance in 1937, two loans were established. One was intended to be used to build the railway from Pukou to Xiangyang, and the other was to build the railway from Guangzhou to Meixian, but both were suspended due to the war. In addition, the bank also borrowed from the British on behalf of the Jiangxi Provincial Government to establish a hydroelectric plant in Nanchang.

The China Construction Bank's cooperation with France has been even more successful. On the French side, four banks, including Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, Banque de l'Indochine, Lazard Brothers, and Banque Franco-Chinoise, organized a French banking syndicate to cooperate with the bank in the construction of Chinese railways and the development of minerals. In December 1936, the French banking syndicate signed a loan agreement with the bank and the Ministry of Communications to supply the materials needed for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Our country was responsible for the funds needed domestically. When the War of Resistance broke out, all the land for the entire line had been purchased, and all the tunnels had been completed. Even the bridges and roadbeds had been completed.

During the War of Resistance, the bank's efforts to develop our country's economy did not stop. After the fall of Shanghai and Nanjing, the government took the southwest as the base of the War of Resistance, so it negotiated with the French to establish the railway from Nanning to Zhennanguan to connect to Vietnam. This project was mostly completed, but unfortunately it was suspended due to the enemy's invasion of southern Guangxi.

The Xukun Railway was an even larger-scale plan. The agreement was signed in 1939, and it was planned to connect Kunming to Xufu in Sichuan to connect to the Yangtze River. At the same time, plans for the development of minerals along the line were also discussed.

The focus of American economic development in China is not on railways, but on industry. Therefore, the bank has consulted with the American business community on plans for the manufacture of rayon, paper, fertilizer, trucks, and rubber. Except for the cooperation with the American Rubber Company to manufacture rubber products, other plans have been temporarily suspended. The bank's operating purpose is to raise funds to promote the establishment of various industries so that they can operate independently, contribute to society, and facilitate the progress of investment in all aspects.

From the progress of the above-mentioned past undertakings, it can be seen that the China Construction Bank's attraction of foreign capital is no longer subject to the conditions of using tax revenue as collateral, and the supervision or joint management of business by foreigners. If it is necessary to use foreign technology and management assistance for various construction projects, the personnel it employs are still responsible to the national personnel in charge of the project, and there are no special regulations due to debt.

### The Establishment of a Domestic Market Has Achieved Considerable Success

It has already been mentioned that our country's economic development has been greatly hindered due to the lack of a capital market.

The general public in our country has hardly any interest in company stocks, except for the rubber stocks in the early years of the Republic of China and the stocks of exchange trust companies around 1920, which had intermittent speculative fever. Before the war, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, except for government bond transactions, had no stocks listed. The reason is that the stocks of various exchanges failed one after another in the past, resulting in a loss of faith in the stock exchange itself. At the same time, companies with status despised the exchange, thinking that once their stocks were listed on the exchange, they would have a speculative color, which would damage the company's own status. At that time, the stock exchange, in order to save the situation, specially negotiated with the bank for assistance, willing to transfer half of the stocks to the bank, and asked the bank to reorganize the internal affairs on its behalf, so that companies with status would be willing to list their stocks on the exchange, and asked the bank to negotiate with financial institutions to provide loans to brokers. Both parties had already reached an agreement on this method, but it was suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance. In 1945, when I was the President of the Executive Yuan, the institute raised the old matter again, still willing to fulfill the previous agreement. Since I had already taken up a government position, I specially negotiated with the bank to give up this right, and transferred all the stocks that should have been obtained to the state bank. After that, the institute was reorganized, reopened stock trading, and the business was very good, and the profits were huge, which is obvious to all, but I and the bank have no regrets, because giving up this right is a matter of course.

In the spring of 1936, the government decided on a policy that the scope of operations for various construction projects should be limited to industries that are not suitable for private investment, such as national defense industries, trunk railways, and hydropower generation. In accordance with this policy, the Construction Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, was gradually reducing its business group and planned to change the affiliated completed projects that were not under state-owned jurisdiction to private ownership. At that time, the bank was the only institution that could bear this undertaking, so it was entrusted to sell the Huainan Coal Mine and Railway, the Capital and Ganyu factories of the committee. After the bank was entrusted, it organized the South Mining and Railway Company and the Yangtze Electric Company (this is unrelated to the Yangtze Construction Company), published advertisements to raise shares, and soon the matter was completed. Unfortunately, due to the outbreak of the war, some subscribers failed to pay according to the subscribed amount. The bank was responsible for the underwriting, and had to purchase them on its own and bear the risks caused by the war. This is the reason why the bank became a major shareholder of the Huainan Mining and Railway and Yangtze Electric Companies, and at that time, the original intention was only to retain a small number so that it could participate in the management of the two companies.

In the spring of 1937, the business operation of Hankou Jiji Hydroelectric Company was difficult, because the bank had many technical personnel, it was also invited to participate in the share capital and reorganize the operation, which was also successful.

In addition, the bank raised a batch of corporate bonds for Shanghai Wing On Company with a term of ten years to pay off its short-term bank debts. It also raised a batch of US dollar bonds for the opening of Huangpu Port in Guangdong, and another batch of municipal bonds for Qingdao's municipal construction.

Based on the above facts, it is known that the bank achieved considerable success in both the dual tasks of attracting foreign capital and building a domestic capital market before the War of Resistance.

Therefore, if the War of Resistance had not occurred in our country, six new railways could have been built in a short period of time, and other important industries could have been developed. Compared with the fact that no railway was completed with the assistance of foreign capital in the twenty years from 1914 to 1934, the difference cannot be measured in distance.

### Amendments to the Provisions of the Veto Right: I Agree with the American Proposal

[Our News] New York, 18th Broadcast: China stated today that it agrees with the American proposal to amend the provisions of the veto right of the five powers in the United Nations Security Council. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, the chief representative of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, stated in his speech that although the proposal to amend the provisions of the veto right will help the future of the United Nations, amending or canceling the veto right is not enough to completely solve the difficulties currently facing the United Nations organization. If the tendency of countries around the world to split into groups is not fundamentally eliminated, the basic threat to the United Nations organization will still exist. Wang did not mention Marshall's proposal yesterday to establish a special organization to promote world peace and security.

### The President Receives Xue Guangqian, Inquiring About the Political and Economic Situation in Europe in Detail

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] President Chiang received Xue Guangqian, the minister of the embassy in Italy who had recently returned to the country, at his official residence on Huangpu Road at 5 p.m. on the 18th and talked for about half an hour. The President inquired in detail about the general political and economic situation in the Balkans and Europe. Xue participated in the United Nations Balkan Dispute Investigation Team at the beginning of the year on behalf of China, traveled through the Balkan countries for half a year, and recently returned to the country via the United States. He has a deep understanding of the current international situation.

### The Treatment of Public Educators Has Already Touched the Hunger Line; Supervisory Committee Members All Agree That They Should Not Be Concerned About Rice, Oil, Salt, and Other Basic Necessities

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] The issue of the treatment of public educators was discussed in detail at a talk held by the Supervisory Yuan on the morning of the 18th. More than 20 supervisory committee members attended and spoke enthusiastically. The meeting recognized that the lives of public educators today are on the verge of starvation. The monthly income of low-level civil servants is only 500,000 to 600,000, which is less than 12 or 13 yuan before the war. Even in terms of the supervisory committee members themselves, the income is only about 30 yuan before the war. After work, they are almost entirely troubled by firewood, rice, oil, and salt. They have no time to take care of their lives or deaths, which will affect work efficiency. On the other hand, many government officials use various conveniences to enjoy themselves to the fullest. Some only come to Nanjing once or twice a week to attend meetings, but they have giant houses in Nanjing, use cars, and have more than a dozen servants at their disposal, all of which are provided by the public. What could be more unfair? Some members of the Legislative Yuan have suggested holding civil servant loans. When this is implemented, there will be many difficulties. At the same time, if the government has money for loans, why not use it directly to increase salaries? However, adjusting treatment at this time will only increase issuance and stimulate prices. Those who benefit may not necessarily be civil servants, which is not a good strategy. As a result of the talks, the following two points were summarized: (1) From the bottom up, the government should not let civil servants worry about firewood, rice, oil, salt, and other basic necessities, so that they no longer struggle on the verge of starvation. (2) From the top down, those in high positions should share weal and woe with their subordinates. The government advocates thrift, and low-level personnel have no savings to save at all. Everything should be advocated by those in power. It is said that Zuo Zuoyi's successful military governance lies in his ability to share weal and woe with his soldiers. This kind of atmosphere should be extended to all parties. At the meeting, the committee also recommended that Gan Weiyuan, Shude, draft a proposal for formal submission to the government.

### British Minister of Civil Aviation, Nathan, Arrives in Beijing

### President Zhang Will Fly to Peiping This Morning; Will Inspect Tianjin, Shenyang, Changchun, and Other Places; Collect Various Data and Pay Attention to Corruption Cases

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] Premier Zhang Qun will inspect North China and the Northeast and is scheduled to depart on the morning of the 19th. If preparations are not completed in time, he will fly to Beiping on the 20th to inspect the areas of Peiping, Tianjin, Changchun, Shenyang, Taiyuan, and other places. In addition to inspecting the administration of officials and visiting the people, he will also pay special attention to corruption cases in various places. After returning from the north, Zhang may travel to South China again. [Another dispatch] Zhang Qun is scheduled to go on an inspection tour on the 19th and will collect information on military, political, educational, and social aspects, with particular emphasis on provincial and municipal administration. His entourage includes Zhou Junliang, Fu Boping, Secretary You Jianwen, and Deputy Director of the Information Bureau Deng Youde.

### Special Envoy Wedemeyer Flies Back to Washington; Will Submit an Investigation Report to the President Immediately

[United Press, Fairfield Airport, California, 17th] General Wedemeyer arrived at the Army Airport here on the 17th from Honolulu. Wedemeyer stayed in Honolulu for a week to prepare a report to Truman on the situation in China and Korea. He declined to comment and patted his briefcase, saying that all the tricks were in it. Wedemeyer flew to San Francisco shortly after landing and will fly to Washington at 7 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. According to estimates by the State Department in Washington, Wedemeyer may arrive at 11:30 a.m. on the 18th.

[Central News Agency, Washington] Wedemeyer is scheduled to fly to Washington today to report to Truman on the results of the investigation conducted by the inspection team he led in China and Korea. His proposals are expected to shape American policy in China. Truman is scheduled to return from a visit to Brazil on the 20th. Upon his return to Washington, he is expected to immediately discuss the situation in China with Wedemeyer.

[United Press, Beiping, 18th] Regarding Sun Ke's warning, qualified American personnel here said on the 18th: "This statement is unlikely to change the State Department's decision on China policy." Sun Ke said that if the United States continues to lead China astray, China will reconcile with the Soviet Union. This statement should be regarded as diplomatic bluffing and is not enough to change the position of the Wedemeyer mission. However, the American personnel hope to see the original text of the United Press before believing that Sun made this statement, fearing that there may be errors when printed in the Chinese newspapers here.

A semi-official Chinese source told the United Press that Sun often has emotional impulses when talking, so his statement "does not represent the government's views." His statement was "a false reaction to Wedemeyer's public criticism of the Chinese government." Although Sun has recently made anti-Soviet remarks, comparing the Soviet Union with Japan, he was previously recognized as a promoter of pro-Soviet policies.

### Profiting by Relying on Privileges Is Pure Fiction

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, I was ordered to go to the United States to serve the country. After returning to the country in 1944, I was appointed as the President of the Executive Yuan and immediately dissolved all previous commercial relationships. I resigned from all the director positions of the original bank and other related companies. I also requested that the bank return the rights to the railway contracts obtained before the war to the government. At the same time, I asked it not to engage in any business related to the government during my tenure as the President of the Executive Yuan. The bank was able to faithfully fulfill my wishes. The most ridiculous thing is that the United Press in the United States issued a draft, saying that the bank used privileges to obtain huge amounts of foreign exchange from the government and profited from it. This matter was investigated by our government, and the result was that the bank only requested US$877.62 from the Central Bank after the victory of the War of Resistance for the purchase of typewriters and miscellaneous stationery. The amount was so small that it was almost unbelievable. It can be seen that the truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, the number of party members who died in the anti-Japanese and anti-communist wars was extremely large, and their families lacked care and their lives were difficult. All comrades in the party and I believe that it is necessary to donate funds for relief. The four companies of Huainan, Po Le, Yangtze, and Jiji now have huge assets. If the bank's shares in the four companies can be donated to the fund, it can be a basis for establishing it.

### It Is Believed That Other Shareholders Can Make the Same Contributions

Before the war, the estimated coal reserves of the Huainan Coal Mine were only 20 million to 50 million tons. After the war, the company felt the urgent need for coal in the Yangtze River area and paid special attention to mineral exploration. It hired the famous geologist Dr. Xie Jiarong to conduct a wide-ranging survey in the surrounding areas. Through his efforts, new coalfields were discovered in Bagong Mountain, with abundant reserves, estimated to be no less than 600 million tons, and they are flat coal seams, which are easy to mine. They are only 214 kilometers away from Yuxikou on the Yangtze River, which is convenient for supplying Shanghai and the Yangtze River area. It is the most promising coal mine in our country. In addition, Huainan also has mining rights in Jiangsi Po Le, and cheap fuel can also be obtained in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in the future.

In the future, with the electricity of the Yangtze and Jiji Electric Companies and the coal of Huainan and Po Le, it will not be difficult to use cheap electricity to form a power grid in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou to develop the industrial construction of central China.

I am only one of the shareholders of the China Construction Bank. For the bank's investment in its coal mines and public utilities, I can only donate the portion of shares I own. However, I have exchanged opinions with many other shareholders. I firmly believe that the majority of shareholders of the company agree with this move and may be able to make the same contribution to the shares of the four companies held by the bank, so that the families of comrades who sacrificed for the country can be relieved.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The National Economic Commission held a routine meeting on the afternoon of the 18th, chaired by Wang Yunwu, to discuss the following six important cases:

(1) Amendment to the Regulations on Price Evaluation Implementation Methods. The case was submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the main amendments were: (A) Adding "If it is necessary to evaluate prices in various counties and cities, the provincial government may designate their establishment, but it must be reported to the Executive Yuan for record." to the end of Article 1 of the original regulations. (B) The original Article 8 "except for edible salt" was revised to exclude those with special management agencies in the area where the designated management items are located. (C) Adding another paragraph to the original Article 13: When prices rise sharply, the price evaluation committee should investigate the reasons for the rise, and if there is any speculation or manipulation, it should report it to the local court for punishment according to law. Note: The main duties of the Price Evaluation Committee are: 1. To stabilize the selling price of major daily necessities; 2. To assist in reporting illegal pricing behaviors. It is organized by representatives of provincial and municipal government officials, public opinion organizations, chambers of commerce, trade unions, and security agencies. This case was passed and sent to the Executive Yuan.

(2) State-Run Enterprise Management Law. This law is divided into finance, business, and personnel sections, and it was decided to submit it to Yu Hongjun, Weng Wenhao, Yu Dawei, Chen Qitian, Jian Guansan, etc. for review.

(3) Automatic Adjustment of Public Utility Prices Calculation Method. According to the original plan calculation, fuel prices, raw material prices, electricity prices, exchange rates, and wages are the standards. During the discussion of this case, the meeting was divided into two opinions. Jian Guansan, Xu Baiyuan, etc. opposed automatic adjustment, believing that it was contradictory to negotiate prices and adjust them automatically at the same time? Also, the base number is unreliable. It was decided to return it to Pan Xulun, Weng Wenhao, Chen Qitian, etc. for review, but public utilities that have reached the adjustment period can be adjusted.

(4) The Ministry of Economic Affairs submitted the Implementation Plan for Developing the Textile Industry and Regulating the Supply of Yarn and Cloth. The main purpose of the original plan is: to exchange cotton for yarn and yarn for cloth, divided into five major parts: (A) Ensuring abundant cotton raw materials, (B) Increasing the production of the textile industry, (C) Mastering yarn and cloth materials, (D) Rationally distributing yarn and cloth, (E) Promoting the export of yarn and cloth. During the discussion, most agreed that cotton yarn should be controlled to reduce speculation and hoarding, and it must not be stopped because some merchants object. A resolution was passed, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs was instructed to supervise the Textile Adjustment Committee to earnestly implement it.

(5) The Sino-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Program for 1948 submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was decided to be submitted for review.

(6) The Implementation Methods of the Economic Reform Plan.

### Postal, Telecommunications, and Railway Services All Suffering Heavy Losses

Remarks by Minister of Communications Yu Dawei

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Minister of Communications Yu Dawei told reporters on the 18th that postal, telecommunications, and railway services are all "suffering heavy losses." The postal and telecommunications industries rely entirely on subsidies to survive. If the subsidy system is cancelled next month, I really don't know how to face this problem. As for the recent situation of the railways, the Longhai Railway, when it is open, can maintain business due to the booming freight transport. However, the banditry in western Henan has spread, and the Luoyang-Shaanxi section has been severely damaged and is difficult to repair in the short term. Even the Jinpu and Jinghu lines have suffered heavy business losses. The Ministry of Communications has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and strictly deal with the corruption case on the Yuehan Railway. When reporters asked whether postal and telecommunications rates would be raised again, Yu laughed and said that he also did not know.

If China's shipping industry wants to seek long-term development, the ocean shipping industry must not be ignored. More ocean routes need to be opened in the future. Once the Sino-Japanese air route requested by the Bureau is submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, it can be formally prepared for navigation.

However, after examination, all requests were denied.

Editorial

### Song Ziwen's Righteous Act

Song Ziwen, a member of the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang, suggested on the closing day of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee that a comrades' mutual assistance association be organized to raise funds to donate to the families of party members who died in the war of resistance and the suppression of bandits. Song Ziwen also took the lead in donating his private property, allocating all of his shares in the China Construction Bank Company as this fund. Song's move can be regarded as a symbol of the Kuomintang's rebirth. Therefore, once the news spread, it was welcomed by the whole country. However, what is the content of China Construction Bank Company? What is the value of Song's donated shares? These are all questions that the people of the country want to understand.

At the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday, Song made a detailed report to the meeting, saying that the tasks of China Construction Bank Company are: First, to absorb foreign investment as much as possible under conditions acceptable to the Chinese people, and to obtain foreign technical assistance; second, to promote the development of the domestic capital market, so as to enable large-scale improvements in China's industry. Since its establishment in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), in addition to lending foreign debts to build railways, its main investment projects are four types: (1) Huainan Mining Railway Company; (2) Pole Coal Mine Company; (3) Yangtze Electrical Company; (4) Hankou Jiji Hydropower Company. From this, it can be seen that China Construction Bank Company is a common financial institution, but it is an important link in China's nation-building cause. In theory, these undertakings could have been operated by the state, but it is especially commendable to operate them as private enterprises and attract foreign investment. Song's righteous act of donating is not only to relieve the families of party members who died for the War of Resistance and the suppression of bandits, but also to return privately-run enterprises to public operation, which makes its significance especially important.

The Kuomintang overthrew the Manchu Qing Dynasty and created the Republic of China; overthrew Yuan Shikai and recreated the Republic; eliminated the warlords and completed unification; and defeated the Japanese invaders, writing off a century of unequal treaties with one stroke. This is the Kuomintang's great achievement for the country and the nation, which is enough to be immortalized forever and cannot be denied by anyone. However, the Kuomintang's achievements, in addition to thanking the leaders who have worked hard, must also be attributed to the martyrs and patriots who gave up their lives for righteousness and gave up their lives for benevolence. They are the real unsung heroes. Since they have sacrificed for the party and the country, the families they left behind should be responsible for by the party members who have not died. Otherwise, how can they be worthy of these martyrs? How can we encourage newcomers to sacrifice for the party and the country again? Therefore, Song's move can not only comfort the souls of the martyrs, but also encourage the surviving comrades. We fervently hope that all Kuomintang party members can follow the principle of "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength" and respond enthusiastically. The wealthy should not be allowed to be solely responsible for the beauty of Song Ziwen. Even ordinary party members should donate as much as they can, no matter how much. All contributions are beneficial. The purpose of Song's proposal to launch this item will not be difficult to achieve if everyone is able to donate enthusiastically: The fate of the Kuomintang and China is already inseparable. On the one hand, we hope that the scope of relief for the families of the martyrs can be expanded, and one day it will not be limited to Kuomintang party members: on the other hand, we hope that people outside the Kuomintang will also donate to the country one after another.

In addition, after repeatedly reading Song's report to the Central Standing Committee, we have the following feelings:

First, China Construction Bank Company has always been quite isolated from the outside world, and very few people know its content. However, after reading Song Ziwen's report, we learned that the company is not an ordinary enterprise company or trade, buying cheap and selling expensive, and only seeking profit, but a true investment company aimed at developing industry. Its investment projects are not only closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, but also its purpose is to promote the improvement of Chinese industry. This point can be imitated by ordinary companies. Today, industry and commerce are declining, the people's livelihood is painful and unbearable, and idle funds are flooding the market. At present, ordinary businessmen raise funds to organize companies, if they do not hoard goods, they often engage in speculation. It seems that there are very few investors like China Construction Bank Company who engage in real business. Therefore, we hope that the Shanghai business community will organize companies in the future, and they can use idle funds and invest them in production enterprises, so that the rising prices can be slightly reduced.

Second, under the current circumstances, the only way for China to engage in nation-building and revitalization is to take the path of "self-reliance." The so-called self-reliance means that everyone in the country can achieve "self-discipline and patriotism" so that the national economy will not be in difficulty. What is the total value of Song's donated shares? It is difficult to estimate the exact number, but the Huainan coal mine has coal reserves of 600 million tons, and its value cannot be said to be small. In terms of shifting people's hearts, it has a great effect. In the past, China did not have large capitalists, but after eight years of war, as a result of inflation, many wealthy merchants emerged. Now that nation-building is difficult and the people are poor, the wealthy should generously donate, or use it as a relief fund, or use it as a nation-building investment. Song has set a precedent, and I hope that the people of the country will respond to the news.

Third, a month or two ago, foreign news agencies did not understand the truth and once widely spread the idea that privileged companies were using official exchange rates, and China Construction Bank Company was also involved. At that time, we were still unclear about the truth. Now, after reading Song's report, we can suddenly understand. We must first investigate the facts before we can judge any news in the future. We should take it as a great warning to say what others say.

### The United States Formally Submits the Korean Issue to the UN General Assembly; Proposes Organizing a Commission to Conduct On-Site Investigations of the General Situation; Will Take Unilateral Action if No Results Are Achieved

[United States Information Service, Flushing, 18th] The United States today submitted two proposals to UN Secretary-General Lie, requesting that they be included on the agenda of the UN General Assembly. The first is to establish a temporary committee of the General Assembly on peace and security, and the second is to discuss the issue of Korean independence.

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Authoritative sources here revealed to this agency that the content of the United States' proposal for resolving the Korean issue is approximately as follows: The United States will suggest to the United Nations to organize a commission to investigate the situation and supervise the early holding of elections in the North and South Korean occupied zones. In addition, it is further suggested that the results of this election will serve as the basis for determining the composition of the Central Assembly of all of Korea under the supervision of the United Nations. The United States will also suggest that the United Nations and the Korean Provisional Government determine the date for the withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea. Under the US plan, the Korean Provisional Assembly, in consultation with UN representatives, can then determine the procedures for drafting the Korean Constitution. The source also stated that, unless there are final changes to this plan, the United States will propose that the Korean Provisional Government and the United Nations Commission should decide on the scope and manner of economic recovery needed by Korea to restore its stability. At the same time, it is understood that if the United Nations cannot make progress on the issue of Korean independence, the United States will also prepare and request Congress for full financial assistance to South Korea.

[United Press, Seoul, 18th] The Soviet delegation of the US-Soviet Joint Commission today issued a statement condemning the United States for causing a stalemate on the Korean issue. It is claimed that the United States is nitpicking and deliberately refusing the Soviet proposal regarding which Korean political parties to consult in organizing a provisional government. The Soviet delegation insists on its original view that if both sides are willing to earnestly implement the Moscow Resolution, the Joint Commission will be able to smoothly resolve the Korean issue.

### Soviet Representative to Counterattack Marshall's Speech at the General Assembly; US Proposal Has Received Majority Support

[United Press, New York, 18th] Delegates from various countries are today closely awaiting the Soviet reaction to the US proposal to establish a 55-nation Security Committee at the UN General Assembly. The majority of small countries' representatives seem to be seeking to support the US proposal, and although the positions of China, Britain, and France have not been announced, it is feared that they will also take consistent action with the United States.

[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, New York, 18th] Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky is scheduled to launch a counterattack today in the UN General Assembly against Marshall's proposal to establish a 55-nation Standing Committee on "Peace and Security." Sources close to the Soviet delegation said that Vyshinsky's reasons for opposing the 55-nation Peace and Security Committee will be that this body is a redundant organization of the Security Council, sufficient to eliminate the Security Council's primary responsibility for maintaining world peace and security. Well-informed sources also anticipate that other points Vyshinsky will raise in the General Assembly include: (1) The internal turmoil in Greece was caused by US interference; (2) The US placing the Korean issue on the General Assembly agenda is a violation of the Four-Power Moscow Agreement; (3) The US proposal to abolish the application of the veto power in issues under Chapter VI of the Charter is a violation of the United Nations Charter; (4) The US refusal to agree to the Soviet Union's views on the control of atomic energy is the reason for the delayed establishment of the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Agency. In addition, it is expected that Vyshinsky will also criticize Argentina's disregard of the previous UN General Assembly resolution in appointing an ambassador to Madrid, and the refusal of Britain and the United States to comply with the previous UN General Assembly resolution on the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed within foreign territories.

### US Note to Soviets

Copies Sent to Chinese and British Governments

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The State Department today released the note sent last week to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, responding to his refusal to participate in the Four-Power talks on the Korean issue. It stated, in part, "Mr. Molotov, I have recently received your letter of September 4th, in which I understand that the Soviet government has decided to reject the US government's proposal to convene Four-Power talks to quickly realize the agreement related to the Korean issue in the Moscow Agreement. For the past two years, the US government has repeatedly shown sincerity in implementing this agreement with the Soviet government, but it has ultimately failed to achieve its wish due to differing opinions between the US and Soviet delegations, resulting in the Korean Provisional Government having no hope of being established soon and remaining in a state of division without gaining independence. The US government believes that this situation cannot be allowed to continue for long, so it now intends to submit the issue of Korean independence to the UN General Assembly for discussion, so that the long-suffering people of Korea can gain freedom and independence as soon as possible. Copies of this note have also been sent to the Chinese and British governments, which are signatories to the Moscow Agreement."

### Two Blocs Engage in Verbal Warfare Over Veto Issue

[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 17th] As the United Nations General Assembly is beginning its broad debate, Latin American countries and the Slavic bloc have formed opposition over the veto issue, engaging in verbal warfare, each with its own position. Foreign Minister of Uruguay, Mr. Baudelt, was the first to attack, opposing the veto power of the five major powers. Poland, of the Soviet bloc, immediately retorted, declaring that Poland "firmly opposes any attempt to amend the United Nations Charter, and especially insists on the unanimous vote of the five permanent members of the Security Council." Mr. Baudelt first spoke out, claiming that if the veto power is abused, peace will never be achieved, and the reputation of the United Nations will be greatly damaged. Baudelt continued to appeal to the General Assembly to restore the harmonious atmosphere of the San Francisco Conference, when drafting the UN Charter, when countries and representatives attending the General Assembly placed the common interest above individual self-interest. In addition to opposing the amendment of the Charter, Poland also took the opportunity to criticize the Marshall Plan, attacking the United States for disregarding the United Nations and neglecting the needs of other wartime allies.

### French Foreign Minister Arrives in New York

[Reuters, New York, 17th] French Foreign Minister Bidault arrived in New York by plane today to lead the French delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. After disembarking, Bidault said that the mission started in San Francisco should continue, as its great expectations have not yet been realized. Bidault avoided expressing opinions on the veto issue.

### General Assembly Steering Committee Passes Resolution; Greek Issue Included on Agenda; Also Resolves to Establish Special Committee to Handle Holy Land Issue

[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, New York, 18th] The United Nations General Assembly Steering Committee, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and Poland, decided last night to place the US proposal recognizing that Greece's political independence and territorial integrity have been threatened on the agenda of this General Assembly session. The Steering Committee also unanimously passed the establishment of a special committee to specifically discuss the Palestine issue. This committee will run parallel to the other major committees of the General Assembly, be composed of all members of the General Assembly, and be directly responsible to the General Assembly.

The Soviet representative stated in the Steering Committee that the proposal by Argentina to convene the General Assembly to amend the Charter and abolish the veto power could not be brought up for discussion. British representative McNeil also stated that he had some clarifications regarding Argentina's proposal to grant Pakistan and India full membership in the United Nations. When discussing the US resolution on the Greek issue, Soviet representative Gromyko strongly opposed placing it on the General Assembly agenda and questioned the US's motives for doing so. He pointed out that discussing this issue in the General Assembly would only further heighten tensions in the Balkans and harm the relationship between Greece and its neighbors. Therefore, the Soviet Union absolutely cannot agree to place this case on the General Assembly agenda. US representative Austin replied that Marshall had explained in detail why the Greek issue must be placed on the General Assembly agenda, and if the Soviet Union opposes it, it can seek the support of a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly to remove it.

### Gu Weijun's Speech

[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States and Second Representative to the United Nations, Gu Weijun, delivered a speech today at the Talley celebration of "United Nations Week" in New York, stating that the future of the United Nations will largely depend on its handling of Asian issues. A satisfactory resolution of these issues will further promote world security and peace. Gu cited China's four-year solo resistance against Japan as an example of how the people of Asia believe that truth overcomes power. He stated that this is the spirit of Asia, because "we know that if justice is in crisis, we will never back down and will fight to the end without fear of any sacrifice."

### Ukrainian Independent Anti-Soviet Guerrillas Active

### Joint Conference of Two Major International Financial Institutions; Yu Hongjun Honored as Chairman; McCloy to Visit European Countries with Gutt

[United Press, London, 17th] Chinese Finance Minister Yu Hongjun was elected as the chairman of the joint meeting of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the 17th. At the same time, Washington has been formally selected as the venue for the next General Assembly. The current annual meeting of the two institutions closed today.

[Reuters, London, 17th] After the conclusion of the annual meeting of the Boards of Governors of the International Bank's President McCloy, and the President of the International Monetary Fund Gutt, will travel to several European capitals to contact government leaders and monetary authorities. McCloy said: The Soviet Union is too far away and is not considered for the trip. One of the purposes of this trip is to find out who has the power to invest and who needs money. McCloy also said that the destinations of this trip may include non-member countries such as the Czech Republic and Switzerland and Sweden. He denied that this trip was related to Marshall's aid to Europe plan. Referring to Britain's economic crisis and the Fund's allocation of 60 million US dollars to Britain to accept pounds, Gutt said that, according to the provisions of the International Monetary Fund's charter, the current so-called dollar shortage is not a phenomenon of dollar shortage listed in the charter, so the Fund cannot find a way to relieve this dollar panic. The Fund's allocation of 60 million US dollars to the United Kingdom is not a loan, but merely a transaction in which pounds are exchanged for US dollars.

### Anglo-American Tariff Negotiations; British Side Still Expresses Pessimism

Clayton to Visit Cripps

[Reuters, Geneva, 17th] It is reported that US Undersecretary of State Clayton will meet with British Trade Minister Cripps in London to try to break the deadlock in the Anglo-American tariff negotiations. Although various parties have placed some hope on this meeting, people from the British delegation believe that unless the United States can reduce its demands and lower its demands for the imperial trade preference system, the talks will inevitably be fruitless.

### Siam Joins Sterling Area

[United Press, Bangkok, 18th] Local officials announced that Siam has joined the Sterling Area. The British Foreign Exchange Control Authority will allow the Siam Bank to open correspondent accounts in London, because most of Siam's foreign income is in pounds, so joining the Sterling Area will help its international trade.

### Japanese Cabinet Passes Bill; Coal Mine Nationalization Plan

Government and Three Parties Reach Agreement

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] After the Democratic Party re-submitted an amendment to the issue of coal mine nationalization, a liaison meeting between the government and the three ruling parties was held yesterday. The focus of the meeting was the relationship between the coal mine nationalization bill and the Coal Industry Public Corporation. First, the Socialist and National Cooperative parties expressed their views, hoping that the Democratic Party would abandon its prejudices and separate the two, but the Democratic Party still insisted that the establishment of the Coal Industry Public Corporation was a prerequisite for coal mine nationalization, and the meeting ended without result. After the meeting, the Socialist Party again pushed Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani to negotiate with the Democratic Party, and a final compromise was reached, which was formally passed at today's extraordinary cabinet meeting and will be submitted to the Diet.

### Japanese Liberal and Democratic Parties Join Hands; New Party Movement Takes Shape; National Cooperative Party May Also Participate

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The conservative new party movement is being secretly launched and promoted by a faction centered on Liberal Party Secretary-General Ohno and General Affairs Chairman Hoshijima, and a faction centered on Democratic Party Vice President Tanaka representing the Shidehara faction. The new party is based on the "Anti-Communist Conservative League" organized by some members of the "First Diet Members Club," which is a joint organization of members from the Liberal, Democratic, and National Cooperative parties, and is probing in all directions. Its activities will become more active with the resumption of the Diet. On the 16th, Vice President Tanaka and Secretary-General Ohno exchanged information in the Vice President's office on the progress of the new party's work.

In addition, Honorary President Shidehara and several members of the so-called anti-Yoshida faction have also had sincere talks on the issue of coal mine nationalization and the work of the new party. In addition, the Secretary-General met with them to test Tanaka's true intentions for the new party's work. Tanaka stated: "The great cooperation between the Liberal and Democratic parties in the future is believed to be a destiny, but there are not many who want to split the Democratic Party and immediately join the Liberal Party. If a conservative new party is organized, it should also take unanimous action by the whole party. Therefore, it is necessary for Shidehara and Ashida to maintain close contact." Strict criticism of the coalition government has now arisen within the Democratic Party, and on the coal mine nationalization bill, both the Ashida and Shidehara factions are adopting a tough amending attitude under the premise of the conservative party. Therefore, there is no longer the deep opposition between the two factions as before on issues such as the president and the coalition. The Liberal Party has also temporarily stopped clearing up its past feelings towards the Ashida faction and is seeking a large-scale consolidation of the conservative camp. As for the form of this consolidation, it will try its best to raise the banner of a major reform of the conservative party to seek the support of public opinion. Therefore, if the middle-of-the-road faction centered on "Issuikai" in the Democratic Party can reconcile the opinions within the party, the Liberal and Democratic parties will actively discuss the issue of organizing a new party in late October. In addition, the National Cooperative Party and small parties of the "First Diet Members Club" will also actively participate.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal was sworn in as the first Secretary of Defense today, even before President Truman returned to Washington. The President is currently returning from South America on the battleship Missouri. It is said that due to the international situation, Forrestal was ordered to take office first, without having to wait for his return to Washington.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Forrestal's assumption of office as the first Secretary of Defense is the first step in quickly merging the nation's military departments into a single, powerful national military organization. Legally speaking, the unification of the armed forces will take effect tomorrow. The Air Force will become an independent department, parallel to the Army and Navy departments, but some parts of the plan will not be completed until two years later. The new military organization will have five independent agencies: the National Security Resources Board, the Research and Invention Board, the Munitions Board, the National Security Council, and the Central Intelligence Agency. There will also be a Joint Chiefs of Staff, including the Army Chief of Staff, the Navy Chief of Military Operations, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and the President's Chief of Staff, commanding a joint staff of about one hundred people. The Army, Navy, and Air Force Unification Act was passed by the previous Congress, placing the nation's military departments under the single command of Forrestal to prevent another Pearl Harbor incident from happening again.

### Our Court's First Trial of Chu Li: Why Didn't the Defendant Report the Murder He Witnessed? The Defendant Requested to Be Tried Under Ordinary Criminal Law, Which the Court Did Not Consider

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Englishman Chu Li, also known as Ah Chu, accused of conspiring with U.S. Army Corporal Malay to shoot and kill black market gold broker Yu Shengxiao, has seen Malay sentenced to life imprisonment by a U.S. military court. Chu Li was directly sent by the police department to the local court's criminal division for legal proceedings. The first public hearing of the case was held yesterday at 2 p.m. in the First Criminal Division of the local court. Before the hearing, the court dispatched bailiff squad leader Zhang Ji and Pan Zhupeng to bring Chu Li from the Sinan Road detention center and escort him to the court for questioning. Ah Chu was wearing a white collared mesh shirt, light gray slacks, and old yellow leather shoes. He was burly with a fierce glint in his eyes. At around 2 p.m., Judge Zhu Yuhuang and Prosecutor Ding Tongjun took their seats. Lawyer Zhu Dianhuaiqun from the British Consulate served as the defendant's counsel. Representatives from the British Consulate, Jili, Chen Guolian, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Cha Liangjian, President of the Local Court, and Xu Guoji of the Municipal Police Department, were all in attendance. Chu Li's wife, wearing dark green glasses and a blue floral silk Western suit, sat quietly to one side.

Chu Li was first brought forward for questioning. He stated that he was 33 years old, British, engaged in import and export business, and resided at No. 16, Lane 188, Albert Road, Shanghai. Next, Prosecutor Ding stood up to present the main points of the indictment, roughly stating that on August 1st of this year, Chu Li and U.S. Army Corporal Malay conspired to commit murder by falsely claiming to purchase five gold bars from black market gold broker Yu Shengxiao. Chu Li then drove Yu to a secluded location on the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway and killed him. The investigation by the Jingying Bureau confirmed the evidence of the crime. Based on Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 6 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and Robbers, and according to Article 3 of the Special Criminal Procedure Law, the case was transferred to the court for trial, requesting that the criminal division punish him according to the law. After the prosecutor finished his statement, Lawyer Tang stood up and said that Chu Li's case was different from banditry and robbery and asked whether it could be handled according to the ordinary criminal law for murder. The court did not consider this request.

Chu Li's testimony mainly stated: He had known Yu Shengxiao for about three months and only knew his surname was Yu. He had traded with Yu about six times.

Malay Asked Him to Purchase Gold Bars

On August 1st, I left my home at 9 a.m., first going to the Hui Zhong Hotel to meet a friend. At 9:45 a.m., I went to the Mars Bar on Nanjing Road, and then to the New Lidu Bar, where I met Malay. The initial conversation was about personal documents. After drinking coffee for ten minutes, Malay asked me if I could find a way to buy five gold bars, each bar weighing ten taels, totaling fifty taels. I agreed to his request and went to discuss it with Yu. Yu said he could arrange it, asking for US$585 per bar. I went to the Li Cha Hotel and told Malay that each bar was worth US$590, with US$5 per bar being my commission. We arranged to deliver the goods at 5 p.m. Malay instructed me to borrow a car, saying that he didn't want a driver. I discussed it with Pai Qu Luofu, stating that the rental fee was 80,000 yuan per hour, and I would drive myself. First, I went to the Li Cha Hotel to pick up Malay. At this time, Malay had taken off his military uniform, changed into civilian clothes, and borrowed a civilian hat from me. When I asked why, Malay replied that buying and selling black market gold in military uniform wouldn't look good. The car drove to Jianmingyuan Road and Renji Road and stopped to pick up Yu. I introduced him, saying, "This is Colonel Malay." The judge asked why he pretended he was a colonel. Chu Li said that he thought saying "colonel" sounded more dignified, it was his own idea and not Malay's instruction.

Saw Yu Covered in Blood

After Yu got into the car, he sat next to Malay in the back seat, with Yu on the left and Malay on the right. Malay immediately ordered him to drive towards Hongqiao Road. According to Malay, they were going to the Country Club, which was around 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. The car arrived near the Golf Club, when suddenly there was a loud bang, like a tire bursting. When I looked back, Malay ordered me to continue driving. At this time, I only saw Yu staring at Malay with his hands on his chest. When we arrived at the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway, Malay ordered me to stop the car on the right side of the road. At this time, I saw Yu covered in blood, and Malay was holding a towel stained with blood. Yu repeatedly shouted, "Don't kill me. You can take everything. I will definitely not report to the police. Chu Li knows me." Malay opened the car door and dragged Yu out of the car. I asked him, "Why are you doing this?" He replied, "I have to do it." Then he closed the car door and ordered me to turn back. The court asked if Malay had obtained the gold bars at this time. He replied that he simply didn't have time to think. On the way back to Shanghai, he saw Malay throw the blood-stained towel by the side of the road. I and Malay went straight home. I saw Malay find a bullet casing in the car. He went inside and went to the bathroom to wash his hands. He took off his coat and gave it to me to hang up, but it felt quite heavy. He wiped the blood stains from his pants and shirt with a wet towel, then sat down and asked me if I could exchange the gold bars for US dollars. He seemed to need money urgently. I took him to the Xie family on Henry Road, but Xie was not home, so we returned empty-handed.

Reasons for Not Reporting to the Police

At this time, the court sternly questioned! "Since you are pushing all the responsibility for the murder onto Malay, why didn't you report to the police to reduce your responsibility?" Chu Li replied in a relaxed tone: "Yu and Malay were both my friends. I was very unhappy that Yu was killed by Malay and didn't think about reporting to the police." He then stated: After leaving home, I drove Malay to the Race Club. Then I returned the car to Patrick Lof alone, for a total of three hours, for which I paid 290,000 yuan. Then Patrick Lof drove Malay to the Broadway Mansions, and then Patrick drove me home. At 9:10 p.m., I went to the Jinmen Cinema to watch a movie. The next afternoon, Malay came to my house to talk. He asked if there was a way to convert the gold bars into cash and took out a gold bar. The court asked if it was Yu Shengxiao's. He replied that he didn't know and also said: "I told him there was no way," and after that, he did not see Malay again. Regarding whether there were blood stains in the car, he said he did not find any. At this point in his testimony, the court ordered Chu Li to sit to one side.

### Qingpu Residents Testified Everywhere

Then, witness Chen Nianxiang (50 years old, repairs bicycles for a living, residing at No. 60, Wu Family Alley, Qingpu) testified: On August 1st, at around 6 p.m., I was returning home from Shanghai. When passing the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway, I saw a person lying in a pool of blood by the side of the road, moaning. I went forward to ask what happened. He said, "I am Yu Shengxiao. Foreigners shot me with guns and robbed me of my money. One is called Chu Li, and there is another American. As for how much money, the woman at home knows." Yu was carried onto a car by Jiang Zhigen, the squad leader of the Qingpu County Self-Defense Corps. He died shortly after the car departed.

In addition, witnesses Jiang Zhigen and He Dengkui did not appear in court. The trial is scheduled to continue at 9 a.m. today. The case concluded at 4:20 p.m. After the clerk read the record, Chu Li signed it and was returned to custody. Before getting into the car, his wife stepped forward and kissed Chu Li passionately.

### Rare Large Diamond Once Surprised Experts Who Exclaimed Enthusiastically, Labor Costs Are Unaffordable, Still Not Cut

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the large diamond held in the custody of a certain bank in the city, a reporter continued to inquire with relevant parties and learned that the diamond was not produced in Nanyang, but flowed into Singapore from elsewhere. Because its surface was covered with a layer of milky white mineral matter, which at first glance looked like alum crystals, no one could determine that it was a rare large diamond. It wasn't until after overseas Chinese Li bought the diamond and took it to a famous French geologist for research that the expert, after appraising it, was overjoyed and exclaimed, "I have never seen such a large diamond in my life!" Later, Mr. Li consulted many experts in Hong Kong and Taiwan, who all said that it was indeed a diamond, but the outer layer of mineral matter had to be cut away before it could show its sparkling brilliance. Mr. Li did not use domestic workers due to a lack of good diamond cutters in the country, while the wages for cutting diamonds in the United States would be more than half of the diamond's value, so he postponed the cutting and brought it to Shanghai to be stored in a certain bank. Besides the fact that about 100 carats of rough small pieces were cut off in Hong Kong and sold for 40,000 Hong Kong dollars, Mr. Li cut off two or three small pieces from the protruding parts of the diamond in Shanghai and gifted them to relatives and friends. After these small diamonds were processed and cut, the edges and corners were crystal clear, the luster was gorgeous, and the color was the same as that of high-quality diamonds. Mr. Li is currently employed by a company in Taiwan, and due to economic constraints, sold it for US$1.5 million. It is said that the value of the diamond is actually more than this amount.

### Simple Canteens Need 100 Shi of Rice Per Day, Civil Food Allocation Committee Agrees to Allocate and Sell

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Civil Food Allocation Committee held its sixth meeting at 10 a.m. yesterday, presided over by Director Wu Kaixian, to discuss several important cases:

(1) Simple civil canteens in the city request rice allocation. According to a report submitted by civilian Xi Langqing, the canteen has installed a water-heating boiler and can cook more than 100 shi of rice per day. There are a total of 26 vegetable markets in the city, with 25 branch canteens set up, each using 4 shi of rice per day, totaling 100 shi. Currently, the canteen's rice is purchased from the black market, and each bowl is priced at 500 yuan. If allocated rice at a fair price, the price per bowl will definitely be reduced, which will greatly benefit civilian food. Resolution: The principle is feasible, but the canteen should regularly send staff to supervise and unify the price of rice.

(2) The handling fee for the first phase of poor rice distribution is set at 1,500 yuan per shi. The current report states that it is not enough to cover expenses, and the request is to increase the handling fee starting from the second phase. Resolution: Depending on the actual situation, a discretionary increase will be given in the next phase. (3) The first phase of poor people's rice distribution began on August 8. Most districts did not begin distribution until mid-August. According to the regulations of the Allocation Committee, it should be sold out within ten days, but many districts are still requesting continued sales. However, the Ministry has repeatedly ordered that the period for poor people's rice distribution should be limited to one month. The first phase has been carried out for a full month, so how should the deadline be unified? Resolution: The first phase of poor people's rice distribution will end fifteen days after the last rice delivery unit is allocated grain. (4) The amendment to Articles 6 and 7 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Rice Distribution for Occupational Workers was resolved and retrospectively approved. 10,000 yuan will be added per shi, of which 9,000 yuan will be deducted by the rice sellers to cover transportation, storage, loading and unloading labor, sales losses, and all handling fees. The remaining 1,000 yuan will be used as verification, investigation, and supervision fees for the Allocation Committee. (5) The rice distribution for occupational workers will begin in September, and it is proposed to send personnel to various occupational trade unions and public sales outlets for regular supervision and inspection, such as checking the roster of certificate holders and inspecting the actual sales situation of the rice stores, to ensure thoroughness. The resolution was passed.

The second phase of poor people's rice distribution will be started after the first phase is completed.

### Gasoline Purchases with Certificates: Fraud Discovered; Users Hoarding, Gas Stations Raising Prices; Director Zhao Says He Will Crack Down

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Director of Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue met with reporters in the Municipal Government meeting room yesterday to report on the fraud discovered since the implementation of gasoline purchases with certificates in the city, and the Public Utilities Bureau's handling methods, stating: (1) Since the implementation of gasoline purchases with certificates in the city, all gas stations have become extremely crowded, and it has been found that the city's gasoline consumption has actually increased compared to before the implementation of gasoline purchases with certificates. The reason is purely the fear of the citizens. Citizens believe that there will inevitably be a gasoline shortage in the city, so they are vying to buy and hoarding at home. The Public Utilities Bureau believes that this phenomenon is extremely unreasonable and easily creates a fire hazard, so it has decided to conduct a strict investigation and crack down. If it is found that users have unreasonable gasoline consumption, their gasoline purchase certificates will be revoked. (2) A small number of gas stations have been found to have fraudulent practices, failing to supply the allocated gasoline as much as possible, and instead selling the gasoline at black market prices for profit. The Public Utilities Bureau has decided to crack down severely. The Asia Gas Station at No. 551 Fuxing Middle Road has already been investigated and ordered to suspend business for one month as punishment. (3) The formulation of the gasoline purchase with certificates method was previously agreed upon by the oil companies. However, after implementation, the oil companies all have complaints. The Public Utilities Bureau has decided to convene the responsible persons of the oil companies tomorrow to review this method again. Finally, Director Zhao hoped that citizens could understand the government's difficulties, cooperate sincerely, supervise each other, and exert their strength.

### Savings Committee Discusses Seven Regulations: Restrictions on Private Cars Desired; Complex Environment, Many Difficulties

During the meeting, the seven savings regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan were discussed based on the city's current environment, and the implementation steps were decided, with slight modifications or supplements as needed. A summary of the discussion results is as follows: (1) Outline of measures to vigorously save consumption: no objection to the original articles. (2) Organizational Regulations of the Savings Supervision Committee: no objection. (3) Measures to restrict the use of private cars: Article 3 stipulates that those who may use private cars are (1) legally registered doctors; (2) legally registered banks, factories, mines, newspapers, and privately owned businesses of significant scale and related to daily necessities for the people; (3) legally approved and registered automobile transportation businesses. Article 5 stipulates that those who do not meet the above regulations should be reduced in phases by lottery. However, due to the complex environment of this city, there may be difficulties in implementation, so the meeting only exchanged views and made no decisions.

### Restrictions on Chinese and Western Banquets: Particularly Strict Enforcement

(4) Among the implementation measures for saving banquet consumption, the following should be given special attention and strictly enforced: Article 2: "Each Chinese banquet shall not exceed six dishes and one soup, and each Western meal shall not exceed two dishes and one soup, and the local government shall limit the maximum price per guest based on local prices." and Article 4: "All food and beverages prohibited from import by the government shall not be sold in restaurants (such as shark fins, bird's nests, foreign wines, etc.)." In addition, the meeting also decided that the driver or attendant should be the responsibility of the guest, and the host may provide guest meals. Drivers and attendants shall not make any demands. (5) Measures to save paper for newspapers, magazines, and books: In addition to complying with the original regulations, newspapers with more than one page should be reduced to one page, and those with more than two pages should not exceed two pages. It was also decided that new newspapers and magazines will not be issued registration certificates within one year, and those that have been approved for registration but are not currently published will not be allowed to resume publication.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Line: Passing White Dew

[Report from Hangzhou, 16th] This reporter, running along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, asked experienced old farmers, people's representative councilors, agricultural experts, and county officials. They did not dare to be extravagant about this year's autumn harvest.

White Dew Rain: Steals Rice, Ghosts Steal

According to experienced old farmers: "White Dew rain steals rice, ghosts steal (a pun)." After it rains on White Dew Day, insect plagues will occur everywhere. For example, insect plagues have already been discovered in Jiashan and other places. There is also a saying: "White Dew rain, arrives in one place, ruins one place." Don't expect a good harvest in any place that has experienced White Dew rain. Probably during the White Dew season, it is precisely the time when the rice is showing its flowers. Only after the flowers show can it bear fruit. The best weather for flowering is cloudy and sunny. If there is a big sun, the flowers will be forced to die. If it rains, the flowers will be damp and easily change. So rain before and after White Dew is bad, old farmers' experience tells us. But according to some people: "White Dew rain is misty, Autumn Equinox rice is evenly ripe." This means that White Dew rain is not heavy, but misty, which is still beneficial to the rice fields. I also consulted agricultural experts, who said: "White Dew rain is bad, is completely without scientific basis." Let's not care whether the rain on White Dew Day is good or bad, but a kind of terrible experience and legend is widely spread in the countryside. Will the farmers be discouraged by this legend? This is why government personnel must work hard to think of remedial measures. Promote and publicize to the villages to make effective salvage.

Good Autumn Harvest, Good Hundred Industries

At present, except for Shanghai, every city and town along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line can be said to be looking forward to the autumn harvest. If the autumn harvest is good, everything will be possible. Like the bricks and tiles of Jia Li Shan, of course few people in big cities build houses, but after the autumn harvest, some rural villages will add rooms and build houses, and the brick and tile industry can also take the opportunity to prosper. Like Fengjing homespun, Xieshi Western socks, and Chang'an gauze, all are eagerly awaiting the large-scale purchases by the rural villages after the autumn harvest. Even the commerce of every city and town is waiting for the farmers to have a little surplus to exchange for a little goods. We look forward to this year's autumn harvest, and we still have to work hard. We hope that after the autumn harvest, the price of rice will not depreciate too low. Don't wait for the farmers to sell their grain after the autumn harvest, and then hear the shouting of "cheap grain hurts farmers!"

Another problem that exists between the villages along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line is the problem of tenant farmers reclaiming wasteland. I have visited three or four counties, and they are all discussing the issue of tenant farmers reclaiming wasteland. The so-called tenant farmers are the mountain people of Shangba Prefecture in Zhejiang, or the people of the Northern District of Jiangsu. Some of them have the habit of being diligent and hard-working. When reclaiming wasteland, their production capacity is always stronger than that of local farmers, thus arousing an undercurrent of dissatisfaction among local farmers. I believe that the local governments should quickly solve these small problems and should not allow them to continue to exist.

Cultivating Land, Avoid Wasteland

Tenant farmers and domestic farmers are originally people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, they are our own people, and they are also citizens of the Republic of China. We can see that there are still many wastelands existing on both sides of the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line. These wastelands can be announced by the government for reclamation in accordance with the land administration laws and regulations, and quickly improved. If it is still allowed to be barren, tenant farmers may be recruited to reclaim it. What I have investigated is that the conflict between tenant farmers and domestic farmers is not in the reclamation of wasteland, but in the cultivation of cultivated land. There is still a lot of wasteland in southern Jiangsu today, and we should seize the opportunity to "make the best use of the land."

Moving Graves and Coffins, Setting Up Public Cemeteries

To reclaim wasteland, there is another problem, which is the relocation of graves and coffins. I advocate that public cemeteries should be established immediately, and all coffins should be moved to the public cemeteries, so that they are no longer scattered everywhere, making it impossible for reclaimers to start.

From the autumn harvest, I thought of "cheap grain hurts farmers." Because of "cheap grain hurts farmers," I thought of the problem of tenant farming. Tenant farming can increase production. We, the people in power and the representatives of the people, should study this series of problems and truly do something for the people. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

The ceremony began with music. The school's principal, Pan Chengyu, presided over the ceremony and said in his speech: Today is the 17th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident."

The education work for anti-Japanese war orphans should be made universal and developed into a social movement, hoping for support from all walks of life. Colleagues and students should all remember the difficulties of founding the school, strive for progress, and express heartfelt gratitude to all circles for their assistance in establishing the school.

### Nathan Flies to Hong Kong, Various Missions

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 16th] Sir Frederick Nathan of the British Ministry of Civil Aviation arrived in Hong Kong on the 15th. On the 19th, he will go to Beijing to discuss issues related to the development of British aviation in the Far East after the signing of the Sino-British Civil Aviation Agreement with relevant Chinese authorities. As Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong's only airport, is small and surrounded by mountains on three sides, the British authorities have long intended to select another site to open a grand airport suitable for international standards. However, the ideal location within Hong Kong's borders is only in the New Territories, which belongs to China as a leased territory. If it is to be developed as an airport, it seems that China's consent should be obtained first. It is rumored that Sir Nathan's trip to Beijing is related to this matter. Another theory is that the Hong Kong government intends to reclaim land from the sea in the Stonecutters Island area to open a large aviation port.

### Mountain People of Taiwan Province Renamed Mountain Compatriots, Ministry of Education Instructs to Pay Attention to Teaching Terminology

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The mountain compatriots of Taiwan Province were discriminated against during the Japanese rule and were forced to live in the high mountains, regarded as uncivilized. Therefore, the name "mountain people" was formed. After the restoration, our government treated the mountain compatriots equally, and the name "mountain people" was abolished long ago to show equality. Now, the Taiwan Provincial authorities believe that it is inappropriate for the outside world to still use the old name, so they have requested the central government to inform relevant agencies separately that the "mountain people" should be renamed "mountain compatriots" in the future. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has instructed the National Compilation and Translation Bureau and other affiliated agencies, as well as public and private colleges and universities in various provinces and cities, to pay attention to changing the name to "mountain compatriots" in editing books, pamphlets, lectures, teaching terminology, and daily language.

### Poor Students and Children of Public School Teachers Should Be Exempted from Tuition Fees, Li Ximou Published a Written Statement Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The collection of tuition fees by municipal national schools in the city was previously decided by the mayor convening a meeting of representatives of municipal school teachers and staff, and was approved by the education group of the municipal council. However, some schools have recently failed to comply with the order to exempt poor students and children of public school teachers. Li Ximou, Acting Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, was very angry upon hearing the report, and specially published a written statement yesterday as follows: "The collection of tuition fees by municipal national schools was originally a temporary expedient measure to show consideration for the difficult lives of teachers. Therefore, it is stipulated that children of public school teachers and poor students should be exempted. Of the collected amount, half should be distributed to the teachers and staff of the school first, and the remaining half should be deposited in the Municipal Bank for unified distribution. This method was discussed and decided upon by all the principals, and all schools should strictly abide by it. Recently, a few schools have changed it without authorization, which violates the original intention of equal distribution decided by the principals. If there is the above situation, once the investigation is true, it should be strictly stopped."

[Another dispatch] The Municipal School Tuition Fee Distribution Committee has been formed and has begun to investigate the collection situation and preside over the calculation and distribution work. The list of members is as follows: Principals: Hu Huaifu, Wang Zunwu, Sun Zhenchun, Song Chaozhi, Yao Sulang, Feng Xiancheng, Su Wanfu, Qiu Xisheng, Mei Guangdao, Wang Liben, Gu Yinqian, Gu Zhaowen; Teachers and staff: Feng Fusheng, Tao Yan, Xue Chuanfu, Sheng Zhigong, Wang Shaosheng, Mao Wenpei, Li Zhanren, Xu Ziling.

### Severe Decline in Early Market, Chinese Stocks Still Weak

Yesterday was the rollover day for cash and forward transactions in Chinese stocks. The foreign exchange market did indeed announce a tightening, but with no foreign capital coming in and businesses facing increased burdens, the situation only worsened. Over time, a wave of sell-offs emerged. After 11:30 AM, rumors of failed loan applications and instability among firms spread widely, causing the "Hen Mouse" (a term for speculators) ranks to collapse, leading to a very severe decline. However, miscellaneous stocks were not affected and remained relatively stable. In the afternoon, due to excessive declines, despite large-scale buying intervention by national banks, the situation gradually stabilized from fatigue.

The morning opened bullish. After the debut of forward Yung Shing cotton yarn, the foreign exchange rates were announced, and the British and American currencies both experienced a decline, initially boosting morale. Numbers 223 and others bought in, causing a surge in prices. Spot Yung Shing rose from 236 yuan, and forward transactions rose from 243 yuan, jumping to a high of 241 yuan and 250 yuan after the opening. When China Cement debuted, there was a lot of interest in the new stock, and Numbers 35 and others gradually pushed it up to the limit. However, after some selling at high prices, Yung Shing was unable to sustain the momentum and retreated. Many resold spot Yung Shing, and there were even more sellers of forward contracts, with interest rates still opening at 2 jiao 2.5 fen and 2 jiao 7 fen, gradually declining with little resistance. After 11 AM, the market collapsed, with widespread selling. Rumors of failed loan applications and instability among eight firms circulated, and Yung Shing plummeted to a low of 221 yuan and 215 yuan for immediate delivery near noon. Although other stocks were affected, they lacked counterparts, causing prices to stagnate. Many took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the market closed at 219 yuan and 226 yuan at noon. Asking prices rose slightly after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, immediate delivery shares of Yung Shing, Sino-British, Mei Ya, Jing Fu, and New China fell by 5%, Hua Feng fell by 10%, New Light, Sino-French, Qin Xing, China Textiles, Rong Feng, and Commercial Press experienced slight declines, while Zhabei, China Silk, Li An Firecrackers, and New Asia remained unchanged, and underwear and Yung Yieh rose slightly. Cement hit the limit. Forward shares of Yung Shing, Sino-British, Mei Ya, and Jing Fu experienced slight declines, New Light rose slightly, and Hua Feng fell by 5%.

In the afternoon, forward Yung Shing rose to 229 yuan and hovered for a long time. As it approached 3 PM, it was learned that the national bank's exchange intervention was still significant, leading to a lot of liquidation of spot and forward Yung Shing, pushing prices down to a low of 217 yuan and 224 yuan. However, there was a slight rebound before the close, ending at 222 yuan and 229 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, immediate delivery shares of Yung Shing, Sino-British, Mei Ya, New Light, Jing Fu, Sino-French, and Li An rose slightly, Qin Xing, underwear, and Rong Feng remained unchanged, Hua Feng rose by 10%, and cement remained at the limit. Firecrackers fell by 5%, and Zhabei and China Silk experienced slight declines. Forward shares of Sino-British rose by 5%, Yung Shing, Hua Feng, and Jing Fu rose slightly, New Light remained unchanged, and Mei Ya experienced a slight decline.

Yesterday, the rollover spread for cash and forward transactions saw a reduction in funds released by financial institutions. There were occasional instances of reversed interest payments, causing the spread to rise from low to high, with a daily interest rate of approximately 1 jiao to 1 jiao 4 fen, including Yung Shing from 6.9 yuan to 8 yuan, Sino-British from 3.7 yuan to 4.8 yuan, Mei Ya from 10 yuan to 16 yuan, and New Light from 4.5 yuan to 5.5 yuan. Yung Shing continued to end at the highest price of around 7 yuan in the afternoon.

### Government Bonds Popular, Foreign Stocks Weak

Government bonds were very popular yesterday. Run De and others bought in, while Rooms 503 and 550 sold, with the transaction volume still around 5 million.

Ewo Yarns opened at 99,500 yuan, but was affected by Chinese stocks and gradually fell to a closing price of 94,500 yuan.

### Reader's Mailbox: Willing to Accept Both, But the Law Does Not Allow It

[Letter from Ms. Liu of Ziyang, Shandong] Editor: I am an 18-year-old girl who has received elementary education and has not yet left the boudoir. In the winter of 1945, I met a boyfriend whose character, knowledge, etc., all met my ideals, and we developed from friendship to love. My mother also sympathizes with us and allows me to be free and unite with him. My father passed away long ago, but my grandparents have very strong feudal ideas, not only restricting my freedom but also not allowing me to meet or correspond with him. Although I have been in this harsh environment for two years, I have continuously communicated and secretly met with him. Now that my lover and I are deeply in love, we have entered into prenuptial agreement, Now there are several points, I beg you to give clear instructions, (1) Is my engagement with the other party, with my mother's consent, legally effective? (2) If my grandparents interfere, what legal argument can I use? (3) The other party already has a wife, and he allows me and his wife to be treated equally (not distinguishing between senior and junior wife, called one family with two branches). I am also willing to do this. Is this legally valid? (4) If someone else introduces me to a husband to my grandparents without seeking my consent, can I refuse? Please give me your blessing. Reader Liu Qingxiu bows and begs, September 8th.

[This column answers] Ms. Liu: According to the Civil Code, marriage agreements should be entered into by the man and woman themselves. However, minors (those under the age of 20 are minors) who enter into marriage agreements should obtain the consent of their legal representatives (parents are the legal representatives of their minor children). You are 18 years old this year and are still a minor. If you enter into a marriage agreement with someone, you should obtain the consent of your parents. As for your grandparents, they have no right to interfere. However, your boyfriend already has a wife, which is a big problem. Although you are willing, the law does not allow it! Article 985 of the Civil Code stipulates: "A person with a spouse shall not remarry." Article 237 of the Criminal Code stipulates: "A person who has a spouse and remarries or marries two or more people at the same time shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years, and the person who marries them shall also be punished." Therefore, the wisest approach is to "rein in the horse at the edge of the cliff" and re-select an ideal partner. This concerns lifelong happiness, so you must not mislead yourself!

### Talking about the Japanese on the "September 18th" Incident

From the "September 18th" Incident, the "January 28th" Incident, the "July 7th" Incident to the "August 13th" Incident, the Japanese have been following a path: invading China, sucking the blood of the Chinese people, making themselves strong, and dominating the Pacific and Asia.

But for sixteen years, this aggressive militaristic dream has not awakened. The Japanese were defeated in battle two years ago. Although they were formally disarmed, the Japanese's inherent spiritual weapons and the skeleton of militarism have not been dismantled!

The "children of the gods" emperor is still preserved. He is the idol of Japanese aggression and the "signal station" for Japan's outward development. Although the emperor has donned civilian clothes, he is the soul of militaristic Japanese people.

Japan's secret police and power institutions have not actually disintegrated. The original personnel and military warlords who have won military exploits are still standing in obscurity, pointing out the direction for the Japanese people to rise again.

Japan's light industry and the economic institutions of the zaibatsu are not only not destroyed, but are also moving forward under the encouragement of making Japan's economy self-sufficient.

Although these responsibilities can be blamed on the American commander, MacArthur, the Allied countries that control Japan should propose strong corrections on this day commemorating the sixteenth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident!

If not, then it is not impossible for the Japanese to launch another "September 18th" Incident in China or the Pacific.

At the very least, its economic aggression has been directed at China two years after its defeat!

### Reflections on the "September 18th" Incident

â€” Zhiwei

Today is the sixteenth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident. Since 1928, Japanese imperialism has actively provoked and exerted pressure on our country under various pretexts. Following the "May 3rd" Incident, there were the "Wanbaoshan" Incident and the "Nakamura" Incident, which were considered the fuse of the "September 18th" Incident. After the "September 18th" Incident, there were the "January 28th" War, the "Yuguan" War, the "Rehe" War, the "Great Wall" War, the "Chengdu" and "Beihai" Incidents, and the "Marco Polo Bridge" Incident, which triggered our country's full-scale resistance. After eight years of heroic resistance, our country finally won. Militaristic Japan has already submitted to the banner of justice. In theory, we should be welcoming this great anniversary - an anniversary full of lessons - with the most pleasant emotions. However, in today's environment, we are filled with mixed feelings and endless emotions, and we really don't know where to start.

The speed of Japan's recovery two years after its victory is unparalleled in modern history. Even Germany cannot help but be inferior and lag behind. Today's Japan, not only in the consciousness of the Japanese people, almost no longer recognizes itself as a defeated country. It still blindly worships militarism and the Emperor system. Even the most important turning point in modern history - the scene of the Japanese representatives signing on an American warship - I am afraid it has long been forgotten. The ambition of aggression is trying to rekindle, and I want to relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

The peace treaty with Japan has not yet been established, but Japan's private foreign trade has been opened since August 15. And recently, many Class A war criminals in Japan have been unconditionally released on the grounds that "the suspicion of being domain criminals has been temporarily cleared"... In short, MacArthur's treatment of Japan is too tolerant, almost indulgent. It must be known that this tolerant policy will cause immeasurable troubles in the future. Maybe one day, Japan will interrogate the war criminals who dropped the atomic bombs!

The "September 18th" Incident is a bloody lesson in our country's history. It is a national spirit that can never be forgotten, and it has deepened our belief in "the victory of justice." When we look back on the past and face the reality, who can guarantee that the "September 18th" Incident will not be repeated in the future? We must be vigilant, not forget the bloody lesson of the "September 18th" Incident, and remember the parting message of "We'll be back in twenty years."

### Introducing to All Shanghai Students: Shuping Scholarship

â€” Ge Le Shan

Mr. Wang Ran's article "Interlude at a School Shop" on July 7th told us many inside stories about scholarships, all of which were sly scams aimed at registration fees. Wang Guangsheng even believes that there is absolutely no great philanthropist in Shanghai who can help as many as three hundred impoverished students. I do not think so, because the Shuping Public Scholarship that I know is beyond Mr. Wang's expectations. Since its establishment, the Shuping Public Scholarship has awarded scholarships to more than a thousand students, and in the next semester, it will continue to help about three hundred and fifty people.

The Shuping Public Scholarship was founded by Mr. Qian Lin in the 28th year of the Republic of China, and it has been a full eight years today. Mr. Gu founded the Shuping Public Scholarship to commemorate his late father, Mr. Gu Shuping, and to help outstanding young people who have been forced to drop out of school.

The Shuping Public Scholarship was originally only for high school students, but now many university students continue to receive scholarship assistance. In addition to tuition and miscellaneous fees, the Shuping Public Scholarship also provides book fees. Students with excellent grades can also receive room and board fees. Any impoverished student can apply. If your grades meet the scholarship standardsâ€”an average of 85 pointsâ€”and you pass the Shuping Public Scholarship eligibility test, you can start receiving the scholarship. After you receive the scholarship, if you do not slack off in your studies, then the scholarship will help you until you graduate from university without any problem.

The Shuping Public Scholarship has many facilities for scholarship recipients, such as a library, free barber shop, laboratory, shorthand class, typing class... and so on, too numerous to mention. For the health of the students, the Shuping Public Scholarship also employs excellent doctors to provide free treatment for various diseases.

(The author is one of the scholarship recipients of the Shuping Public Scholarship, so he is quite familiar with the inside story of the Shuping Scholarship. Everything mentioned above is factual.)

### The First Troops to Resist During the September 18th Incident

â€” Mei Wu

During the September 18th Incident, the first to encounter and resist the Japanese army was the 7th Brigade of the Northeastern Army, which had three regiments, 619, 620, and 621, stationed in Beida Camp. The Japanese attacking forces were divided into three main detachments. The second detachment attacked Dongda Camp, the third detachment attacked the provincial capital, and the first detachment with the strongest firepower attacked Beida Camp, because Beida Camp was the largest barracks in the Northeast at the time, and the enemy was quite afraid of it.

The Japanese army advanced in five lines, with infantry leading the way and heavy artillery providing cover from behind. Machine gun bullets fired like popping beans. The longest line first invaded the northeast corner, and the 621st Regiment was caught off guard and fought in haste, suffering heavy losses. Soon, the Japanese army invaded from the southwest corner, and the 7th Brigade headquarters and the 619th Regiment could not withstand the fierce firepower of the Japanese army and had to withdraw from the camp. The remaining troops retreated one after another.

At this time, the Japanese army had encircled about 40% of the camp, while the 620th Regiment was still in the camp, so they fought a bloody battle to break through, and did not completely withdraw until the morning of the 19th. In this small-scale battle, the 620th Regiment suffered extremely high casualties, and the Japanese army also suffered the heaviest casualties.

After the fall of Beida Camp, Dongda Camp was isolated and helpless. The soldiers retreated in formation, crying bitterly, which shows the state of mind of the soldiers at that time.

Marginal Notes on Water Margin

### Piercing Rot

â€” Ai Zhu

In the Water Margin, several people were punished by being tattooed and exiled to a certain prefecture's prison. "Tattooing" means tattooing the face, and "exiling" means exiling the body. In ancient times, tattooing the face was called "Qing," which meant leaving an indelible mark on the face of a criminal and then forcing him to do hard labor. From the Qin and Han Dynasties to the Three Kingdoms, all government-owned slaves had marks tattooed on their faces, but it seems that this practice was not very common afterward. In the Song Dynasty, the practice of tattooing and exile was more due to "exile" than "tattooing." At that time, tattooing the face was a mark of soldiers, regardless of whether the soldier was a volunteer, conscript, or drafted man, or a criminal prisoner, they were all tattooed with a few characters. The reason why Song Jiang, Lin Chong, Wu Song, and others were tattooed was simply because they were "exiled" to the "military."

This practice began in the late Tang Dynasty, and the armies of Zhu Quanzhong and Liu Shouguang were like this. The reason was naturally to prevent soldiers from deserting. From then until the Song Dynasty, this practice was continued without being abolished, lasting for three hundred years. Therefore, once someone became a soldier, they could never change careers and were subjected to the contempt and humiliation of the world. It was impossible to tell whether a soldier was a criminal or not, as if all soldiers had committed crimes. During the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song, in order to defend against the Western Xia, the army was not enough, so many conscripts were temporarily recruited from the border areas to form a "righteous army." At that time, it was stated that only hands would be tattooed, not faces. However, the famous virtuous minister Han Qi still strongly advocated that faces must be tattooed, while Fan Zhongyan strongly opposed it. As a result, the conscripts under Han Qi's command had their faces tattooed, while those under Fan Zhongyan's command were spared.

"Heroes don't care about humble origins." Among the tattooed soldiers, there were actually people who relied on their swords and spears on the border to climb to the position of executive, and that was the famous Di Qing. The Song Dynasty originally valued literature and despised military affairs, and among the military men, those who came from the ranks had no hope of making a fortune. Di Qing's success was really an exception at the time. It is said that when he returned to the court after victory, he was rewarded for his merits, and the prime ministers discussed only adding the honorary title of Jiedushi to him. Later, the emperor couldn't stand it anymore and interceded for him, scolding the prime ministers, and then they discussed making him a privy councillor with a tattooed face, which was unprecedented. Even though he became a high official, people still looked down on him. Once, when he and Han Qi led troops on an expedition together, a general offended Han Qi, and Han Qi wanted to kill him. Di Qing stepped forward to protect him, saying that this general was a good man. Han Qi immediately put on a stern face and said, "Only the number one scholar who comes out of Donghua Gate is a good man, what is he!" Han Qi looked down on this unlucky general, and also looked down on Di Qing. Di Qing came out and sighed: "My official position is the same as Han Gong, but I only lack a Jinshi." In fact, although Di Qing suffered from the tattooing, he was a little proud of it in his heart. At that time, there was a maternal uncle of the emperor who was also from the military, with characters tattooed on his face. Later, his sister entered the palace and gained favor, and he also became a high official out of nowhereâ€”this kind of nepotism is naturally another matter, but Di Qing only relied on military merits, so it was an exception. This maternal uncle of the emperor tried every means to find a doctor to remove the characters on his face, and it is said that it was quite effective. He was fat and white, and when the tattoo was removed, he actually had the appearance of wealth and nobility. Someone advised Di Qing to try to find a doctor, but Di Qing said: "I want my brothers to know that tattooing can also lead to success, and I don't want to remove it." When he reviewed the troops, he sometimes pointed to his face and said to the soldiers: "Look at me! As long as you fight bravely, you don't have to worry about not being rich!" It is also said that he always wore a mask on his face when fighting, and I think this may be related to the tattooing, he didn't want the enemy to know his origin.

When Di Qing was a privy councillor, people made a nursery rhyme to slander him, saying: "The Han looks like a barbarian, and the barbarian looks like a Han, his home is by the river of herbs," the first sentence alludes to the character "Di," and the second sentence alludes to his place of origin and the character "Qing," as a prophecy of his rebellion. Another time, a fire broke out across the street, and someone reported that they had seen Di Qing wearing a yellow jacket directing the fire fighting. The yellow jacket naturally alludes to putting on the imperial robe, and directing the fire fighting also implies that he wanted to take the opportunity to start an incident. As a result, he suffered attacks from all sides and was released to a foreign post and left Beijing. Soon, he became ill from anger and did not seek medical treatment or take medicine, and died depressed.

American Housewives

Both are housewives, both cook, wash clothes, sweep the floor, and buy groceries. Chinese housewives are busy all day and night, and they have to take care of their husbands in the evening. They say they don't have time to watch movies, and they don't even have a moment to sit down. American housewives do the same work, but they have a lot of free time all day long. In the evening, they take their husbands' arms and go to the movies or nightclubs for fun. In that kind of living environment, how can they not be broad-minded and fat? You rarely see an American housewife with a worried look. But Chinese housewives are overwhelmed by the heavy burden of the family. Except for a very few wealthy young wives who watch movies, play mahjong, and have fun every night, ninety-nine percent are suffering unspeakable hardships. This kind of suffering is completely unjustified. If Chinese families were mechanized, there would be no hardship to eat. The housewife would get up in the morning, push the electric sweeper, and walk around the room. In one minute, the floor would be swept clean. She would take out milk and bread from the refrigerator, turn on the electric stove, set the timer, and at a certain time, the power would automatically turn off. The bread would be baked and the milk would be boiled. After eating breakfast, she would go to the street to buy groceries. She would walk into the grocery store and take all kinds of vegetables and grains. The prices are fixed, and there is no need to bargain, nor do you need to bring a scale to weigh them. American scales have been standardized. There is no distinction between market scales and old scales, nor is there any difference between lowering or raising the price. The shop assistants are not allowed to press their hands on the scale to increase the weight and deceive customers. This saves a lot of trouble and disputes. Cooking lunch takes more time, but most families eat sandwiches. At most, they open a can. Washing clothes is the cheapest. Put the clothes and soap powder in the washing machine, turn on the power, and the machine will rattle. In about a quarter of an hour, the clothes and sheets will be completely washed and cleaned. Unfortunately, there is still no automatic ironing machine, and manual labor is still required. That is a more troublesome job, which American housewives regard as a daunting task, and most of them do it with the help of their husbands. The rest of the time is free. They read novels, listen to the radio, go for a walk in the evening, watch movies, and those who are interested go to nightclubs. With a glass in hand, they have no worries. American families make full use of Sundays and do not easily let them go. They either go to the suburban parks for picnics, or visit scenic spots in neighboring counties, or attend parties and be sure to have fun before returning. Americans are naturally optimistic and regard everything as unimportant, because Americans are not afraid of losing their jobs and do not worry about firewood and rice. What else can make them worry? The family is the cell of society. When society is stable, the family is also harmonious. In the United States, it is not easy to see husbands and wives scolding and fighting. Fighting can be a reason for divorce. Laying hands is not considered to be a Man. (Here it means a manly man.) (52)
