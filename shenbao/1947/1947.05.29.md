### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Cordially Receives Councillors, Explains Current Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a luncheon at his official residence at 12:30 PM on the 28th for several People's Political Council (PPC) members who are professors. Attendees included Zhang Boling, Xu Deheng, Zhang Lan, Wu Yifang, and others. During the luncheon, the Chairman inquired about their opinions on the student protests and the peace situation. Xu Deheng was the first to speak, stating that the young students are very pure and hoping the government could take this into consideration when handling the student protests. He believed the student protests were related to the peace issue, and he should offer his opinion on the peace issue. The Chairman acknowledged the students' purity but believed they were inevitably being exploited by external forces, and the government should handle the situation reasonably.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet for all PPC members at the Lishi Society at 7:30 PM on the 28th and immediately held an open forum that lasted for approximately an hour. Chairman Chiang first explained the current military, political, and economic situation. In military affairs, the Chairman expressed optimism about the future. Regarding the economy, although there is a sense of crisis, China is based on agriculture, so there will be no economic collapse. Regarding the current student protests, the Chairman stated that the cause of the protests was largely due to the instigation of the Communist Party, who even publicly stated that they would hold large-scale parades on the Communist Party's memorial day of June 2nd, which further proved this. The government should handle those who cause disturbances according to the measures for maintaining public order. Government officials attending tonight's banquet included Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Chen Qitian, and others. The banquet concluded around 9 PM.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet for all National PPC members at the Lishi Society at 7:30 PM on the 28th. At the end of the banquet, he stood up and gave a speech, explaining the current situation. The main points of the speech are recorded as follows: (1) The PPC has been in session for over a week. The PPC members have been diligently researching methods to stabilize the current situation, showing their concern and responsibility for the country, which is commendable. I believe that if we all work together to promote the spirit of serving the country and the people, we will be able to overcome any danger and difficulty. Moreover, the construction of the Republic of China will be completed soon. (2) Currently, there are indeed many shortcomings in the economic, social, and political aspects of the country that need to be openly examined and reformed. However, the most important thing is to enable the people to distinguish right from wrong and understand their interests. If right and wrong are not clear, and interests are not distinguished, it will be the root of national turmoil. I believe that the greatest hidden worry of the country today lies in the confusion of the concept of right and wrong and the lack of understanding of interests, resulting in the loss of a common goal. Since the councilors began meeting, they have been painstakingly studying how to achieve national peace and unity, and enable the people to live in peace and prosperity. However, I believe that the greatest contribution of the councilors lies in leading the people of the whole country to understand what is right and what is wrong. The place where public right and wrong lie is the place where great benefits and great harms are involved. This is the biggest key to stabilizing the current situation. (3) Today, society is in decline and the people are suffering. Everyone desires peace, and the reasoning is the same. Since the surrender of the enemy, I have personally, for more than a year, been seeking peace through all possible means, enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens. The process by which I sought domestic peace is well known to all of you. What I want to say painfully and frankly today is that if there is still war in the country after eight years of resistance against Japan, it will be a disgrace to the entire country. Any responsible government would not want to use force to solve problems. This is obvious. If the Communist Party still has the slightest sincerity to seek peace, the government is willing to solve it through political means. However, when the Communist Party forces the government to use force to stop destructive and unifying armed actions, some social opinions blame the government for the responsibility of the war, and oppose conscription and grain requisition, without considering what caused this suffering, nor have they heard any cries for the plight of the people in the bandit areas. If right and wrong are not clear in this way, what good will it do to the facts? The so-called peace talks should be bilateral. I can declare that the government's policy of political solution and peaceful unification has never changed. As long as the Communist Party has sincerity and extends its hand, the government welcomes any effective suggestions from your council for preserving the country's vitality and relieving the people's suffering.

The Nature of This Student Protest Is Complex, Hoping All Schools Assist in Eliminating the Trouble

(4) The complexity of this student protest is unprecedented. The Communist Party has a definite plan to intensify military attacks on the front lines and intensify social disruption in various places. Our young students are being used as tools. At first, the Communist Party instigated students to make various excessive demands for their own benefit, and then turned the student protests into opposition to the civil war, conscription, and grain requisition. Clear-sighted people can see the occurrence and evolution of this. It is by no means accidental that they designated June 2nd as the date for a general strike and parade, and called for strikes and boycotts. In fact, June 2nd is the anniversary of the so-called anti-civil war movement launched in Yan'an last year. The government had already learned of this plan. In order to protect the majority of young people from being destroyed by schemers and to maintain social order, it cannot but take preventive measures. Therefore, the National Government promulgated temporary measures to maintain social order. The speech I personally gave clearly told young people not to be poisoned by the Communist Party's trick. Although we have already warned in this way, we still hope that social leaders and school authorities will assist the government in pointing out the true right and wrong, benefits and harms to young students. Young people are the new life of the country. We must cherish them, but we must not be lenient. The ancients said, "leniency breeds evil." We should know that leniency is enough to foster disaster. We cannot indulge and spoil, corrupt the academic atmosphere, sacrifice national laws, and harm social order, especially when the Communist Party is doing its best to incite. The first priority must be to clearly distinguish the Communist rioters in the school from the general students, so that the Communist Party cannot mix in and cause trouble. We have the responsibility to cultivate young people, and we must do everything we can to find ways to prevent unfortunate events from happening. I hope everyone understands the government's painstaking efforts and adopts a consistent and solemn attitude. In particular, the local school authorities must cooperate with the government and jointly take responsibility, so that we can eliminate the trouble before it takes shape. (5) Regarding the military situation, I would also like to give a brief description. Although there is no significant progress on various fronts, the planned plans have been achieved. The soldiers on the front lines are serving the country with loyalty, courage, and unwavering spirit, and will never allow the Communist Party to succeed in its conspiracy to arbitrarily disrupt. Currently, important strongholds in the north and south have been recovered one after another. The national army is closely guarded, monitoring the next step of the Communist army. Until the Communist Party sincerely accepts your council's suggestions for seeking peace and has concrete results, the national army will never relax its efforts to protect the foundation of the country. Then, Lin Hu, Chairman of the PPC Presidium, replied, saying: "Today, I am very grateful to the Chairman for specially inviting us to the banquet despite his busy schedule. Recalling that this council was established during the War of Resistance, it has made contributions to the country and society, all thanks to the Chairman's wise guidance. Now that the country is moving towards democratic construction, the government's support for public opinion organs and respect for public opinion at all levels is very exciting for us. The Chairman's speech just now was sincere and detailed. I hope that the Chairman's wise spirit will inspire all levels of government. Public opinion organs at all levels should work together for the stability and progress of the country."

### The Corruption of Yangtze River Shipping Should Be Improved Quickly

Temporary Motion in the Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] PPC members Liang Jiguang, Chi Zaiqing, and dozens of others, regarding the Yangtze River shipping problem, presented a temporary motion at the PPC plenary review committee on the 28th, which was decided to be submitted for review. The reasons for the case are as follows: "The corruption of Yangtze River shipping is becoming increasingly serious, and effective improvements should be made quickly, and the responsibility for the loss of the Zhongya steamboat and the subsequent handling of the matter should be investigated."

### The "Relief Headquarters" Office Replied to the PPC Yesterday by Telegram

[Central News Agency, This City] After the staff members of the Communist Party stationed at the Executive Headquarters (EH) received a telegram from the PPC a few days ago urging the Communist Party's PPC members to go to Beijing to attend the meeting, they replied to the PPC yesterday morning in the name of the Shanghai Office of the "Relief Headquarters" (RH), stating that the person in charge, Wu Yunfu, had gone to the Communist Party's relief area in Shandong to inspect. The telegram stated: "To the Presidium of the Nanjing PPC and the entire assembly, when your council's telegram arrived in Shanghai, it coincided with Mr. Wu Yunfu's departure from Shanghai to inspect relief work in our area, so he himself did not have time to receive it. However, after checking, there is no connection between the Yantai EH radio station and any Communist radio station in our area, so after Mr. Dong Biwu and others left Beijing, our association's communication and liaison with northern Shaanxi has been completely cut off. We are sorry that we cannot comply with the request to forward the telegram. We hope you will forgive us for our disobedience. We hereby reply by telegram." It is reported that there are three places that maintain contact with the Shandong Communist Party area through the Shanghai EH radio station: Yantai, Huimin, and Shibaishuo. In the past, most of the letters and telegrams from the Communist Party authorities to Shanghai were transmitted through the Shanghai-Yantai line. After the recovery of Yan'an, the transmission time may have been extended, but it should not have been cut off. Therefore, the reason why the Communist Party members staying in Shanghai did not send the PPC's invitation telegram is unknown.

### Stabilizing the Currency Value, Thorough Research on the Exchange Rate, No Changes at Present - Dong Xian Guang Declared at a Press Conference

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, Dong Xian Guang, answered reporters' questions at a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 28th as follows:

Question: What measures will the government take regarding the students' plan to hold a nationwide demonstration on June 2nd?

Answer: The measures for maintaining social order promulgated by the government on May 29th prohibit demonstrations and parades that disrupt social order and harm public safety. The government and school authorities are now making their best efforts to persuade students not to take illegal actions.

Question: Does the government have any plans or intentions to conscript students or others who participate in demonstrations into the army?

Answer: I have not heard of any such plans or intentions by the government.

Question: Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance recently reported to the PPC that the government is considering stabilizing the currency system. Can you tell us the detailed meaning of this statement?

Answer: Since the previous PPC suggested that the government stabilize the currency, the government has been thoroughly studying this issue. There are currently no plans to change the foreign exchange rate.

Question: Please tell us about the recent military situation, especially the military situation in the Northeast. Has the Communist army's threat to Changchun been lifted?

Answer: The battles in the Northeast last week were concentrated around Changchun and Sipingjie. The Communist army mobilized 60,000 people. Its First and Third Divisions began to attack Sipingjie on May 20th. At the same time, the Third Column of the Korean Communist Party and the troops of the First and Second Independent Divisions attacked the Changchun-Sipingjie area, and fierce battles occurred. The First and Third Divisions of the Communist army suffered heavy losses, and the remnants have retreated. The Communist army around Changchun has also retreated, with approximately 3,000 casualties. In addition, another 30,000 Communist troops attempted to seize Yongji, but failed. The 50,000 Communist troops led by Li Hongguang and Yang Jingyu, which are a mixed force of the Chinese Communist Party and the Korean Communist Party, are rampaging in the Meihekou and Weijinhekou areas north of Tonghua in the south. There are no new developments on the Shandong and Shanxi battlefields.

Question: Does the government have concrete measures to suppress the rising rice prices?

Answer: The government is striving for reasonable and stable grain prices, and I explained this on May 7th. These measures are being actively implemented. At present, we are paying particular attention to facilitating the transportation of grain, so that provinces and counties with surplus grain can quickly transport it to important cities. After the Yangtze River water level rises, the difficulties in grain transportation will gradually decrease. In addition to answering reporters' questions, Dong also released two pieces of news: (1) The National Economic Commission held its first meeting in the Executive Yuan yesterday. President Zhang told the 34 committee members present that the commission was the general staff for solving China's economic problems. President Zhang serves as the chairman of the commission and there is no vice-chairman. (2) Yesterday, the Executive Yuan meeting approved the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Review Committee. The Minister of Finance will serve as the chairman of the committee, and the other members will be the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, the Director-General of the National Government Accounting Office, the Minister of Audit, and the Governor of the Central Bank. In the future, the committee will be fully responsible for reviewing foreign exchange.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the suspension of the Shanghai Wenhui, Xinmin, and Lianhe newspapers, at the Information Bureau's press conference at 4:30 PM on the 28th, a reporter asked about the Information Bureau's attitude. Director Dong replied that the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Headquarters implemented the suspension of the three newspapers based on martial law, and the garrison headquarters has the power to implement this. Regarding the handling of this matter, the Shanghai Police Department has reported to the Ministry of Interior.

### Regarding the Communist Party and Peace Proposals, the PPC Has Completed the Review and Submitted Them to a Special Committee to Formulate Concrete Plans

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The PPC held a plenary review meeting all day on the 28th to discuss the peace issue. The number of PPC members, government officials, and guests attending and listening was greater than in previous meetings, which proves the importance attached to the peace issue by all parties. More than 50 PPC members requested to speak, presenting their personal opinions and methods. As a result, the meeting passed the Presidium's decision to organize a special committee on proposals related to the peace issue to formulate concrete plans. The records of each PPC member's speech were also submitted to the committee. As for the trends of those who spoke at the review committee, some PPC members believed that the Communist Party was arbitrarily rampant in its controlled areas, and the people were suffering terribly. They advocated that the government should issue an order to suppress the rebellion. PPC members from various northern provinces strongly advocated this. Those with more moderate opinions advocated that the General Assembly should appeal for peace to both the government and the Communist Party, and take this peace talk as the final test of the Communist Party's sincerity for peace. Although some people also advocated that there should be no further fighting at present, it seemed difficult to realize their intentions from the atmosphere of the meeting.

The plenary review meeting on the morning of the 28th was chaired by Li Huang. 217 PPC members attended. At 9:25 AM, Li Huang announced the opening of the meeting and immediately explained four points: (1) Proposals will no longer be read one by one to save time. (2) Those who wish to speak should notify the chairman in writing. (3) The speaking time is still limited to five minutes. (4) The proposer's explanation is also limited to five minutes. At this time, there were already many slips requesting to speak on the chairman's stage, and more were added later. However, because many speakers failed to abide by the five-minute limit, although the morning meeting lasted for three hours, only Chen Shaoxian, Liang Shangdong, Sha Yankai, Wang Hansheng, Wu Chunwu, Wang Puhan, Zhou Qianchong, Li Hongwen, Jiang Hengyuan, Du Xunruo, Du Xiyi, Lü Yunzhang, Lu Qian, He Baoren, Huang Yuren, Zhai Canglu, Zhang Jinjian, Hu Qiuyuan, Wang Dongzhen, Yao Yanfen, Chen Yaodong, Xu Deheng, Zhang Yishan, Pan Chaoying, Li Shimao, Pan Lianru, Kong Geng, Jiang Yiping and other 29 people got the opportunity to speak, and the meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

The only common point among the speakers was that they all clarified that peace is an urgent demand of the whole country, and no one opposed it. However, there were two major factions on how to achieve peace: one faction advocated peace talks and seeking peace through peace, and the other faction advocated that there was no need for peace talks and that an order should be directly issued to suppress the rebellion and seek peace through force. The former was divided into two opinions: one was to take this peace talk as the final test of the Communist Party's sincerity for peace, and the other believed that the current situation could no longer continue fighting, and a military solution was impossible, so a political solution should be sought. The most number of people advocated using peace talks as a test of the Communist Party's sincerity. Chen Shaoxian said: The preconditions for peace talks put forward by the government and the Communist Party are far apart. Shortening this distance is the goal of this council today. Therefore, he advocated that the council should invite the Communist Party's PPC members to come to Beijing to attend the meeting and discuss peace strategies with a solemn attitude. Sha Yankai said that to restore peace talks, we should "not settle old scores and not talk about the law" so that the negotiations can proceed smoothly. He advocated "replacing war with elections." Wang Hansheng pointed out the lessons of past failed peace talks and believed that attention should be paid to three issues this time: (1) see if the Communist Party has the determination to achieve peace, (2) the method of peace should be the unification of military orders and the unification of political orders, (3) the steps to carry out peace talks should be stipulated. After describing the atrocities of the Communist army after entering the Northeast, Du Xunruo believed that the Communist army was not satisfied with occupying a certain area. He advocated that if seeking peace through peace could not be achieved, the national strength should be used to help the government suppress the rebellion. Lu Qian agreed with Ye Daoyuan's proposal and supplemented three opinions: (1) The council should maintain a detached position, (2) Publicly negotiate the process and the opinions of both parties, (3) Political and military discussions should be held at the same time. He Baoren said that the Communist Party's sincerity for peace should be given a final test. If the Communist Party still has no sincerity, please ask the government to suppress the rebellion. Huang Yuren doubted the Communist Party's sincerity for peace. He believed that (1) peace is by no means a distribution of spoils, (2) peace should be achieved as soon as possible. The method is to appeal to both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for peace, create a fair opinion, and ask the people of the whole country to hold a fair attitude and let the council send representatives to participate in the peace talks. Hu Qiuyuan explained Wang Xiaolai's proposal, advocating putting forward a detached and active peace plan. This plan should: 1. Both sides cancel the preconditions, 2. Not investigate the past, 3. Respect the facts, acknowledge the facts, 4. Abide by the principles and spirit of the Political Consultative Conference. The party that does not accept the council's plan should bear the responsibility for the war. Chen Yaodong said that both the government and the Communist Party should make concessions on the preconditions and negotiate with a fair attitude. Only success is allowed, and failure is not allowed. Kong Geng's opinion on peace talks was different from others. He advocated that there should be no truce before the negotiations are successful. His reason was that the Communist Party does not keep its promises and cannot be deceived again. Jiang Yiping hoped to correct the Communist Party's style and attitude, so that both sides would not investigate the past and discuss fair and reasonable methods to seek a solution. Xu Deheng was the most vocal advocate that a military solution should not be used and that peace talks must be restored. He believed that "fighting on is unacceptable," "fighting for ten or twenty years will still require peace," and that the lives of the people in the North are extremely difficult and should not continue to fight. He said that the PPC is an organization that united to resist Japan, and after the war, there is an opportunity for peace and unity. Political problems should be solved in a political way. He also raised the impropriety of the student protests, the suspension of the three newspapers in Shanghai, and the temporary measures to maintain social order. Jiang Hengyuan believed that it was impossible to solve the Communist Party problem in three to five months, so the council should send representatives to discuss with the Communist Party, and then form groups such as the Peace Promotion Association to discuss the solution. Jiang said: If this problem is solved, the student protests can also be quelled. As for those who advocated that there was no need for peace talks and that an order should be directly issued to suppress the rebellion, there were also many of them. Liang Shangdong said that most people currently hope for peace, which is the hope that the government will send troops to defeat the Communist Party in order to achieve peace. He sacrificed his right arm during the War of Resistance and is now willing to sacrifice his left arm in the suppression of the Communist Party. Wu Chunwu believed that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have exclusiveness, and it is predetermined that they cannot stop the war and make peace. Only the government can be asked to issue an order to suppress the rebellion. Wang Puhan also believed that "there can be no peace," and the Communist Party's PPC members would never attend the General Assembly. The responsibility is clear, and the human and material resources of the whole country should be concentrated to use force to achieve peace. Li Hongwen represented the opinions of the people in the North and opposed the ineffective truce to avoid suffering losses again. Zhai Canglu also advocated immediate suppression. However, he said: The military discipline of the troops suppressing the Communist Party should be paid attention to by the military officers. Li Shimao firmly advocated achieving the goal of peace through military action. In addition, some people also advocated launching a peace movement in the Communist Party area. For example, Huang Yuren pointed out that if a peace movement is launched in the government area through strikes and class boycotts, the Communist Party area will concentrate all its strength to attack the national army, which is very unfair. Fan Chaoying's opinion was the most novel in the morning meeting. He explained that the terms "civil war" and "internal turmoil" are both inappropriate. He believed that today's war is a war instigated by a third country. Therefore, the solution should start from the international and diplomatic aspects, and the true meaning of this war should be declared so that people all over the world can understand peace before there is a solution.

### The Review Committee Continues Meeting: Councilors Enthusiastically Speak, Seeking Paths to Peace, Each with Their Own Proposals

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The full council review committee continued its meeting on the 28th afternoon. Chairman Jiang Yong presided, from 3:30 PM to 7:15 PM. Councilors continued to express their opinions on peace. A total of 34 people spoke, including Bao Yimin, Yan Shutang, Lin Hu, Yin Shuxian, Wu Wangji, Zhou Qianchong, Chu Fucheng, Huang Yanpei, He Jihong, Cheng Ximeng, Wang Zaoshi, and Jin Zhenyu. The majority advocated that if seeking peace fails, the government should immediately issue a decree to suppress the Communists. For a time, the meeting place was filled with calls for suppression.

Their reasons were that wherever the Communist army went, they burned, killed, looted, and seized, the people could not bear their lives, and were in extreme suffering. The Communist army had no intention of peace, only engaging in fighting interspersed with negotiations, which only increased the people's deeper suffering. Therefore, they advocated that the government immediately issue a decree to suppress them. Secondly, some advocated for peace with a price. Others advocated sending personnel to the Communist-held areas to solicit opinions. If the Communists proposed conditions without sincerity for peace, then they should resolve to suppress them. Generally speaking, all felt that fighting interspersed with negotiations caused too much suffering for the people, and a definite strategy must be determined to seek a permanent solution. Another part believed that the opinions of the people should be respected, and the decision on war or peace should be based on them. Wang Zaoshi proposed stopping the civil war, believing that all parties in the country should bear responsibility for the civil war. If the civil war were to continue, it would affect the international war, so a ceasefire should be enacted immediately, and the ceasefire must be sincere. Wang had three methods for conducting peace talks: (1) Both sides immediately and simultaneously implement a comprehensive ceasefire in place; (2) A national peace conference could be convened; (3) This council should elect councilors from various parties to organize a peace promotion association.

Zhou Qianchong proposed that political disputes should be resolved with political wisdom. Zhou said that the key to the peace issue lies in determination. If the people have the determination to seek peace, then peace can be achieved. At the same time, he believed that China's problems should be resolved in China, in Nanjing. Currently, it is a tug-of-war war, "pulling back and forth, the people's heads are being pulled off." Huang Yanpei loudly exclaimed that peace is a must. Not only are the common people suffering now, but they will suffer even more in the future. Huang believed that the present is a critical juncture for the life and death of the country and the people, and we must come up with a proper solution to resolve it. Chu Fucheng then emphasized and explained Shao Congen's peace proposal, with his opinions being: (1) The assembly should pass a resolution calling on the government and the Chinese Communist Party to seek peace, and organize a peace promotion committee; (2) Both sides should abolish any conditions for peace talks and immediately cease military conflicts throughout the country; (3) The Peace Promotion Committee should provide opinions based on a national standpoint to ensure that true peace is realized as soon as possible. Wang Bao-xuan pointed out that peace should be sincere and should not put on a compassionate face, hypocritically proposing peace. It should be clear who does not want peace and be cautious about the object of peace. Wang said: "Those with political power must want peace; those without political power do not need peace. The Communist Party has already negated the government. We are councilors hired by the government negated by the Communist Party, and have no status in the eyes of the Communist Party. Yet we are talking highly about peace. Who will be the target?" Wang then commented on the student movement proposed by Xu Deheng and the three newspapers in Shanghai, saying: "Are we going to target the three newspapers and the students? Do the three newspapers and the students represent the Communist Party?" Finally, he said: "Seeking peace with peace was tried last year and proved unsuccessful. Seeking peace with war is not yet hopeless. The reason it has not been successful is due to some shortcomings. We should ask the government to eliminate corruption and concentrate all efforts to seek true peace."

Liu Jing, Bao Yimin, Cui Zhenhua, Wu Shipeng, Li Rulang, Wang Huamin, Zhang Bangzhen, and others all recounted the suffering of the people and unanimously requested suppression. Yan Shutang exclaimed: "I don't want peace talks. I can't bear to hear peace talks. I hate peace talks!" Zhang Deng said that peace is for three parties: (1) the government, (2) the Communist Party, and (3) the Soviet Union. Currently, we are only asking for peace from one-third of the parties, the government. How can it succeed? Wang Zemin believed that there were several prerequisites: First, both sides must cease fire unconditionally; Second, if this cannot be done, the people's organizations from both sides should jointly form a people's arbitration committee to decide. The opinions of both sides on peace can be submitted to the arbitration committee; (4) If one side cannot accept the opinion, it can be known which side is rejecting the people, and the people on both sides can jointly condemn it. Others still believed that the council should be a mediator. However, in the afternoon meeting, calls for suppression outnumbered calls for peace.

### Random Notes from the Political Consultative Conference

— Our Correspondent, Yu Zhenji

The full review session of the council on the 28th had 217 councilors in attendance, making it the liveliest day since the meetings began. President Sun Ke, President Yu Youren, and Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng also attended and listened in, filling the seats on the officials' platform. This proves the degree to which all parties are concerned about peace.

The meeting place was full of speeches. Ye Daoyuan stood up to remind the chairman that continuing the discussion in this way would not yield results. Chairman Li Huang replied that the presidium had discussed this matter beforehand. After all parties had spoken to a considerable extent, the presidium would have a way to handle it.

The lyricist Lu Zhi dropped a lot of book knowledge on the podium, shouting, "Fight, talk, fight, talk, fight, talk, rise, fall, rise, fall, rise, fall." If this continues, the common people can't bear it!

Huang Yuren, the "big gun," was the most prominent figure in the meeting on the 28th. Before speaking, he handed a note to the chairman, roughly requesting an extension of his speaking time. In fact, he spoke for at least ten minutes that day, earning applause five or six times. His witty remark, "In today's situation, the people cannot bear their lives, and the officials are not connected to their livelihoods," he said that peace is not a division of spoils, not a piece for the Kuomintang, a piece for the Communist Party, a piece for the MinShe Party, and a piece for the Youth Party. If that were the case, wouldn't it become a "fried eight pieces"!

Female councilor Wang Dongzhen reported two strange tortures used by the Communist Party, one called "going to the rooftop" and the other called "anti-aircraft gun." Lu Yunzhang also told a story. In this type of council meeting, many female councilors tell stories, and they all tell them very vividly.

Hu Shi gestured wildly on the stage talking about peace. His wife was supervising him in the audience. After Hu finished speaking and returned to his seat, his wife also left, as if she had come specifically to support her husband.

Chen Yaodong spoke at length about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, saying, "The general trend of the world, after a long period of division, it must unite; after a long period of unity, it must divide; after a long period of peace, there will be war; after a long period of war, there will be peace." He also said that he himself had a lot of experience in persuading couples to stop arguing. As long as there is sincerity, no quarrel cannot be resolved.

The old gentleman Kong Geng took the stage to perform again today. Halfway through his speech, the time was up, and the chairman rang the bell. He turned around to argue and criticized, saying that in history, only Qin Hui talked about peace. Those who have been fooled by the Communist Party do not talk about peace. He himself is an example.

Jiang Yiping is worthy of being a famous lawyer. He pointed out that Councilor Xu Deheng had exceeded his speaking time. The chairman repeatedly rang the bell, and the audience repeatedly applauded, urging him to come down, but he ignored them. Not talking about the rule of law and talking about democracy is empty talk. The tug-of-war style peace talks are ruining the common people.

Almost none of the 29 councilors who spoke this morning did not exceed five minutes. They turned a deaf ear to the ringing of the bell on the stage, and the chairman's attempts to stop them were ineffective. The peace issue is too important, who wouldn't want to say a few more words! (Combined)

In the afternoon meeting, the first few speakers were all female councilors. According to statistics, none of the seven or eight female councilors who spoke did not advocate for suppressing the rebellion. In particular, several female councilors from the Northeast spoke vehemently. Councilor Fan Yongshu from Yunnan spoke with humor. He said, "Now peace talks are empty talk. Precisely because they are empty talk, I will not talk about them." Zhang Bangzhen said: "Peace, peace, how many evils are carried out in your name."

Youth Party councilor Zhou Qianchong gave an example. He said: "An American reporter who went from China to Japan said that his impression of the two countries was like going from a chaotic world to a silent paradise." Japan is moving towards the road to recovery, and we should be vigilant. After Zhou finished speaking, someone said that they discovered that Zhou was speaking for the second time. Kong Geng immediately protested to the chairman, saying: "If a person can speak twice, I want to speak again." However, this issue did not cause a stir, because Zhou Qianchong's second speech had special reasons, and the presidium could not help but give him some understanding.

Wang Zaoshi said that it is wrong to sit on a sofa and talk about whether to fight or not.

### The Northeast National Army Recovers Faku: Fierce Battle at Siping Throughout the Night, the Communist Army Retreats; Two Routes of Communist Army in Eastern Hebei Attack Shijimenzhai

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] Faku was lost and recovered on the 27th, and the threat to Tieling has been reduced. Xi'an and Xifeng are both stable. In addition, the Communist army attacked Changtu on the night of the 28th and shelled Shizhan, with fierce fighting throughout the night. At dawn, they harassed Mazhonghe and other stations again to the south, threatening Kaiyuan. By noon, the Communist army was repelled. The Communist army besieging Siping Street numbered no less than 70,000. On the night of the 27th, they approached the city again, with fierce fighting throughout the night. On the morning of the 28th, they retreated to a slightly more distant place. Army Commander Chen Mingren said that Siping is safe.

[United Press, Beiping, 28th] Military authorities in Siping Street issued a curfew order on the 28th and arrested 180 suspected spies, one of whom has been executed. The spy who was executed was a Taoist priest who climbed onto a chimney and sent attack signals to the Communist army, after which the Communist artillery shelled the city of Siping Street.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] Dong Yingbin, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, flew to Beiping by plane in the rain on the morning of the 28th and returned to Shenyang at dusk. It is said that he was sent to confer with Director Li Zongren on military matters.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] The Communist army south of Pulandian has been gathering in Zhuanghe in recent days. In addition to the approximately 2,000 who bypassed Wafangdian some days ago, there are more than 3,000 who have bypassed from other routes. It is judged that there are two reasons: (1) to harass the Andong area, and (2) to contain the National Army's forces.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The fighting northeast of Tangshan in Eastern Hebei is still ongoing. It is said that the remnants of Li Yunchang's Communist army fled east from the border of Rehe to Caoying and Yiyuan Pass west of Linyu.

### The Distribution and Organization of Korean Communist Army in Northeast, Totaling Approximately 30,000

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] As the Communist army in northern Songhua River forgets the painful lessons learned from several past invasions of the Jilin-Changchun area, and once again throws its entire force south across the river, the reporter hereby synthesizes information from various sources to introduce the distribution and organization of the Korean Communist army in the Northeast, which is driven by the Communist army's "use of foreign races" policy and makes futile sacrifices. The leader of the Korean Communist army in the Northeast, Jiang Xintai, is a powerful member of the "International Faction." He served as a captain in the Soviet Red Army. When the Japanese surrendered on August 15th, he entered the Northeast with the Soviet army. He is currently the commander of the Jilin-Eastern Military District. In addition to controlling the security regiments of Wangqing, Helong, Hunchun, Dunhua, and Yanji, five counties in eastern Jilin (totaling approximately 2,500 people), he also commands the Independent Division, the Independent Second Division, and the Li Hongguang Detachment (equivalent to a division's strength), the main force of the Korean Communists in eastern Jilin. The total strength of these three divisions is approximately 17,000 people. Jiang himself serves as the commander, occupying the Jinchuan and Huinan areas in the northern part of Andong Province and the eastern part of Jilin Province, in a state of confrontation with the National Army stationed in Hailong, Panshi, and Huadian, and taking advantage of opportunities to harass the National Army's defense areas, looting, burning, and killing. In this group of Korean Communists, in addition to the soldiers and some cadres being Korean, the senior cadres and deputy division commanders are all members of the Chinese Communist Party. It has been learned that the commander of the Independent Second Division is Liu Dongyuan, and the leader of the Li Hongguang Detachment is Wang Guang. Wang is the deceased leader of the Korean anti-Japanese movement in the Northeast. The Chinese Communist Party uses his reputation among Koreans, borrowing the name of the team. In addition, the Communist army's Jilin-Eastern Military District also has a Korean artillery regiment of approximately 500 people, which assisted the Communist army in capturing Changchun in "April 14th" last year. In addition, there are the Chinese-Korean mixed First and Second Divisions, stationed in Dunhua and Hada respectively. The strength of the two divisions is 15,000 people, of which Koreans account for approximately one-third. In total, the Korean Communist forces above, the Jilin-Eastern Military District has approximately 22,000 people, and approximately 10,000 others are scattered in various places in Harbin. They have also assisted the Communist army in invading Jilin and the southern end of the Ji-Hai Railway. However, according to qualified Koreans in Changchun, nearly 70% of the Korean Communist army are forced to participate, and more than 20% are looking for food and clothing by joining the army because they have no means of living.

### Traffic on the Ping-Cheng Section is Restored: The Battle for Longhua is Fierce

### The Communist Army Devises Various Pretexts to Seek Money Before Taking Lives

The So-Called Account-Settling Murder is Very Cruel

[Our GuiSui Dispatch, 27th] The Communist army has innovated its tricks. Recently, in the Yanbei area, following the settlement of accounts, they have implemented the so-called clearing of accounts, that is, killing those who have been settled with to eliminate all traces, which is a retaliatory act against the returning home team. The method of clearing accounts is to drag those who have been settled with to the ground, dragging them until their brains rupture, their whole bodies are fractured, and they die.

### Famous Historian Qiao Xun Tragically Murdered by the Communist Army

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th] The famous historian Qiao Xun was tragically killed after the fall of Hejin due to the Communist army's clearing of blood debts.

After the War of Resistance, he retired to his hometown. The Japanese threatened him several times, but he refused to take any puppet position.

### People in Harbin Flee in Large Numbers: The Communist Party Sets June 1st to Implement General Mobilization; Men Will Be Forcibly Conscripted to the Front Lines

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] Harbin is now experiencing a phenomenon of famine flight that has not occurred since it was occupied by the Communist army for more than a year. According to statistics from the Changchun Municipal Government, in the past five days, the number of refugees fleeing from Harbin to Changchun has reached more than 3,000. In addition to escaping the famine that is prevalent in the Communist-held areas, they also want to escape the "manpower shortage" caused by the Communist Party's continuous military defeats. On June 1st, Harbin City will implement a general mobilization order, and men will be forcibly conscripted to the front lines, either as soldiers, or as stretcher bearers, or to drive carts to transport supplies. Even the old and weak cannot be exempted unless absolutely necessary. This is what refugees who fled from Harbin to Changchun told reporters. What is particularly noteworthy is that among the thousands of refugees who fled to Changchun, most are old, weak, women, and children. Given the strict security in the Communist-held areas, how can they allow so many refugees to pass through checkpoints and flee? According to refugees who fled to Changchun, at present, inflation is rampant and prices are high in the Communist-held areas. As a result of thoroughly requisitioning grain in recent years, not only is spring plowing impossible, but it has also led to a famine. Therefore, the people, threatened by the famine and various terror policies, all want to flee to the recovered areas. In order to alleviate the serious famine caused by the lack of food, the Communist army has clearly imposed restrictions, but tacitly allows those so-called stubborn elements to leave the Communist area. Anyone who wants to move out of the Communist area only needs to pay a deposit of 20,000 yuan and find two shops to guarantee them, and they can be released. It is said that the Changchun Municipal Authorities are currently trying to provide relief to these refugees.

### Yu Hongjun's Financial Report (Continued and Concluded)

Improving Local Finances: Last year, the government, considering it necessary to change the financial revenue and expenditure system for national construction, revised the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law, dividing the national finance into three levels: central, provincial (municipal), and county (municipal bureau). The allocation of tax sources for all levels of government was also readjusted. Now, we will first review the system aspect. Since the implementation of the revised Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law, there have been both advantages and disadvantages in the local finance system. Advantages: 1. The new system divides national finance into three levels, with a clear system, and has a somewhat equitable financial form, which is very beneficial for the implementation of constitutional government and the promotion of local autonomy. 2. The provincial finance has restored its independent status, allowing it to gradually seek self-sufficiency to promote provincial autonomy. 3. County finance is more abundant than before. In addition to the original five autonomous taxes, it also receives 50% of the land tax (including agricultural tax), 50% of the business tax, 30% of the inheritance tax, and all of the deed tax, and can legally levy special taxes tailored to local conditions to make up for the budget, thereby consolidating the foundation of grassroots autonomy. Disadvantages: 1. The allocation of tax sources is not completely fair, especially the provincial tax allocation is too small. 2. Although the business tax is clearly defined as a provincial tax, it is also stipulated that half of it should be returned to the county, which is similar to a tax source shared by the province and county, and the name does not match the reality. 3. Provincial revenue is extremely scarce. The main provincial revenue is only 20% of the agricultural tax and 50% of the business tax. It is still difficult to achieve self-sufficiency to support provincial undertakings. County and municipal finances have seen a large increase in legal tax sources since the reform, and a considerable foundation has been laid in terms of the system. However, because county and municipal expenditures are not necessarily based entirely on legal budgets or the requirements of autonomous undertakings, and because temporary expenditures to meet the orders of superiors or military supplies are often several times greater than normal expenditures, they are generally still in a state of insufficient income and expenditure. In recent years, the increase and expansion of county and municipal institutions have also been the root cause of the difficulty in eradicating miscellaneous levies.

Let me further elaborate on the Ministry's handling of the problem of miscellaneous levies and apportionments in local areas: The central government has repeatedly strictly prohibited local apportionments and miscellaneous taxes. The Ministry has paid special attention to this issue for a long time. In 1946 alone, the Ministry supervised the abolition of more than 70 types of miscellaneous and difficult taxes. Recently, in order to effectively clarify miscellaneous levies and apportionments, we have formulated five measures: 1. It is proposed to request the Executive Yuan to issue a general order to all ministries and departments of the central government and provincial commissions that the funds required for matters entrusted to counties and cities should be allocated by the entrusting agency in a dedicated manner. 2. After the budget is approved, if new local undertakings need to be carried out, a supplementary budget should be prepared in accordance with the law and submitted for approval before implementation is allowed. 3. No illegal collection agency shall collect any funds or materials from the people, and even legal collection agencies shall not collect illegal taxes or apportion funds or materials from the people. Violators shall be punished in accordance with Article 129 of the Criminal Law. 4. County and city magistrates shall be jointly liable for any connivance or leniency in the illegal apportionment of their subordinate grassroots administrative agencies, or for negligent supervision, if verified by public complaint. 5. If county governments and township and village personnel arbitrarily apportion local levies, the people are allowed to list the facts and evidence and directly report to the provincial government or the central government. After verification, severe penalties will be imposed. The above supplementary measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.

Conclusion: The above report is about the important financial and monetary measures of the past year. We will continue to work hard in the future to strengthen the coordination between financial and economic policies, with the goal of increasing agricultural and industrial production, enriching the national economy, stabilizing prices, and balancing income and expenditure. Although the current financial and economic situation is difficult, I firmly believe that as long as everyone recognizes the goals, works together, and strives, all difficulties can be overcome.

Editorial

### Steps to Stabilize the People's Food Supply

Yesterday, rice prices in Shanghai plummeted, with top-grade white japonica dropping to the 400,000 yuan per shi mark, a decrease of about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan from the previous day, but still up 52.6% from the end of January this year. Whether the supply is sufficient and whether there are supply problems still depends on the efforts of officials and merchants. It can be seen that the seriousness of the people's food problem has not yet been resolved. The local government is reorganizing an agency to handle distribution, and the city councilors are also paying close attention to this and are said to be proposing six specific measures for discussion, which further demonstrates the importance and urgency of this issue.

In summary, the focus of this issue is twofold: insufficient quantity and high prices. The main reason for the high prices is still the insufficient quantity. Therefore, the fundamental solution should start with improving the supply, but in an emergency, it is necessary to start with distribution in order to stabilize rice prices, reassure the people, and ensure that the supplied grain benefits the consuming public and does not flow into the hands of hoarders and profiteers. The distribution agency is being organized, and the survey of impoverished households has already begun. The distribution of rice to schools and factories has also started. The above emergency measures can be said to have matured and only need to be expanded and popularized, which should not be a problem in general. The only problem is how to increase the supply.

According to Mayor Wu's report to the City Council, the city needs 500,000 shi of rice per month, but because some citizens prefer wheat flour and some factories can purchase directly from the producing areas, only about 300,000 shi is actually needed. In addition to supplying 500,000 bags of wheat flour per month, the Ministry of Food is said to supply 120,000 shi of rice. The arrival of rice from the North and South Markets in the city ranges from 1,000 to 7,000 shi per day, averaging 5,000 shi, which yields 150,000 shi per month. Therefore, the supply and demand of rice in the city is roughly balanced, except for special reasons.

The concern is that the free delivery from the North and South Markets and the direct purchases by some factories are too fluid and not very reliable. Whenever the market price in the producing area suddenly changes, or accidents occur during transportation (such as detention or forced purchase), or the city introduces new control measures (such as implementing price limits, negotiated prices, and strict inspection of stored rice), rice merchants often use this as an excuse to temporarily stop purchasing or withhold the arrival of goods. At that time, rice prices inevitably fluctuate again, or even form a situation where there is a market but no supply, and the food crisis cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, in order to improve the supply and stabilize the people's food supply, we believe that the following three points still need to be quickly addressed.

(1) Stabilize the Market. The purpose is to stabilize the grain merchants so that they can freely purchase without being subjected to unexpected twists and turns and troubles. The key is to effectively protect legal transactions, avoid all unnecessary interference, and avoid excessively frequent emergency measures. If such interference and emergency measures are deemed necessary in fact, they should be extra cautious and strive to be reasonable, legal, and legitimate to protect their due interests.

(2) Strictly Prohibit Obstruction. This refers to the transportation of rice. Although free circulation has been repeatedly ordered to be followed, in reality, the difficulties, delays, and extortions are still unavoidable. Moreover, it is difficult to explain in law why goods in free circulation must apply for a purchase certificate in advance, undergo inspection and request permission locally, and be checked at every stage during the journey and request clearance. In fact, these problems indirectly increase the cost of rice purchases, so the local authorities should submit a request to the central government to find ways to effectively improve this in order to improve the supply.

(3) Replenish Reserves. With a smooth supply, reserves will naturally be abundant. However, the capital is too heavy, and it is difficult to keep them idle. Accumulating too much often leads to misunderstandings and unexpected troubles. Under the current situation, it is impossible for legitimate rice merchants to purchase and store more to replenish the people's food reserves. We believe that this task should be handled by the local government by raising funds on its own, at least to store enough rice for two or three months. This will provide a buffer against emergencies and be sufficient to bear the responsibility of regulation and contingency. As for this rice, if it is inconvenient to purchase more from domestic producing areas, other methods should be considered to purchase from Siam or Vietnam. Therefore, where to purchase from and how to raise the funds are all technical issues that can be handed over to the Food Distribution Committee for consideration.

In short, today's food issues are no longer a question of whether to plan, but have entered the question of how to plan. Fortunately, the local government has already established a special agency to effectively take on this responsibility, not just to be satisfied with price limits, negotiated prices, or selling stored rice. If the above suggestions can be adopted and implemented, I believe that the supply and demand of rice can be smoothly resolved, and we will no longer have to treat the symptoms rather than the cause, constantly living in emergency measures!

### Japanese Government Still Seeks Control Over Islands Surrounding Homeland, Especially Attentive to South Kuril Islands

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th Dispatch] Japan will strive at the peace conference to prevent the Soviet Union from annexing the South Kuril Islands, and will request the return of the seven islands north of Hokkaido that were occupied by the Soviet army after its surrender. The Japanese government submitted a memorandum to the Allied Headquarters in November of last year concerning the above issue, and attached historical proofs and documents to support its position. That is, the Kuril Islands south of the Iturup Strait have always been Japanese territory, and the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Islands, which are currently under Soviet occupation, are not part of the Kuril Islands granted to the Soviet Union under the Yalta Agreement, but are historically and geographically part of the four Japanese islands. Japan would be satisfied if the South Kuril Islands were placed under United Nations trusteeship or similar measures, allowing Japan to fish between and around those islands, but the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Islands must be returned to Japanese sovereignty. An official spokesperson for the Japanese government explained that Japanese fishermen catch 3 million yen worth of kelp annually between the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Islands, accounting for 40% of Japan's total output from all islands. The total output of kelp from Hokkaido accounts for 97% of the total output, and it occupies an important position in Japan, where there is almost no meat. Japanese officials emphasize that if the Soviet Union occupies the South Kuril Islands, it will harm Japanese fisheries in the northern territorial waters, because the Soviet side insists on implementing a 12-mile radius limit, meaning that Japanese fishing boats are not allowed to enter that area to fish, which in effect excludes Japanese fishermen from the South Kuril Islands. Japan also hopes that the peace conference will stipulate measures to allow Japanese fishing boats to navigate around the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands, and is currently considering recommending the return of Amami Oshima, located between Kyushu and the Ryukyus, to Japan. Although the area is not currently occupied, it is still outside Japanese territory because the Allied forces stipulate that Japanese territory is limited to north of 30 degrees north latitude. Amami Oshima has always been administratively part of Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu, not Okinawa Prefecture, and its people and customs are the same as those of the four Japanese islands. In this regard, the principle in the Atlantic Charter that no territorial changes should be made that are inconsistent with the freely expressed wishes of the people can be applied to the island. In this regard, Japanese officials clearly hope that this provision will also be applied to the Ryukyus, or even the South Kuril Islands, if the islands are placed under trusteeship; in other words, future Japan will have the opportunity to demand a plebiscite.

### Japanese Socialist Party Issues Formal Statement: Decides to Abandon Four-Party Coalition; Support for Yoshida's New Cabinet from Shidehara Makes Optimism Difficult

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The Socialist Party issued a statement at 5:00 PM on the 28th, stating, "The Socialist Party, bearing the responsibility of being the leading party, has strived to form a four-party coalition cabinet. However, the Liberal Party's statement today has greatly distorted the facts. Although Chairman Katayama promised President Yoshida that the left-wing would not join the cabinet, the Liberal Party still demanded a concrete assurance from the Socialist Party that it would not be influenced by the left wing. The Prime Minister yesterday even offered the Liberal Party a guarantee that the left wing would not join the cabinet. At the same time, in order to conduct democratic negotiations, the party prepared to compromise, but the Liberal Party did not change its attitude. Despite our party's utmost efforts, a four-party coalition cabinet remains impossible. Going forward, the Socialist Party will devote its full efforts to completing the formation of a three-party coalition cabinet."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The Democratic Party convened successive meetings of its top leadership in the morning and afternoon of the 28th. On the same day, it held a secret meeting of its members to discuss the Socialist Party's proposal for a three-party coalition cabinet. As a result of the discussions, opinions could not be unified. The opinions of Shidehara, Saito, Kimura, Tanaka, Itimatsu, and one other were at odds with those of Ashida, Hayashi, Nagano, Yano, and one other. The former advocated adopting the same attitude as the Liberal Party or reconsidering policies. The latter favored forming a coalition cabinet with the Socialist Party. The division between the conservative and reformist factions within the Democratic Party has now become very clear.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Mr. Rikizo Hirano of the Social Democratic Party visited the private residence of Secretary-General Ohno of the Liberal Party at 10:30 PM on the 27th to inquire about Secretary-General Ohno's opinions on the conditions for the coalition proposed by the Democratic Party. Ohno immediately stated that the Liberal Party had no room for considering those conditions.

### Rumor that U.S. State Department Will Take Over Japan and Korea

MacArthur Headquarters Says It May Be Misinformation

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Regarding the matter of the State Department taking over the administration of Korea and Japan, which are currently under U.S. military administration, sources here claim: The U.S. military occupation zone in South Korea will be transferred from the Department of the Army to the State Department around July. The timing of the takeover of Japan will depend on the situation in Korea. However, optimists believe it can be realized by autumn.

[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] It has been rumored in Washington that before a peace treaty is signed between the Allied nations and Japan, the administration of Japan will be transferred from the Department of the Army to the State Department. A spokesman for the Allied General Headquarters recently commented on this matter, stating that he had heard of it but doubted that any changes would occur before a peace treaty is signed, as any changes would require the agreement of all Allied nations. The Allied General Headquarters is unaware of any plans to change the organization of the Allied General Headquarters before a peace treaty is signed. The U.S. military occupation zones in Korea, Germany, and Austria differ somewhat from Japan. In the aforementioned U.S. military occupation zones, the U.S. administration is unilateral, while the Allied General Headquarters' administration of Japan is international. Therefore, this change would require action by the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission. Therefore, the rumor regarding the transfer of administration of Japan is likely misinformation.

### Wei Lihuang Visits France: Observes Air Force Base

[Agence France-Presse, Bordeaux, 27th] General Wei Lihuang, accompanied by General Piollet, Chief of Staff of the French Air Force, led a delegation today to inspect the French air base and air force school near here. They returned to Paris at 4:00 PM in the afternoon.

### The Bestial Nature of the Japanese Is Inherent; Vigilance Should Be Exercised to Prevent Relapse

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] After indicting Japanese war criminals for seventeen months, Mr. Carpenter, the legal director of MacArthur Headquarters, stated today that the bestial nature of the Japanese is inherent. Although it is temporarily suppressed at present, it will reemerge once unleashed. Americans today should not be deceived by the superficial courtesy of the Japanese. One can tell they have absolutely no manners by observing the way Japanese men treat women. I believe that punishing Japanese war criminals is the most valuable development because we can thereby uphold international law.

### Viet Minh Resolved to Fight to the End Due to Unacceptable French Conditions; Ho Chi Minh Calls on French People to Cooperate in Striving for Peace

[Reuters, Saigon, 27th] The Viet Minh radio station broadcast yesterday an appeal from President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh Republic to the French people, begging for their assistance in saving peace. He said that French colonialists have launched a war in the past twenty months, and countless numbers of French and Vietnamese people have been sacrificed. The Viet Minh government, in accordance with its peaceful intentions, proposed a ceasefire to the French government on April 25th and began peace negotiations. Unexpectedly, the French side put forward the following conditions: (1) surrender the weapons of the Viet Minh army; (2) the French army has freedom of movement throughout Viet Minh territory; (3) all soldiers opposed to the Viet Minh are under the command of the French military headquarters. It is evident that the French side, intoxicated by temporary success, has put forward unacceptable and insulting conditions, making it impossible for the peoples of the two countries to approach each other. The responsibility for continuing the war lies entirely with the French side. All we desire is peace and to obtain unity and independence within the French Union. Now, forced by French warmongering colonialists, we will fight to the end until victory is achieved. We hope the people of France will assist us in saving the lives of French youth and Vietnamese people.

[Reuters, Saigon, 27th] It is widely rumored here that the Kingdom of Annam is expected to be restored soon. Mr. Bollaert, the French Commissioner to Vietnam, visited Saint-Jacques in Cochinchina today, where he met former King Thanh Thai of Annam. According to a spokesman for the newly established All-Vietnam National Front, there will be even more surprising developments in the Viet Minh negotiations next week.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] Reliable sources here declared tonight: They have no knowledge of reports in Saigon newspapers that the Viet Minh government has sent a written peace proposal to France.

### Dutch Suggest Forming a Dutch-Indonesian Joint Government

[United Press, Batavia, 28th] Well-informed sources claimed today that the Dutch Colonial Ministry has suggested that a joint provisional government, immediately organized by both Dutch and Indonesian Republican personnel, serve as the initial step towards establishing a federal United States of Indonesia. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, has submitted a written statement to Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir containing several final Dutch proposals, the aforementioned being one of them. It is said that although the Dutch statement is not an ultimatum, if Indonesia refuses to accept it or if its response is unsatisfactory to the Dutch, the entire issue of negotiations with the Republic will be submitted to the Dutch government for resolution. Sjahrir plans to travel to Yogyakarta today or tomorrow to meet with Indonesian President Sukarno and the cabinet to draft a response.

### U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey: $100 Million Has Been Allocated

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder handed Secretary of State Marshall a check for $100 million tonight, representing a portion of the costs for the aid to Greece and Turkey case advanced by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, in order to immediately begin implementing the aid plan. The Aid to Greece and Turkey Act passed by Congress did not specify the source of the aid funds, but specifically instructed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to advance a portion of the costs immediately.

### Mountbatten Returns to India Today; Indian Constitutional Plan to Proceed in Three Stages; Returning Leaders to India Urge the People to Maintain Law and Order

[Reuters, London, 27th] Governor-General Mountbatten of India will depart London this Thursday in order to hold a meeting in New Delhi on June 2 with Indian leaders regarding the procedures for the transfer of power. He will hold a final pre-departure meeting tomorrow with cabinet experts on Indian affairs. Prime Minister Attlee has also hurried back to London from Margate, where the Labor Party annual conference is being held, to participate. Political figures believe that the New Delhi meeting starting on June 2 is part of the three stages of the Indian constitutional plan. The first stage is to determine whether India will be unified or divided. The second stage is to solicit the opinions of elected representatives from across India. The third stage is for the top Indian leaders to decide on the final method of partition based on the results of the previous stages. It is generally expected that these three stages can be completed in a few months. It is anticipated that the geographical boundaries of India can be clearly determined by this summer, and the mechanism for the transfer of power can be effectively utilized.

[Reuters, Calcutta, 27th] It is widely rumored here that an unprecedented large-scale disturbance will occur starting on June 2, causing widespread anxiety. The authorities have dispatched planes to scatter leaflets from the sky to reassure the people. The Governor of Bengal, Burrows, personally delivered a radio address to reassure the people. At the same time, returning leaders to India jointly issued a call for peace. The declaration was signed by nine leaders from the Muslim League and the Congress Party, including Gandhi and Jinnah. It stated that there have been recent rumors that a major riot will occur on June 2, the day the Governor-General informs Indian leaders of the British government's plan to transfer power to India, causing widespread anxiety. The British government's plan may not be acceptable to all parties, and some individuals or factions may not be satisfied. However, under no circumstances should violence be used to maintain law and order.

### India to Be Divided into Three Zones to Become a Dominion

[United Press, London, 27th] Reliable sources recently declared that Governor-General Mountbatten of India will propose a "three-tier constitution" after returning to his post, making India a dominion to be governed by Mountbatten in his capacity as Governor-General. The Muslim League is still expressing its opposition, but it is generally expected that the Governor-General will proceed with his plans based on the plan agreed upon with the British cabinet. It is said that the British cabinet's proposal includes the following three items: (1) Hindu-majority provinces will be designated as one zone; (2) the provinces of Punjab, Northwest Frontier Province, Sindh, and Baluchistan will be designated as one zone; (3) the provinces of Bengal and Assam will be designated as one zone. With the exception of defense, foreign affairs, and transportation, which will be managed by the central supreme authority, all other political affairs in the aforementioned three zones will be self-governed by each zone. It is widely believed that Governor-General Mountbatten, now with the full support of the British cabinet, will change his plans and implement the aforementioned proposals. This action is likely to dissolve the existing provisional government and restore it to the status of a dominion.

### Koreans in China Oppose Trusteeship

Unanimously Support Syngman Rhee and Kim Koo

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Koreans in China recently issued an urgent declaration to call for the cancellation of trusteeship: "We unanimously support the advocacy of clarifying the nature and authority of trusteeship by the 49 organizations and over 7 million people in the country under the leadership of Syngman Rhee and Mr. Kim Koo, and we propose the following items for reference by the U.S. and Soviet authorities: (1) Cancel trusteeship; (2) Remove all current armaments in North and South Korea. After the establishment of a provisional government, a new army will be rebuilt by the provisional government with the assistance of the four powers, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union; (3) The selection of personnel to organize the provisional government shall be conducted through free popular vote under the joint supervision of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and shall not be conducted through group nominations; (4) The four powers jointly assist in establishing a democratic Korea. Jointly proclaimed by the Chinese General Branch of the Korean Independence Party, the Korean delegation in China, and the overseas residents' associations in Nanjing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Kanto, Xuzhou, Guangzhou, Taiwan, and Hainan Island."

### Soviet Union Wants to Make Korea Its Vassal State

Hodges Holds This View

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] General Hodge, Commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, told the House Appropriations Committee that he believes the Soviet Union wants to make the entire Korean peninsula a communist vassal state. The Soviet Union is making Koreans feel that U.S. efforts are insincere and that the U.S. intends only to make Korea its colony and continue to exploit its interests.

### Prime Minister Ramadier's Appeal Effective: French Coal, Electricity, and Gas Strike Cancelled

[United Press, Paris, 27th] Prime Minister Ramadier delivered a radio address today, appealing to members of the French gas and electricity workers' union to cancel the planned all-day strike scheduled for tomorrow for the sake of the public welfare. It is said that, "I speak to you with complete friendship, hoping that you will not strike. Nationalizing the electricity industry is very important. Your work is not to increase the profits of capitalists but to directly serve the country."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The order for a general strike of gas and electricity workers in the Paris region has been cancelled. The French Minister of Labor, Miot, held a meeting with representatives of the gas and electricity workers' union today, and an agreement was finally reached stipulating the establishment of a special committee responsible for reviewing workers' demands within the scope of government policy before June 18. According to a United Press report, the government's mobilization order, based on which the power plants were taken over by the government and the workers were conscripted into the army, has also been cancelled.

### Holy Land Investigation Team to Depart in Early June

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 27th] The United Nations Palestine Investigation Committee is scheduled to depart from here on June 6 and 10 on two special planes to Palestine. Each plane will carry 36 people, flying directly from New York to Lydda Airport in Palestine. To maintain the neutrality of the Secretariat staff participating in the work of the investigation team, UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie has decided not to send Jewish or Arab personnel to participate in the work of the secretariat group. Therefore, two Secretariat staff members, Mr. Salah, a former official of the Egyptian Embassy in France, and Captain Epstein of the former Royal Canadian Army, will not be participating in the work of the investigation team.

### Carlson Dies

The U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, Tuck, will depart for Washington in the coming days, presumably to discuss relations between the U.S. and Egypt with the government.

### U.S. Authorities Execute Large Number of German War Criminals

[United Press, Rendsburg, Germany, 28th] Forty-eight guards and administrators of the Mauthausen Nazi concentration camp were sentenced to death by hanging for war crimes. The U.S. Army executioner executed twenty-two of them yesterday, and the remaining twenty-six were executed today. The scale of this execution is the largest in the history of Allied execution of war criminals.

The coup conspiracy was scheduled to be implemented last night, involving setting fire to the customs building to distract the local police. The conspirators planned to seize the arsenal while other troops seized the barracks. Upon hearing the news today, President Guillén urgently returned to the capital from his summer retreat. Although the conspiracy has been prevented from developing, news from the mining area indicates that incitement is still ongoing. Toba Garcia served as Minister of the Interior under President Villarroel, who was killed last June. Guillén succeeded him.

### Morrison Calls for Increased Production: Labor Party Congress Passes Motion to Establish Propaganda Fund

[Agence France-Presse, Margate, 28th] British Cabinet Minister Morrison this morning called on workers and employers at the Labor Party Congress to increase industrial output. It is said that the war of socialism is a war of production, and any strike today is a conspiracy to sabotage. Morrison finally expressed the hope that a trade agreement with the Soviet Union could be concluded in the short term, pointing out that the economic problems of Britain and the Soviet Union are similar.

[Reuters, Margate, 28th] The Labor Party conference, in a closed-door session today, resolved to establish a special propaganda organization fund with a target of at least £166,000 in order to launch a powerful propaganda campaign during the most critical period in the history of the Labor Party movement. The expenses will be raised by collecting special surcharges and ordinary membership fees from local Labor parties and trade unions. The Labor Party Executive Committee explained that income must be increased to meet the increased expenditure of the propaganda department.

### Municipal Council Forms Special Committee: To Assist the Government in Guiding the Student Movement; Directors of Four Bureaus Attend to Answer Inquiries

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its second meeting of the Third Session of the First Congress yesterday from 3:00 PM to 7:30 PM at its location on Tanggu Road. 107 councilors attended. More than thirty representatives from the municipal government and various bureaus and offices were present. After the secretariat reported the number of attendees, the councilors began to question the Education Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Health Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau separately. After the questioning was completed, the bureau directors answered respectively.

Furthermore, the Municipal Council passed yesterday the proposal made by Councilor Tao Baichuan the day before to organize a special committee to guide the student movement. The committee members were nominated by the speaker and approved by the council. It consists of seventeen councilors: Xu Jiqing, Wang Zhengting, Tao Baichuan, Ye Fenghu, Zhao Junhao, Xi Yushu, Pang Jingzhou, Zhao Yangxiong, Zai Zhuyi, Zhan Wenhu, Wang Weiyin, Rong Hongyuan, Huang Shijin, Li Kaidi, Li Wenjie, Ma Junshuo, and Yan Yilin. Xu Jiqing, Wang Zhengting, and Tao Baichuan will convene a meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon in the office of the speaker of the Municipal Council.

In addition, the three tasks of the committee were determined: (1) Investigate the truth of the student movement; (2) Draft a message to the parents of students and school principals, hoping that the student movement will be resolved soon; (3) If necessary, the committee can assist the government authorities and school authorities in guiding the student movement to a speedy resolution.

Regarding the Greater Shanghai Plan, the council also passed a resolution to organize a review committee. Twenty-nine councilors were nominated to form the committee: Xu Jiqing, Zhang Zhihan, Zhu Wende, Wang Zhuyi, Yang Shukang, Xi Yushu, Lu Yinchu, Tang Shichang, Zhang Xuelian, Xu Yongzuo, Li Kaidi, Xu Xueyu, Huang Bingquan, Zhou Feicheng, Wang Weiyin, Zhao Junhao, Wang Yansong, Jin Runxiang, Zhao Yangxiong, Zhu Kaiguan, Tong Xingbai, Wei Yunqing, Zhai Shi, Zhou Xiangsheng, Rong Hongsan, Jiang Hao, Zhou Xuexiang, Fan Shouyuan, and Pang Jingzhou. Xu Jiqing, Xu Xueyu, and Xi Wangshu will serve as conveners. A review meeting is scheduled to be held at the Municipal Council at 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon.

### Only Empty Names of Schools: No School Addresses Can Be Found; Councilors Question the Education Bureau

[Our Newspaper] The inquiries made by the councilors to the Public Works, Public Utilities, Health, and Education Bureaus yesterday are recorded separately below.

Education: Councilors paid special attention to the student movement issue. Jiang Huaisu said that the student movement should be prevented before it happens. After things have occurred, those that can be stopped should be stopped, and those that cannot be stopped should also have a method. Force should never be used. It is alright to protect the march and avoid conflicts with the military police or citizens. Meetings should not be prevented either. In this way, the student movement will subside on its own. He also described his previous experiences with student movements and how he handled them in Jiangxi. Wang Weiyin said: (1) The biggest reason for the student movement is dissatisfaction with the current politics. Sympathy and understanding should be given. The authorities should not excessively destroy it in order to consolidate the nation. I ask the Director of the Education Bureau how he views the student movement! (2) The council resolved at the first congress to establish women's normal schools, commercial schools, vocational schools, and agricultural schools within one year, and to establish several junior high schools in the suburbs. But a year has passed. How much has the Education Bureau done in this regard? Wang Liben said: (1) The supervisory work of the Education Bureau itself must be corrected and strictly attended to. (2) Why are the salaries of newly hired colleagues in each school often two months late compared to the original colleagues? Zhu Ya Kui asked: Do the private schools comply with the Education Bureau's order and have they fully refunded the fees to those who exceed the prescribed purchase standard?

Are There Plans for National Primary Schools?

Zhang Yiqu asked: (1) What is the distribution of municipal national primary schools? Is there a unified plan? (2) The Old Zha District is the commercial center of Shanghai and pays the most taxes, but no national primary school is established. Can the authorities be requested to set up one quickly? Zhang Zhongyuan said that he represents the cultural and artistic community and requests that the municipal government establish an art gallery in the city center for colleagues to use for leisure. Pan Jiemei said: Does the Education Bureau pay attention to the enrollment situation of vocational and general education at all times? Sometimes a class is set up in three or four schools, which is purely a waste of money. Zhang Xuelian said: It is often heard that there are schools in the city with only empty names. The statistical table lists the number of students and teachers, but the school address cannot be found at that address. What is going on! Sun Zhenchun hopes that many of the municipal councilors who are school principals should lead by example and pay attention to supervision.

Striking Middle Schools Have All Resumed Classes

Vice Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau, representing Director Gu Yuxiu, who went to Beijing on official business, selectively answered the education questions as follows: (1) Regarding the student movement, because it started in the universities, the Education Bureau has no reason to interfere. Later, because it involved primary schools, the bureau immediately convened all middle school principals in the city to discuss the handling methods. It was stipulated that if university students come to the school to promote strikes, two methods should be adopted to deal with it: (1) refuse them peacefully, (2) if it is ineffective, report to the nearby police station. This time, Mailun and Jiaotong Middle Schools had strikes for several days, and now they have resumed classes. Currently, it can be said that there are no middle schools on strike. At the same time, someone used the phone to impersonate the Education Bureau to order middle school students to strike. After hearing the news, the bureau immediately published a statement stating that there was no such thing.

Have Not Heard of Private Schools Collecting Rice

(2) Regarding the issue of fees for private schools, in the last semester, there were 20 schools, including Lingnan, Jinke, and the affiliated middle school of Shanghai University, that exceeded the prescribed fees, and 21 primary schools. All of them have been ordered to refund the fees. Unless it is transferred to purchase books and instruments, it will be exempted from investigation after verification, and the rest will be dealt with separately. Regarding the councilor's statement that it is rumored that private middle schools will collect rice in lieu of fees next semester, with 5 shi for universities, 3 shi for middle schools, and 1 shi for primary schools, the bureau has not heard of it. (3) Academic advancement fees will be refunded, with 30,000 yuan per person for middle schools and 20,000 yuan per person for primary schools. Other inquiries will be answered in writing.

### Installing a Telephone Requires Gold Bars; Evidence Can Be Submitted; Single-Person Tricycles Easily Tip Over; Attention Should Be Paid

Regarding public utilities, the following inquiries were made: Chen Peide asked: (1) After rickshaws are converted into single-person tricycles, they often overturn. The Public Utilities Bureau should pay attention to safety issues. (2) I applied to the authorities for a suburban telephone some time ago, and they said it would be installed soon, but why hasn't it been installed yet? Ma Junshuo asked: Citizens install telephones for convenience and speed. Why does the telephone company secretly stop the current of automatic telephones? Also, when making calls in the western district, operators often deliberately make things difficult. Can the Public Utilities Bureau strictly supervise this? Zhao Yangxiong also requested more suburban telephones and, on behalf of the residents of the southern city, opposed the conversion of the outer roads into warehouse areas. Chen Boliang said: (1) Installing a telephone requires gold bars. I know for a fact that installing a telephone costs 10 million, and an extension costs 2 million. If the director of the Public Utilities Bureau wants evidence, it can be provided, but can the bureau strictly stop this? (2) There are tricycle companies, but no tricycles. Please investigate this strictly. Lu Shidao inquired: There are currently several vehicles in this city that have already paid taxes and been issued licenses. However, because regulations prohibit transfer, disputes have arisen repeatedly. Why not completely resolve the vehicle license issue and allow free transfer? Zhu Wende asked: Will public utility deposits continue to be collected in the future?

Accident Tricycles All Fail to Meet Standards

There were several other inquiries regarding public utilities. Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau categorized and responded separately: (1) The Public Utilities Bureau pays close attention to single-person tricycles. The regulated standards for converting rickshaws are: 25 inches high, 30 inches wide, and 66 inches long. However, according to police reports, the tricycles involved in accidents did not meet the standards, so they should be banned. (2) Suburban telephones are difficult to install in large numbers at the moment because the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications lacks materials. (3) The Public Utilities Bureau has studied a unified plan for training telephone technicians and telephone management, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan. However, the Yuan ordered to maintain the status quo for the time being, so it has not been implemented. The municipal government plans to ask the Executive Yuan to approve it again soon. The number of calls in the central district is increasing daily, and the company can only increase equipment and external lines. Foreign exchange is currently being applied for.

Water Shortage in the Western District of Shanghai; Adding Water Faucets

(4) Street lights in alleys that belong to the public are installed by the Public Utilities Bureau. Those that belong to private individuals can be installed according to the method of managing street lights for private individuals. (5) There is a water shortage in the western district of Shanghai. Engineers have been dispatched to investigate the addition of water taps and the repair of leaking pipes. Only public water taps can be installed in shantytowns. (6) There are currently no plans for the Nanshi Outer Road warehouse area. (7) Public utility deposits are collected according to central regulations. (8) Regarding the issue of car transfers, some cars in the city are quite suspicious. To prevent enemy property from being occupied, there are restrictions on transfers. If evidence of property rights can be provided, the transfer can be approved. This matter has now been discussed and agreed upon with the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office, and the Central Trust Bureau is planning unified processing.

Telephone Demands Gold Bars; Difficulty in Obtaining Evidence

(9) Although I have heard about the need for gold bars to install telephones, I have no evidence. I hope everyone can provide evidence, and we will definitely deal with it strictly. (10) Regarding the issue of tricycle companies having no tricycles, it has now been decided that tricycle license applications will not be handled by the companies; they must be registered individually. (11) The lights and tap water in Nanshi are often cut off due to excessive electricity and damaged switches. Improvements are also being made.

### Health Inquiries

Health-related inquiries: Zhu Yakui said: Public toilets reek and are filthy. Please thoroughly clean them up, Health Bureau. The garbage problem remains unresolved. As the weather gets warmer, please pay special attention. Zhang Zhongyuan asked: (1) On May 11, the newspaper reported that doctors and nurses from the Shanghai Health Office would resign en masse. Why is that? (2) The city's major health services are handled by other agencies. The Health Bureau's work seems very light, so can staff be reduced and expenses saved? Shi Qian asked to relocate the coffin placement station on Anyuan Road. Lu Keming said: Hospital management and supervision are quite inadequate. He went to see a doctor at a hospital on Haig Road and smelled a bad odor as soon as he entered.

Director Zhang of the Health Bureau responded: (1) It is best to completely abolish public toilets and sell grass paper while people bring their own paper. Public toilets should be the responsibility of contractors, who should paint and repair them every three months. The bureau sends people to investigate from time to time and will strengthen management in the future. (2) The coffin placement station on Anyuan Road will definitely be relocated before the end of October. (3) The news of the mass resignation of doctors and nurses at the Health Office is actually a misrepresentation. In fact, more than a dozen employees of the Yangshupu office overpaid their salaries, and they had to be deducted when salaries were paid. They then requested resignation, but after being allowed to deduct less, they continued to work. (4) Epidemic prevention and health work cannot be done without the vast power of society. The bureau currently has a great deal of work and personnel to deal with, and there is no free time, but it will supervise personnel handling affairs at any time. (5) The leaking of manure trucks is due to a lack of funding, and it is impossible to repair them all at once. The municipal government has now allocated some funds and should be able to complete the repairs before summer.

### Dissatisfaction with Road Administration; Suspected of Cutting Corners; Director Zhao Explains Difficulties; Asphalt is Four Times More Expensive Than Tar

Public Works: Shi Zongde claimed that there was a great deal of road damage, and the Public Works Bureau's road repairs seemed to be "cutting corners." Chen Peide claimed: Several highways in Pudong and the Pudong area have not been repaired to this day, and there has been no news of the Pudong Bridge since the resolution was passed by the Assembly. Shao Yongsheng believes that the road administration is too bad and hopes that the Public Works Bureau will use every cent of the citizens' hard-earned money. Zhao Yangxiong said: Park tickets cost 20 yuan; it is better to open them for free. Pan Jiemei also said that there is no planning for road repairs, etc., and the work is slow. Hou Junren requested to dredge the Xinjinggang River and ban the houses that obstruct traffic in the Houjiazhai area of Fahua Town. Chen Boliang said: The Public Works Bureau does not allow people to voluntarily repair roads and bridges. It is rumored that citizens contract for cheaper work, while the bureau's contract work is more expensive.

### Director of the Public Works Bureau Responds Point by Point

Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau responded: (1) The city's roads have not been repaired for many years, and there is too much damage. Moreover, the number of vehicles has increased, causing even more damage. The bureau's manpower, equipment, and materials are limited and can only be handled step by step according to the urgency of the situation. Currently, it can only repair those that are about to break down and cannot repair those that have already broken down. Road repairs are planned, starting with the central area, then the suburbs, and then the roads with trams and buses. (2) Road repair work is also carried out at night, but the reason why it is not carried out at night at the moment is that there are few workers and a lack of equipment and funds. At the same time, road repairs must be carried out at high temperatures, and will begin again when the weather gets hot. (3) Cutting corners is not the case; it is saving materials. Because foreign asphalt is about four times more expensive than tar, more tar must be used. (4) Dredging the river and repairing Pudong Avenue, the design work has long been completed. They can only be repaired gradually due to limited funds.

### American Wishes to Invest in the Pudong Bridge

Regarding the construction of the Pudong Bridge, Mr. Kangwei said that Americans may invest in the construction of an overpass. If successful, or if the US loan of 500 million US dollars is allocated to Shanghai, it can be started. (5) Regarding park charges, it has been stipulated that the tickets for five parks, including Zhongshan, Zhongzheng, Huangpu, Linsen, and Fuxing, will be changed from 20 yuan to 200 yuan each, and the other nine parks will be opened for free. Because some parks are connected to schools, there is too much damage after opening. (6) The Xinjinggang River dredging was also not included in the budget due to funding reasons. Now that it has been raised, it can be included in next year's budget. The houses in Houjiazhai, Fahua, are dormitories for employees of the Central Mint. Personnel can be dispatched to investigate. If it is indeed occupying a public transportation area, they can be ordered to be demolished. (7) Private construction of roads and bridges is not prohibited, and the Public Works Bureau can provide assistance. It is also not true that the Public Works Bureau's contract work is more expensive than private contract work. If it is found out, it will definitely be revoked.

### Unclaimed Coffins in the Suburbs Will Be Cremated Starting in August

[Reported by this newspaper] The Health Bureau submitted to the Municipal Government for approval to clear unclaimed coffins in the suburbs by district and sub-district. Starting in June and July, the Xuan Shi area in the suburbs of North China's Xinjing has been dispatched for numbering. All unclaimed coffins must be buried by the end of July of this year.

### Robbery and Murder on Xinzha Road; Cloth Vendor and Ticket Seller Killed

[Reported by this newspaper] Li Xiangchen, a native of Anhui in his late 50s, lived at No. 66, Lane 1536, Xinzha Road. He traveled between Shanghai and Zhenjiang as a cloth vendor. At about 10 p.m. last night, as Li was preparing to undress and go to bed, several robbers suddenly arrived. Two robbers broke into Li's residence, and the remaining robbers stood guard on the side of the road. Two packages of cloth and 4 million yuan in legal tender were robbed. Li Xiangchen firmly refused to let go, angering the robbers. One robber fired a shot, which hit his lower left back. As a result, the robbers escaped with the stolen goods. Li chased after the pain, and after walking a few steps, he arrived at the mouth of the alley and shouted loudly. Wang Zhihong, a neighbor from No. 23 Pi Zi (ticket seller for the British Electric Tram Company, No. 1230), heard the sound and thought there was a fire, and rushed out the door. When he arrived at the mouth of the alley, he was also shot by the robbers, hitting his heart, piercing his back, and falling to the ground and dying. At this time, Li Xiangchen turned around and fled back to his residence, fell to the ground in extreme pain, and was barely breathing. Later, neighbors heard the alarm and rushed over and called an ambulance to take him to the hospital for treatment, but it was too late, and he also died.

### Labor-Management Evaluation Committee Formulates Detailed Rules for Implementing Wage Adjustments After Unfreezing the Cost of Living Index

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Labor-Management Evaluation Committee held its tenth meeting in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, presided over by Chairman Wu Kaixian. The meeting discussed the calculation methods for piecework, overtime, work stoppages, and vacations for workers in various industries after the cost of living index was unfrozen. The detailed rules for implementing the "Provisional Measures for Wage Adjustment in Shanghai" are as follows:

Piecework: For piecework wages calculated according to the cost of living index, the actual monthly base salary should be calculated and paid in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the "Provisional Measures for Wage Adjustment in Shanghai." However, to encourage production, the highest production volume of each department in the six months before the index was unfrozen can be used as a standard. Wages for the part exceeding the standard should be paid in full to show encouragement.

Overtime: The base salary for overtime wages will not be discounted, but if there is a bonus wage in addition to the overtime wage in the grain industry, the bonus wage part will still be added to the total base salary and discounted.

Work Stoppages: Whether or not wages are paid for work stoppages or leave, the calculation is based on the actual base salary earned by the worker during the period of work stoppage or leave.

Vacations: Wages for national holidays, weekly holidays, and other designated holidays shall be paid in accordance with regulations. If the employer wants the worker to work as usual, the overtime wage for that day should be paid in full without any discount.

### Letter of Correction

To the esteemed editor: The news of the May 26 bloodshed at our school published in your newspaper on the 27th does not conform to the facts. Please correct it as follows: "Our association held an evening party on the evening of the 26th to welcome the return of students who were arrested for no reason. On their way back to the dormitory, the students were threatened with gunfire by dozens of thugs, followed by beatings with iron rulers and wooden sticks. At the same time, the street lights were turned off. This is obviously a planned conspiracy. Three students were seriously injured and are now in the hospital in critical condition. More than 20 students were slightly injured. Therefore, this bloodshed incident was purely an act of violence by thugs and was definitely not a dispute over 'striking' or 'returning to class.'" Sincerely, Student Union of National Fudan University, May 28.

### Free Tuberculosis X-Ray Photography at the Lufei Anti-Tuberculosis Clinic; The Anti-Tuberculosis Clinic Sets Up Free and Reduced-Fee Methods; Patients Must First Apply to This Column Before Verification

### After Asking the Mayor for Instructions, the Ministry of Food Returned to Shanghai and Agreed to Increase the Allocation of Rice; The Issue of Increasing Subsidies for Public Utilities is Awaiting a Decision by the National Price Conference

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu was summoned to the capital by the central government and took the night express train the night before yesterday.

After close consultations with relevant authorities, he took a car back to Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. that afternoon and arrived at the North Station with Zhang Peter, the head of the Public Relations Section of the Municipal Government, at 11:00 p.m. last night.

After getting off the train, the mayor told reporters that the mission to Beijing was still prices. Because the chairman was very concerned about the city's prices and always cared about the people's food. The solution is still to thoroughly implement the current direct rice allocation system of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in order to stabilize rice prices. According to Mayor Wu, the main purpose of his trip was to ask the central government to increase the allocation of food rice in order to curb the rise in rice prices in the city. The Ministry of Food has now agreed to gradually increase the amount of rice allocated to the city, with a target of 300,000 dan per month. Therefore, he believes that rice prices can be stabilized. Regarding the issue of increasing subsidies for public utilities, the mayor said: Preliminary discussions have been held, but it still needs to be submitted to the National Price Conference to be held in Beijing this weekend for a final and specific decision.

Gu Yuxiu, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, went to Beijing at the same time as Mayor Wu the night before yesterday and did not return last night. When reporters asked Mayor Wu about the resignation of Director Gu, Mayor Wu said that all parties are making every effort to retain him.

### Responding to the Call for Peaceful Nation Building: Religious Followers Establish Grand Alliance

The "China Religious Followers' Peaceful Nation Building Grand Alliance," aiming to unite followers of all different types of religions to realize peace and dedicate themselves to national construction, was declared established here yesterday. The initiators were Jiang Weiqiao, Li Yujie, Da Pusheng, Xu Langxi, Ding Fubao, Tecang, Tianhui, Tang Huaiqun, Fan Songfu, Zhang Enpu, Cheng Jingsheng, Wang Xiaolai, and over seventy others. They issued a declaration and sent a telegram to the Political Consultative Conference calling for peace. The declaration is as follows:

Declaration

We have no strong political interests, nor do we intend, at any time or in any environment, to engage in power struggles for personal gain. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, we were deeply enlightened by objective reality and profoundly understood that the powerful manifestation of the altruistic spirit of religious figures cannot be completely outside of politics. Therefore, we began to prepare for the formation of an alliance to unite religious forces and promote open-minded politics. In recent years, the domestic and international situation has gradually become dangerous, and the incredibly brutal civil war will destroy the people, destroy the country, and even expand and spread to destroy the world. If people from all religious systems are not gathered to jointly call for peace and change this dangerous political tendency, not only will the distant prospect of human prosperity and happiness become a mirage, but also the salvation goals of all religions will never be reached. Therefore, our reasons for organizing the alliance are extremely simple: one is to quickly and effectively strive for peace, and the other is to work together wholeheartedly to assist in national construction. From the former perspective, we must consider the people and soldiers on the line of death, we must consider the vast masses on the line of starvation, and we must consider the entire humanity and the future of the world. We will not hesitate to take any action or make any appeals to immediately stop the war. Even if there is sacrifice for this, we will not hesitate. Currently, with anxious and earnest emotions, we hope that all intermediate parties, social elites, and members of the Political Consultative Conference will overcome all difficulties and continue to strive for peace, without being swayed by the intentions of the warring parties.

We are willing to do our utmost

to support this action. No matter how difficult, how dangerous, or how despised and slandered the task is that is conducive to peace, we are all happy to share it. Even if the facts require us to appeal to the Communist army areas, we are willing to brave bullets and endure hardships to give it a try. Even if those in charge of peace do not want to travel far lightly, we can do it alone. Even if there are any obstacles, we will never be afraid. From the latter perspective, the country has been suffering from a long and bitter war, and the people's livelihood has been extremely depleted. In the future, to engage in construction, we must unite the nation's human and material resources on the basis of peace and democracy to struggle together. We believe that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's complete teachings can still lead national construction, and some of the policies in the Communist army areas are also progressive and can be used as a reference for the government. If the outstanding members of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can cooperate sincerely and not let their forces cancel each other out, they can both serve as the backbone of national construction. Other intermediate parties also have talent and experience. If they are not used for unnecessary disputes, they can all achieve excellent results.

We believe that the issue of national construction

is not limited to governance alone, and political problems are not limited to officials alone. If we can obtain correct leadership, everyone can share the responsibility of future construction, and everyone will have the opportunity to develop their talents and aspirations. We, as religious followers, organize the alliance for no other purpose. We are all religious followers, but our religious beliefs are not completely consistent. Therefore, the conditions for the formation of this alliance are political rather than religious. Moreover, we must maintain the solemnity and sanctity of freedom of belief and never force agreement or disagreement. Therefore, the members of this alliance participate in their individual capacity and do not represent groups. However, if it is mistakenly believed that this alliance emphasizes politics and neglects religion, then it is not so. Indeed, we have a common understanding that all religions have an altruistic spirit, which is absolutely consistent among various differences. Based on this, we began to generate the motivation to care about politics, began to put forward the demand for peaceful nation building, and began to determine the "foundation" of our understanding of political, economic, domestic, and international issues. Based on this, we began to insist that capitalism and socialism, the United States and the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should coexist peacefully and replace struggle with competition, rather than encouraging war and expanding the killing. Based on this, we began to not flaunt our purity and isolate ourselves from reality, but instead, with the spirit of religious martyrdom, serve the people, completely disregarding any possible slander and misunderstanding. Thus, we began to emphasize the interests of the people and the country, rather than prioritizing the future of this alliance. We can admit that this alliance is a political party, but we will never emphasize party spirit. We can participate in elections under the premise of democracy, but we will never ignore the talents outside the alliance. We can appeal and run around for the benefit of the people, but we will never be preoccupied with the private interests of this alliance. This is the consistent spirit of this alliance, and this is also where this alliance differs from ordinary political parties. Currently, this alliance's

initial organization has just been completed.

All preparations still await efforts. We never want to boast about history and strength, and even more, we do not want to boast to the people about having a certain number of followers. At present, our only attempt is to respond to the peace movement of various progressive groups and to accept the support from all parties. We hereby extend our friendly and cooperative hand with the utmost sincerity to domestic political parties and all progressive forces to work together and jointly plan for national affairs. This is our declaration.

### Telegram to the Political Consultative Conference

To Secretary-General Shao of the Nanjing Political Consultative Conference and forwarded to the Presidium and all Councilors for your review: "The day of the formation of this alliance coincides with the time when you gentlemen are meeting, and the peace proposal of your council is also the basic proposition of this alliance. We hereby support this effort with the utmost sincerity. If the Communist Party of China is temporarily unwilling to come to Nanjing due to transportation difficulties or other reasons, this alliance will, in the spirit of religion and the common wishes of the Chinese people, go to the Communist army areas to appeal for saving the crisis. We urge your council to persist to the end in order to achieve permanent peace. The China Religious Followers' Peaceful Nation Building Grand Alliance respectfully bows."

### Dispatching Representatives to Nanjing to Negotiate

[Our Newspaper] After the establishment of the Religious Followers' Peaceful Nation Building Grand Alliance, in addition to issuing a declaration and sending a telegram to the Political Consultative Conference, it also dispatched representatives to Nanjing last night to negotiate matters related to appealing for peace in the CCP area. According to one of the initiators who told reporters, there are many religious groups that have become political parties in Europe, but in our country, a single religious group is currently insufficient in strength and must unite Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam.

### Zhao Zukang and Others Advise Jiaotong University Students Not to Participate in the June 2nd Parade; Maintain Jiaotong University's School Spirit of Practicality and Truth-Seeking

[Our Newspaper] The Jiaotong University Alumni Association, including Zhao Zukang, Wang Jishan, Zhao Zengyu, Yuan Pilie, Hua Weizhong, and other alumni, recently issued a "Letter to Jiaotong University Students," the original text of which is as follows: "Students, please note: Our Jiaotong University students previously launched a school protection movement due to the Ministry of Education's proposal to stop enrolling students in the naval and marine engineering departments, which eventually led to strikes and petitions. The Alumni Association also sympathized with this and telegraphed Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education to avoid changes. Later, Minister Zhu came to Shanghai and agreed to establish the Marine Engineering Department and the Navigation Management Department, and other petition matters were also agreed to be handled accordingly. The purpose of our students' school protection petition has been gloriously achieved. Unexpectedly, after ten days, in response to other schools, classes have not been resumed, and there is also an intention to participate in the joint parade on June 2nd. The members of this association are deeply concerned. Our Jiaotong University students have always valued practicality and truth-seeking, which has become a trend and is the basis for their ability to become national construction cadres. Now, after the goal of school protection has been achieved, they are confused by external fluctuations and do not hesitate to abandon precious time and waste precious studies to engage in external movements. Is this not contrary to Jiaotong University's school spirit of practicality and truth-seeking? If other dangers occur as a result, and the more than fifty years of history of the alma mater are on the verge of destruction, would this not be painful for those who love it and gladdening for those who hate it? For the sake of protecting the school, for the sake of the glorious future of the alma mater, and for the sake of the nation's vitality, the members of this association dare to list the following three points in all sincerity: (1) Resume classes immediately and restore the normal state of the school; (2) Absolutely do not participate in the parade on June 2nd; (3) The members of this association will do their best to protect all students together with the school authorities. We hope that our dear students will understand the difficulties of the times, maintain the school's reputation, resume classes immediately, and no longer increase the severity of the current turbulent social environment. We hope that you will all consider it."

### Regulating Food Distribution and Promoting Circulation: Four Banks Jointly Provide Grain Loans; Principles for Grain Mortgage Financing Established; Registered and Approved Grain Merchants Can Apply

In order to regulate the food supply, the Four Banks have recently established principles for grain mortgage financing. Legally operating grain merchants who purchase and store grain can apply for loans from national banks. Those with more than 200 shi (a unit of dry volume) are required to report to the Ministry of Food for approval. The loan principles are as follows:

(1) In order to cooperate with the supply measures for daily necessities for people's livelihoods and promote the circulation of grain, grain merchants in various regions may apply to national banks for grain mortgage financing.

(2) Grain merchants in various regions, based on permits issued by the local grain administration authorities and approved by the Ministry of Food, may apply to national banks for grain mortgages for the purchase and storage of grain. The maximum term shall not exceed two months.

(3) The funds obtained by grain merchants from mortgage loans from banks shall be used for the continued purchase of grain and shall not exceed two months.

(4) If there is a shortage of grain in the local area, or if grain prices fluctuate drastically, the local grain administration authorities may submit a request to the Ministry of Food to order grain merchants to redeem and sell the mortgaged grain on the market within a limited time. Otherwise, the Ministry of Food will order the local grain administration authorities to purchase and sell the grain at the original price plus legal profits.

(5) Grain merchants in various regions shall apply to national banks for mortgage loans in accordance with Article 2 of these measures, and the local grain administration authorities shall be responsible for providing guarantees.

### Abundant Rice Supply: Market Prices Continue to Decline; High-Quality Thin Japonica Rice Nears the 400,000 Mark

[Our Report] Due to the increasing rice supply and the continuous flow of goods from various regions, the market continued to decline, carrying on the weakness of the previous day. Yesterday, the market registered a total of 6,743 shi of goods arriving. After the opening, due to the sluggish market atmosphere, all parties were watchful and hesitant to buy, resulting in sluggish transactions and a downward trend. High-quality thin japonica rice has fallen close to the 400,000 mark. The decline in other indica rice and Jiangbei pointed rice is even more severe. White japonica rice was priced at 405,000 yuan in the southern market and 410,000 yuan in the northern market. It is reported that Wuhu rice has stopped shipping north and is all going south. Telegrams from Beijing also report that a large number of indica rice, two to three hundred ships' worth, have arrived, so the situation may continue to decline.

The flour distribution has not yet been completed, and digestion has become active, resulting in a sudden increase and a rebound of 10,000 yuan. Bran is scarce in both supply and demand, and the market is generally weak. Soybean cakes have fallen by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, following the decline of various other commodities. Due to the decline in both soybeans and oil cakes, factories are hesitant to buy, resulting in a sharp drop of 10,000 yuan. The oil market is experiencing sluggish sales, with a decline of 10,000 yuan. Mung beans are declining steadily, with a further small decline of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Corn is experiencing idle demand, with a further decline of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum is following the decline with a drop of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are experiencing a surge in supply and sluggish sales, resulting in a sharp drop of more than 20,000 yuan.

Sesame transactions are few and far between, with high prices and secondary products showing weakness. New broad beans have appeared, arriving in Shanghai from Hangzhou and Yuyao. This is the first time they have appeared this season. The quality of the new goods is good and the value is around 80%. All grains are temporarily looking downstream. Although the flour market is firm, it will be difficult to maintain its position as new wheat comes to market.

Wu Kaixian Concurrently Appointed as Chairman of the Distribution Committee

[Our Report] The organization of the Municipal Food Distribution Committee has been decided in principle after President Zhang of the Central Bank, Chief Accountant Xu of the National Government, Deputy Minister Pang of the Ministry of Food, and Mayor Wu and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau exchanged opinions and obtained the consent of President Zhang of Nanjing via telegram. It will have three sections, four units, and one office, with more than 100 full-time staff members, and will be under the jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Bureau.

The candidates for the three standing committee members have also been internally determined and will be filled by Zhang Xiaosong, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, Ren Xianqun, the representative of the Central Trust Bureau, and Ye Baofu, the Counselor of the Ministry of Food. After the establishment of the committee, the original Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau will not be abolished.

It is also reported that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau plans to request the Central Trust Bureau to allocate 500,000 bags per month, of which 240,000 bags are intended for direct distribution to citizens for consumption.

Oil Distribution Mechanism to Be Improved

The supply of edible oil for people's livelihoods in this city has been suspended for a long time due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials for the oil pressing industry. Currently, only the Zhongzhi Oil Factory distributes 350 dan (a unit of weight) per day to regulate the market. The quantity is small, and the distribution to merchants is not widespread. Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a document to the Municipal Government stating that the city's edible oil will be half-funded by the Zhongzhi Oil Factory. In order to improve the distribution mechanism, the Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM today, convening representatives from the third district of the oil pressing industry, including Zhongzhi and Zhongshi. The Ministry of Food has approved the allocation of 4,000 dan per month by the Zhongshi Oil Factory for distribution. As for the Municipal Edible Oil Regulation Committee, the authorities intend to adopt a method of having rapeseed pressed and distributed by the oil pressing industry on behalf of the government, but the rapeseed has not yet arrived, and the date of the committee's establishment has been repeatedly delayed.

Chinese stocks were volatile yesterday, with market conditions sparse. Some securities traders bought on dips, and prices recovered repeatedly. The opening price of Neiyi fell to the limit, but soon stabilized. Huafeng was also unsupported, but gradually brightened. The Match Company received strong buying from bank traders, and the Mei Ya Company was trading for the last day before the capital increase. Both companies were forced to suspend trading at one point and were the most eye-catching. Mei Ya Silk Factory is implementing a capital increase, and spot and delivery transactions will be temporarily suspended from today.

The market opened lower in the morning due to a strong sense of peace. After the opening of the Diyi Yarn market, traders from No. 231, No. 11, No. 179, No. 94, No. 152, No. 224, No. 205, No. 119, and No. 97 bought in, and the price gradually rose to 680 yuan. Traders from No. 94, No. 89, No. 157, No. 180, No. 14, and No. 130 sold at 6,550 yuan. The appetite of traders from No. 213, No. 224, No. 152, No. 160, and No. 97 suddenly improved, and the price rose to 6,730 yuan. Traders from No. 155, No. 231, and No. 94 continued to sell, and the price failed to advance further. Although the Match Company was listed as rising to the limit by No. 110, Zhongyi Trust, Diyi Yarn was still liquidated by traders from No. 94, No. 153, No. 232, No. 89, and No. 231. After the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate rebounded to 16 yuan, the price fell to 6,500 yuan. Traders from No. 154, No. 117, No. 99, No. 142, and No. 143 came to buy, and Mei Ya No. 24 and others were listed as rising to the limit. At 12:30, the price rose to 6,800 yuan. Traders from No. 77, No. 89, No. 190, No. 31, and No. 155 sold again, and the price fell back to 6,600 yuan near the close. Traders from No. 117 and No. 152 were still buying, and the market closed around 6,680 yuan. The market stabilized slightly after the close. The results showed that Xinhe fell slightly compared to the previous close, Yonggong fell by 0.5%, Yongsha, Huafeng, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinyu, and Zhongfa rose slightly, Xinhua rose by 0.5%, Mei Ya rose to the limit, and Neiyi rebounded after falling to the limit, but still fell by 10%. The Match Company rose to the limit. Jinglun, Shangwu, Xinya, Guohuo, and Lianzi fell slightly to the limit, and the remaining stocks all rose slightly. Delivery transactions showed that Xinguang and Yonggong were flat, Yongsha, Jingfu, and Qinxing rose slightly, Xinhe rose by 0.5%, and Mei Ya rebounded after rising to the limit, still rising by a strong 0.5%. Off-market old stocks rose and fell slightly.

### Cocoon Markets Open Successively in Various Regions

According to a message released by the Sericulture Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Hangzhou branch reported that as of the 26th, the number of cocoons received by various cocoon merchants was 21,000 dan of local fresh cocoons and 5,000 dan of improved fresh cocoons, totaling 26,000 dan (calculated at a ratio of 1:3 for fresh cocoons to dried cocoon weight). Currently, the number of local varieties is gradually decreasing, while the number of improved varieties is gradually increasing. 147 families in Zhejiang province can all begin weighing today. In the past two days, silkworm farmers in various regions have been enthusiastically selling cocoons, with each merchant receiving an average of 150 dan of fresh cocoons per day. The order in the cocoon market is good, and all are able to comply with the regulations and procedures. Cocoon banknotes have also been rushed to various places by the Agricultural Bank of China to provide assistance, so there is no need to worry about shortages. In addition, the quality of cocoons in various regions is quite good. The discount for green silk is smaller than the 420 jin stipulated by the association. It is estimated that the average conversion rate for improved varieties can be within 400 jin, so the original standard cocoon price can be slightly increased. In Jiangsu province, except for the cocoon merchants in Wujiang and Liyang, who will start weighing in one or two days, the remaining areas of Wuxi, Wujin, and Jiangyin will not start weighing until June 2nd or 3rd. Based on the production situation in various regions, it is feared that 300 billion yuan will be needed to cover the cost of all cocoons.

### Holders Unanimously Seek Higher Prices: Factory Thread Market Shows Improvement; Rayon Is Mediocre, Silk Prices Are Weak

Yesterday, the rayon market lacked the strength to rise and ultimately leveled with the previous day. No. 120, with a high mountain and bright light, opened at 17.2 million yuan. The silk factory traders showed some interest, causing the asking price to rise slowly. The morning close was 7.8 million yuan, 300,000 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, due to the tight money situation, there were those willing to sell at a discount, so the final price was 7.75 million yuan. The price of the Dongyang brand was 600,000 yuan, the same as the previous day.

Yesterday, the factory silk market suddenly became enthusiastic. As the price of cocoons in the countryside has increased, and the cost of new silk will also increase, holders unanimously sought higher prices. The transaction price yesterday rose by 1.4 million yuan compared to the previous day. Tongshun bought 15 bales of D-grade thread, with prices ranging from 21.4 million to 600,000 yuan in three levels. There were also transactions in medium-grade thread, with prices around 20 million to 50,000 yuan. The price of high-grade thread was similar to that of D-grade thread. Yesterday, there were more than 30 bales traded in total. Qianjing still lacks buyers, but the asking price was also good yesterday, rising by 500,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the silk goods market was very weak in the morning, but the asking price returned to level in the afternoon due to the rising price of silk. Dachang's plaid silk crepe opened at 350,500 yuan, with a minimum price of 200 yuan. There were those who wanted to buy in the afternoon at 500 yuan. Bedding fabric initially cost 100,000 yuan. High-grade goods from Huajin silk crepe were transacted at 13,800 yuan. Although the price is high in the producing area, some people in the Shanghai market are eager to sell due to monetary reasons, and they inevitably sell at a discount. Moreover, the quality of the goods varies greatly, so the market price lacks a standard.

### Cloth Market Weak at First, Then Slightly Better

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened quietly, and sales were also sluggish. The price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth once fell to 288,000-289,000 yuan, and Sijunzi gabardine was 290,000 yuan. However, as Tianjin traders bought up medium and low-grade fine cloth at low prices, and Hankou traders also showed interest in bleached cloth, the market price rose. As a result, the price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 298,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine cloth such as Wufu Caiqiu also increased by 4,000-5,000 yuan. Gabardine Sijunzi and Jinlian Miaowu increased by 5,000-7,000 yuan. Bleached cloth, colored fine cloth, blue cloth, twill, and straight tribute also saw many increases.

### Daily Necessities Rise Slightly: Soap and Candle Raw Materials Fall Back

Yesterday in the daily necessities market, traders on the floor traded 500 boxes of Huang Xiangmao soap at 255,000 yuan. The afternoon price was 260,000 yuan, with many transactions. The final listed price was 261,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of the Gu Ben and Arrow Knife brands fell by 4,000-2,000 yuan, while the price of Guanghua and Meihua rose by 5,000 yuan.

In the match market, there were more transactions of new brands, and the price also rose slightly. Nanjing brand matches were 1.75 million yuan per box, Jincheng was 1.55 million yuan, and Rose brand was 1.82 million yuan, an increase of 20,000-50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of the old brand Phoenix matches fell slightly by 20,000 yuan.

In the market for soap and candle raw materials, foreign firms sold off quite a bit due to tight credit, the market was flooded with chips, and sentiment was soft. Yuepai caustic soda fell to 7.25 million yuan, and American caustic soda also saw a small decline, to 7 million yuan per barrel. Caustic soda powder fell back by 100 yuan per pound, to 2,400 yuan. Demand for coconut oil was even weaker, falling sharply by 50,000 yuan per barrel, to 1.05 million yuan. Vanilla oil fell from 15,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan per pound. N rosin fell back by 30,000 yuan, to 600,000 yuan per can. White wax fell slightly by 100,000 yuan, to 1.4 million yuan per sima dan. Styrene also fell slightly from 3.5 million to 3.2 million yuan, a decrease of 300,000 yuan.

### Cigarette Market Turns Weak in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened slightly higher, but turned weak in the afternoon. Transactions were also flat, and asking prices for all cigarettes fell. 10-pack Great Britain brand cigarettes were 6.65 million yuan per case, a decrease of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of Old Knife fell by 330,000 yuan due to ample supply, to 5.8 million yuan. Transactions of Wuhua cigarettes were particularly good, rising by 30,000 yuan. Other Chinese brands of cigarettes rose and fell mutually.

### Domestically Produced Woolen Fabrics Are Popular

With the difficulty of importing foreign goods, domestically produced woolen fabrics are in demand, and prices continue to rise, setting new records. All large and small woolen fabric manufacturers are thriving and making huge profits. Woolen fabric shops, on the other hand, are in a difficult situation. Foreign firms have mostly suspended operations due to import controls. With the exception of large-scale stores, ordinary shops are feeling the pain of rising costs and high interest rates. The future of their business is fraught with hidden worries.

### Measures for Importing Raw Materials for Export Products to Be Approved Soon: Review Procedures to Be Handled by the Export Association

[Our Report] A person in charge of the executive committee of the Export Promotion Committee met with reporters yesterday and said: During this trip to Beijing, he had discussions with the competent authorities on measures for importing raw materials for export products and measures to support bulk export materials. The approval of these two measures should not be a problem and will be announced and implemented in the near future.

The measures for importing raw materials for export products have been discussed and approved by both the Export and Import Committees. The review procedures will be handled by the Export Association. As for the issuance of permits, it will be handled by the licensing office. As soon as the government order is issued, it will be followed.

Government Support for Exporters

Regarding measures to support bulk export materials, recently, due to the discrepancy between domestic and foreign market prices for some bulk export materials, and due to the exchange rate, exports will incur losses. All exporters hope that the government will provide assistance. In order to balance international payments, the government cannot ignore these bulk export materials and will do its best to support exports. However, it is best if merchants can export on their own. To date, assistance has been implemented for frozen eggs, silk, and tea. Other products such as tung oil and hog bristles are also being planned.

### Taiwan Sugar Allocation Halved

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable, with ups and downs. The association set the price for Peruvian sand sugar at 419,000 yuan at first, then 425,000 yuan, a rebound of 5,000 yuan. Taizhong white sand was 375,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan, and rebounded to 390,000 yuan in the afternoon. 24 coarse white was 470,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. 3.5-car white was still 430,000 yuan. Shantou green opened at 283,000 yuan, up 3,000 yuan. Xinghua white loosened slightly, opening at 390,000 yuan. Xinghua red was 300,000 yuan to 290,000 yuan, totaling hundreds of baskets. Diaoqing other star opened at 250,000 yuan. In the evening, news came from the Taiwan Sugar Company that it had decided to halve the quota for today's allocation based on the actual amount of the previous period, allocating only two types: 4.5-car white and 20 medium sand white. It is predicted that the market may be slightly tight today.

### Green Tea Sales Remain Stable

Stir-fried green tea, roasted green tea, pearl orchid, and other green teas have been weaker in Tianjin and Yingkou recently, and the trend is becoming more stable. Although there are inflows and outflows of other varieties, the process is calm and unremarkable. In the foreign traders' tea market, negotiations continue to stall due to disagreements on both sides, and the situation remains quiet. According to industry insiders, Bai Lin black tea, which is popular both domestically and abroad, may arrive in Shanghai soon this year. The selling price is affected by high costs and is likely to reach a peak.

### June Coal Allocation: Various Agencies to Discuss Tomorrow

[Our Report] According to a person in charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Coal Management Committee, the coal supply to this region mainly comes from three places: Northeast China, Kailuan, and Taiwan. Currently, the coal supply from Northeast China and Kailuan has been disrupted due to the unstable situation and blocked transportation. The supply relies solely on Taiwan, which is insufficient for distribution. In addition, the price of coal has not been adjusted for a long time, which may affect the supply of coal from various coal mines. Although the coal allocation problem for May has been resolved, there is currently no definite certainty about the coal allocation for June. Therefore, the committee has scheduled a meeting for 2:30 PM on the 30th of this month, convening relevant parties, including the Municipal Government, the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Command, the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Junpu Bureau, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau, the Shipping Association, the Logistics Command, and the Naval Headquarters, to jointly discuss the adjustment of the June coal allocation.

### Coarse Yarn Rises Slightly

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was stable. Because yarn dealers took advantage of tight money conditions to sell a considerable number of yarn stocks, coupled with the release of ten types of yarn by the Textile Construction Company, there was an abundant supply, and market asking prices once fell. However, as Guangdong traders continued to buy, the prices rebounded. Finally, except for 16-count yarn, which showed a slight rise, 42-count Blue Phoenix continued to fall by 50,000 yuan, and 20-count yarn was stable with no change.

[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhixin ship sailed from Shanghai to Guangzhou the day before yesterday, carrying more than 2,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 386 pieces of cloth. It also carried more than 660 boxes of cigarettes and 6,900 pieces of miscellaneous goods to Guangdong. The Zizhong ship returned to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao the day before yesterday, carrying 9,400 tons of soybeans.

### Deadline for Export of American Goods Set for June 30

[Our Report] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association received a letter from Mr. Cologne, Chairman of the Provisional Committee of Cotton Importers, stating: "I have just received a telegram from the American Cotton Transportation Association, please forward the following information to all brokers and Chinese buyers: The Department of Agriculture has repeatedly warned American exporters that the deadline for limiting the shipment of exported goods must not exceed June 30 of this year, and the law will not be extended. In this situation, in order to comply with the Department's limit, it is advisable to quickly settle all payments before the end of June so that exporters can load as scheduled, and loading requires at least 30 days of preparation time. If the payment is delayed, the congestion during loading will inevitably result in penalties from the Department of Agriculture." This matter is extremely important and should be promptly communicated to all committees.

### Large Fraud Case of 800,000 Hong Kong Dollars - Manager of Hong Kong Wing Hing Foreign Firm Disappears, "Order Slip Bandits" Gradually Vanish

— Hong Kong, 24th Dispatch, Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng

"Order Slip Bandits" Rampant for a Time

Hong Kong exhibits a deformed prosperity, while also being full of deception and terror.

The most troublesome are the widespread threatening letters, with newspapers reporting "order slips" almost daily. The names used in the "order slips" are uniformly "Overseas Youth Action Faction." Major hotels, theaters, shipping companies, and restaurants have almost all received this type of "order slip" letter. The Kam Cheng Restaurant, Luk Hoi Tung Grand Hotel, Dak Wan Teahouse, New World Theatre, and the "Guangdong" ship have all been bombed by the "Overseas Youth Faction" and suffered considerable losses. For a time, everyone spoke of the "Overseas Youth Faction's" "actions" with fear. The police authorities worked hard to arrest them, and many have been caught. Taking the arrested "order slip" bandit Hong Wenfeng as an example, he sent forty-six threatening letters at once. Judges are not hesitant to use severe punishments, with the heaviest being twelve years of hard labor and twelve lashes of the rattan. As a result, the "order slip bandits" have gradually disappeared and are not as prominent as before.

The city is sinful. Hong Kong's population is increasing daily, making it difficult to make a living, so there are more criminals. In addition to the "order slip" bandits mentioned above, the bizarre and fantastic scams are countless.

"Smart People" Are After All Confused

Around 1:00 PM on the 15th, a woman of about 27 or 28 years old walked into the most modern "Wiseman" restaurant on Des Voeux Road. She was wearing a white-bottomed striped dress, white suede high heels, a diamond ring, and carrying a Western newspaper. She reserved 170 Western meals with the manager, saying they were for a farewell party for the Governor of Hong Kong. The party would be seated at 6:00 PM the next day. Seeing the woman's demeanor, the manager naturally provided diligent service. He immediately agreed on the menu and even used a bowl of curry chicken rice himself. After eating, she ordered 30 roast ducks, 170 catties of large shrimp, 8 turkeys, 200 oranges, 200 apples, 100 mangoes, and 50 pounds of raisins. The manager asked her to pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan. She opened her handbag, took out several 500-yuan bills, and said she didn't have enough money with her, promising to go to the bank to get it later. The manager believed her without a doubt. Before leaving, the woman took away two roast chickens, a bottle of whiskey, half a dozen sandwiches, and half a dozen beers, saying she would pay for them later. She also borrowed 40 yuan from the manager because she didn't have any change for the taxi. The manager lent it to her. Unexpectedly, the woman disappeared without a trace. The manager then realized he had been deceived, resulting in a loss of 105 yuan. It was truly an unprecedented and amusing scam. "Wiseman" is translated as "smart person," but this "smart person" was confused for a moment!

Large Fraud Case, Principal Culprit at Large

The recent large fraud case that shook all of Hong Kong is even more shocking, with the amount defrauded reaching as much as 800,000 Hong Kong dollars. Twenty-one commercial firms were defrauded, making it an unprecedented large-scale scam in the Hong Kong business scene. The protagonist is Ou Jiaxue, the manager of Wing Hing Foreign Firm. His office had two locations: one at 12 Stanley Street and one at Queen's Road Central. Recently, burlap sacks were in high demand and difficult to order. Wing Hing Foreign Firm advertised that it had close ties with Indian merchants and could accept orders. One after another, twenty-one commercial firms made contracts with him, ordering a total of 1,726,000 burlap sacks, with a total value of 4 million Hong Kong dollars. After receiving 20% as a deposit, Ou Jiaxue had 800,000 Hong Kong dollars in hand. Unexpectedly, Ou suddenly disappeared on May 19, and this large fraud case was revealed. A great commotion immediately erupted in the business community. The police have now issued an arrest warrant for Ou to bring him to justice. The victimized commercial firms have formed a "Wing Hing Foreign Firm Creditors' Group" to formally pursue legal action. According to the reporter's investigation, the largest loss was suffered by Da Ji Trading Company, which paid a deposit of 100,000 yuan, while others lost 30,000 to 50,000 yuan each. The inside story of this complex and confusing scam is still a mystery, but merchants have since become very wary of ordering goods!

### Cruel Wolves Fiercely Attack a Lonely Sheep - Blood and Tears in Anyang

— Zhengzhou, 11th Dispatch, Our Newspaper Correspondent Fan Shiqin

The situation in Henan Province is very clear to the people of the country: Wan is not as good as Luo, and Luo is not as good as Zhang. Wan is Nanyang, Luo is Luoyang, and Zhang is Zhangde, which is Anyang. This shows how strategically important Anyang is. The deliberate siege by "One-Eyed Dragon" Liu Bocheng has been going on for more than a day. Following this, the heroic defense of the loyal and brave National Army!

This time, the National Army withdrew from Tangyin, making Anyang City even more isolated. This tragic situation is like a person losing their only comrade in adversity. The ferocity of a wolf towards a lonely sheep is doubled, otherwise, the world would not have the word "cruel."

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the railways have been destroyed by the Ba Lu Jun. People returning home to the north were blocked in Anyang. Later, they stayed there due to livelihood reasons, so there are still refugees from distant villages (including those from the Northeast) to this day. Other refugees were driven out of nearby provinces and counties by the Communist army's struggle sessions. Representatives from Anyang seeking aid said: "If we can give each refugee two liang of millet a day, we will be worthy of them."

Zhang Shiji, the speaker of the Anyang City Council, and Wang Maosheng, the deputy speaker, are both elders with high morals and prestige who have been living in seclusion for twenty years and whose descendants are all over northern Henan. After the city was surrounded, they organized a Pacification Promotion Association. The people in the city, regardless of age, had to do construction work. Everyone did construction work. The things in the city, whether public or private, that could be used were all taken out. They shared difficulties and dangers together, truly embodying the saying "sharing the same boat."

Li Tietou (i.e., Li Zhenqing), the famous commander of the 41st Division, and Huochetou (i.e., Zhao Zhichen), the famous former commissioner, are responsible for leading the people to defend the city. Li said to the people: "The soldiers defending the city regard Anyang as their hometown. They would rather lose their lives than lose their hometown." Since being besieged on April 8, Anyang has remained standing because of these brave men.

Defending a lonely city is certainly a tragic thing, and besieging a lonely city is also a tragic thing. This time, when Liu Bocheng besieged Tangyin, he should have known that there were things he couldn't bear to do. One night, a Communist army regiment commander forced his soldiers to charge with machine guns. Those soldiers charged again and again, seeing batches of civilians fall. Seeing this, the soldiers couldn't bear it. Holding their machine guns, they turned around and knelt in front of their regiment commander, pleading: "We can't fight anymore. Too many civilians are dying!" That night, the regiment commander ordered a temporary halt to the attack. The next morning, the regiment commander was found hanged in the woods.

A Monk Also Voices a Call

Editor: We are a group of neglected and oppressed people in society because we are monks. Few people pay attention to our class. Here, I must declare in advance that although monks are said to be detached from worldly desires, that is just a religious theory. When we are hungry, we need to eat; when we are cold, we need to wear clothes. This is the reality. Living in the real world, we have to abandon theory and study the current reality. We live in the degenerate age of Buddhism. The collective monastic practice system established by monks in the past has now lost its function. Especially in Shanghai, 100% of the temples rely on performing Buddhist services to make a living. Therefore, we are a group of monks who chant scriptures and perform repentance ceremonies for temples. We chant until our voices are hoarse from 8:00 AM to 4:00 or 5:00 PM, but the "single salary" we receive is only 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. At the end of last year, the price of public bonds in various monasteries (i.e., each temple) was 8,000 yuan, and we were receiving 3,000 yuan. In March of this year, they still asked for 12,000 yuan per person, and we still got what we got. Recently, prices have skyrocketed, and these meager incomes are really not enough for daily needs. The Buddhist Association has a resolution that the single salary of the monastic community should be calculated according to 30%, but each temple does not raise the price, which is like drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. Therefore, in great disappointment, we convened a meeting of representatives from various monastic communities and voluntarily agreed to set the single salary at 6,000 yuan (i.e., 6,000 yuan for one day of performing services). In the feudal minds of the abbots of various temples, they consider us rebellious for daring to set the price ourselves. Therefore, many temple abbots have announced that anyone who dares to mention raising the "single salary" will be "expelled" (a monastic term meaning to be kicked out). The single salary we have set this time is already extremely low compared to the general standards of society. Because we are all single, we cannot be compared with other classes. But even this extremely low demand cannot get their sympathy. They can arbitrarily ask the believers for any amount for a Buddhist service, plus income from vegetarian offerings. Our single salary is like a leaf in the ocean. They ignore that we are all Buddhists and forget the ancient saying of "crossing the river in the same boat." They only care about selfishness and how to exploit the masses? If there is still justice in the world, I don't know how these Buddhist magnates should be punished. We are the oppressed and weak. We cannot compete with these elders in terms of money and power. We can only appeal to fair-minded people in society and the media to sympathize with and help us. (Yi Yi Monk)

### Interlude of the Spring Tea Harvest in Western Anhui

— Hefei, 15th Dispatch, Our Newspaper Correspondent Bai Ping

From Lu'an to Mabao, the roadsides are lined with lush green wheat fields. After traveling twenty li, wheat fields are less common. Instead, there are clusters of low, green tea trees. Looking into the distance, there are also scattered clusters of tea. After familiarizing myself with the tea-growing area, I realized that facing the tea clusters covering the mountains and fields also means facing countless problems in the tea-growing area.

In the mountains of western Anhui, the peaks are overlapping and there is very little farmland. Residents can only "rely on the mountains for a living." Tea planting is not only their main sideline but also the source of life in the mountainous area. The success or failure of each year's spring tea harvest has a huge impact on their entire rural economy. Because their livelihoods depend so heavily on tea, they are usually called tea farmers. Mongolians use the number of cattle and sheep to indicate their wealth, while tea farmers in western Anhui determine their wealth by the number of tea clusters. A rich farmer not only owns many bamboo forests that do not require much labor to cultivate but, more importantly, has several good tea mountains. The poor are different. Those who have mountains have barren land that produces little. Those who rent other people's mountains also mostly rent barren mountains. They also have to take out some of the tea they grow to pay the landlord, which is the duty of tenants.

The lives of tea farmers in western Anhui are on the brink of starvation. Their only enjoyment is the fresh air and unrestrained singing in the green mountains.

Human or Bird? A Tragic Story

Is a touching story that every tea farmer can tell.

Every year, when the tea trees are lush all over the mountains, there is a sharp, crisp, and sorrowful bird sound that echoes in the mountain valleys at night. "Yang Kuiliu," "Yang Kuiliu," the tea farmers recognize that this night bird is calling out tirelessly.

It is said that, in an unknown year, there was an old tea merchant named Yang Kuiliu from outside the mountains who would come to the Pi River area to buy tea every spring. This year, after buying the tea, he loaded it onto a wooden boat and went down the Pi River. For some reason, he tragically drowned in the Pi River. His wife waited for her husband to return every day. However, day after day, month after month, year after year, she never saw the husband she missed. Later, she learned that her husband had been buried in the belly of a fish a long time ago. She was extremely saddened and soon died in depression. But her soul did not disappear. In order to cherish her husband, she turned into a small bird. Every spring, she would fly to the tea-growing area to look for her husband all over the mountains and fields, calling out her husband's name "Yang Kuiliu" sadly. After listening for a long time, the tea farmers called this bird "Yang Kuiliu." Thus, a person's name became a bird's name. Tea farmers often tell this story.

This story is a myth. The longer it is passed down, the more mysterious it becomes. Tea farmers use the volume of "Yang Kuiliu" sounds each year to predict the success or failure of the spring tea harvest. This year, the sound of "Yang Kuiliu" is not very loud. The tea farmers say that this year's spring tea harvest is only average.

Tea-Picking Mountain Songs Are Beautiful Poems

The season when "Yang Kuiliu" calls out all over the mountains and the azaleas are as red as fire is the time when spring tea arrives, which is also the busiest time for tea farmers.

The tea-picking season is still based on the old "Farmers' Almanac." "No picking after Grain Rain, no stopping picking after Qingming." Tea picked before the Rain Water season is called "small tea." Tea picked after the Grain in Ear season is called "large tea." "Large tea" has the highest yield.

During tea-picking, men and women, young and old, carry baskets on their backs, some even bring small wooden stools, and scatter around the low tea trees. With their hands moving, the tea leaves fall rustling into the baskets. Tea-picking also requires skill. The best tea-pickers can pick one to one and a half catties of "small tea" every day. Poor ones can only pick half a catty. When picking "large tea," because the tea trees have grown completely and the leaves have grown well, each person can pick six or seven catties every day.

Young men and women are more active when picking tea, as if spring belongs to them. In the warm sunlight, they use mountain songs to relieve the pain of material life and the fatigue of work. They sing to each other, and naturally many of the lyrics are lewd, but many are simple and lovely, revealing true feelings. We can say that those mountain songs are simple peasant literature, they are beautiful poems.

Mountain songs in western Anhui are usually five lines. Listening to them sing, the melody is very consistent with the principles of music, and the mood is happy and emotional. The reporter has selected and recorded three songs as follows:

"Looking at the good sister wearing cyan blue, carrying a small bamboo basket in her hand, I ask the good sister where are you going? The husband is poor and the family is difficult, making bitter vegetables for dinner."

"Seventeen or eighteen, a flower on a branch, if you don't marry a man, when will you? The moon is full on the fifteenth, the time is short in youth, people reach middle age and everything stops, the water flows to the East Sea and never returns."

"The orchid grass flower smells fragrant, the rapeseed flower shines yellow, compare the two flowers, home flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers, the home man is not as strong as the wild man."

There are also realistic mountain songs that men and women sing to each other.

The man sings: "The small tea tree squats low, holding the tea tree and sighing, picking tea all day until night, frying tea until the fifth watch, and no money to return home."

The woman sings: "Sister tells her dear brother not to worry, I will handle your travel expenses, you can pawn hairpins and jewelry, the slave will choose dry tea for you, carrying a painted eyebrow bird, swaying home."

From these few mountain songs, the hardships of the tea farmers' lives and the love between men and women can be imagined.

Carrying the Burden, Enduring Long Years

Once the spring tea season begins, all the manpower of the tea farmers' families is concentrated on tea. Before that, they must prepare, such as building tea pots, tying bamboo silk handles for frying tea, yellow flower handles, tea picking baskets, cloth pockets for selling tea, and tea baskets for loading and drying tea. When the tea picking comes, they pick tea non-stop in the tea garden during the day and fry it at night to prepare for sale tomorrow. As the mountain song says, "Picking tea all day until night, frying tea until the fifth watch," they are exhausted.

From the autumn season of the first year, they engage in cultivation, weeding, transplanting, merging, pruning, and other work on the tea, until the spring of the second year when they pick, dry, and sell it. A lot of labor is spent in between. However, the price they get for their labor is hunger and cold. They endure long years in an environment of poverty and sorrow all year round!

This year's tea price was very high when it first came on the market, at 24,000 yuan per catty. But because it was just trying out the new tea, the good times didn't last long. Soon it fell to a miserable 8,000 yuan per catty. When the reporter arrived in the tea-growing area, it was the time when the national rice price began to fluctuate. The tea price followed the rice price, rising to 12,000 to 13,000 yuan per catty. Although the tea price had improved, the tea farmers were not better off than last year. Western Anhui is short of rice, and the tea farmers sell tea to buy rice. At this time last year, one catty of tea could be exchanged for one dou and four or five sheng of rice. This year, when the reporter was in Mabao, the price of rice had risen to 150,000 to 160,000 yuan per shi. One catty of tea can't buy any rice. Moreover, when selling tea, they have to bear very heavy taxes. Tea is one of the largest sources of income in the special product tax. For example, the budget of Lihuang County almost entirely relies on the support of the special product tax. Tea farmers have to pay 10% special product tax for selling one catty of tea, and the tea merchants also take 3% commission. The tea farmers receive only 8,700 yuan for every 10,000 yuan they earn. This puts a heavy burden on the tea farmers, and the land tax, conscription, Baojia, assessments, and other counties have the same burden.

Sometimes, tea farmers are also exploited by tea merchants. Tea farmers always sell wet tea. They carry it on their shoulders for dozens of li of mountain roads to reach the tea merchants, and they are waiting for money to buy rice or cloth. Moreover, wet tea will rot in two days, so it must be sold. This gives the tea merchants an opportunity. Cunning tea merchants see this and deliberately suppress the price. Yes, it's better not to buy it, but it's better not to sell it. So the tea farmers know they are at a loss, and they have to reluctantly sell the goods for money!

Year After Year The government did not do anything to tea farmers

To be fair, the government has paid attention to tea farmers. Every spring, the government has sent officials to tea-growing counties in western Anhui to issue tea loans. The amount of the loan is allocated according to the number of cooperative members. However, the tea loans are given to a few people year after year. These few people are the tea merchants who specialize in studying banknotes. Whenever they hear about the distribution of tea loans, they make up many names and become a cooperative. When the loan is in hand, they not only don't use it to buy tea but also lend it out for profit. Some tea farmers are instead exploited by them. The government originally hoped that the money would benefit the farmers, but the effect is the opposite.

This year, the total amount of tea loans in western Anhui is 250 million yuan, which is issued by the Agricultural Bank. Perhaps the Agricultural Bank knows about past abuses, so this year the Agricultural Bank is organizing a working team to issue loans themselves. The Social Affairs Office of the Provincial Government has also organized a tea cooperative working team to cooperate in handling the matter. The reporter has met them in Lu'an, Mabao, and other places. This year, they should be able to correct past abuses. The reporter wishes the tea farmers well!

### A Brand New World Atlas

— Shen Xiuzhi

Hammond's New International World Atlas Published in 1947 Price 55,000 Yuan

Hammond's New International World Atlas is a brand new atlas published after World War II, and it is an indispensable tool for those who study modern geography.

This atlas is divided into three parts. The first part mainly consists of thirty-nine "World Political Maps," which, except for the first "World Map," are arranged in the order of continents. (1) North America and South America, including maps of Canada and Newfoundland, the United States, Mexico, Central American countries, the West Indies, Northern South America, Southern South America, and Central South America. (2) Europe, including maps of the United Kingdom and Ireland, Spain and Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, Italy, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the Balkan Peninsula, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, the Soviet Union (European part), and others. (3) Asia, including maps of Turkey, Syria and Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan, Iran and Iraq, Arabia, India, Ceylon, Burma, Siam, Vietnam and Malaya, the East Indies, China and Japan, the Soviet Union (Asian part), Japan and Korea, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, and others. (4) Australia. (5) Africa, divided into North Africa and South Africa.

The second part consists of several supplementary items: (1) The aftermath of World War II. This is a short article explaining the changes in the borders of countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa after World War II, based on treaties, surrender terms, and other agreements. (2) World Gazetteer, divided into country names, areas, populations, capitals or major cities, map numbers, and locations. (3) Important locations of World War II, divided into Europe and North Africa, and Asia and the Pacific. (4) World Statistics, regarding the heights, lengths, and areas of the world's high mountains, major rivers, oceans, and large lakes. (5) Topography and Resource Distribution Maps, indicating the topography and distribution of important minerals and agricultural products of each continent.

The second part is "Illustrated World Geography," which "describes the natural resources, topographical features, industries, occupations, and cultural backgrounds of various countries in the world." It uses text and photographs for explanation, and the order is the same as the maps, starting with North America. However, the classification here is more detailed, with each country as a unit. The text explanations are concise, with no other special features, but the photographs and illustrations are beautiful and well-selected. They allow us to see the fishing villages of Nova Scotia in Canada, the Spanish-style churches in Mexico, the "fiber boats" on Lake Titicaca in Ecuador, the medieval fortresses of France, the snowy landscapes of Finland, the heroic appearance of New Turkey, the scenery of the North African desert, and the flocks of sheep in Australia.

The third part is historical maps, including forty-five maps, with concise explanations. These historical maps can help us read about Europe and the United States. They allow us to understand the rise of ancient empires in the Near East, the vast territory of the Persian Empire, and the rise and fall of ancient Greek and Roman culture. They take us to medieval Europe, allowing us to witness the barbarian invasions, the Crusades, the rise of the Mongol Empire, and the feudal era in Europe. Then we enter modern times, and we see the voyages of discovery to the Americas from 1492 to 1611, Italy during the Renaissance, Europe in 1559, Europe in 1763, the partitions of Poland, Central Europe in 1812, Europe from the Congress of Vienna to 1839, the unification of Italy, Europe in 1914, and Europe from 1919 to 1938. Regarding the American part, there are also several maps, namely the birth of the United States, the expansion of American territory, the distribution of the American slavery system from 1775 to 1865, and the United States at the beginning of the Civil War in 1861.

### Introducing "The Electric World"

— Yang Shi

Edited by Qiu Weiyu Published by the Science Instrument Company

In the publishing world, there are more than a dozen general science publications, but the "Electric World" monthly magazine, published by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers, is the only magazine that specifically discusses electrical science and electrical engineering. Electricity—one of mankind's most faithful servants—has a bit of mystery. The minuteness of electrons is unimaginable, and the wonder of radio surpasses the imagination of ordinary people. It is a great source of power. The smallest particle of matter is the atom, but the interior of the atom is still filled with unequal numbers of electrons orbiting. Therefore, this is indeed an authentic "Electric World."

In terms of arrangement and material selection, equal emphasis is placed on special articles and reports, and they are rigorous and accessible, with a level of depth suitable for university science and engineering students. The "Forum" column is written by well-known domestic professors, who not only report their research findings, but more importantly, systematically introduce new things from abroad to the Chinese people. In terms of engineering, China's electrical engineering is progressing faster than any other field, and electrical undertakings are also rising in various places. This publication has a plan to collect reports from various places in the country and provide them to students and young people who are fascinated by science.

Radio experiments are the most interesting and convenient. A few strands of electric wire, a few vacuum tubes, and a couple of batteries can be combined into a radio receiver. Many other small experiments can inspire people's thinking and increase their interest in learning. Therefore, there is a "Laboratory" to help you make these experiments. "Knowing is difficult, doing is easy" is the best example used in this regard. Experiments are easy, but the principles behind them are profound. Perhaps countless mathematical equations cannot explain a very small experiment. In the "Readers' Correspondence" column, there are many professors who specialize in answering readers' spontaneous questions. The effectiveness of obtaining answers to questions raised by oneself is greater than that of lectures given by teachers in the classroom.

Up to now, there are very few university textbooks on science and engineering written in our own language, and some have different translations or are translated in a way that is more profound and difficult to understand. Therefore, textbooks and reference books for science and engineering colleges are simply written in the original language, which is a discount on effectiveness, and makes it even more difficult for self-taught science youth to encounter problems in learning tools (language) first. In addition to using smooth Chinese to explain these profound questions, "Electric World" also has many illustrations to help understanding. Indeed, this is a rare electrical engineering magazine.

In some aspects, "Electric World" has shortcomings. For example, the target audience could be expanded to include middle schools, and it is hoped that there will be some simpler articles in the special discussions. In order to make it easier for readers to read, more illustrations should be added, and more interesting electrical engineering knowledge should be added. In addition, the current situation of domestic and foreign science and engineering colleges regarding electrical engineering can also be systematically introduced, which would make it more perfect.

### Roosevelt's Life and Thought

— Qi

Edited by Xia Ping Published by Vitality Publishing House

President Roosevelt, this generation's great man, passed away more than a year ago. The fascists, whom he deeply abhorred during his lifetime, have all fallen one by one. The "world peace," "Atlantic Charter," and the "Four Freedoms" of the person, which he actively promoted during his lifetime, are still being vigorously pursued and promoted by peace-loving and democratic people around the world today. In the year after his death, the world has changed dramatically. Although World War II has ended, those who are superstitious about force are dreaming of a new world war. Although world peace has been realized, there is still this place of war... Looking back today, it is not a meaningless thing to browse through the life of this human democratic mentor!

President Roosevelt came from a distinguished family and received a good family education from an early age. In his childhood, he showed his fairness, frankness, and the spirit of moving forward courageously and never slacking off. Although he did not experience difficult times, he held an attitude of distrust towards the current people, but sympathized with the laboring masses. Outside the political sphere, his personality made both his friends and enemies feel undeniable.

When the President was studying at Harvard University, he became interested in politics. In 1910, he participated in the election for New York State Senator and was elected as a Democratic Senator the following year. After that, relying on his extensive knowledge, far-sighted vision, and great fearless fighting spirit, he had a smooth sailing in the American political arena. In 1912, he served as the Governor of New York State, and the following year, he became the Undersecretary of the Navy, making great contributions to the Allied countries during World War I. 1921 was the most memorable day in President Roosevelt's life. He contracted polio and fought the disease for three full years, finally recovering to his previous state. The author wrote in the book: "In the position of ordinary people, after such a long period of illness, they must complain very much, or their spirits will be declining..." (page 60 of the original book). If this were the case, they would bury their own future, "but Roosevelt did not do this."

When he was elected president in 1932, the United States was in a crisis of extreme economic panic. He finally saved the country with his New Deal. At that time, although there were enemies who made things difficult for him everywhere, he was "an extraordinary great man who, with his unique ability and moving sincerity, ultimately defeated his political enemies, and the opposition had to express their heartfelt submission to him. It is no accident that Roosevelt was able to create the record of being elected president three times in a row in American history.

One-third of the book is devoted to Roosevelt's contribution of his greatest strength in World War II, contributing to a series of brilliant victories for the United Nations, but it is a pity that he unfortunately passed away before the final victory. The American people and the United Nations therefore lost this leader of the democratic struggle and the promoter of building peace and security after the war.

In the chapter "Roosevelt's Personality," there is a good explanation of his style and demeanor. Everyone who wants to understand him and learn from his character should read it carefully several times.

There is no doubt that President Roosevelt was a great statesman. The last chapter of this book points out his great contributions to modern humanity, especially his great contributions to international security and peaceful relations between countries after the war, which are unparalleled by anyone.

From this book, we can see the personality record and life microcosm of this contemporary great man. Roosevelt's decisiveness, courage, and always forward-looking attitude and spirit are worthy of our learning. Who will continue the unfinished business he left behind?

### Cultivation of Children's Personality

— Nian Hong

Written by Wansiers Translated by Yi Wenshan Printed by Zhengzhong Book Company

The importance of children's education is well known to the public. Therefore, although there are not many books on children's education on the market, there are indeed several books with rich content that can be used as a reference for general researchers of children's psychology and children's education workers. However, it is rare to see complete books that are relatively practical and not too boring for ordinary parents and teachers to read. Although this book still has many shortcomings, generally speaking, it is still a good read.

Rather than saying that this book is about cultivating children's personality, it is more broadly speaking an overview of all children's education methods (except for specialized intelligence training). It has a very detailed exposition on children's physiology, environmental influences, and various characteristics of children. However, precisely because it is too detailed, some places in this book seem too trivial. Especially in the first few chapters on clothing, posture, and physiology, it is often difficult for people to generate a clear concept after reading. This is a common shortcoming of educational theory books, and this book regrettably also has this small flaw.

The best written (meaning the most suitable for ordinary parents and teachers to read) two chapters are also the focus of this book—namely, the comfort of the family and self-reliance and personality. It clearly points out several extremely important points that are often overlooked by ordinary teachers and parents, and discusses them in detail. For example, children have a habit of liking to be with adults, and like to hear what adults are talking about and doing. However, ordinary adults are often not happy to let children know too much. In Chinese society, you can often hear words like "Adults are talking, children go away." Of course, there are many things that may have a negative impact on children, so it is natural not to let children know. However, this kind of behavior often fosters psychological inferiority in children, making them afraid of any social activities in their youth. This is one of the reasons why so-called young people are too shy and unaccustomed to social habits. For example, many parents are always unwilling to let children do too many things. In fact, when children's physiological development is able to cope, the help they ask for from their parents gradually decreases. However, because parents have the habit of helping them, they want to help them more and more. Some parents even spoon-feed three- or five-year-old children without teaching them how to hold chopsticks, dress, or wash their hands. These will hinder the cultivation and development of children's ability to take care of themselves. In the two chapters on children's self-reliance and family comfort, there are seventy or eighty important precautions listed, and they are discussed and studied item by item. Many of them are indeed extremely important but extremely ordinary experiences that are overlooked. After the author refers to the basis of simple educational theory, it feels even more that what he said is realistic and accurate.

However, compared with this book and another work by the author, "Modern Parents," it seems to be slightly inferior in terms of translation and the realism of the content. Perhaps it is because the translator used a direct translation and the national conditions and habits of China and the United States are different. Some places often do not seem very suitable and fluent to read. Strictly speaking, this should also be a flaw.

### "I Choose Freedom"

— Guang Jian

(I Choose Freedom V Kravchenco)

Translated by Yun Wen (May 1947) Published by Independence Publishing House

Last year, this edition introduced the English version of this book. I think the readers who saw that introduction at the time must have hoped that a Chinese version would be published and come out as soon as possible, so that it could be widely circulated and everyone would have the opportunity to read it.

Now, the first Chinese version of this book has been translated by Mr. Yun Wen and has been published by Independence Publishing House. It was a fad in the United States, with many discussions. In China, at least it is worth paying attention to.

This book is a passionate biography. The author, Victor Kravchenko, is a typical figure of loyalty and purity. In order to realize "freedom and equality," he joined the Communist Party, believing that by becoming a Communist Party member, he could repay the Soviet Union and benefit the suffering people. However, the Communist Party's facilities are dark; the Communist Party's rule is cold-blooded; the Communist Party officials fundamentally ignore the interests of the people and do their best to exploit and enslave them. Driven by his conscience, after experiencing countless cold-blooded blows, he finally broke away from the Communist Party and became a stateless vagrant. Before his departure, he was serving as the deputy head of the Soviet Purchasing Mission in the United States, a position that can be said to be quite high, but due to mental distress, his determination to leave the Communist Party did not waver.

This book begins with the Great Revolution of 1905 and ends with the Soviet Union's involvement in the whirlpool of World War II. Kravchenko faithfully depicts the whole story of the penetration of socialism in the Soviet Union. He exposes the iron facts: hunger, exploitation, and enslavement. "Socialism, to put it appropriately, is better called robbery." (The words of the farmers in the collective farms) For daring to help countless dying little people in violation of party orders, he was purged. This is a fact, and as far as we know, his views have been scolded by some people, but the facts have not been denied.

We must read this book in order to understand the real situation in the Soviet Union. At a time when society is unstable and people's hearts are extremely distressed, those who are still willing to know and compare various social systems, in particular, must read this book. After reading this book, we can increase some knowledge and understanding of the modern world or society.

The translator has many translations, and this book is one of them. When translating this book, the translator spent a great deal of meticulous effort, not only striving to conform to the original meaning in every word, sentence, and paragraph, but also expressing the meaning revealed between the lines very profoundly. As for the fluency of the translation and its literary interest, it is something that goes without saying. It is hoped that young friends who are dissatisfied with the reality and dream of another ideal can read it quickly.

### Trends in Russian Literature

— Xu Peiji

Original by Mikawa Masao Translated by Ren Jun Published by Zhengzhong Book Company

Under the orange-yellow lamplight of dusk, I quietly finished reading "Trends in Russian Literature," and my thoughts traveled through a vast plain full of fragrant flowers and exotic fruits.

Although my journey of the soul was hurried and fleeting; although I could only appreciate the neat rows of flowers and fruits laid out on the surface, in the joyful leaps, the overall picture of the colorful plain that I captured forever tempted me to fall into the dense flower and fruit business in the sky I was looking at, and go deep in a roundabout way.

Russian literature, from the era of sentimentalism, established a sincere attitude towards life, and until the establishment of Proletarian literature, the ideology of the old era's literature has completely changed. This hard-won journey of history has made Russian literature occupy a very high position in the world's literary world, emitting its unique brilliance.

The author of this book uses meticulous brushstrokes to point out the traces of literary historical development from a vertical perspective, and from a horizontal perspective, he concisely and succinctly lists the literary giants who illuminate the traces, and how amazing and admirable are their inherent qualities and outward brilliance!

The whole book is divided into nineteen chapters: (1) The Age of Sentimentalism (2) The Age of Romanticism (3) Pushkin (4) Forerunners of Realism (5) Lermontov (6) Gogol (7) The Forties, the Victory of Realism (8) Turgenev (9) The Sixties, Before and After the Emancipation of the Serfs (10) Dostoevsky (11) Tolstoy (12) The Great Achievement of National Drama (13) The Seventies, From Hope to Disillusionment (14) The Eighties, Chekhov (15) The Nineties, Gorky (16) Modernist Literature (17) A Glimpse of Modern Poetry (18) Fellow Travelers Literature (19) Proletarian Literature. In these chapters, we can see that the author sometimes uses the characteristics of the era to measure the achievements of the literary figures of that era, and sometimes uses the giant image of a literary figure to represent the style of the entire era. The consistent and orderly narrative: readers can easily find the clues of the mutual influence between "era" and "literary figures."

The impression that Russian literature leaves on the general public is that it is a dark and melancholy literature, a literature with a strong spirit of resistance and revolution, or a literature with a very obvious religious color, and these impressions seem to have become concrete common sense. Sure enough, these observations are not without merit, but they cannot grasp the true essence of Russian literature. The most fundamental characteristic of Russian literature is a sincere energy that is unwilling to only live in another independent world of literature, to stick to the position of pure art of observing and reproducing life phenomena, but to constantly engage in desperate, bloody struggles in order to solve practical life problems, practical social problems, and improve human life. To summarize in a simple sentence, the fundamental characteristic of Russian literature is the spirit of serving society and the tendency of social education. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, as well as many other Russian literary giants, have all used literature as a method of social education, and have tried hard to establish a social religion through literature. This characteristic is a powerful factor promoting the evolution of Russian literary trends, and the author has a very detailed discussion of this issue in the book.

Because Russian literature has this fundamental characteristic, it presents a completely different posture compared with Western European literature. In Western Europe, various forms of expression still exist in social life outside of literature, but in Russia, which is almost uncultured in cultural life, which is almost uncultured, literature is the only method to express ideas and self-expression. The direction of expression of literature produced in the country of serfs and landlords is pointed out by the author in the preface with the following characteristics:

"First, the love for nature is particularly profound. Second, the narrative form is simple and unpretentious, completely without any feeling of gaudiness, splendor, etc., and sometimes, it even gives people a rigorous impression. Third, the spirit of endlessly immersing in moral and religious problems and exploring its truth is extremely prosperous and persistent... etc." "Is this the art of barbarians? Or is it the literature of saints?" A Western European critic's cry of doubt is just right to find an appropriate answer in this book.

If literature is the soul of a nation or country, or literature is a specific reflection of the state or era's ideology, then the driving force of pursuing truth, enthusiasm, sincerity, and uncompromisingness flowing through Russian literature can help us further understand the inner essence of the giant squatting in the north of our country.

Since the New Literature Movement occurred in our country, the works of Russian writers have been continuously translated, directly and indirectly giving the Chinese literary world a decisive influence.

Young people who love Russian literature disorderly absorb these nutritious foods, but they all suffer from the inability to consistently adjust the taste, then this book has the function of supplementing these defects. In the Chinese literary world, which has not yet systematically introduced Russian literary history, and in the impoverished and barren Chinese publishing world, this book is indeed worthy of rereading and recommendation.

### The Chaos of Greece

— Translated by Meng Lin

Since March 12, when U.S. President Truman requested loans from Congress to aid Greece, this ancient nation has been the focus of world attention.

Greece is currently the only country in Europe where the left and right factions are openly fighting. In its appeal to the United Nations last year, it complained that its three communist neighbors—Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria—were providing assistance to the guerrillas in its northern mountains. In reality, hasn't the government, or rather the royalists, also received foreign aid? British troops are stationed within its borders, training the government army, wearing British-made uniforms, and using British weapons. Now, with the addition of American aid, it is practically a second Spanish Civil War!

Since being liberated from the iron heel of the Germans in October 1944, Greece has not improved; on the contrary, the situation has become even worse. Transportation is blocked, the economy is on the verge of collapse, and internal strife hinders even the simplest construction. Prisons are crammed with political prisoners, farmers cannot return to their fields, and the strong join the guerrillas.

The guerrillas entrenched in the mountains number nearly eight thousand, with about fifteen thousand villagers in contact with them. However, the government army, which claims to have one hundred thousand soldiers, actually has only fifteen thousand, and they are not skilled in mountain warfare, and their weapons are pitifully crude. Therefore, neither side engages in trench warfare, and the number of people involved in any engagement never exceeds four hundred.

Paradoxically, the Communist Party has an office and publishes a newspaper in the capital city of Athens. High-ranking leaders within the party have not been arrested and imprisoned. They explain to foreign journalists that the reason they haven't been arrested is, "This allows the Greek government to appear very democratic in the eyes of the international community."

Although the majority of the Greek people live in dilapidated houses with leaky roofs and crumbling walls, and many have no coats and walk barefoot in the snow, the families of speculators and hoarders are adorned with Parisian perfume and wear American nylon stockings!

Most merchants are short-sighted and unwilling to invest in productive enterprises. The recent import manifest for Greece does not show a single "lathe," but it does show the import of one hundred and thirty-two brand-new automobiles!

Inflation is rampant, and banknotes are overflowing. People often tear up banknotes in the street, not taking it seriously. Many goods are priced in gold coins, and even servants know to exchange their wages for gold coins. The Greek treasury has almost exhausted its reserves of these coins, and they are becoming increasingly scarce in the market because wealthy Greeks are doing their best to hoard them to preserve their wealth.

The Greek government is at its wits' end and has had to seek help from the United States.

Mr. Paul Porter, Truman's special envoy to Greece, said, "I hope that the aid funds will be strictly supervised after being handed over to the Greek government, ensuring that the beneficiaries are the majority of the Greek people, not a small number of corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants!"

### Introducing Miss Jiang Ying's Solo Recital

— Dong

Miss Jiang Ying, the third daughter of the late military strategist General Jiang Baili, studied in Western Europe for over ten years, specializing in soprano vocals. Upon the strong invitation of friends, she is scheduled to perform her first solo recital since returning to China at the Lyceum Theatre in this city at 5:15 PM on May 31st. Given Miss Jiang's musical accomplishments and her performance record abroad, the event promises to be a grand occasion.

Miss Jiang has loved music since childhood. While studying at McTyeire School, she began learning the piano. In 1936, she traveled to Europe with her father, and the following year, she entered the Berlin Conservatory of Music, studying singing under Professor Weissenborn. After graduating in the summer of 1942, she studied sacred music with the highly acclaimed modern sacred music singer, Doria Loerle, and also studied music theory at the Sullig Music Institute under Professor Berther Luger. The following year, she studied opera with Wagner opera expert, Coga, and held concerts in major European cities. Her fame spread far and wide, and she became the most renowned singer of Eastern descent in the European music scene.

Miss Jiang spent over ten years in Europe, mastering English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, and Latin. Therefore, she can thoroughly understand the essence of famous songs from various countries. When she graduated from the Berlin National Conservatory of Music in Germany, her academic evaluation read: "Her innate talent, timbre, and expression are all divine." Very few Chinese can obtain this honor. Subsequently, the Berlin German Grand Theatre repeatedly extended invitations, and she entered into a recording contract with the "Telefunken" record company. However, with the outbreak of the war, she moved to Switzerland to continue her research in "harmony."

In 1943, Miss Jiang participated in the "Lucerne" International Music Festival in Switzerland and won the championship in the singing competition organized by Hungarian acoustics master, Jlona Durigo, becoming the first person of Eastern descent to win the award. European modern violin and educator, Carl Flesh, once heard Miss Jiang sing Bach's music in a church in Switzerland and told a friend: "If no one told me she was Chinese, I would surely think she was a future king of song with unlimited prospects." Bach's music combines the essence of religion and philosophy and expresses it through music.

This performance at the Lyceum Theatre is a rare opportunity for Miss Jiang to sing for the people after returning to China. The program includes sixteen pieces from Germany, Italy, Austria, and France, as well as operas. Professor Magolinsky, former conductor of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, will be the accompanist. It is expected that she will achieve even greater success and meet the people.

### Fisherman's Pride

——Seen in the French news agency's dispatch from Spain in the May 26th edition of this newspaper, a fisherman nets a box containing ten thousand taels of gold.

Strange tale from overseas cries to be told, fisherman casts net, harvest a surprise. Only thought a big fish was struggling hard, amazed box opens, ten thousand taels of gold shining bright!

Note: Astrologers say that proper wealth is good luck, while windfall wealth is bad luck. The last three lines refer to those who fail in speculation and throw themselves into the Huangpu River.

### Serve in Office Then Trade—Miscellaneous Notes on Reading History, No. 1

— Xiao Dai

The current difficult life of ordinary civil servants is a well-known fact. But with a careful study, it is not necessarily true that all civil servants are poor. There are many who have ways to accumulate gold and US dollars. Taking advantage of their positions to do a little business has become a common practice in today's officialdom. Although the government has repeatedly ordered that civil servants shall not engage in commerce, this is only a piece of paper. Don't you see the powerful and influential opening companies and firms, and the capital of wealthy families is squeezing the economic market?

In fact, the practice of civil servants doing business dates back to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. If we were to speak in the tone of an old scholar, this could be called the "national essence." Moreover, people at that time already understood a set of rules for doing business. Their rules were: "Be optimistic about the changes of the times; therefore, when others discard, I take; when others take, I give." And "Trade goods with each other, eat the spoiled ones. Do not keep goods, dare not hoard for profit, discuss their surplus and shortage, then know the expensive and the cheap. When the expensive reaches the extreme, it will become cheap; when the cheap reaches the extreme, it will become expensive. Treat expensive goods like dung, and take cheap goods like pearls and jade. Wealth and currency should flow like water."

Compared with the operating methods of civil servants currently doing business, these methods are too outdated and cannot keep up with the times.

After doing business, it is said that one can become rich; not only can one manage the family, but also enrich the country. Let's cite two examples:

Fan Li, after avenging the shame of Kuaiji, sighed and said, "Of Ji Ran's seven strategies, Yue used five of them and was successful. Since they have been applied to the country, I want to use them at home." So he floated on the rivers and lakes in a small boat, changed his name and surname, and went to Qi, becoming Chi Yi Zi Pi;

### Words on Seal Carving

— Feng Zhong

The characters on the seals that people generally use now are mostly called seal characters. Most of what is commonly used is the Small Seal script. In fact, the characters carved on seals do not have to be all Small Seal script. Some use "Stone Script," which is the "Great Seal" script; some use "Bronze Script," which is the inscriptions on bells and tripods; and some even use "Mo Shu" (ink writing), so it is incorrect to say that half of the characters carved on seals are "Small Seal" script.

In reality, the characters on seals do not necessarily have to be "Bronze Script," "Stone Script," or "Small Seal" script, and some are slightly different. This type of seal script is called "Erroneous Seal," which is an erroneous seal script. Why are there some errors? Because seals are a private signature symbol. To prevent others from privately carving them, some errors are intentionally made as a mark.

The number of characters is increasing day by day. Although some ancient characters have died out because they are not used by later generations, later generations are still innovating new characters. Therefore, if you want to carve a seal based on ancient seal characters without any mistakes, what will you do if there are no such characters in ancient times? For example, the character "village" 村 is often used in people's names. However, according to the seal script, there is only the character "village" 邨 and no "village" 村 character. Therefore, the "village" 村 character in people's names is often used as the "village" 邨 character on seals. If someone creates another "village" 村 character based on the form of the seal script, people may laugh at it from the perspective of philology, but from the perspective of seal carving, it is nothing. Let's take the character "seal" 印 as an example. We don't need to argue for modern seal carvers. Let's just flip through the seal manuals of ancient Qin and Han bronze seals, and we can find at least ten different styles. Chinese people admire the ancients. Since the ancients said that the characters carved on seals are "Erroneous Seal" (as stated in the preface to Explaining Simple and Analyzing Compound Characters), then why should we now be critical of the seal carvers for carving the characters unreasonably?

Zhi Tao, became Duke Zhu in Tao. Duke Zhu thought that Tao was in the center of the world, and the various lords traded goods there. So he managed his property, accumulated wealth, kept up with the times, and did not demand from others. ... Within nineteen years, he amassed a thousand gold three times, and distributed it twice to poor friends and distant brothers. This is what is called the rich who love to do good deeds. Later in his old age, his descendants continued his business and rested, and eventually reached millions. Therefore, when people talk about the rich, they all call him Tao Zhu Gong."

"Zi Gong, after studying with Confucius, retired and served in Wei, depositing wealth between Cao and Lu. Among the seventy disciples, Zi Gong was the most prosperous. Yuan Xian did not dislike chaff and bran, and hid in poor alleys, while Zi Gong connected carriages with silk and brocade, and used them to hire and entertain the lords. Wherever he went, the lords of the states would treat him as an equal. Was it not Zi Gong who made Confucius famous throughout the world? This is what is called gaining power and becoming more prominent!"—(Record of Biographies of Merchants)

Fan Li accumulated vast wealth, and Zi Gong gained power and became more prominent. These are the benefits of doing business. Only that little guy Yuan Xian was willing to hide in poor alleys.

After completing the research, I feel infinite joy, because from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods to the present, this custom has not declined for thousands of years, but has become even more developed and grand, which is truly a great thing!

### Bereavement Compensation

— Liu Meng

In the "Gleanings from the Political Participation Council" in the 26th edition of Shen Bao, it was said: "Chen Gengya, who was a journalist, appealed for the colleagues who died during the Anti-Japanese War. He asked why the government gave only 30,000 yuan in bereavement compensation to Jin Huating, Zhu Xinggong, Zhang Xiaotong, and Zhang Sixu. What is that enough for?"

"What is that enough for?" Not only Chen Gengya would ask, but I also have the same question in my heart. 30,000 yuan can only buy at most one dou of rice, equivalent to about 1,000 characters of new No. 5 typesetting work, or the manuscript fee for an article of 1,000 characters. What is that enough for? Although money is the root of all evil, who can lack money? Saying that 30,000 yuan is bereavement compensation is really an exaggeration. It would be more appropriate to say that it is for buying a pen and a few pieces of paper for the orphans of the deceased.

The deceased are gone! Even if the government takes out less money as their "bereavement compensation," they will definitely not have any objections. Their willingness to risk bullets was definitely not to seek a sum of bereavement compensation from the government after death, so the item of bereavement compensation is dispensable. It is a pity that since the government is giving bereavement compensation, why is the bereavement compensation given so little? If this bereavement compensation is intended to give the loyal a kind of honor, then a certificate of merit can be competent enough, and there is no need to do this.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the number of people who sacrificed for the country, whether in the front or the rear, who are unknown, must account for the vast majority. In order to comfort the dead and encourage those who come after, I believe that we can take the example of France's "Tomb of the Unknown Soldier" and also establish one or several Tombs of the Unknown Heroes; to place the meaning of praise and commemoration... in one place, without the disadvantage of omission, just as in Catholicism there is a "All Saints' Day" to commemorate the unknown saints. Wouldn't that be good? I came to this from bereavement compensation, I don't know if it is appropriate?

### Literary and Art Circles

Playwright Li Jianwu is currently immersed in translating "The Complete Works of Molière."

He Jiahai has been away from Shanghai for many days, going to Hangzhou to recuperate. When he had a physical examination in Shanghai, the doctor said that there were problems with his stomach and intestines. So this time he went to Hangzhou, planning to stay in the temple of Taoguang to rest quietly.

### Love Meter

— Jiao

Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd: "The Times recently reported that a Danish scientist has invented a love meter. This meter is small and exquisite and can be placed in a man's pocket or a woman's handbag. It has a scale that can measure the depth of love." This is an unprecedented news item that has never been heard of, but the report does not specify whether the measured degree belongs to oneself or to the other party, which cannot but be considered a regret for the readers. If it belongs to oneself, that's fine. If this meter can measure the depth of the other party's love, I hope that this scientist will manufacture it in large quantities. Not only can he make a fortune, but he can also reduce the suicides of those infatuated people who envy mutton but the ants don't. Between men and women, they will not be manipulated by false love and fall into the sea of ​​pity and bitterness.

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Wandering like a ghost, he didn't even know how long he had been walking or what places he had passed. Finally, he felt his feet step on a pile of bricks and tiles, which felt like harder ground. He rubbed his eyes and began to look around. That's right, this was the ruins of the largest hotel in Jinchengjiang - the Railway Hotel! There were also many people resting on the broken rubble, their clothes were better than those of the other refugees in the town, but they were equally pale and emaciated.

Old Zhu's eyes seemed to catch a familiar face, but it was too unlike. That face shouldn't be so small, and it didn't let Old Zhu get a good look before quickly lowering.

It was the clothes he was wearing and the unusually short haircut that reminded Old Zhu and made him determine that this was Fatty Xu Shaoming - the general manager of Dahua Enterprise Company.

"So this guy also fell here?" Zhu Zhaonian thought to himself.

He felt a little hesitant. "Should I say hello to him?" Seeing how embarrassed he looked, not wanting to see acquaintances, why should I make him uncomfortable? But seeing him in such an unexpected situation, so embarrassed, and we are old friends, how can I turn a blind eye and not comfort him?

"Old Zhu, it's terrible! It's terrible! I'm finished!" Fatty Xu probably also knew that hiding from people like this was meaningless, so he took the initiative to walk over, sighing non-stop along the way.

Today's Fatty Xu is no longer true to his name. His face is pale, his cheeks are sunken, and the entire set of Hawaiian shirts and shorts he is wearing has also been dyed a gray color that symbolizes bad luck; when he shouted Old Zhu's name, Old Zhu could truly feel the sadness of an old ox about to enter the slaughterhouse from his voice.

At that time, Old Zhu couldn't help but ask him why he was in such a mess.

"That damned fire burned all my things, including three cars!" He was also straightforward and immediately poured out his heart: "Originally, there was also the first batch that was shipped out earlier, which had arrived in Dushan ten days ago, but my precious wife actually changed her mind and ran away with both the goods and herself! Now I'm finished! I'm finished...!"

As he said this, Xu Shaoming's tears fell like broken pearls.

"Don't be so sad! Everything is finished? That's not entirely true! At least you still have a country!" Old Zhu patted him lightly on the shoulder, unconsciously saying a set of words that Xu Shaoming absolutely didn't understand and didn't want to hear. "Although the country is dilapidated, it hasn't been destroyed to this day; as long as the country isn't destroyed, with your brother's talent, making a few more truckloads of goods is as easy as turning your hand, isn't it?"
