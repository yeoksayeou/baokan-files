[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The lists of members of the Standing Committee of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association and all members of the Investigation Committee, Propaganda Committee, and Research Committee have been submitted by all parties. They will now be sent directly to Chairman Chiang for review and then announced by order of the National Government.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The 57th meeting of the Central Standing Committee was held at 9:00 AM on the 28th in the conference room of the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters. The meeting discussed the newly added candidates from the Kuomintang for Legislative Yuan members, Control Yuan members, National Political Council members, and Standing Committee members of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association. After voting, seventeen Legislative Yuan members, nine Control Yuan members, eleven National Political Council members, and eighty-six Standing Committee members of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association were selected.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] In the preliminary lists of the China Democratic Socialist Party for the four institutions, the allocation of committee members for the various committees of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association has not been finalized. Chiang Yun-tien will take the night train to Shanghai on the 28th to consult with people in Shanghai before submitting the list to the government.

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] The National Government will take concrete steps on March 1st to end the Kuomintang's one-party rule of the past twenty years. The Executive Yuan and the National Government Committee will also be reorganized before March 15th. This will end the period of political tutelage under the Kuomintang, as Chairman Chiang has repeatedly promised.

Mr. Zuo Shunsheng Expresses His Thoughts

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Zuo Shunsheng, the propaganda director of the Chinese Youth Party, recently expressed his thoughts on the party's participation in the four government reorganization institutions. Mr. Zuo stated that since the party participated in the National Assembly to jointly formulate the Constitution, it has been determined to further jointly promote democracy and prepare for constitutional governance. This participation in the four institutions is consistent with the spirit of participating in the formulation. Among the four institutions, the National Political Council was originally a public opinion institution created during the war of resistance. Our party proposed its expansion during the Political Consultative Conference and has participated for a long time. This slight increase in the number of people needs no explanation. The Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association was originally decided by the National Assembly. Since we have participated in the National Assembly, it is natural to carry out the work we have decided. However, the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan previously had no participation from parties other than the Kuomintang. This inclusion of people outside the party shows the Kuomintang's determination to end political tutelage. The Legislative Yuan urgently needs to decide on some sub-laws in the Constitution, and it is more appropriate to participate in opinions from multiple parties. The Control Yuan's duty is to rectify officialdom and is directly related to the interests of the people. Absorbing some new viewpoints will undoubtedly help strengthen administrative efficiency. In short, we cannot recognize that the creation and adjustment of these four institutions constitutes a reorganization of the government, but it is not unrelated to the realization of democracy. This can be asserted.

### Xinjiang Ethnic Issues Can Be Resolved After Constitutional Government; Zhang Zhizhong Returns to His Post in a Week

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Zhang Zhizhong visited Chiang Yun-tien at 4:00 PM on the 28th to discuss improvements in Anhui politics. He hosted a banquet for Wu Tiecheng and other dignitaries at 7:00 PM. Mr. Zhang is scheduled to return to Xinjiang in a week.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Our reporter visited Zhang Zhizhong at his residence on the morning of the 28th and had a detailed conversation about the general situation in Xinjiang and Mr. Zhang's activities in Nanjing. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

Question: The general perception is that the Xinjiang issue is complicated, and disputes have occurred recently. What is the truth?

Answer: They have recently made two petitions, the requirements of which are roughly: (1) Regarding personnel issues, they want the authorities to replace the commissioners of certain bureaus; (2) They demand that the post office and telecommunications bureau be changed to provincial operations; (3) Regarding judicial matters, Han Chinese judges should be withdrawn, etc. However, we are determined to adopt a peaceful approach to guide them.

Question: In January of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), President Song proposed to the Soviet side opinions regarding economic negotiations in Xinjiang, but the Soviet side did not respond. During Chairman Zhang's meeting with Soviet Ambassador Petrov in Nanjing, did you exchange opinions on this matter?

Answer: Last October, the government sent a diplomatic note to the Soviet Union, but the Soviet side is still studying it.

Question: Chairman Zhang stated at a press conference that Xinjiang needs a central government subsidy of 20 billion Xinjiang currency. Has this been approved by the government?

Answer: The 20 billion yuan subsidy for development projects has not been approved, because President Song believes that all projects will be suspended. However, the monthly subsidy of 1 billion yuan has been approved.

Question: Will the implementation of the economic emergency measures have any impact on Xinjiang's finances?

Answer: It will have a significant impact.

Question: What instructions does the central government have regarding national defense policy in Xinjiang?

Answer: It is not yet possible to discuss this.

Question: What are your plans for building a new Xinjiang in the future, and how will you strengthen education, culture, economy, and other aspects of development?

Answer: There are no plans yet.

Question: What about the ethnic issues in Xinjiang? What are the details of the bloodshed that occurred in Dihua on the 25th of this month?

Answer: The 25th was still a mass conflict. Major problems in Xinjiang do not occur often, but minor problems occur frequently. By adopting the Three People's Principles and a policy of peace, tolerance, and leniency, the situation can definitely be prevented from deteriorating. After the implementation of constitutional government, ethnic autonomy and other issues may be resolved.

Question: Will you return to Nanjing in the near future?

Answer: It is currently difficult to say when I can return.

Question: Will you return to Nanjing to mediate peace talks again?

Answer: I have this hope.

Question: What are your impressions of Anhui?

Answer: My impressions of Anhui, and the conclusions I have reached, are the common situation throughout the country, namely, the decline of agriculture and forestry, and the instability of people's lives, which urgently need to be improved. I believe that reviving the countryside is the foundation for strengthening the country.

Question: What are your opinions on the political personnel in Anhui Province?

Answer: No comments. Personnel issues can be resolved when constitutional government is implemented, as all candidates will be elected by the people.

Question: What is your view on the current situation?

Answer: I am not pessimistic. All issues will be resolved peacefully.

Question: What is the progress of the Northwest Cultural Construction Association?

Answer: It is being actively prepared. In the future, it plans to run publishing, translation, film, and other cultural service businesses. This was initiated by the Northwest Headquarters and is being promoted.

### Bevin Expresses Hope in the House of Commons That China Will Recover Soon; British Undersecretary of State Says Trade With China is Difficult

[Reuters, London, 27th] Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed in the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons his sincere hope that the Chinese situation will be resolved soon, so that this great nation, which has long been a friend of the UK, can move towards recovery and prosperity. Bevin said that things like nerve warfare and civil wars are very likely to become major factors contributing to a widespread war. The confrontation of great politicians and the indulgence of force are extremely dangerous weapons in terms of the concept of world peace. He earnestly hoped that politicians would strive to avoid playing with such dangerous weapons for the sake of the people of the world, and stop encouraging them so that the dangerous situation can end. The economic and financial situation in China is deteriorating, mainly due to civil war. I earnestly hope that a solution can be found soon.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mayhew said yesterday in the House of Commons in response to a question from a member of parliament that China is on the verge of financial and economic collapse. In such an environment, trade is naturally difficult. Regarding the prospects for British trade in China, I can offer little advice.

### Overview of the Work of the Resources Committee; Qian Changzhao Reports to the Resident Committee of the National Political Council

Qian Changzhao, the chairman of the Resources Committee, reported on the overview of the committee's work over the past fourteen years at the National Political Council yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. He also clarified that the committee's main task is to follow the Principle of People's Livelihood to develop national capital, and that the biggest prerequisite for developing national capital at present is to promote the construction of basic industries, encourage the free development of legitimate private enterprises, and eliminate the harm of bureaucratic capital. At the end, Qian also presented a report on the projected output of national resources for this year and two years later. The full text is recorded below:

I am very happy to have the opportunity to report to you on the work of the Resources Committee today. Before reporting on the work, I would like to raise a few questions for your advice:

The Correct Path for Economic Construction

First, the whole world is moving forward, and we cannot go backward. There are roughly three paths for economic construction: communism, capitalism, and the Principle of People's Livelihood. Communism seems equal but is very unfree, capitalism seems free but is very unequal, and only the Principle of People's Livelihood combines freedom and equality, and there is no doubt that it is the most correct path. Developing national capital is one of the most important principles of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Its purpose is to realize the ideal of nationalizing capital and enjoying it by the masses. Unfortunately, the Constitution formulated by the National Assembly did not emphasize this. Furthermore, in terms of facts, especially regarding basic industries, private capital in our country will definitely not invest on a large scale in basic industries in the current and recent three to five years, under the circumstances of changing prices and generally high-interest rates. Moreover, foreign capital is hesitant to move forward due to unstable political and social conditions. Unless the government undertakes the responsibility of basic industrial construction with strong confidence and full perseverance, the future is unimaginable, and the original weak foundation will inevitably collapse, and talents will also be lost.

Bureaucratic Capital Harms the Cause

Second, some people in society often raise the issue of the competition between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises. In my view, our country's production is backward, and the strength of the government and the people are very limited. Each can develop freely, and there is no reason for conflict. In the future, we should divide the labor and cooperate with each other according to the entire economic construction plan. Standing on the position of state-owned enterprises, I believe that the government should fully assist all rational and enlightened private enterprises, except for those that only seek profit and disregard the interests of the country and the nation, and for those that are anti-social combinations, such as trusts and cartels, and take measures to prevent them.

Third, recently some people have confused national capital with bureaucratic capital, which is a major error. So-called bureaucratic capital is the use of bureaucratic status to develop their own private capital, which is absolutely opposite to national capital, which belongs to all the people. The harm of bureaucratic capital to state-owned enterprises is no less than its harm to private enterprises. The colleagues of the Resources Committee are very clear about this point, and I can guarantee that the persons in charge of the various enterprises will never abuse their power for personal gain.

Adjusting the Industrial and Mining Power Industry

Now let's talk about the work of the Resources Committee itself. The Huangyuan Committee was established in the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932) and has been in existence for fourteen years. The work in the first three years was limited to investigation, statistics, and planning. Starting in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), it began to run businesses. After that, it was still able to proceed smoothly according to the established steps. The War of Resistance against Japan broke out in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), and it had to change its original plan and engage in the dismantling of factories and mines in the war zone and the construction of factories and mines in the rear. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the Resources Committee built a total of 79 units in the rear, including industrial and mining industries and power industries. The distribution of all regions and the types of products were all in accordance with the needs of the War of Resistance. In the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the War of Resistance was won, and it entered the period of national construction. The focus of the Resources Committee's work was: one was the adjustment of the original industrial and mining and power industries in the rear, and the other was the takeover and reorganization of the enemy and puppet industrial and mining and power industries in the recovered areas.

The adjustment of the original industrial and mining and power industries in the rear has four principles: First, all businesses that are purely to meet wartime needs will be terminated. Second, all businesses that are purely to supply local needs will be transferred to local governments or local people for operation. Third, if the sales of a business's products decrease, but the Resources Committee still needs to continue operating it, it will be appropriately reduced. Fourth, businesses that are of the nature of important basic industries will be maintained and efforts will be made to develop them. As a result of the adjustment, a total of 15 units were terminated, a total of 24 units were transferred to local governments or local people for operation, a total of 4 units were appropriately reduced, and a total of 36 units were maintained and efforts were made to develop them.

### Communist Personnel in Nanjing and Shanghai Limited to Withdraw Before the 5th; Security Authorities Have Sent Notices Separately

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Capital Garrison Headquarters stated that communist personnel have been spreading rumors and inciting disturbances in the valley, which have greatly affected local security. Therefore, it has telegraphed the Communist Party's Nanjing Liaison Office and Delegation, ordering all personnel residing in Nanjing to withdraw completely before March 5th. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To the Communist Party's Nanjing Liaison Office and Delegation at No. 17, Meiyuan New Village: At present, your party refuses peace talks and closes the door to peace. Your party's troops are openly rebelling in various places, attacking the National Army, and your party's personnel are spreading rumors and inciting disturbances everywhere. In order to maintain local security, this Headquarters requests that your office completely withdraw all personnel residing in Nanjing before March 5th of this year, and quickly prepare a list of the names, genders, ages, native places, and positions of the current personnel stationed in Nanjing and send it to this Headquarters for escort out of the country. This is specially telegraphed for your information. Capital Garrison Headquarters, Secret Seal, February 28th."

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Commander Xuan Tiewu of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party, stating: "To the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party: It is found that your party refuses peace negotiations, creates internal strife, and incites disturbances and organizes riots in this city. The Military Mediation Department has now been dissolved. In order to ensure security, this Headquarters hereby notifies your party's personnel in Shanghai that they are required to withdraw completely before March 5th. All withdrawing personnel and their dependents are required to submit a list of names to the department for verification before March 3rd. Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu." (Note: The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party was established under the name of General Zhou Enlai's residence in May of last year.)

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] US Army Air Force planes will carry the personnel attached to the Communist Party offices in Nanjing and Shanghai to Yan'an on Sunday.

### Communist Personnel in Chongqing Also Concentrated for Withdrawal

At 10:00 AM, Commander Sun Yuanliang visited Wu Yuzhang in Huijiayan to inform him that this measure was purely based on the requests of the general public and the satisfaction of the general public afterward, and hoped that Wu and others would quickly prepare for their departure to Yan'an. The Garrison Department is determined to be responsible for the escort.

### It is Reported that the Chongqing Xinhua Daily Has Been Ordered to Cease Publication

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 8th] According to well-informed sources, the only Chinese Communist Party newspaper, "Xinhua Daily," published in the government-controlled area, has ceased publication since this morning. Communist personnel here say they have not heard of this.

### JINAN OUTSKIRTS TEMPORARILY CALM, SITUATION IN EASTERN SHANDONG BECOMES TENSE, NATIONAL ARMY ENTERS Qufu ON JINPU FRONT

[Central News Agency Qingdao 28th Dispatch] The war in Shandong has extended to eastern Shandong, but the center of gravity has not yet shifted there. Several columns of Communist troops from the north, numbering over 10,000, have been discovered southwest of Jiaoxian and northeast of Zhucheng. The National Army on the Jiaoji Railway is concentrating its forces to intercept and engage the Communist troops scattered in eastern Shandong and those fleeing north.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou 28th Dispatch] The National Army advancing north along the Jinpu Railway has united its central and flanking forces into a cohesive whole and is now advancing in a balanced manner. The central units eliminated the resistance of the Communist militia on the evening of the 28th and entered Qufu County. After occupying Feixian County, the right-wing units eliminated the remnants of the Communist New 7th Division in Liangqiu, southwest of Feixian, on the 28th. The left-wing units have reached the vicinity of Wenshang.

[Another Dispatch] To coordinate with the advance of the National Army on the main front, the National Army in western Shandong has crossed the Grand Canal and is advancing eastward. They reached the outskirts of Wenshang County at noon on the 28th and are expected to enter the city tonight. The Communist troops there are fleeing northeast.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou 28th Dispatch] The situation outside Jinan has changed. The National Army is tightening its encirclement of the Communist troops in Shandong. The National Army advancing north from Zou County recovered Qufu at 5 PM on the 28th. The Communist troops were routed and fled towards Sishui. Sishui is now under National Army control. The National Army, which recovered Qingtuosi north of Linyi on the 27th, defeated the stubborn resistance of the Communist troops and recovered Shuanghouzhen at noon on the 28th, continuing its advance towards Mengyin. There are now no large columns of Communist troops roaming in the triangular area between the Yellow River and the Grand Canal in western Shandong.

[Our Newspaper Jinan 28th Dispatch] The situation outside Jinan was quiet from the 27th to noon on the 28th. The Communist troops did not attack, and there were only minor skirmishes. However, Zhangqiu and Mingshui continued to be fiercely attacked, for no more than three reasons: (1) They know that the National Army in Jinan has increased in strength, so they are avoiding the main force and shifting their attack targets. (2) Although the areas retreated from by the National Army have been occupied by the Communist troops, the Communist troops suffered heavy casualties and need to reorganize for some time before attacking again. (3) The National Army is advancing rapidly on the Jinpu Railway, and they will inevitably increase their forces to meet the challenge.

[Our Newspaper Jinan 8th Dispatch] The situation around Qingdao and the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway is becoming tense. It is reported that since the beginning of spring, the total number of Communist troops transported from Dalian to eastern Shandong has exceeded 50,000. In recent days, another 20,000 fully armed Communist troops, some of whom are Japanese, have been transported from Dalian to Yantai, Weihai, and Penglai, where they have landed with the assistance of military personnel. In addition, four regiments of Lin Biao's troops have fled from Yantai to the Nanhezhen area south of Yexian. The 5th and 6th Divisions, along with artillery units, have fled back from Weihai to the north and south areas of Jiaoxian and Gaomi. It is generally believed that a major battle in the Qingdao area is imminent.

[Our Newspaper Jinan 28th Dispatch] After inflicting heavy blows on the Communist troops, the National Army at Longshan Station on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway retreated to Guodian Military Station on the 27th and is continuing to inflict blows on the Communist troops. Furthermore, although the National Army outside Jinan is still facing off against the Communist troops on the line of Huanghe, Yancheng, Guodian, Zhonggong, Xiying, Jiujiahua, and Changji on the 28th, it has established contact with the National Army north of Taian and Yuncheng. It is expected that the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Jinpu Railway will be cleared soon.

### PORTUGAL RELINQUISHES PRIVILEGES, EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTRY IS NEGOTIATING

### Overview of the Resources Committee's Work, Continued from Page One

Principles for Reorganizing Enemy and Puppet Industries

There are also four principles for receiving and reorganizing enemy and puppet industries and power enterprises in recovered areas: First, takeover operations should avoid being piecemeal, and should be limited to important basic industries and those that the government deems must be taken over by the Resources Committee. Second, takeover operations should consolidate similar industries in adjacent areas, concentrating manpower and financial resources for unified management. Third, takeover operations should adopt a company system as much as possible. Fourth, the goal of takeover operations is to quickly restore production. As a result of the reception and reorganization, there are a total of nineteen units in the nine northeastern provinces. Because these units were dismantled and relocated by the Soviet Union and damaged by the Communist Party, although work is gradually resuming, active replenishment is still needed. In Taiwan, there are a total of seven units jointly operated by the Resources Committee and the Administrative Governor's Office, and three units exclusively operated by the Resources Committee. During the war, each unit was bombed by Allied aircraft, with average losses ranging from 30% to 60-70%. Except for the copper mine and aluminum industries, which are still in the planning stage, the rest have resumed production. There are a total of twenty-six units in North China, Central China, and South China. Except for coal and steel, where three units are still in the planning stage, the rest have resumed production.

1947 Production Estimates

The Resources Committee was ordered to reorganize and report directly to the Executive Yuan in April of last year. It currently has a total of ninety-five units, with more than 250,000 employees. Each enterprise is moving towards corporatization, adopting a company system as much as possible in its organization, and striving for scientific management. Vertically, responsibility is divided at each level to eliminate the drawbacks of being too large to manage or top-heavy; horizontally, cooperation is strengthened to achieve the benefits of division of labor and cooperation. In terms of technology, the hope is to catch up, both by hiring foreign experts to assist in China and by sending personnel abroad to study. Now, let me briefly mention the estimated output of each enterprise in 1947: (1) Electricity: 724,859 kilowatts. (2) Coal: 7.4 million tons. (3) Steel: 99,000 tons of iron and 106,000 tons of steel products. (4) Petroleum: 22.83 million gallons of gasoline, 9 million gallons of kerosene, and 310 million gallons of diesel fuel. (5) Metal ores: 7,500 tons of tungsten sand, 5,000 tons of antimony, 2,650 tons of tin, 2,300 tons of copper, 660 tons of lead, 60 tons of zinc, 4,200 tons of aluminum, 12,500 taels of gold, and 100,000 taels of silver. (6) Machinery: 6,000 horsepower of power machinery, 110 machine tools, 2,000 tons of operating machinery and parts, 10 locomotives, 480 freight cars, 2,000 tons of shipbuilding, and 150,000 tons of ship repair. (7) Electrical engineering: 100,400 horsepower of electrical machinery, 47,800 kilovolt-amperes of transformers, 117,400 coils of electrical wire, 300 transmitters and receivers, and 2.5 million insulators. (8) Chemicals: 31,000 tons of acids and bases, 57,600 tons of fertilizer, and 2.5 million gallons of power alcohol. (9) Cement: 340,000 tons. (10) Sugar: 100,000 tons. (11) Paper: 27,000 tons. The total production value for 1947 is estimated to be approximately 2,350 billion yuan, of which approximately US$20 million can be exported to earn foreign exchange. In the future, reconstruction work can utilize Japanese compensation equipment and seek to purchase equipment from abroad. As long as the situation is relatively stable, it should not be difficult to complete the initial stages by the end of next year, and production should be greatly increased starting the year after, with a large portion being completely self-sufficient.

1949 Possible Targets

Here are the targets for 1949 that are more likely to be achieved, for reference: (1) Electricity: 1.1 million kilowatts. (2) Coal: 15.3 million tons. (3) Steel: 500,000 tons of iron and 500,000 tons of steel products. (4) Petroleum: 182 million gallons of gasoline, 51 million gallons of kerosene, and 109 million gallons of diesel fuel. (5) Metal ores: 11,000 tons of tungsten, 10,500 tons of antimony, 5,700 tons of tin, 2,500 tons of copper, 4,000 tons of lead, 200 tons of zinc, 18,000 tons of aluminum, 57,000 taels of gold, and 255,000 taels of silver. (6) Machinery: 40,000 horsepower of power machinery, 2,000 machine tools, 10,000 tons of operating machinery and parts, 72 locomotives, 2,000 freight cars, 110,000 tons of shipbuilding, and 1.3 million tons of ship repair. (7) Electrical engineering: 440,000 horsepower of electrical machinery, 450,000 kilovolt-amperes of transformers, 760,000 coils of electrical wire, 2,600 transmitters and receivers, 6 million insulators, and 150,000 radio receivers. (8) Chemicals: 120,000 tons of acids and bases, 260,000 tons of fertilizer, and 13.32 million gallons of power alcohol. (9) Cement: 1.7 million tons. (10) Sugar: 600,000 tons. (11) Paper: 60,000 tons.

Slight Surplus in Past Revenue and Expenditure

In summary, the importance of state-owned industries and power enterprises in national production can be seen. The Resources Committee's expenditure, on average over the years, is less than 2% of the total national budget, which is insufficient for developing basic industries. At a time when the country's finances are difficult, we can only do our best to promote state-owned enterprises within the scope of what is possible. The original purpose was not to make profits, but the revenue and expenditure over the years have been able to offset each other, with a slight surplus, all of which has been turned over to the treasury. Although this provides a basis for the development of state capital as indicated by the Principle of People's Livelihood, it is still far behind the advanced countries of the world. It is imperative to establish an economic policy centered on production and to coordinate financial and monetary policies with it, so that it can flourish and complete the task that basic industries should have in national construction. I hope that you gentlemen will give us more guidance and assistance. (End)

### Luo Junqiang's Treason Case Concluded After Trial; Still Attempting to Evade Responsibility After Being Interrogated for the Fourth Time Yesterday; Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 6th

[Nanjing, February 28th, this newspaper] Luo Junqiang, the traitor, was interrogated for the fourth time at 10:00 a.m. on the 28th, and still attempted to evade responsibility for everything he had done in the past. After the closing arguments began, Luo recited his prepared defense statement, filled with phrases such as "eager to serve the country" and "my heart can be judged by heaven and earth," which were chilling to hear. When he read the line "a broken heart harbors other feelings," laughter could be heard in the courtroom. Later, lawyer Duanmu Kai also stood up to defend him, hoping for a lenient sentence. The arguments concluded at 12:30 p.m., and the court announced that sentencing would be on March 6th.

Today's trial of Luo was presided over by Judge Luo Yunxie of the Second Criminal Court of the Nanjing High Court, with judges Ge Zhaotang and Li Huaian serving as jurors. After the court was convened, various pieces of evidence were examined. Luo not only refused to admit to the various corrupt practices during his tenure as chairman of the puppet Anhui Provincial Government, but also considered them to be "virtuous policies" that benefited the people, speaking with a sense of pride. Subsequently, prosecutor Wang Wenjun detailed Luo's various crimes, arguing that Luo had held important positions in the government during the early stages of the war of resistance, yet shamelessly served the enemy, which was unforgivable. Luo then responded with ten reasons, shifting responsibility and arguing that although he had "mingled with" the collaborators, he had not been "tainted" by them. Lawyers Wang Shanxiang and Duanmu Kai also successively defended Luo from the perspectives of law and human sentiment. Wang argued that Luo was only a mid-level official in the puppet government and not a key figure, requesting a lenient sentence of life imprisonment, and pointed out that Luo had assisted in the war of resistance, hoping for a reduced sentence. Duanmu Kai, in his dual capacity as defense counsel and friend of Luo, explained that Luo had been extremely patriotic during the early stages of the war of resistance, and although he later left Chongqing due to personal reasons, he had absolutely no prior plan to join the puppet government. Luo's various actions after joining the puppet regime could prove that he "had no intention of colluding with the enemy, but rather had the reality of opposing the enemy." Finally, prosecutor Wang sternly refuted the arguments, and the closing arguments concluded. The court announced that sentencing would be on March 6th.

### Tragedy in Fancheng While抢领购盐凭证; Six People Trampled to Death, Fourteen Injured

Editorial

### The Deadline for the Withdrawal of CCP Personnel

The government has already instructed security agencies across the country to pay close attention to the safety of the personnel of the CCP offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing as they return to Yan'an before March 5th. The local garrison headquarters has also received this instruction and formally notified the Shanghai CCP office yesterday. The issue of the withdrawal of CCP personnel arose long ago after the United States announced the abandonment of its mediation efforts. However, the government authorities have repeatedly tolerated this, hoping that the CCP would one day see the light and lay down their arms. Therefore, there has been no concrete decision made on this matter. However, over the past month, the CCP bandits have rejected any restoration of peace talks, and have launched large-scale offensives on all fronts, from northern Jiangsu to southern Shandong, and from southern Shandong to central Shandong, almost launching a full-scale rebellion. In recent days, the Northeast is also brewing a large-scale battle. This terrible trend is sufficient to prove that the current CCP problem is no longer a party dispute. The wars in central Shandong and the Northeast are by no means conflicts between the CCP and the KMT, but rather a rebellion by the CCP that endangers the country. Therefore, the CCP today is no longer comparable to an ordinary political party, and cannot enjoy the rights that a legitimate political party should enjoy in politics. If the CCP is not a legitimate political party, how can the personnel of the CCP offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing be allowed to remain in place?

Let us review the various activities carried out by the CCP personnel in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, and it will not be difficult to see that these CCP personnel are simply engaged in activities that harm the country and the people. The government allowed the CCP to establish offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing in order to facilitate peace talks. However, in reality, the establishment of the CCP offices in the three cities has not only been unhelpful to the peace talks, but has been harmful. During the process of the peace talks, the CCP offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing have almost become the CCP's main base for launching propaganda warfare, with inaccurate reports and irresponsible remarks, doing everything possible to maliciously slander the government, and even obstructing the progress of the peace talks. All of these have been released from these three offices. After the peace talks stalled, the work of these three offices has become even more active. Taking Shanghai as an example, the work of the CCP personnel has always focused on the following two goals: (1) Inciting labor unrest to plunge society into a state of chaos, thereby suppressing the people's morale. When workers can no longer be used, they change their tactics and use "patronizing domestic goods" as a smokescreen, attempting to incite anti-American sentiment among the public. The incident at the Trade Union Building was created in this environment. (2) Disrupting the financial system and accelerating the bankruptcy of the national economy in order to achieve their goal of "promoting the collapse of the domestic economy." The CCP's forces, mixed in with the recent surge in gold prices and stirring up trouble, are also considerable. This newspaper's editorial has long pointed out that this gold rush contains political factors, which refers to the CCP. In order to ensure local peace and stability and the well-being of the people, how can the government allow CCP personnel to continue to undermine security and disrupt the financial system within the government's jurisdiction?

The national policy adopted by the government after the victory has been repeatedly declared by our national leader. In short, it is peaceful unification. This is also what our people have been yearning for day and night. However, peace must be complete, and unification must be even more complete. In the past, in order to achieve domestic peace and unification, the government did not hesitate to compromise and negotiate with the CCP, always hoping to resolve the CCP issue peacefully through political means. However, after more than a year of repeated concessions, the CCP has still failed to wake up from its delusions, resulting in talks and fights, fights and talks, and wasting more than a year's time. In the end, the peace talks stalled and could not be resumed. Although the government still hopes that the CCP can come to its senses, put down its arms, and achieve peace throughout the country, it must faithfully fulfill its responsibilities to the nation and the people when the CCP remains obstinate. At present, the CCP is not only attempting to seize territory by force, but also harbors the ambition to seize power by force. The government cannot fail to take decisive measures to achieve the early realization of domestic peace and unification. Therefore, the national army is on the front lines, whether in northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, central Shandong, western Shandong, eastern Shandong, or northern Shandong, and will resolutely strike back against any offensives launched by the CCP in order to shatter the CCP's delusions of seizing power by force. The regaining of Linyi is the best lesson for warmongers. Now that the situation has developed to this point, the government naturally does not need to shy away from seeking domestic peace and unification through military force. Emergency measures have been implemented in the economy; it is also necessary to implement other important measures in the military, especially regarding the deployment of troops, which cannot be openly left to CCP personnel to gather intelligence. Moreover, most of the CCP personnel are skilled intelligence workers, and cannot be allowed to remain within the government's jurisdiction.

From the above, it goes without saying that CCP personnel should return to Yan'an from Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. However, the CCP spokesperson in Yan'an has also made a statement on this issue: "The establishment and existence of the CCP offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing were previously requested by the government and the United States, and permitted by the government. Their task is to liaise with various parties at home and abroad, including the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Unless the government decides that it will no longer negotiate from now on and formally notifies the CCP to withdraw these agencies, or the CCP decides to withdraw them, there is no reason to cancel them." The CCP spokesperson's statement seems plausible on the surface, but it is actually a great error. First, the restoration of peace talks is deadlocked due to the CCP's refusal. Since the CCP is unwilling to negotiate with the government, what is the use of leaving this liaison agency? Second, the battles on the front lines are all caused by the CCP's offensives. Since the CCP is determined to seize power by force, it loses its status as a legitimate political party and cannot retain its offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, nor can it enjoy the rights that a legitimate political party should enjoy. The Beijing Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and the Farmers' Association recently issued a declaration demanding that the government prohibit CCP personnel from enjoying human rights. Third, the United States' abandonment of its mediation efforts is also the inevitable result of the CCP's anti-American movement. The Military Mediation Department has long been closed, and the CCP no longer needs to liaise with various parties at home and abroad.

In short, the government has always been lenient towards CCP personnel and can be said to have exhausted all means of tolerance. CCP personnel must know that a political party that resorts to armed rebellion and harms the country and the people has no legal standing in any democratic country. Now, the Nationalist government can still take into account the safety of CCP personnel, and although they are limited to returning to Yan'an before March 5th, they are still being protected, which can be said to be extremely lenient. Therefore, we hope that CCP personnel can also understand the government's good intentions, and when withdrawing, do not engage in destructive actions that harm our people.

### White House Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss Foreign Policy "Big Stick"; Foreign Policy and Congressional Leaders Participate

[This newspaper] San Francisco, February 28th broadcast: President Truman convened his foreign policy advisors and key members of Congress in a secret meeting yesterday, sparking widespread speculation that the meeting was in preparation for a global foreign policy decision. All participants in the meeting swore to secrecy, demonstrating the importance of the meeting.

[United Press International, Washington, February 27th] President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall held a highly secretive meeting with congressional leaders at the White House today to discuss the United States' foreign policy. It is rumored that Truman solemnly pointed out to Republican and Democratic congressional leaders that Marshall needs to carry a "big stick" when attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. It is understood that all those attending the White House meeting solemnly pledged not to divulge the details of today's meeting beyond the broadest issues. However, based on Truman's invitation to Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to attend today's meeting, it is widely believed that defense spending was within the scope of discussion. It is rumored that Truman believes that China's recent budget dispute may lead to speculation by the Soviet Union that the United States has exposed weaknesses in its army and navy plans. According to reliable sources, Truman explained the subtlety of the Moscow meeting to those in attendance and the necessity of avoiding excessive cuts in army and navy budgets. According to Senator Vandenberg, the meeting was merely a broad discussion of foreign policy issues and European issues included in the Foreign Ministers Conference. When asked by reporters whether he was optimistic about the Foreign Ministers Conference, Vandenberg replied, "I have said all I can say, no more."

Pay Attention to the Situation in Greece

[This newspaper] San Francisco, February 28th broadcast: President Truman held a secret meeting with congressional leaders yesterday, with the focus of discussion being how to support Greece in resisting the intrusion of Soviet forces. The reason is that Britain is currently unable to support Greece alone and will inevitably withdraw its troops stationed in Greece. Last year, Britain spent 60 million pounds in Greece, but due to domestic economic difficulties, it will be forced to abandon its interests in Greece. It is widely believed that if the United States does not continue to support Greece after Britain, then this only Balkan country that has not been invaded by Soviet forces will inevitably be forced to break away from Western democracy.

### Bevin Plans to Propose Four-Power Pact to Maintain European Peace at Foreign Ministers Conference

[United Press, London, February 27th] The House of Commons began its foreign policy debate today, with Foreign Secretary Bevin reviewing general foreign policy issues. It is said that Britain is eager to establish a four-nation pact to maintain peace in Europe. This issue will be discussed at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, and Britain will support the United States' proposal to conclude a four-nation pact for a period of 25 years to ensure the disarmament of Germany. Although the United States and Britain have had misunderstandings over the Palestine issue, they remain united, and the relationship between the United States and Britain is extremely close. Britain will not allow any force to intrude and harm the relations between the two countries. As for the Anglo-French alliance, it is hoped that it will be signed soon. According to reliable sources in Paris, Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault are scheduled to sign the agreement next Wednesday at a location on the French coast. The proposal for the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom to conclude a 25-year mutual assistance agreement was put forward by former US Secretary of State Byrnes at a peace conference last April. It stipulates that the four powers will continue to occupy Germany for 25 years after the current military occupation of Germany ends. Bevin said that this proposal should be included in the agenda of the Moscow conference. It is truly remarkable that the United States is so closely involved in maintaining peace in Europe. Britain's policy towards Germany seeks local decentralization and economic unity.

First Batch of British Representatives Depart for Moscow

[Reuters, London, February 27th] The first group of twelve members of the Moscow delegation left London by special plane today for Moscow to make arrangements. Foreign Secretary Bevin will lead the remaining hundred members of his entourage, along with twenty British and foreign journalists, and fifteen members of the US delegation, to cross the sea from Calais, France, and take a special train through Belgium, Germany, and Poland.

### Argentina Plans to Convene Antarctic Conference

Argentina's most recent note reiterated the country's previous stance, while the United Kingdom, citing its initial discovery of the islands, declared its continued occupation.

### Qiu Weng Warns That the British Empire is Wavering

[United Press, London, 28th] Gil, speaking at a political gathering of businessmen today, emphatically stated, "My empire is now wavering." He urged the business community to do everything possible to bring the Labor government to a "swift end."

### Handling of Palestine Issue Awaits Agreement with Britain

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 27th] Regarding the United Kingdom's proposal to convene a special session of the United Nations to discuss the Palestine issue, United Nations Secretary-General Lie has informed the British government of material difficulties. The British government immediately responded, deciding within two weeks whether to convene a special session. It is generally believed that the British government may decide to wait until the United Nations General Assembly convenes in September of this year before submitting the Palestine issue for discussion at the General Assembly.

### Ruhr Industrial Area: War's Root Lies Dormant

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 28th] Robert, Deputy Governor of the British occupation forces in Germany, recently told the press: The Ruhr area, in terms of its structure, may always become a source of war. Currently, there are 1.5 million tons of coal in Ruhr coal mines. British authorities hope to use this coal to supplement Germany's almost completely destroyed industrial equipment.

### Greece Demands Annexation of Cyprus Island

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 28th] The Greek Political Committee recently decided to request that Parliament vote on annexing the island of Cyprus to Greece. Cyprus is a British island territory in the Mediterranean.

### "Ambassador Spy" Case in Poland: Three Main Culprits Executed

Implicates British Ambassador to Poland, Bentinck

[Reuters, Warsaw, 27th] The main culprits in the sensational "Ambassador Spy" case, Grocholski, Bakzak, and Barycki, were executed today by firing squad. President Bierut refused to grant clemency to the three convicts. The defendants were accused of acting as liaisons between a certain foreign ambassador and the Polish underground movement. That ambassador was the British Ambassador, Bentinck. Mr. Bentinck has already been transferred to another position and is scheduled to leave Poland next week.

### Purge of Japanese News Media: Allied Headquarters to Strictly Enforce

[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] Allied Headquarters spokesman Mr. Macken stated at a press conference for Japanese journalists today: They cannot hope for lenient punishment for unnecessary Japanese journalists. Headquarters will strictly enforce the purge movement because these individuals are elements who betrayed the Japanese people and hindered the progress of democracy.

### France's Post-War Population Decreases by Over One Million

[Agence France-Presse, Paris Airmail] According to a survey conducted on March 10, 1946, the total population of France is 40,517,923, a decrease of over 1,389,000 compared to ten years ago. The populations of the largest cities have all decreased; Marseille decreased by 30%, and Paris decreased by 4%.

### Britain Accuses Albania of Laying Mines: Security Council Establishes Investigation Team

[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] The United Nations Security Council decided today to establish a three-nation team to investigate Britain's accusation against Albania of laying mines. Prior to this, there was a two-hour debate on whether the Soviet Union could exercise its veto power. The voting result was nine to zero against the veto, with the Soviet Union and Poland abstaining.

Immediately after the vote, the organization of the team was discussed, which took another hour. Finally, Australia, Colombia, and Poland were designated to form the team. The Soviet Union insisted that Poland should participate in the team. Soviet representative Gromyko argued that establishing the team was a matter of substance, not procedure, so the veto power should be exercised, but no one seconded the motion. Gromyko finally stated that he would waive the right to vote but insisted on retaining the right to object. The team should submit a report on the investigation by the 10th of next month. The team is scheduled to meet on the 30th of next month. Representatives from Colombia and Poland stated that the case is likely to be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for adjudication. Britain accuses Albania of laying mines in the Corfu Strait, causing two British destroyers to be damaged by mines on October 22 of last year. Britain demanded an apology and compensation, but Albania ignored it, so Britain filed a complaint with the Security Council.

### Municipal Government to Reduce Staff by Half Based on Organization Regulations Passed by the Executive Yuan: Municipal Council Resolves to Telegraph President Song, Stating Further Contraction is Difficult, Requests Dispatch of Personnel for Inspection Before Making a Decision

The organizational regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Government have been passed by the Executive Yuan. According to reliable sources, the formal order has not yet arrived at the Municipal Government. The amended new organizational regulations have been brought to Shanghai by personnel from the capital. According to reporter inquiries, the content of the amended organizational regulations involves reorganizing the original eight bureaus and six departments of the Municipal Government into nine bureaus and three departments. Among the nine bureaus, in addition to the original eight bureaus of Finance, Social Affairs, Public Works, Public Utilities, Land Administration, Police, Education, and Health, the Civil Affairs Department will be reorganized into the Civil Affairs Bureau. Among the original six departments, only the Secretariat, Statistics, and Accounting Departments will be retained, in addition to the Civil Affairs Department being reorganized into a bureau. The Personnel Department is stipulated to be reorganized into a Personnel Office. The Information Department has no legal basis and will be abolished. It is also stipulated that there will be four to six councilors. As for the bureaus, it is stipulated that there will be no deputy directors or commissioners, and the administration will be changed to a two-level system, abolishing the establishment of departments. Each bureau is stipulated to have three to five sections directly under the control of the bureau director. Each bureau is only allowed to have one secretary holding a senior position, with the rest holding recommended positions. According to the current Municipal Government and the original number of personnel in each bureau, there are 3,354 people, including 125 holding senior positions, 680 holding recommended positions, 2,016 holding appointed positions, and 533 employees. If the new organizational regulations are followed, more than half of the staff will be reduced, especially those holding senior and recommended positions. Moreover, the original number of sections in each bureau ranges from 14 in the most to 6 in the least. If the regulations for downsizing and merging are followed, there will also be many mergers.

[Another Report] The detailed situation of the new organizational regulations of the Municipal Government is as follows: The original number of personnel in the Municipal Government and each bureau is more than 3,300. After the reduction and merger, only more than 1,900 people can be retained. The original 120 sections will be reduced and merged into 48 sections. Among them, only more than 500 section members can be retained from the original 900. Currently, the number of personnel in each bureau ranges from more than 270 to more than 470, but the new organizational regulations limit the number to just over 100. The number of secretaries must not exceed four at most.

[Our Report] During the 68th municipal council meeting held by the Municipal Government yesterday morning, the Executive Yuan's routine meeting passed the contraction of the city's municipal district as reported in the newspapers, and medical issues were discussed. According to relevant sources, during the meeting, everyone believed that the central government could not clearly understand the actual situation in the locality. The Municipal Government's establishment had been contracted again and again. The work of each bureau and department was very busy. If the reduction was carried out according to the central government's regulations, the work would not be able to proceed, and there would only be a collective resignation. Later, Mayor Wu stated that the Municipal Government had not yet received the official document, and opinions could be submitted to the Executive Yuan. It was decided yesterday to immediately telegraph President Song, stating that since Mayor Wu took office, the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government had been greatly contracted compared to before. Later, the Council decided to hold a meeting, and it was reduced by 80%. During the second meeting of the Council, there was a proposal for contraction. The Municipal Government had difficulties in fact, so it asked the Council to send personnel to inspect the Municipal Government in person. The result was that there was no room for further contraction. Therefore, although the Executive Yuan had passed the draft for reduction, please consider the special circumstances of Shanghai and the economic turmoil and social disorder in recent days, and reserve it. Please also ask the Executive Yuan to send personnel to Shanghai for on-site inspection before making a final decision.

Moreover, reporters visited various relevant parties yesterday and stated that the Executive Yuan's official document had not yet arrived at the Municipal Government, and this news may not be completely reliable, especially the abolition of the Personnel Department and the Secretariat. According to Article 83 of the Constitution, the duties of the Personnel Department include examination, qualification, performance appraisal, grade salary, promotion, security, commendation, bereavement, retirement, and old-age care. The work is already very busy at ordinary times. After the establishment of the Public Employee Food Ration Committee, the work will be doubled, and it is difficult to reduce it. According to the current organization of the Municipal Government, each bureau has a personnel office, and each affiliated agency has a personnel administrator. If the current Personnel Department is reduced to a Personnel Office, and the Personnel Office of each bureau is reduced to a Personnel Administrator, what will the Personnel Administrator of the current affiliated agency be called? Moreover, the Municipal Government's Personnel Department was previously submitted to the Examination Yuan and forwarded to the National Government for record, which is directly under the central government, and it seems impossible to abolish it.

### Economic Investigation Network Begins Operations: Four Agencies Responsible for Comprehensive Monitoring; General Report on Thorough Investigation of Gold Rush to be Drafted

[Our Report] The Economic Supervision Group's thorough investigation of the gold rush officially ended yesterday. The entire blacklist and general work report have also been drafted. Special personnel will be dispatched to the capital to submit them to Chairman Chiang for review. The number and identity of the people on the blacklist cannot be released until the Chairman approves them. However, it is reported that more than 40 people are listed on the list. The list details how the individuals engaged in speculation and manipulation and is accompanied by reliable evidence. It is unknown whether there are any "big tigers" involved. According to related sources, there are fewer than 10 people who are qualified as "tigers." By their identity, most of them are "officials and businessmen intertwined" or have strong backgrounds. There are also some pure civil servants, including Zhao Pei, the director of the Qinghai Provincial Government's office in Beijing. There are no soldiers. The highest amount of speculation and manipulation is said to be no more than 5,000 taels. How these people will be dealt with in the future will be executed by the Songhu Garrison Command upon order.

The Economic Supervision Group will no longer be used in name from today, but the economic supervision work will continue to be carried out. The only difference is that the centralized public activities will be transformed into a secret "economic investigation network" that is scattered and dense, and each unit forming the Economic Supervision Group will be responsible separately. In the future, the city's economic supervision work will be carried out in four aspects: (1) Yu Chao's affairs will be the responsibility of the police bureau. (2) The factory side will be the responsibility of the Garrison Command. (3) The bank and money house side will be the responsibility of the Central Statistics Bureau. (4) The general price aspect will be the responsibility of the Military Statistics Bureau. If anyone is found to be engaged in speculation, manipulation, and hoarding, they will be dealt with by the Garrison Command.

[Another Report] After the end of the Economic Supervision Group, the unfinished matters concerning the investigation of production loans to various manufacturers will be continued by the Ministry of Finance and the Four Allied Headquarters. As for Sun Zixin, the owner of Xinda Yarn House, who was ordered to be wanted by the Economic Supervision Group, it is said that he has fled to Hong Kong to hide. In addition, the Huangzhong Company purchased gold bars from "Tongfeng" House, which was mistakenly recorded as "Tongfengyu" yesterday.

### Economic Supervision Group Announces End; Commander Xuan Issues Statement

The work of the Municipal Economic Supervision Group to suppress past financial turmoil has come to an end today. The name of the Supervision Group has also been cancelled. From now on, the Songhu Garrison Command will be responsible for directing the military and police at any time to assist in the effective implementation of the economic emergency plan and prevent the recurrence of economic turmoil. The reporter asked Commander Xuan Tiewu about the work of the Economic Supervision Group in the past ten days, and he gave a statement as follows: "Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and a slight move can affect the whole body. The central government decided to take action because the price of gold bills was stimulating a general rise in prices, which was a phenomenon created since the victory. At that time, people were panicked and unable to live in peace, as if a great disaster was about to come. The Japanese took the security as a matter of concern and immediately ordered the police and constitution to conduct strict investigations. Then, they received the Chairman's instructions to thoroughly investigate speculators, manipulators, and hoarders. In a few days, the economic emergency plan was promulgated. With the efforts of all parties, the prices in this city gradually returned to normal. All the colleagues who participated in the economic supervision work worked hard day and night and made some achievements. As of today, the work can be said to have come to an end. From now on, the military and police agencies in this city can still be responsible for promoting the methods stipulated in the price control and economic emergency plan. As for the person in charge of this turmoil, the bank and money house side will continue to be thoroughly investigated by the Ministry of Finance, and the production loan part will be responsible for investigating the Central Bank's Audit Department. The rest who are found to have major suspicions can be reported to the higher authorities for approval today on a special case basis. In short, the unfinished work of this group has been continued by the competent authorities, and there is no need to continue to exist, so it is appropriate to end it in time. I sincerely hope that the emergency plan promulgated by the central government will be actively promoted, and there will be no more financial turmoil or price stimulus to stabilize people's livelihood."

### Zheng Jiemin Visits Mayor Wu

General Zheng Jiemin, who was ordered by the central government to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the gold rush, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at around 11:00 a.m. yesterday for half an hour. The inspection work of the gold rush case has come to an end, and General Zheng will return to the capital to report. According to relevant sources, Zheng's visit to Mayor Wu was to say goodbye to Mayor Wu.

### Taishan Stock Purchases and Hoards Gold Bills; Transferred to District Procuratorate Yesterday Morning

[Our Report] Taishan Stock was found to have purchased and hoarded more than 80 gold bars and more than 20,000 US dollars by the Economic Supervision Group and was transferred to the District Procuratorate yesterday morning on charges of disrupting finance. The prosecutor will summon its manager Chen Keda to the case for interrogation.

### Shipping Industry Plans to Adjust Freight Rates; Sends Representatives to Petition in the Capital

The Shanghai Shipowners Association convened a general meeting of members the day before yesterday to discuss ways to save the shipping industry crisis. A unanimous decision was made: (1) to implement comprehensive joint operations, coordinate the allocation of routes, and thoroughly save shipping costs; (2) to adjust freight rates to maintain special shipping costs, and to send representatives to the capital to explain the actual difficulties and the necessity of adjusting freight rates to the Ministry of Communications and the Executive Yuan. The representatives left for the capital last night. At the same time, Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the state-run China Merchants Bureau, and Hu Shiyuan, the deputy general manager, have also been summoned to the capital to report on the actual situation of the shipping industry.

### Gasoline Panic Eliminated; Rationing Temporarily Suspended

[Our Report] Because the supply and demand of gasoline at gas stations in this city was abnormal, Asia, Mobil, and Texaco decided to adopt a quota distribution system at the request of the Public Utilities Bureau. All vehicle owners in the city were notified to register from February 22, and it was originally scheduled to be implemented today. Now: The gasoline panic has been eliminated, and there are fewer congested gas stations. Therefore, with the consent of the Public Utilities Bureau, the oil company authorities have decided to temporarily suspend the old rationing method. Currently, it can still be freely filled, but all applications for registration will be retained so that they can be implemented at any time if a panic occurs again.

### Emergency Measures to Ban Opium; This City Strictly Implements

Chairman Chiang is very concerned about the opium ban in Beijing and Shanghai and has issued a severe order. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Municipal Government ordered the police bureau to discuss seven emergency measures with Liu, the special commissioner for opium suppression from the Ministry of Interior: (1) Those who have not been investigated among the registered opium addicts will be summoned by the police bureau for investigation. (2) The Health Bureau will announce the list of hospitals responsible for opium addiction investigations. (3) Those who still need opium detoxification after investigation will be sent to the court for severe punishment. (4) Order each police sub-bureau to step up the detection of opium addicts and opium trafficking agencies. (5) The police bureau will consult with military and constitutional personnel to strengthen inspections at land, sea, and air terminals to prevent opium from being transported. (6) The Civil Affairs Department will order the chiefs of districts, guarantees, and captains to seriously review and thoroughly report. (7) The public is welcome to report, and generous bonuses will be given. According to Fang Zhichao, director of the Administrative Department of the Municipal Police Bureau and chief executive of the Opium Eradication Association of this city: The above methods have been separately ordered to be implemented.

### Telephone Collection of Telegrams to be Trialed Today: Limited to Current Fee Telegrams for Now

The International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications in this city has been ordered to trial the business of notifying and collecting telegrams by telephone from today. Senders who live in fixed locations can notify the station to send personnel to collect urgent, ordinary, and slow current fee international telegrams by dialing 1120 between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. every day. Accounting telegrams will not be applicable to the telephone notification and collection method for the time being. In addition, in order to facilitate the sending of telegrams by the public, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has also been ordered to trial the "telephone notification and collection of telegrams" from today. If the public wants to send telegrams, they can notify the General Business Office of the bureau at No. 70 Fuzhou Road (telephone 13059) of their address (domestic telegrams are temporarily limited to the current fee urgent telegrams and express telegrams) by telephone. The office will assign an external telegraphic assistant to come to the address to collect the telegram, and all fees payable will be calculated and collected by the telegraphic assistant on the spot, and a telegram receipt will be issued.

### Taxi Prices: 9,000 Yuan for 20 Minutes; Tram and Bus Prices Have Not Increased

[Our Report] According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, he told reporters: It is absolutely not true that trams and buses will collectively increase prices by themselves from today. Public utilities are not allowed to adjust prices without the approval of the bureau.

Various taxi companies have increased prices by 100% without authorization, from 6,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan per 20 minutes. From today, the bureau will strictly ban it. The Public Utilities Bureau has approved taxi prices to increase by 50% from March 1, charging 9,000 yuan per 20 minutes.

### Director Wu's Statement: Hoping Citizens Will Overcome Difficulties Together

A Vicious Cycle of Prices and Wages Must Be Suppressed Simultaneously; This is the Only Measure to Avoid an Unprecedented Crisis

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, recently made a statement on the issue of prices and wages, with some elaboration. The original words are as follows:

The central government has formulated an economic emergency plan and stipulated that it will be strictly implemented in Beijing and Shanghai. In this plan, the points concerning prices, wages, and the supply of daily necessities are within the scope of the bureau's responsibility in the Shanghai area. I will further explain it again.

The increase in prices is due to the lack of materials. The formation of the lack of materials is due to the fact that the order has not been fully stabilized, resulting in inconvenient transportation and difficult transportation, and goods cannot flow freely. This is the most important reason. On the other hand, because of the abundance of hot money, speculators manipulate and fuel the increase in prices. In the industrial sector, because of the increase in prices, the cost of living index of workers has increased, the cost of manufactured goods has increased, and prices have increased in a cycle. Therefore, prices and wages have become mutually causal and become a cyclical upward phenomenon. Prices and wages are always competing, and the ultimate result will inevitably form a huge crisis. To solve this crisis, we must first stop the vicious cycle of prices and wages and stop their competition. Therefore, the suppression of prices and wages must take a unified chain approach. This plan decides to stabilize prices and limit wages at the same time, taking the cost of living index in January as the standard. This is naturally the only appropriate measure at present.

### Emergency Measures, About Two Purposes

The central government's measures aim to assist the development of production enterprises and maintain the stability of the lives of workers and the people. Some people may think that limiting prices will affect the development of production enterprises, and limiting wages will affect the lives of workers. In fact, this view is not accurate. Because if prices are not suppressed, prices will always rise in a straight line, wages will increase, costs will increase, and the prices of raw materials will increase. Because of the high prices, the people's lives will be depleted, and sales will be reduced. The factory's manufactured goods will not be able to meet the needs of production and consumption, resulting in the accumulation of goods and no one cares. Over time, it will inevitably tend to decline.

On the worker side, because prices are always increasing, the factory's goods lack sales, which will inevitably lead to the closure of the factory, causing serious unemployment panic for the workers. Both the factory and the workers will perish. Therefore, the factory and the workers must understand this principle and jointly support this policy, so that production can be increased and prices can be reduced, which is a proper way.

### Small Profits and Quick Sales are Beneficial to Factories

On the raw material side, because the general price is generally reduced, producers can naturally reduce their selling prices. Moreover, the government is also trying to unblock the source and crack down on hoarding and speculation, which are all factors that can reduce raw materials and costs. In addition, the government strictly controls foreign exchange, the cost of foreign goods is increasing day by day, and consumers will inevitably adopt more domestic goods, and sales will be more prosperous. That is, because the price is limited, the manufactured goods increase sales, and they get more profits, that is, the so-called small profits and quick sales. The economy is more flexible, prices can be more balanced, and the national economy can be greatly developed. Therefore, limiting prices is beneficial to factories.

### Worker Welfare Needs to be Organized Urgently

Workers will inevitably be affected by the limitation of wage increases. Therefore, the organization of worker welfare undertakings is even more necessary. For example, worker consumer cooperatives, worker children's refresher schools, labor hospitals, nurseries, and other worker entertainment facilities are all being urged by the bureau to be effectively implemented by various factories, which can also reduce part of the worker's burden. As for the method of subsidizing daily necessities, there are now detailed regulations in this city, and the bureau will definitely implement them effectively.

Now is the time after the war. According to historical practice, after the war, people have to endure pain and suffering to overcome this difficulty and move forward to the new happy and prosperous road. The current hardship must be adhered to and endured by everyone in order to create national rejuvenation and national progress. I hope that the people will effectively support this measure and work together on this plan.

### After the Promulgation of the Food Supply Method, Reactions from All Parties are Inconsistent

[Our Report] After the Social Affairs Bureau announced the food supply method for manufacturers and workers in this city yesterday, the reactions from various manufacturers are very different due to different business conditions. As far as reporters have visited, generally speaking, both labor and management in industries such as tobacco and rubber, which are generally paid by the piece, are still satisfied. Most machine and department store industries are still not satisfied. The reasons they hold are that the labor side believes that there is no distinction between the advantages and disadvantages of technology, and there is no distinction between technicians and apprentices. The subsidies are the same, which is unfair. The management side believes that there is no separate subsidy for the diligence, laziness, efficiency, or inefficiency of employees, which is a loss of the meaning of rewards and punishments. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is unwilling to express its views on this. The association is scheduled to hold a board of directors meeting this afternoon to discuss.

### Ban Changing Salary Increase Under a Different Name, Chamber of Commerce Informs Various Industries to Comply

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been approved by the Municipal Government to ban the creation of allowances in addition to the basic salary as a disguised increase in the basic salary. It has specially informed the trade associations of various industries to order their members to strictly comply.

### Two Labor Unions Petition, Hope for Freezing of Cost of Living Index

[Our Report] The newspaper industry trade union in this city sent representatives to submit a presentation to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting to unfreeze the cost of living index.

Moreover, more than 10 representatives from the Fourth District Machine Industry Trade Union in this city, including Xu Binggeng, Chen Baolian, and Wang Zuhui, also petitioned the General Federation of Trade Unions yesterday, requesting that the government be requested to unfreeze the cost of living index and stabilize the lives of workers. They submitted three written opinions on the food ration method. Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions, promised to submit the various suggestions made by the representatives to the meeting of the board of directors of the General Federation of Trade Unions this afternoon for discussion.

### Social Affairs Bureau Officially Announces Average Price Difference of Daily Necessities

72,965 Yuan, Generally Issued at 73,000 Yuan

[Our Report] The average price difference of six kinds of daily necessities for employees in January and February was officially announced by the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday: a total of 72,915 yuan. Because the calculation of the fractional number is troublesome, it was decided that the actual distribution would be calculated at 73,000 yuan. In this way, every employee whose salary is calculated based on the cost of living index, in addition to the salary they should receive in February, which is calculated based on the worker's 7,945 times the cost of living index in January and the employee's 6,614 times, the factory will also subsidize each person with 73,000 yuan.

The calculation of the average price difference of daily necessities for employees is the responsibility of the Municipal Government Research Office. The detailed list of the price difference between January and February is as follows:

### Municipal Finance New Budget, Council Budget Committee, Requests Municipal Government to Re-compile

The Municipal Council Budget Committee was held at the Secretariat in Fuming Village at 4:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the budget for this year. More than 10 people including Xu Yongzuo, He Yuanming, and Wei Fu Jiu attended. Min Xiangfan, the director of the accounting office of the Municipal Government, also attended. The committee has tried several times to adjust tax revenue, and the difference with the original budget is close to only more than 40 billion yuan. However, recently, due to the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, various bureaus and offices need to add new budgets of more than 1,800 yuan, and the current total difference is more than 220 billion yuan. Therefore, the current budget cannot be compiled at all, and the Municipal Government is requested to recompile the budget for review. This issue will be decided at a joint meeting of the Finance and Budget Committee on March 3.

### Entertainment Tax Revenue Has Not Decreased, Banquet Tax Shortfall of 500 Million

[Our Report] The tax rates for entertainment tax and banquet tax in this city have been reduced since February. It is reported that the revenue from entertainment tax in the first half of February of the Finance Bureau was more than 1.55 billion, and the estimated total revenue for February can reach 3.1 billion, which is equal to the revenue in January when the tax was not reduced. The main reason is that the police bureau allowed each theater to add seats during the Spring Festival. The revenue from banquet tax in the first half of February was more than 800 million, and the estimated total revenue for the whole month was 1.6 billion, which was more than 500 million less than in January.

In addition, the above statistics do not include the floating population and the foreign population.

### Council General Meeting Changed to 6th

[Our Report] The second general meeting of the Municipal Council was originally scheduled to be held on May 5 of this month.

### Embezzlement of Loan Incident, China Trust Bureau Did Not Sue

[Our Report] The incident of embezzling the loan from Tongfengxiang, which occurred in the China Trust Bureau in September last year, has not been resolved so far. The China Trust Bureau handled the acceptance of the 30 million yuan of the National Trust Bank in accordance with normal procedures. It is deeply regrettable that there has been an accident. In order to clarify the credibility of the staff, the entire file was sent to the court for investigation on the 18th of this month to clarify the truth. However, it is not true that the China Trust Bureau sued Tongfengxiang.

### China Training Corps Students, Two Grand Meetings in Beijing and Shanghai

### Child Killed by Bus

[Our Report] At 5:40 p.m. yesterday, at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Old West Gate, bus No. 37799 on Route 6 knocked down a child over ten years old due to the driver's carelessness. The child was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after due to serious injuries. The name of the deceased child cannot be investigated so far.

### Embezzling Public Funds for Interest Case, Wu Suiren Sentenced to Eight Years

[Our Report] Wu Suiren, the chief of the cashier section of the Executive Yuan, was sentenced to eight years in prison for embezzling 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for profit. After the public prosecution was filed by the District Procuratorate, the District Court held several hearings, and the debate ended. The verdict was announced by Shao Renjie, the judge of the Criminal Court I of the District Court yesterday afternoon. The main text of the verdict is: "Wu Suiren shall be sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for engaging in profit-making in the affairs under his supervision and deprived of his civil rights for eight years." The reasons for the verdict are roughly: "The defendant has already admitted the facts of the crime, which is also consistent with the testimony of the witnesses. The defendant argued that he surrendered himself and that the purpose of the loan was to start a small loan business, which is unfounded and not credible. However, the defendant returned all the public funds after the crime, so the sentence is light."

### Ship Repair Shop Dismisses Employees, Social Affairs Bureau Mediation Fails to Compromise

[Our Report] The China Merchants Bureau's First Ship Repair Shop dismissed more than 100 workers. The Social Affairs Bureau convened both parties for mediation yesterday. The labor side demanded that the shop withdraw its decision. As a result, the shop believed that technicians and others could be given work, but 54 small workers still had to be dismissed. The dismissal fee salary is one month. The workers believed that they could not be satisfied and insisted on resuming work as a whole, and gathered this morning to petition the Municipal Government.

### Procuring Prostitutes for Haircuts; Planned to Earn Cigarettes

After packing, he wrote a note, instructed the shop apprentice to go to the barber shop with the Mei Sheng apprentice to get money from his wife, and then hired a streetcar to leave. After the two apprentices asked a shampoo girl for money, the girl was at a loss. It is said that she is a prostitute named Xu Sannan, 20 years old, from Suzhou, living at No. 10, Lane 401, Zhengzheng East Road. She was called to the hotel by the guest the night before and spent 42,000 yuan on the night, and went to the Mei Sheng Barber Shop to wash her hair with her in the morning. When she arrived at the door, she shook hands and said goodbye, and was not his wife. The tobacco shop then realized that it had been deceived and reported to the Songshan Branch Bureau for arrest.

### Fudan University Teachers and Students Launch Rights Protection Movement

More than 50 professors and most students of National Fudan University recently launched a "Rights Protection Movement," the main purpose of which is: (1) to oppose international interference in China's internal affairs, (2) to withdraw all foreign troops stationed in China, (3) to recover all sovereign territory, and (4) to return all looted materials. A huge slogan was hung at the gate of the school, which read: "Advocating international interference is a traitor." It is heard that this movement will soon receive a

Essays	Remembering Mr. Sun in Retirement  Rude

 Spring brings many feelings. Having remembered Wang Pingling, who secluded himself in a mountain city, I then recall Mr. Sun Fuyuan, who hid even further away than Pingling's elder brother. Beneath his red nose, a cluster of Leninist-style whiskers, a small and wiry figure, yet exceptionally open-minded. Old Man Sun differed from other literati in that he never complained and loved to hide in urban areas. In Chongqing, he and a few friends founded a Sino-Foreign Publishing House. That place connected Niujiaotuo and Shangqingsi, amidst the dust and noise of constant traffic. In summer, it was truly annoying, but Old Man Sun remained calm, sipping white liquor and munching peanuts and dried tofu in a small tavern in Niujiaotuo, regarding them as rare delicacies.

 In terms of supplements, Sun Fuyuan and Shao Lizi, these two Shaoxing literati, can be considered the ancestors of supplements. During the May Fourth era, Mr. Shao Lizi edited the "Enlightenment" section of the Republican Daily, and Old Man Sun edited the "Morning Supplement" of the Beijing Morning Post. At that time, Sun in the north and Shao in the south of the supplement world were like Chen (Duxiu) in the south and Li (Dazhao) in the north of the Communist Party, evenly matched and each dominating their own territory. Mr. Shao's "Enlightenment" benefited from young writers in the Kuomintang. Because the Kuomintang had not yet come to power, many talented individuals dedicated themselves to writing. Although "Enlightenment" was a supplement, it was filled with excellent works. The Beijing Morning Post supplement, located in the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, was supported by a group of new scholars from Peking University. Moreover, Old Man Sun was a confidant of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, giving him free rein to select and polish excellent works. No wonder it flourished and became a veteran in the supplement world. Therefore, when the Wuhan Central Daily News was founded in 1927, Old Man Sun was hired as the chief editor of the central supplement. In 1942, when Chen Bosheng was in charge of the Chongqing Central Daily News, Old Man Sun was again hired to host the central supplement, burying himself daily under the oil paper windows of the Central Daily News in Hualongqiao, reading manuscripts. The manuscripts piled up on several tables. I really didn't understand how he read them, but Old Man Sun handled everything with composure, so naturally, it didn't matter. However, the wartime central supplement was not as lively as the Morning Post supplement during the May Fourth era. I once discussed this in detail with Old Man Sun. The conclusion: concentrated will and unified thought contribute greatly to politics; the success of the Soviet Union is the best example. Freedom of thought and divergent opinions contribute greatly to culture; the flourishing of the Hundred Schools of Thought in the Spring and Autumn period, the European Renaissance, and the May Fourth Movement are the best examples. Therefore, I want to tell Old Man Sun that the era of May Fourth liberalism has arrived again. I do not wish Old Man Sun to stay in western Sichuan, sitting on a small bamboo chair and gossiping in Chengdu. I still hope Old Man Sun will come out of retirement and work for literature and art, for the youth.

 Old Man Sun and Mr. Lu Xun had the elegance of being from the same hometown and colleagues. He knew Lu Xun very well. In Chongqing, he published a booklet called "Anecdotes of Lu Xun," which, although brief in content, was exceptionally authentic. Young people today still have a blind faith in Lu Xun. I also hope that Old Man Sun will do more research on Lu Xun, introducing him to the youth of the new era with correct insights.

 Silence should be time-limited, and seclusion is not the way in a democratic era. The second May Fourth has arrived. We must create, create, regardless of age!
### "Complaining"  Hu Shanyuan

 Everyone can complain, but it seems that literati are the best at it. Because literati are always more sensitive and have greater desires than others. And because they excel at writing and are good at describing, complaining has almost become the exclusive domain of literati. Since the time of Qu Yuan, who wrote "Li Sao" to express his grievances, almost every literati has complained, and almost every literati is good at complaining. Complaining and literati have become almost inseparable, and thus poets are called "lamenting men."

 Qu Yuan's complaints, and those of his successor Jia Yi, can easily evoke our sympathy. But we cannot agree with their sorrowful and haggard deaths. They were loyal to their ruler and loved their country, and wanted to achieve something. Unfortunately, they destroyed their lives early, leaving nothing but writings. This can be called Qu-Jia-style complaining.

 Those who have read Selections of Ancient Prose must have a deep impression of the complaints in "Li Ling's Reply to Su Wu" and "Yang Yun's Letter to Sun Huizong." These were both caused by unfair treatment, and they can be regarded as the orthodox complaining, because complaining arises from injustice. But I feel that they are just making unnecessary efforts. Not to mention that Yang Yun lost his life for complaining, what good did Li Ling, who thought he was wronged, ultimately do for himself or others? This can be called Li-Yang-style complaining.

 Li-Yang-style is certainly inferior to Qu-Jia-style, because Li-Yang is just a matter of personal treatment, while Qu-Jia has a great purpose. But looking coldly at the complaining literati in general, there are many more Li-Yang-style than Qu-Jia-style. Perhaps this is because "each generation is not as good as the last"!

 Su Dongpo's "a bellyful of unsuitability" should naturally also be classified as complaining. However, Su Dongpo was not as stubborn as Qu-Jia, nor as indignant as Li-Yang. He would complain intentionally or unintentionally, when he could, and if not, he wouldn't bother. This may be called poetic complaining, or still using the person as the standard, Su Dongpo-style.

 I think Su Dongpo's complaining is a true expression of the poet's feelings, done for no reason, and it embodies the ancient poet's principle of "sorrow without injury, resentment without anger." But don't you think he's a bit too passive?

 Until now, most of the complaints made by literati are of the type of celebrated scholars. The so-called celebrated scholars only have a name. As for "scholar," perhaps they are barely given this title because they can read, write, and write articles. They have absolutely no other skills and no knowledge whatsoever. But they are the most self-important. They have no country or society in their eyes, no one else. They only have themselves. They think they should enjoy themselves and live a life of luxury. In other words, they believe they should get something for nothing. If not for the great grace of the emperor or the legacy of their ancestors, then drunken women and all the tools of enjoyment should fall from the sky. Since they don't have these and they can't get them, they sit around complaining all day long, thinking that the country and society have treated them unfairly, that everyone, including their family and children, has treated them unfairly, and that even heaven has treated them unfairly. He is angry; he scolds; he cries; he goes crazy; he dies. And he never realizes until his death that he is pure. Some people actually call him pure, sympathize with him, and pity him, but they don't know him. These celebrity-style complainers can only complain and are truly "useless for everything else." Li Chi, who was contemporary with Li Bai, went crazy and drowned in the toilet. Or perhaps this can be called Li Chi-style complaining.

 Li Chi-style complaints are groundless. That is to say, unlike others who complain because they are forced to do so, their complaints are completely voluntary. They often groan without illness. It may be a bit harsh to say, but they may feel that there is joy in complaining and are complacent!

 Once across the river, celebrities are as numerous as carp. "The times are ultimately different. There won't be any more Li Chis, right? It wouldn't be bad to have a few more Su Dongpos, leaving more achievements in literature, but how easy is that? If you can't be a poet, you become a celebrity. And after all, you don't necessarily have to be good at complaining to be a poet. It seems that not all the great Western poets started out by complaining. Qu Yuan and Li Yang, no matter what they themselves were like, should not be emulated by later generations. In a nutshell: complaining is useless in every way. Literati should make good use of their strengths in other beneficial ways and never complain!
One Inch of Land, One Inch of Blood  Ye Jingfeng

 That was my first impression of Mr. Dai. Other impressions are many, many, such as that he has a commanding presence, an attractive power that commands respect and love, an X-ray-like gaze that penetrates your mind; an unwavering determination that makes you always willing to trust him; etc. I am not willing to record too much about these things. Let's wait and use his actions—in the rear, in the occupied areas after August 13th, and at the forefront of various battlefields—to express the deep impression he gave us.

 After Mr. Dai spoke, Tsurumi recovered his usual state:

 "The goal of going to Matsui's place has finally been achieved; 100% achieved"!

 I felt strange when I heard Tsurumi's report. The thing I was most worried about was that he might have conflicts at Matsui's place, or that Matsui might have discovered our secrets, thereby shaking our current working foundation. Now, listening to his report, there is no indication of anything like that. So, why was he so flustered?
 "I would like to ask a question," Tsurumi had already recovered his Beijing accent. He glanced at us at this time, and then focused his gaze on Mr. W: "This is a six-story building in total. Apart from our floor, everything is isolated from the outside world. Do the guests on the other floors, from the second to the fifth floor, and the diners and tea drinkers on the lower floors, have accurate statistical surveys on weekdays?"

 "Yes," Mr. W had already pressed the bell to summon someone; because he knew what kind of reference information would be needed in the following passage.

 After the on-duty staff member responded with a sound, entered, retreated, and summoned, a special figure had joined us in a short time of one or two minutes—the general manager of this hotel. His appearance was like that of other hotel managers or large-scale business owners in Peiping: simple, calm, sincere, and amiable.

 "On the street-facing floor, how many people come and go for meals every day? ... Are there any regular customers who come and go often?" Tsurumi asked.

 The manager took out a small notebook from his pocket, but did not open it to look at it:

 "For regular meals, not counting festivals and anniversaries, it's about seven or eight full. Among these seven or eight full, it can be said that 99% are regular customers, many years of regular customers, and we know their backgrounds clearly. That one percent may be one or two customers who eat a small meal; some may have only come once; and some will "return" once after a while. We have some records of these "return" customers; for example, their names, occupations, addresses, comings and goings, etc."

 Tsurumi's questions and the manager's answers made us understand the center of the problem. From the center of this problem, we immediately deduced a fictional passage and conclusion. In other words, Tsurumi must have discovered something unusual during his trip in and out within this hour—a new threat to Mr. W's organization, a coordinated attack from within and without, or an invasive resistance work.

 "What about the permanent residents on the second to fifth floors?" Tsurumi asked again.

 "We can't talk about the fifth floor, they are all our own brothers. The remaining three floors have a total of forty-two rooms, with permanent residents occupying about 70%, those coming and going accounting for 20-30%, and vacant rooms accounting for about 10%. These coming and going people all have investigation records. Among the seven permanent residents, only three rooms are more complicated, but we have installed detection equipment in all three rooms, and their conversations and actions are recorded," the manager answered word by word, as if reciting a familiar passage.
Tea Drinkers——Ten Chapters of Continuing Dreams of Yangzhou  Hong Weifa

 It is commonly said that people in Yangzhou love "skin wrapping water in the morning and water wrapping skin in the evening." "Skin wrapping water" refers to going to a teahouse for tea, and "water wrapping skin" refers to going to a bathhouse for a bath. In fact, those who love "skin wrapping water" do not necessarily love "water wrapping skin."

 Those who love "skin wrapping water in the morning" are mostly older tea drinkers, who not only go to the teahouse in the morning but also in the afternoon. They arrive at the teahouse around nine o'clock every morning and sit there until after eleven o'clock before leaving. After three o'clock in the afternoon, they arrive at the teahouse again, staying until twilight, and then leisurely return home on foot. Regardless of cold or heat, rain or shine, they spend almost half of the year's time in the teahouse, except for sleeping. This type of tea drinker used to be very numerous, but in recent years they have gradually decreased.

 They are mostly concentrated in very few teahouses, such as the Dangchun Teahouse, which is one of their major camps, and they are also somewhat different from other tea drinkers. Although other tea drinkers also have their own places where "birds of a feather flock together," such as those in the money business often gathering in a certain teahouse, and those in the rice business often gathering in a certain teahouse, etc., their main purpose is to talk about market conditions and discuss transactions, and drinking tea is just an incidental activity. They are ashamed to associate with these tea drinkers. They have no market conditions to speak of, nor do they have transactions to discuss. They only talk about romance, discuss national affairs, or comment on poetry and prose. Talking about romance is mostly done implicitly, so it is not too harmful. Discussing national affairs sometimes involves feelings and sometimes indignation. When they get indignant, they become oblivious to others, stroking their beards and slapping the table. In the past, whenever there were sudden changes in the situation, the owner of the teahouse, fearing that their behavior would cause trouble and harm his own business, would post red paper strips saying "Do Not Discuss National Affairs." This was naturally a warning to them, and as a result, in the short term, they would change from speaking freely to whispering. But after a long time, they would relapse into their old habits. Although others respect the elderly and value virtue and are mostly understanding, it is always a very distressing thing for the owner of the teahouse. As for commenting on poetry and prose, it is mostly about the works of their peers. For example, three people, A, B, and C, are at the same table. A points to B and says to C, "Old man, have you read his recent work?" C replies, "I have already read it! Excellent, excellent! This article is between Ou and Gui"! C nods as he speaks, while B smiles slightly to himself. Then A says to C, "Old man! In my opinion, it is not only between Ou and Gui, it is simply between Ou and "! After A finishes speaking, he can't help but laugh. And at this time, B can't help but slightly raise his body, and say to A and C with cupped hands, "I dare not! You two are really overpraising me"! Similar conversations are often found among them. Sometimes, commenting on poetry and prose can also evoke nostalgia. For example, A and B are talking about poem clocks, and they both feel that today is not as good as yesterday. Then A says, "Those special clocks from the past are not easy to see now, it is truly a loss to culture"! B then continues, "What Mr. A said is very true, like the poem clock made by a certain old man in the past, 'Lying with a covered head in the wind and rain at the third watch, touring the lakes and mountains of six dynasties arm in arm', these two lines of embedded characters, embedding the four characters 'three heads and six arms', are so neat and so refreshing! People today cannot make them", similar conversations are also often found among them.

 They are tea drinkers and also true tea drinkers. Because they drink a lot of tea, but eat very little dim sum. In the morning, they may only eat three or four steamed dumplings, and in the afternoon, they may only eat two or three small baked cakes. And they mostly keep accounts, each with their own account, and each keeps their own account. Unless it is stated in advance, no one will pretend to be cordial and compete to be the host. These debts are settled during the three major festivals, and even then, they can be temporarily unsettled, leaving some balance to be rolled over to the next festival. Therefore, drinking tea for a year, before the war, cost at most a hundred yuan or so, which was not much, and they could enjoy it without getting tired of it.

 As for the people involved, there are noble young masters, tired politicians, uninhibited celebrities, and also those from humble backgrounds who are appreciated for their skills and therefore join them. But most of them are people who are proficient in writing and calligraphy, so they share the same interests and easily become tea drinkers who are in another realm, living without competition and, it can be said, looking down on everything.

New Year's Greetings——Respect to Authors and Readers  Editor

 Thank you, readers and authors, for sending us many precious articles from all over the world every day. Many of these crystallizations written from every angle of life have already met everyone on paper, and many have not been published because they are not very suitable.

 I believe that the authors who write manuscripts all hope that their works can be published as soon as possible; however, due to various reasons, these manuscripts cannot sometimes be adopted by us.

 I would like to make a brief explanation here:

 "Freedom Forum" is different from "Essays". It is a comprehensive publication. In addition to general literary and artistic theories, novels, and poems, everything else should be the world of "Freedom Forum." Therefore, the materials for "Freedom Forum" are very broad. "Above and below, ancient and modern", "north and south", everything can be discussed, anecdotes in the literary world and political circles, historical essays, essays; and comments and news in art, music, fine arts, and literary circles, the dynamics of movies, dramas, and old dramas; cartoons, sculptures, woodcuts, songs, and educational and enlightening manuscripts and urban life reflecting reality, all included in the example of "Freedom Forum"'s themes.

 In summary, the articles we are willing to publish are those that we hope to be positive, educational, and through various forms of short and concise articles.

 These articles may quote ancient and modern times and discuss the world, but they must be interesting, meaningful, lively, and have content and flesh and blood.

 The writing themes may open up new paths and find new worlds. Readers will also be bored if they follow behind others.

 For example, "fighting tigers" can be temporarily left aside. Too many people have written about it repeatedly these days. Recommending "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon", we introduced it a long time ago.

 This publication hopes to accommodate manuscripts from all aspects, all levels, and all angles. We hope that everyone will write about things they are familiar with and tell everyone your anger, joy, and sorrow.

 "Depression" is a symbol of this era. You may wish to quietly refer to more materials and pour out the language that you have accumulated in your heart.

 We also welcome readers and authors to tell us what kind of articles you want to see? Are you satisfied with the content of this publication for the past ten days?

 Don't be stingy with your paper and postage. We should try to communicate with each other and talk from time to time, so that we can speak freely and achieve "seamless cooperation"!

 If possible, I would like to write a letter similar to an explanatory letter to readers and authors every week or ten days.

 Best wishes!
Editor, February 27th

 (Note: If the manuscript is accompanied by stamps, the unused draft can be returned).
Notice: The manuscript fees for the second half of February in this publication are being settled. Authors of this publication who have not attached their seals and addresses are requested to send them as soon as possible so that the manuscript fee slips can be sent to you as soon as possible.

A Literary Man's Contempt——New Words Heard, Talk Four  Ting Song

 Literary men have always despised each other. The instructors in various schools are mostly senior scholars.

 My late grandfather, Shi Fujun, was selected and appointed as the instructor of Haichang before he was strong. When he first took office, he was often accused of slanderous remarks, but my grandfather dismissed them with a smile. The school palace was close to the Maitreya Nunnery, which was very effective and had a very prosperous incense. A wealthy gentleman gathered public funds to rebuild the temple, and everyone asked Dong, a professor, to write a couplet. Dong was old and sick, and said to everyone: Qian, the instructor, is very rich in literature, why not ask him? My grandfather made a couplet: "Always smiling, laughing at the past and the present, everything is nothing but laughable, generous and tolerant, tolerating heaven and earth, what is there that cannot be tolerated in people." Although the meaning of the words is the same, the atmosphere is very broad. The first line looks at the past and present, and the second line contains a wide range of meaning. The description of Maitreya's expression is especially accurate and unchangeable. It is indeed a famous couplet, and the people of the state unanimously admired it. Therefore, my grandfather served for more than 30 years, and those who were blessed by his teachings achieved great success. Even today, the elders still remember him with praise.

 Our Zhejiang has many talented scholars, but literary men despise each other, and it has become a habit. Every time there is a provincial examination, someone must write a couplet to mock the names of the chief and deputy examiners. For example, Li Wentian and Chen Ding said: "The old name of literature, Li Zhongde, why not be slightly despised, the new Ding Ji opened, Chen Boshang can be discussed." The combination of Li Duanyu and Fei Nianci's names is especially clever. The couplet is "Mu Zi Er Mu cannot be said, just teach one character to be unintelligible, for no reason they meet, Fu Bei brother do not be too much, just want thousands of gold to be given, to raise the thought of mercy." One is dedicated to family names, such as Wula Xi Chong, A Yun Chanbin, and then said: "The bird is not as good, just because there is no ink in the chest, the military source can be taken, as there is a bias outside the body." Bai Huanpan Yanxiang said: "Jinshan Temple fights to kick the literary leader, it is difficult to escape the combination bowl, Zishi Street curtain picks the martial sister-in-law, tightly tailored clothes." The next couplet is word-by-word neat, it is indeed the so-called writing is natural, the wonderful hand accidentally obtained it, Mr. Yi Ye, came to Renxuezheng again in Ji Chou, once talked to people about this couplet, saying that the author is indeed scheming, but also because the two people's names are too clever, although the words have regret, but also can be said Junfang's words are wonderful Tian Tianxia, Yu Yin has been known for nearly sixty years, and he misses his teacher. I feel that the world has changed, and I can't help but feel the feelings of the past and the present.
Life at the End of the Century  Tang Shan

 In the latter half of the 19th century, a "fin-de-siècle" trend of thought occurred in Europe. The life that expressed this thought was fanaticism, absurdity, humility, shamelessness, and weariness! All kinds of complex expressions and behaviors. People in this era had no bright vision for the future of the entire world; they felt even less pity for their own lives. In this way, as long as life existed, they desperately consumed it, hoping to incorporate all the sounds and colors of the world into their five senses in an instant. Once they had finished enjoying today, it was considered their happiness.

 The fin-de-siècle trend of thought in Huanzhou is vaguely similar to the kind of thought of the scholar-official class in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties in our country. The worldview of the literati in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties was "Drink today if you have wine, worry about tomorrow if you have no money"! This kind of decadent life is naturally not exclusive to a certain class, it has its social roots and era environment.

 We know that European capitalism, developing to the latter half of the 19th century, had already exposed its own contradictions from the peak. A few capitals concentrated and monopolized, so the lives of most people became more and more miserable: they lived lives of semi-starvation, overwork, disappointment and despair. When people reach the point where hope is extinguished and life will never improve, they will naturally negate the meaning of life. Nuerte's "Degenerate Theory", published in 1893, contained many examples of the life attitudes that arose from the negative denial of social life by the life of that time. During the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, society was turbulent, politics were dark, and people's lives were miserable to the extreme. That heavy and turbulent era made people's hearts seem to have no hope of peace forever. Rather than sitting and waiting for death, it is better to be happy for a moment and die!

 A few days ago, a friend came to see me. During the chat, everyone felt that the shadows in front of them were getting thicker and thicker. My friend said: "Now, nothing in culture, science, or art makes people happier or more valued than money." This is really the most cruel shadow of reality. With money dominating everything, the dignity, beauty, harmony, integrity, love, and mutual assistance of life have all been destroyed by money. Now it seems that it is also the end of the century, and people's heavy hearts are only filled with darkness and despair!

 Opening the newspaper, there are suicides, robberies, and rapes all day long. On the other hand, there are speculative transactions and extravagant pleasures. How tragic and terrible is this life! Are we going to destroy ourselves before the world is destroyed?
A Civil Servant's Sigh  Jinhua

 —A Set of Liu Yong's "Painting Night Joy" Lyrics

 I remember when we first met after the restoration, we were only suitable for following the index, but I never expected that a little bit of kindness would turn into a snail's pace. Moreover, the new ten thousand yuan banknotes are exposed, facing the rice weevils of treacherous merchants, I am afraid that the bad times will be difficult to get through from now on;

 A bitter hardship, who can I tell, calculating the previous words will eventually be lightly betrayed, if I had known it was so humble, I would have regretted not cultivating the garden in the first place, but after my hometown was burned, there was another × army staying there, a naked body, also had no way to go.
A Record of a City in Danger  Qin Shouou

 Preface

 In the spring of 1944, I lived idly in Guilin. In addition to occasionally writing short articles for Dagong Daily, I spent my days enjoying the clouds and mists and wandering among the springs and rocks, feeling quite isolated from the times. By the end of May, the sound of artillery fire in northern Hunan resumed, and the enemy's atmosphere became clamorous. After Changsha fell, Hengshan also could not be defended. On the Luxikou line, three cities were lost in one day, and Guilin was greatly shocked. Wealthy families moved west with their entire families, and the order within thousands of miles was greatly disrupted. I also left alone when the local authorities first announced the emergency evacuation order, becoming one of the higher-level refugees. Unexpectedly, at this time, my wife and two children also came from Shanghai to the interior. They had just arrived in Ganzhou when Hengyang fell. I knew nothing about it beforehand, so I left them to wander the roads, leaving everything to fate. By the time we bypassed Guangdong and Guangxi and arrived in Guizhou, more than three months had passed. During this time, they had suffered a lot and had repeatedly been on the verge of danger. When the family reunited, the mother and three children were already thin and shapeless! Therefore, the Hunan-Guangxi campaign left the deepest impression on me. Every time I think of it, I still have lingering fears. This campaign was not only a major tragedy in the late period of the War of Resistance, but also the main reason for the continuous domestic turmoil today. Ashamed that I am not a historian, I cannot follow in the footsteps of Ban Gu and Sima Qian. I will pick up fine remnants and make this novel, but I dare not vainly hope that it can be passed down to future generations!

 The outline of this book was completed in the summer of 1945, when I lived in Chengdu. I discussed it with my two brothers, Ying Yunwei and Zhang Huijian, and planned to first complete the novel and then adapt it into a script. We also decided to name it "A Record of a City in Danger." Later, victory came suddenly, and everything changed. For more than ten months, people were confused and had no time to rest, so it was repeatedly delayed, and it was not until now that I could finally hold a pen. Last winter, I saw a short message in a certain magazine, knowing that Mr. Duanmu Hongliang had published a short story in Guangdong, also named "A Record of a City in Danger." I initially planned to rename my work "Flowers in Purgatory" to avoid repetition; however, friends in the industry all criticized its new literary style as too heavy, and considering that one is a novel and the other is a short story, and the authors are not the same person, there should be no confusion even if they have the same name. Therefore, I still use the original name! This is the preface.

### The Issue of Trusteeship of Manus Island: US and Australia Seek Resolution

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] Sources here recently stated that Britain believes the future status of the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific should be resolved by a peace conference. Britain has notified Washington of this stance, and Australia and New Zealand hold the same position. Regarding the defense policies of the Australian dominion, Britain has now assured its support, especially concerning Manus Island, which the Australian government leased to Britain during the war. The United States has invested $200 million in constructing a base on the island and has requested Australia to transfer the trusteeship of the island to the US. It is now hoped that this issue can be resolved before negotiating the US trusteeship of the former Japanese mandated territories.

### US Generals Emphasize National Defense

[United Press, Elgin, Illinois, 27th] Former Commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral King, today delivered a speech at the Elgin University winter lecture series, advocating for vigorous armament and full vigilance. He stated that the US Navy must be prepared to strike the enemy head-on. Air power or atomic bombs alone are not enough to win. There may be methods of defending against atomic bombs. An atomic bomb is just a type of bomb, an offensive weapon, and by itself, it is absolutely insufficient to win a war. The primary mission of the Navy is to maintain the security of the United States, followed by the security of the Western Hemisphere, and then world peace.

[United Press, Austin, Texas, 7th] Fourth Army Commander Wainwright today delivered a speech at the Texas State Legislature, advocating for the establishment of an atomic bomb air force and the implementation of universal military training to ensure national security. Wainwright stated that the best way to ensure the security of the United States is to build ten or more powerful aircraft and constantly stockpile atomic bombs for use. Such bombers could fly to any location on Earth with a full load of atomic bombs and return. Today's world has only three major powers, one of which is in partial collapse, and another could become an aggressor. The fall of one country will leave us alone to face this threat.

### Soviet Union Trains Airborne Troops for Blitzkrieg Attacks - Numbering 100,000, Surpassing Other Countries

[United Press, Washington, 28th] According to news leaked from the Soviet Union today, the Soviets have or are currently training an airborne army whose strength far exceeds that of airborne armies in other countries. It is reported that the Soviets are training an airborne army specializing in blitzkrieg attacks, numbering as many as 100,000, while the US Army has only 10,000 trained in this area. According to Lend-Lease figures, the United States supplied the Soviet Union with 700 transport aircraft during the war. Experts estimate that only 500 transport aircraft are needed to quickly transport a division of 12,000 troops with all their equipment simultaneously.

### Agreement Reached for Anglo-French Alliance - Signing Possible in Dunkirk Next Tuesday -

[Our report] London, 28th Broadcast: Bevin stated in the House of Commons that negotiations for the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty have reached an agreement, and it is hoped that it can be signed in Dunkirk next Tuesday.

French Prime Minister's Remarks - Believes Understanding Among Four Powers is Necessary

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] French officials recently revealed that the signing date of the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty may be postponed. Rumors from foreign sources that France will standardize its military equipment according to the standards of the United States and Britain are entirely baseless.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] French Prime Minister Ramadier held his weekly press conference today, expressing hope that Britain and France could conclude an alliance treaty as soon as possible and predicting that the harmony and unity of the Anglo-French-Soviet triangular relationship would create a favorable atmosphere before the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. Prime Minister Ramadier said that France had submitted a memorandum on the German issue to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union had raised reservations on some points and expressed disagreement on others, but the overall response was still good. We may be able to reach a compromise through four-way compromise, and we will do our best to create an atmosphere of understanding between countries. Although British-Soviet negotiations for concluding a treaty have encountered difficulties, they are currently progressing smoothly. British-French negotiations began after the Soviet Union requested revisions to the Anglo-Soviet treaty. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference has yet to resolve the various difficult issues concerning Germany, and it is important to give new impetus to realistic peace policies and reduce suspicion among countries.

### US Congressman Suggests Merging Iceland - Denmark Protests to the US - Saying Such Suggestions Are Inappropriate

[Reuters, Reykjavik, Iceland, 27th] Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson told Parliament that he had instructed Icelandic Minister to the United States Thors to protest to the US State Department against the suggestion of California Republican Congressman Gearhart to invite Iceland to join the United States as the 49th state. Iceland believes that making such suggestions in the US Congress is inappropriate. Gearhart had also requested the United States to negotiate the purchase of island bases in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Caribbean Seas.

According to United Press, Washington: Local newspapers unanimously believe that although US Congressman Gearhart has made these two suggestions to Congress, Congress will not seriously consider them.

### Inviting the Soviet Union and Other Countries to Jointly Investigate the Arctic

Canadian Foreign Minister Delivers Speech in New York

[United Press, New York, 27th] Canadian Foreign Minister Laurent today delivered a speech at the New York Pilgrims Society, inviting the Soviet Union and other United Nations countries to join the United States and Canada in jointly investigating the Arctic. Laurent said: "I don't know why we shouldn't seek various conveniences within the framework of the United Nations to explore knowledge about the northern region on the broadest possible basis. I dare say that our country is happy to cooperate in this endeavor, but on the condition of reciprocity. We have already exchanged meteorological information with our Soviet neighbors on the basis of reciprocity, so why not extend this to other useful information? The Soviet newspapers' reports about the activities of the United States and Canada in the Far North are based on fabrication and misunderstanding. Canada has not provided military bases to the United States. Anyone can freely enter northern Canada. They can see the small scientific measuring station at Fort Churchill in Manitoba, with fewer than one hundred American soldiers stationed there."
