### Important Resolutions Passed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the KMT: Central Party and Youth League Unified; Seventh National Congress to Convene on May 5th Next Year

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Kuomintang's Fourth Plenary Session held its second meeting at the National Assembly Hall at 3 PM this afternoon. Zou Lu presided over the meeting. The Secretariat reported that 95 Executive Committee members, 32 Alternate Executive Committee members, 42 Supervisory Committee members, 18 Alternate Supervisory Committee members, 262 observers, 28 Central Youth League Affairs personnel, 9 Alternate Affairs personnel, 21 supervisors, and 9 Alternate supervisors were present, constituting a quorum. The following were then discussed: (1) the party's current organizational program proposal; (2) the proposal to unify the central party headquarters and youth league headquarters. Both of these proposals had been passed by the joint conference of the central party and youth league and were presented to this meeting for discussion. As a result of the discussions, both were amended and passed. According to the party's current organizational program, it is the second part of the Kuomintang Reorganization Program. The General Assembly considered that there was no need to separately formulate the current political program and changed the name of the original program to "The Kuomintang's Current Organizational Program" for submission to the plenary session for discussion. Regarding the unification of the central party headquarters and youth league headquarters, except for the modification of the word "uniformly" to "all changed" in the first item of the measures, the rest remained unchanged. (3) The proposal to convene the Seventh National Congress on May 5, 1948, was unanimously approved by acclamation immediately upon its presentation. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM. The draft declaration of the General Assembly prepared by the Declaration Drafting Committee will be presented for discussion tomorrow morning.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The joint conference of the central party and youth league continued at 9:45 AM on the 12th, presided over by President Chiang. The meeting continued to discuss the draft inspection of the Kuomintang Reorganization Program submitted by the Proposal Sorting Committee. The case was divided into two parts: "The Party's Current Political Program" and "The Party's Current Organizational Program". The former was studied in detail and it was considered that there was no need to formulate a new political program for this plenary session. Instead, it should focus on implementing the resolutions made by previous plenary sessions to achieve practical results. Therefore, it was not put to discussion. The organizational program was completely revised and passed. Subsequently, the proposal to unify the central party headquarters and youth league headquarters submitted by the presidium was discussed and also passed with amendments. After the passage of this proposal, President Chiang delivered a brief speech, stating: "This meeting considers this proposal to be the most important. Its passage by the General Assembly fully demonstrates our spirit of unity and lays the foundation for the party's rebirth. It is deeply believed that with this sincere and impartial spirit for the party and the nation, we can guarantee the success of suppressing the rebellion, the realization of the Three Principles of the People, and the completion of national construction." After listening to the instructions, all comrades were greatly inspired and applauded enthusiastically for a long time. The meeting adjourned at 12:01 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Kuomintang's current organizational program was revised and passed by the joint conference of the party and youth league on the morning of the 12th, and then sent to the Second General Assembly of the Fourth Plenary Session for discussion in the afternoon, where it was also approved. During the discussion, the entire case was debated only on two points: the registration of party members' property and the recruitment of party members. Regarding the registration of party members' property, some people believed that if there was no confidence in implementing it thoroughly, it should not be rigidly stipulated. However, this point was still passed. Regarding the recruitment of party members, Sun Ke advocated that freelancers should be recruited, and Liu Jianjing believed that women should also be included. As a result, Shao Lizi said that there was no need to add more items, and it would be appropriate to pay special attention to the recruitment of party members in the original articles. Everyone thought it was very appropriate and it was passed smoothly. Today's meeting proceeded quickly and smoothly, which may have been unexpected. On the morning of the 12th, the President also celebrated the satisfactory results of this harmonious atmosphere. The General Assembly may be closed after the meeting on the 13th.

### Full Meeting of the Central Supervisory Committee: President Instructs to Strengthen Supervisory Work

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Sixth Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang held its fourth plenary meeting at the committee's headquarters on Zhongshan East Road at 1 PM on the 12th. 75 members including Wu Jingheng, Zhang Ji, Wang Chonghui, and Shao Lizi attended. Peng Shaoxiang and Wang Lu, five supervisory committee members from the provincial and municipal party headquarters, were present as observers. Committee member Zhang Ji was elected to preside over the meeting. Secretary-General Di Ying first reported on the work of the committee, followed by a discussion on how to strengthen the party's supervisory power and strictly enforce discipline. Committee members Li Jingzhai, Cao Haosen, Zhang Banghan, Qian Yonghe, Lei Yin, Hu Shuhua, Zhang Mojun, Mao Bingwen, Lin Bin, Deng Qingyang, and observer comrades Zhang Fubin and Peng Shaoxiang expressed their opinions on how to strengthen supervisory power and thoroughly enforce discipline, which were relevant and earnest, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic.

### Rehabilitation Commission to be Established Soon; Subsidies for Public Utilities to be Gradually Reduced; Policy Guidelines for Next Year Will Not be Drafted

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] In order to continue handling rehabilitation and relief affairs and taking over the unfinished business of the UNRRA headquarters that will be closed, the government has determined not to draft national policy guidelines for the period after the implementation of constitutional government, as it would be inappropriate for the current transitional government to do so. In order to prepare the annual budget for the 37th year of the Republic, a Rehabilitation Commission will be formally established soon. The main tasks of the commission are the reconstruction of the Yellow River flood area and the relief of agriculture and fisheries. In addition to establishing a Reconstruction Bureau for the Yellow River Flood Area, it will also organize a Deliberation and Custody Committee for Rehabilitation Affairs to plan financial resources, manage custody, and effectively use materials.

[Another Telegram] During the State Council meeting on the 12th, it was decided on the issue of subsidies for public utilities to gradually reduce them depending on the situation, hoping to completely stop subsidies in the shortest possible time.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The proposal for drafting national policy guidelines for the 37th year of the Republic was previously discussed and resolved at the Executive Yuan meeting. It was considered that since national policy guidelines for the period after the implementation of constitutional government in the 37th year would not be drafted, it would be inappropriate for the current transitional government to do so. In order to prepare the general budget for the 37th year, all ministries and commissions only need to refer to the chapter on basic national policies in the Constitution and the Outline for Implementing Constitutional Government by Mobilizing to Suppress the Rebellion, and formulate the central work for the next year as a basis. The provincial and municipal governments should also follow this procedure when preparing the budget for the next year, so there is no need to draft the national policy guidelines for the next year. It was resolved at the State Council meeting on the 12th that the policy guidelines for the 37th year do not need to be drafted.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The National Government Committee held its eleventh State Council meeting at the National Government Conference Hall at 10 AM on the 12th, presided over by Vice Chairman Sun. 16 members including Zhang Qun, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, and Zou Lu attended. First, according to the agenda, the reporting items were read out: (1) the plan to delineate a period to determine the election units for counties, cities, and equivalent areas; (2) the explanation that incumbent officials running for National Assembly representatives or legislators in the district elections of vocational groups should be subject to legal restrictions. Next, Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi reported on the recent military situation, followed by a discussion of the proposals: (1) the plan to send the impeachment of political officials and supervisory committee members to which agency for handling. It was resolved that the impeachment of political officials and supervisory committee members should be handled by the Political Official Impeachment Committee of the National Government. (2) The draft organization regulations of the Rehabilitation Affairs Committee, which was resolved to be passed and handed over to the Legislative Yuan. (3) The legislative member Lian Shenghai passed away due to illness, and the vacancy was filled by Zeng Ji, which was resolved to be passed. (4) The appointment of Ren Bingjun as a supervisory committee member of the Control Yuan, which was resolved to be passed. (5) Other financial budget proposals were also passed, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.

### Number of National Assembly Representatives for Industrial and Commercial Groups Increased to 68; Allocation Method to be Determined by the Legislative Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The proposal to increase the number of National Assembly representatives for industrial and commercial groups has been passed by the State Council on the 12th, and it has been decided to increase it to 68. The allocation method will be determined by the Legislative Yuan. This important proposal was jointly submitted by the five government committee members Zhang Ji, Shao Lizi, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, and Wu Zhongxin. The main reason is that in recent months, commercial groups in various places have strongly argued for increasing the number of National Assembly representatives and legislators. Although the committee had previously resolved to increase the number of legislators by five, the groups believe that the total number of representatives for industrial and commercial groups is 31, which is 73 less than the previous session, and commercial groups only have 13, which is unfair. It is checked that the allocation of the number of National Assembly representatives in this session, the former National Defense Council had a resolution of "according to the proportion of the previous session", commercial groups should be given a considerable proportion. In terms of the organization of vocational groups, commercial groups are the most long-standing and widespread, and it seems that it is not appropriate to suppress them excessively. Moreover, during the War of Resistance, commercial groups bore a heavy burden, and currently, the suppression of rebellion and national construction still require the business community to bear its economic responsibilities. The allocation of too few places is not enough to show the government's fairness.

### Industrial Circles in Hebei, Pingjin Negotiate to Purchase the China Textile Company

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 12th] The industrial circles in Hebei, Pingjin are actively preparing to negotiate the purchase of the China Textile Company. Shi Zizhou, speaker of the Tianjin Provisional Assembly, said that the China Textile Company is estimated to be worth over 500 billion yuan, and the Tianjin business community can raise 300 billion yuan. The remaining funds and working capital of about 200 billion yuan will be requested from the industrial and commercial circles in Hebei, Peiping, and Henan, Shanxi provinces. Currently, the provisional assemblies and business leaders of Hebei, Pingjin, etc., will jointly telegraph the central government to approve the priority purchase of the China Textile Company.

### Fusi Nian Criticizes, Wedemeyer Issues Statement

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Chinese Senator Fu Sinian told reporters today that 90 percent of Wedemeyer's recent farewell statement in China was completely correct. The biggest shortcoming was that Wedemeyer did not make a quantitative analysis of the Chinese situation. Although the corruption of the National Government is limited to a few officials, these few officials occupy important financial and economic positions, and they should bear the main responsibility for the current situation. China's civil administration can be compared to the United States or other countries, but its military administration is far inferior. It is expected that the National Government will issue a statement on the results of the special envoy's investigation, which will be partly accepted and partly denied. The best assistance the United States can give to China is in administrative management, and it should be accompanied by internal government reorganization. Wedemeyer is quite popular in China, except among the communists. From the perspective of the Kuomintang, his position is even higher than that of Marshal Ma, and he is an ideal US ambassador to China.

### Our Map Printing Plates Seized, Allied Headquarters Orders Japan to Return Them

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Allied Headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to return all 5,270 map printing plates seized from our country during the war to their original owner. The above-mentioned printing plates are for printing maps of mainland China, Northeast China, Korea, Japan, Siberia, the Malayan Federation, and its neighboring areas.

### US Foreign Relief Plan to Begin Implementation in China

[United Press, Washington, 11th] A portion of the United States' $350 million foreign relief plan is expected to be implemented in China within a few weeks. According to a State Department spokesman, negotiations with China on this assistance issue have been protracted and are now nearing completion. After that, relief matters can begin quickly, but the rumors in the Chinese political circles that $30 million has been earmarked for China in this fund are inaccurate, and the amount has not yet been determined.

### Agencies of Various Provinces and Cities Stranded in Shenyang; Advancement Locations Have Been Determined; Chen Cheng Summons Leaders to Instruct on Takeover Matters

[Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 12th] Since Director Chen Cheng has been stationed in Shenyang, a new situation has unfolded in the entire Northeast. The governments of various unrecovered provinces and cities in the Northeast, which have been stranded in Shenyang for more than a year, are preparing to take action and advance to areas close to their respective provinces and cities, so as to be ready to take over at any time. When Chen summoned the leaders of various unrecovered provinces and cities a few days ago, he had instructed the advancement locations, approximately as follows: the government of Andong Province to be advanced to Hailong, the governments of Hejiang and Songjiang Provinces to be advanced to Yongji, the government of Nenjiang Province to the border of Liaobei Province, the governments of Xing'an and Heilongjiang Provinces and the Harbin Municipal Government to be temporarily stationed in Changchun, and the Dalian Municipal Government to remain in Shenyang for the time being. In principle, this is the case. The leaders of various provinces and cities have been holding meetings to discuss this matter, and it is said that they will soon submit their conclusions and difficulties to Chen for final decision.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 12th] Chen Cheng works diligently and lives in the office of the Xing Yuan, sharing meals with senior Xing Yuan personnel. The meals are simple and time-efficient, and banquets are declined. Visitors are not allowed to smoke, and joint office work begins at 8 AM every morning. The heads of various units of the Xing Yuan gather in the director's office on time. The time is determined by the complexity of the affairs, and official business is resolved quickly and conveniently.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 12th] The personnel of the Northeast Xing Yuan are now determined: Zheng Dongguo is the only deputy director, Dong Yingbin is the chief of staff, Dong Yanping is the deputy chief of staff, Chu Xichun is the chief advisor and commander of the Qianfang Defense, Zhang Xueming is the deputy chief advisor, Peng Jiqun is the secretary-general, Che Fanru is the director of the director's office, and Liu Muzeng is the deputy director. In addition, the entire Xing Yuan personnel will be reduced from 600-700 to more than 500 according to the prescribed establishment.

### British Parliamentary Delegation Scheduled to Depart on the 27th

[British News Service, London, 12th] The British Parliamentary Delegation is scheduled to depart for China on the 27th. The London China Association will hold a grand farewell at the Chinese Research Society two days before the delegation leaves the UK.

### Foreign Minister Wang Arrives in New York, Determined to Do Everything Possible to Promote the Success of the United Nations General Assembly

[Our Newspaper News] New York Broadcasting, 12th: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie arrived in New York today to attend the United Nations General Assembly. Those who welcomed him at Port Lagardia Airport included Gu Weijun, Hu Shize, Guo Taiqi, Jiang Tingfu, and Chinese Ambassador to Canada Liu Kai. Wang told reporters that he believes that this meeting is critical to the success or failure of the future of the United Nations, and we should all do our best to promote its success. When asked when peace can be restored in China, Wang replied: "Whether in Asia or Europe, peace must be restored as soon as possible, otherwise the situation will deteriorate and reach a level that the major powers will not be able to control."

### Appeals from Hainan Island

— Bu Shaofu

Random Notes from a Southern Trip, Part Five (Continued)

From the three-hour symposium in the "Coconut Kingdom" and the statements of local people I contacted over the next three days, I concluded that Hainan Island is being poisoned by the words "chaos" and "poverty."

In politics, issues are discussed but not decided, and decisions are made but not implemented (such as reforms). Local officials have responsibility but no authority. Bandit suppression plans repeatedly fail to be carried out, so that robberies on the highway in the Haikou city area have become commonplace. These are all signs of chaos.

Hainan Island's resources cannot be said to be scarce. Rubber, coconut oil, sugar, and seafood are the main products, which can replace part of those from Southeast Asia and Taiwan. In the past, the Japanese were determined to develop this area and established many factories. The Eastern Hydroelectric Power Plant project was intended to supply electricity to the entire island, and even the island's ring railway was planned for electrification. However, after the takeover, theft and dismantling for sale became rampant, and everything fell into disrepair. I once visited a nutrition factory (producing soy sauce and canned goods). The scene made me want to cry. Any Chinese person with a sense of national consciousness would cry upon seeing that situation. Productive enterprises have all been shut down. Good people travel far across the ocean to make a living, while others go into the mountains to become bandits, relying on robbery and looting. As a result, able-bodied men flee. The villages are full of women, children, and the elderly. Therefore, Hainan Island is now only surviving on remittances from overseas Chinese. The only business of several banks in Haikou is to transport banknotes from the mainland.

Preventing a fire before it starts is unrewarding and thankless, and very laborious; but frantically rescuing after a fire has already broken out brings applause and cheers from everyone. This kind of political atmosphere has caused many people to not start with foundational work, but only to think about speculating and seeking shortcuts to gain merit.

Cai Jinjun is in Hainan Island and very much wants to make a difference. He is from Wenchang and is willing to serve his hometown. According to common sense, he would never do anything that would be sorry to the elders and folks in his hometown. Perhaps precisely because he is eager for achievements, some places are inevitably dissatisfied with him. However, this dissatisfaction, when analyzed, is close to destructive criticism. For example, before the War of Resistance, Hainan Island was like a place beyond civilization. When the government orders were unified, the War of Resistance broke out, and it was occupied. Now that victory has been achieved, many unprecedented taxes are suddenly imposed on them, which they cannot understand or tolerate. They mostly believe that this is harassment after the commissioner took office. The illegal corruption during the takeover period is still being discussed by the people of Hainan as a fresh issue. They miss a commander Chen dispatched by Chen Jitang during his rule in Guangdong. They almost emotionally blame all the current suffering on the current situation. This is naturally not a fair judgment.

Being isolated overseas is due to insufficient transportation conditions. This easily creates estrangement and also easily creates corruption. Up to now, there is still no direct ship between Shanghai and Haikou, and there is no regular shipping line between Guangzhou and Haikou, and the air service between Guangzhou and Haikou is only once a week. If this status quo continues, it will be a great obstacle to the development of Hainan Island. Nothing is more urgent than transportation. The biggest frustration for the people on Hainan Island seems to be the feeling of being forgotten by the country.

I mentioned bandits above. In Hainan Island, they are indeed native bandits. This group of desperadoes has no ideology, doctrine, or organization at all. Their so-called "democracy" is nothing more than a cover-up, to make themselves sound louder. Previously, Hong Kong had rumors that Li Jishen had some organized activities and that military supplies were being provided to the bandits on Hainan Island, etc., but the Director of the Headquarters Zhang Fakui and the Bandit Suppression Commander of the Ninth District Cai Jinjun both denied it unanimously. Due to the nature and language, it is almost impossible for a person from another province, or even a Guangdong person from outside Hainan Island, to join the bandits here. This can also be proven by looking at the bandit situation survey statistics chart made by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Precisely because of this situation, the bandits on Hainan Island are both easy and difficult to suppress. Locals who fled to the rear during the War of Resistance, as well as locals who have worked in Southeast Asia for decades, excitedly rushed back to their hometowns after the victory, hoping to see their elders and homeland, but they had to stay in Haikou, look at their homeland dozens of miles away, and return home. How can they not feel sorrow?

Politics is more important than military affairs. At least in Hainan Island, this is the supreme guiding principle for bandit suppression. The current authorities are currently doing their best to conduct a thorough census of households and establish a chain of Baojia system. If this is done thoroughly, it will definitely be effective in eliminating banditry. However, at the same time, it is also necessary to start from the economic aspect to stabilize the people's lives. (End)

### Bandits in Central Anhui Plot to Invade Hefei; Situation in Lushi County, Western Henan, Unclear

[Special Dispatch from Hefei, This Newspaper, 12th] (1) Liu Bocheng's troops, numbering tens of thousands, having fled from the foothills of Dabie Mountain and invaded western and central Anhui, capturing Tongcheng and Lijiang, are attempting to cross the Yangtze River southward. The bandit forces in Lu'an, Huoshan, and Shucheng are still resisting stubbornly and are active northward along the Shu-He Highway, seemingly to support the crossing of the river. However, the Anqing and Guichi areas along the river are heavily defended, and the bandit forces' attempt is unlikely to succeed. (2) Two to three thousand bandit troops who fled from Tao Xi Town and harassed Nan Huazi Gang and Dong Gang (60 li from Hefei) have engaged in fierce battles with the national army for several days. The bandit troops in Dong Gang were ambushed by the national army on the night of the 11th, suffering casualties. The national army seized one heavy machine gun and more than ten rifles. (3) The national army, having recovered Shangcheng, crossed the mountains to pursue the bandits towards Lihuang. Another unit of the national army encountered more than 800 bandit troops in the northeast of Shangcheng and engaged in a fierce battle, killing 500 bandit troops and capturing a large amount of supplies. (4) "Local Communists" are active in the border area between Chao and He. The Jiong River bridge on the Huainan Railway was damaged and is being repaired.

[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, This Newspaper, 12th] After Shangcheng was recovered, the bandits fled towards Lu'an. On the evening of the 11th, the national army pursued them to an abandoned temple south of the city, annihilating a bandit battalion, seizing three heavy machine guns, and capturing many prisoners. The bandits in Lu'an are panicked by the advance of strong units of the national army from Anqing. On the 11th, a group of bandits from Huo and Shucheng reached Huazi Gang south of Hefei. The Hefei strike force has reached Fifty Li Pu, blocking the bandits' advance. It is also learned that a strong national army unit is advancing rapidly from He County towards Shucheng.

### Many Enemy and Puppet Properties in Northeast China Not Yet Transferred

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] The total value of enemy and puppet properties already taken over in Northeast China is 1.2 trillion current notes, but only 3 billion yuan have been processed for transfer. Because the central agencies often misunderstand "takeover" and "take possession," many of the enemy properties taken over have not been processed or transferred, and they want to obtain property rights. The local governments also often believe that enemy and puppet properties should be returned to the local governments and allow the local governments to use them. This is indeed a misunderstanding. The takeover work in the Northeast has passed, and the main focus now is on accurate figures for compensation claims against Japan.

### Political Integrity in One Corner of Shandong Province; Communism Unable to Invade; American Reporter Praises Commissioner Zhang's Achievements

[United States Information Service, New York, 11th] The New York Herald Tribune commented on the Chinese situation yesterday, saying: "In Shandong Province, China, a reporter for the Howard newspaper found several districts where communism has never gained a foothold. This reporter, Mr. Newton, inquired about the reason why the Red Army could not enter this area, because these situations are very satisfactory from the American point of view. He learned that the commissioner of this area, Zhang Tianzuo (transliteration), is an honest man who is doing sound work like in any war zone. General Zhang's problems are of course difficult, but he has solved them one by one. He organized a committee to transport supplies by plane and export local products at the same time. The section of the Jiaoji Railway under his jurisdiction is open and unobstructed, although other places have been destroyed by the Communist Party. He taxes merchants, but he did not put the money into his own pocket. He used the money to feed tens of thousands of refugees. He organized an obstetrics hospital. He obtained many books and built many schools for rural children. He used DDT to kill insects, thereby improving the general health of the people. His work, beyond the expectations of any Chinese, made it impossible for communism to arouse people's interest in this area."

### Bai Chongxi's Military Report at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang – Full Text (Continued from Yesterday)

(3) Compensation for Casualties and Placement of Disabled Soldiers: 1. Officer and Soldier Compensation: Regarding the disbursement of compensation measures by this Headquarters in the past year, the main points are described as follows: (1) Revising the system, relaxing the standards for documentation, and striving for accuracy and preventing abuse; revising the procedures for dependents to receive compensation; comforting the families of officers captured or missing in action; adjusting compensation payments in a timely manner by referencing the standards for army payments and the amount of severance pay. (2) Simplifying procedures, promoting postal salary payments, simplifying compensation claim procedures, widely establishing compensation inquiry offices, and simplifying the twelve types of application forms into one each for "injury" and "death" compensation claims, which are produced and distributed to post offices, institutions, troops, and local governments for claimants to use. (3) Strengthening manpower, establishing battlefield compensation agencies to assess and disburse compensation locally. (4) Entrusting medical examinations to military or public hospitals in various regions to save claimants from difficulties. (5) Establishing a compensation fund management committee to earmark compensation funds as a special national fund, not included in military expenditures, to protect the legal rights of compensation recipients. (6) Issuing honorary certificates, conducting commendations, awards, honoring the loyal and brave, erecting monuments, and holding public funerals. (7) Providing preferential treatment for employment, job referrals, accommodation, education, and free schooling for the children of the injured, disabled, and deceased soldiers. (8) For the reward and compensation of civil servants who die in the line of duty while defending territory, this Headquarters will first investigate the circumstances of the operation and make a preliminary assessment before submitting it to the Executive Yuan. 2. Placement of Disabled Soldiers: During China's war of resistance against Japan, over 70,000 soldiers were disabled due to injuries. The rehabilitation of these disabled soldiers, in addition to consolidating and streamlining management institutions, will be handled by the relevant departments to properly draft a placement plan. The main points are roughly divided into the following categories: (1) Those with homes to return to will be sent back to their hometowns. (2) Those who had vocational skills before enlisting and whose disability does not hinder their work will be allowed to resume their former occupations. (3) Those who are unable to resume their former occupations due to disability or who had no vocational skills will be given vocational retraining and job placement assistance. (4) Those who volunteer to farm will be granted land for cultivation. (5) Young people with considerable academic qualifications who volunteer to continue their studies will be given opportunities for advanced education. (6) Those who have completely lost their ability to work and have no homes to return to will continue to be supported in hospitals. To implement the above plan, the first step should be to carry out retirement and demobilization, with the government issuing relatively generous retirement or demobilization pay. Those who wish to return to their hometowns will be given sufficient travel expenses. Thereafter, whether returning to their hometowns, finding employment, being granted land, or pursuing education, disabled soldiers will continue to receive annual stipends for life to demonstrate respect for virtue and reward for merit. Although the amount of this expenditure is large, it still depends on the government's efforts to pay it. However, if the above plan is to be fully implemented: 1. Transportation throughout the country must be unimpeded, and social order must be restored; 2. The economy must return to normal, and agriculture, industry, and commerce must be widely developed. Since the communist bandits have not yet been completely eliminated in various regions, the above conditions are not yet met. The placement of disabled soldiers is planned to start in the southeast and southwest provinces first, and then gradually extended to the North China provinces.

(4) Rectification of Military Discipline and Harmony in the Lives of Officers and Soldiers: 1. Rectification of Military Discipline: Military discipline is the lifeblood of the army. The Headquarters has been constantly working on this, mainly focusing on direct management, establishing supervisory systems at all levels, and supplementing them with military police forces. The methods are as follows: 1. Organizing supervisory institutions for various headquarters and garrison commands. 2. Planning to dispatch supervisory officers to units and agencies above the division level to implement comprehensive supervision. 3. Training supervisory personnel at the Central Training Corps and assigning them to posts. 4. Subordinate units are mainly supervised by their superiors, supplemented by the strength of the military police. 2. Military Justice and Handling of War Criminals: 1. Military justice organs at all levels have established military procuratorate sections or procurators. From June 1946 to July 1947, 6,882 procuratorial cases were handled, 457 cases were directly tried, and 5,117 cases were concluded. 2. It is currently planned to establish military justice supervision and enforcement agencies in various railway line areas. 3. Regarding the handling of war criminals, separate military courts have been established in various regions. A total of 782 cases have been tried and concluded, with 93 people sentenced to death, and 699 people are still detained in various regions. 4. In order to centrally execute war criminals sentenced to imprisonment, preparations are being made to establish a war criminal prison in Shanghai for management. 3. Regarding Harmony in the Lives of Officers and Soldiers, in order to prevent soldiers' lives from becoming monotonous and to prevent the lives of officers and soldiers from becoming disconnected, to achieve a state where the troops are like a family and the troops are like a school, the main points of the Headquarters' measures are as follows: 1. The key points of the News Bureau's Implementation Outline for News Work, compiled this year, are to guide officers and soldiers to pay attention to nutrition, practice a new life, guide soldiers to organize food management committees, assist in organizing and arranging the environment of the camp, and improve health and medicine. Currently, 15,365 Sun Yat-sen Clubs have been established in various units, and singing, acting, and film screenings are held for all officers and soldiers from time to time to promote noble entertainment. 2. Advocating a new atmosphere of openness in opinions, transparency in management, fairness in judgment, and impartiality in rewards and punishments; organizing discipline supervision and evaluation committees, current affairs forums, and group discussions. 3. In order to make officers and soldiers one entity and have consistent lives, the Implementation Measures for Examining the Lives of Officers and Soldiers have been formulated, stipulating that unit leaders at all levels, along with news workers, should inspect one company every day to examine the living conditions of officers and soldiers, and operate and eat together with officers and soldiers. 4. Regarding material and spiritual comfort for wounded and sick officers and soldiers, the Headquarters stipulates that unit leaders and news workers should visit and comfort them once a week, or send representatives to visit and comfort them, but unit leaders should still visit and comfort them once a month. (To be continued)

Editorial

### The City Budget for 1948

The city budget for 1948 has been roughly drafted: the total amount of revenue and expenditure is 983,819,219,944 yuan each. Revenue and expenditure are balanced, which is gratifying.

It was rumored a few days ago that the total amount of expenditure budgets proposed by various city government units actually reached 2,147,612,133,719 yuan, exceeding revenue by 1,163,792,913,775 yuan. Such a huge deficit has caused deep anxiety to all those concerned about the city's finances, fearing that the excessive imbalance would make it impossible to prepare the budget for the next year, and fearing that large amounts of revenue would have to be raised to offset the deficit, leading to a sudden increase in the burden on citizens. However, the final figures for revenue and expenditure are barely balanced, and no new sources of taxation have been opened up. The key lies in distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent matters, and classifying the huge amount of overspending of more than one trillion yuan under the so-called new business expenses, to be raised separately and treated as a pending issue. In fact, this is equivalent to a disguised rejection. This is not only a clever technique in budget preparation, but also a necessary measure within the authority of the competent authorities. Because it is not easy for local governments to formulate a complete policy plan due to various constraints. Each unit determines its needs based on what it sees, and the total amount of expenditure is naturally difficult to match the total amount of revenue. And at a time when everything is waiting to be rebuilt and prices are soaring, how can the costs requested not exceed revenue? Under such circumstances, if the competent authorities accept everything without approval or rejection, they will inevitably be forced to exhaust all resources and greatly increase the burden, leading to a deadlock. Therefore, establishing a separate item and temporarily treating it as a pending issue is considered a human effort to seek moderation. Those that should be explicitly rejected may be explicitly rejected; those that should be postponed may be decided to be postponed; this is a common practice in budget preparation and an unavoidable fact. We are not saying that there is nothing important among the so-called new business ventures, but rather that the original demands of various units are not necessarily unimportant. However, limited by financial resources, there is no way to meet them, so it is necessary to consider priorities and make choices.

There are several points in this draft budget that are worth noting: (1) The salaries of staff are calculated based on the actual number of staff this year, so the rumor of further downsizing is likely to be unreliable; or at least, the city government is always advocating maintaining the status quo. (2) The item of temporary expenses is listed as three times the original budget and additional budget for this year. Whether this estimate is accurate remains to be proven by future facts, but it can also provide a glimpse into the future trend of prices. (3) However, the two items of regular expenses and living allowances are all approved according to the current payment standards. Living allowances are stipulated by the central government, and aside from earmarking reserves to cope with them, there is currently no way to estimate them; but since regular expenses have not increased, it is questionable whether there will be difficulties in the future. (4) The revenue for the so-called new business expenses has not yet been secured, and could originally be postponed across the board. However, it is said that several of the increased expenses have been approved and are deemed necessary. Although this amount is not large, it must be adjusted separately to ensure its availability.

The above is in terms of expenditure. In terms of revenue, the amount listed this year is 253,590,266,722 yuan, an increase of 730,228,953,222 yuan. It is said that this figure was estimated accurately and there should be no abuse of collecting revenue without actual expenditure. However, although inheritance tax has been included according to precedent, there has never been any revenue from it. After the special business tax was transferred to the central government, the business tax listed at 120 billion yuan is still more than double that of this year, and the entertainment tax listed at 80 billion yuan is also 52.8 billion yuan more than this year. Given that the ban on dancing is inevitable, it is worth noting how reliable these revenue estimates will be in reality.

In this autumn of volatile prices, preparing a budget is an extremely difficult task. There are still four months before the implementation of the new budget, and even if the current estimates are very accurate, it is still questionable whether they will conform to reality by then. For example, this year's budget was originally just over 240 billion yuan, but according to the accounting office, the actual expenditure by the end of the year is likely to exceed 500 billion yuan. Therefore, looking at the budget alone, its practical significance is far less important than in times of peace. Therefore, while efforts must be made to ensure that revenue and expenditure are realistic in order to compile a good budget, on the other hand, it is necessary to hope that the overall economy will improve, strive to stabilize prices and the value of currency, and ensure that tax revenues are surplus rather than deficit, so that various budgets can gradually approach the ideal.

### All Countries Should Cooperate to Stabilize Global Currency and Finance. The Far East Needs Assistance More Than Europe. The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Expresses Incisive Views.

[Reuters, London, December 12] The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Gutt, today submitted his annual report to the boards of directors of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund, stating that the Far East needs more monetary assistance than Europe. The economies of China, Burma, the Philippines, and other countries invaded by Japan are extremely devastated. Without monetary assistance, the recovery of world trade may be delayed for decades. The reconstruction of Europe is mostly a matter of substance, while the destruction in the Far East has struck the very foundation of the global monetary system. The world cannot prosper if the Far East is bankrupt. Although inflation in China may seem unrelated to other countries, the decline in the value of the Chinese currency will harm U.S. trade, leading to problems such as unemployed workers. World trade is currently showing a significant imbalance. The evils of war are not even half as bad as global bankruptcy. The recovery of the world economy is the most urgent task at present. The sixteen European countries are currently negotiating the needs of European reconstruction in Paris, but is this enough? All countries of the world should consult together to find a mutual assistance system. Compared to the needs of Europe, the Far East pales in comparison. It is hoped that all countries of the world can immediately pay attention to the economic chaos in Asia, especially China.

[Associated Press, London, December 12] The President of the International Bank, McCloy, today issued his annual report to the Board of Directors, stating that the major problems of European reconstruction are still food, fuel, and manpower. Europe itself must make significant contributions to solving these problems. External assistance is indeed important, but it is only a small part of the overall effort. The situation in some countries is indeed noteworthy, but there is no doubt that European countries can continue to take beneficial and important steps. One of the most important steps is to restore financial stability, which must start with balancing the budget, sound taxation, and striving to economize on unnecessary expenditures. In addition, the financial development plans of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America will soon be of major concern to the Bank. Of course, the Bank cannot do everything on its own, and cannot even complete a major portion of this task.

### Economic Report of Sixteen European Countries. Clayton Expresses Dissatisfaction. Reconstruction Efforts in Western Europe Encounter Setbacks.

[Reuters, Paris, December 11] U.S. Undersecretary of State Clayton's harsh criticism of the report of the conference of sixteen European countries discussing the Marshall Plan may lead to a revision of the report, and the final plenary session of the sixteen-nation conference, originally scheduled for Monday, may also be postponed.

Clayton met with the five-member executive committee of the sixteen-nation conference, namely the liaison body between the sixteen-nation European Economic Cooperation Committee and the expert committee, at the U.S. Embassy here yesterday, explaining the U.S. response to the conference's report for two hours. His main criticisms were: (1) Lack of adequate provisions for mutual assistance among the sixteen countries; (2) The needs figures presented in the report are collective needs figures, without the needs figures for each individual country; (3) The recommendations regarding the restoration of European currency exchange lack accuracy. Clayton also pointed out that European countries have not actively abolished trade barriers between them. In addition, European countries have not reached an understanding to allow surplus labor and materials in one country to be used by other European countries lacking such labor and materials. Clayton also said that the sixteen European countries were invited to prepare a joint report, which does not mean that each country does not need to discuss individually with the United States. In fact, the United States intends to conclude individual agreements with each country. According to people at the sixteen-nation conference, the failure of the report to distinguish between the needs of each country was due to the British delegation. Because the European balance of payments is mostly due to Britain, the British delegation supported submitting collective figures. The report of the sixteen-nation conference was submitted on September 8, estimating that the total trade deficit of the sixteen European countries with the American continent in the next four years will be $22.499 billion, including $8.049 billion in 1948, $6.35 billion in 1949, $4.65 billion in 1950, and $3.45 billion in 1951.

### The U.S. Considers It Difficult to Reinstate the Lend-Lease Act.

[United Press, London, December 11] High-level sources here said that Britain had almost made a suggestion to the United States to implement a lend-lease ordinance in peacetime, but the United States has rejected it. It is reported that U.S. representatives attending the International Bank and Monetary Fund meeting, in response to inquiries about whether Britain had directly proposed to the United States a peacetime aid to post-war chaotic countries, said that this may be the case, but refused to explain the details. Therefore, it is expected that the United States has considered it impossible to implement and has rejected it.

### Britain Adopts New Measures to Economize on U.S. Dollar Spending.

Book Imports Also Require Permits.

[Reuters, London, December 12] The British government announced two new measures this morning to economize on U.S. dollar import restrictions, just hours before Commerce Secretary Cripps went to Dorchester House to announce his increased export plan to 5,000 business and labor leaders.

Music and advertising materials are also subject to the same restrictions. Foreign magazines, English novels, and children's books have already adopted the import permit system. The new measures announced today will subject almost all types of printed matter to the same restrictions. At the same time, the Ministry of Food also announced that before reissuing a notice, it will immediately restrict the import of certain kinds of fruits, such as melons, peaches, and plums. Other certain fruits and vegetables, such as small lemons, figs, dried plums, and cucumbers, etc., must use individual import permits.

### The United Nations General Assembly is Approaching. Marshall Departs for New York. Three Major Issues Urgently Need to Be Addressed by the General Assembly.

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, December 12 Broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly, which will be held next Tuesday, will be extremely important for world peace. The agenda is full of explosive issues. According to well-informed sources, the United States is determined to have a showdown with the Soviet Union at this meeting, which can be proven by Marshall's personal attendance.

[Associated Press, Washington, December 12] Secretary of State Marshall departed from here today for New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, which opens on the 16th of this month. Marshall's advisors said that Marshall's letter to the General Assembly on Wednesday will be a major revelation of U.S. policy in order to win over countries between the non-Soviet and the Soviet-American blocs. He will clearly state that the United States will become the cornerstone of its foreign policy.

The United States' past performance has not been fully accepted by the world. Marshall's strong reputation and his assumption of the position of head of the U.S. delegation will increase U.S. power. Another of Marshall's goals is to establish a "border monitoring" team in Greece despite Soviet opposition. The Soviet Union has vetoed the U.S.'s efforts in this regard in the Security Council. Marshall's opponent on the Soviet side is Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky.

[Reuters, Lake Success, December 12] The current United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on September 16 at Flushing Meadow in New York.

Concerned observers predict that this General Assembly will be the last chance to restore the reputation of the United Nations organization. Even the most optimistic observers recognize that this General Assembly will be a turning point in the history of the United Nations organization, and success or failure depends on this. The Balkan issue, the veto issue, and the Palestine issue are all important issues that must be addressed at this General Assembly.

[Reuters, Tehran, December 11] The U.S. Ambassador to Iran, Allen, said in a speech to the Iranian-American Relations Association today that the United States supports Iran's freedom to decide how to dispose of its resources. Iran's resources belong to Iran and may be given to others or rejected at a high price. The United States does not ask whether the proposals are commercial, but if such proposals are accompanied by hostile threats or dangerous statements, the United States cannot help but express its concern. The United States has the determination to eliminate the threat of aggression in the world, and the Iranian people can trust the U.S.'s decision to support Iran's freedom of choice. Allen's speech came as the Iranian parliament is about to discuss and approve the Iranian-Soviet oil agreement, which is obviously intended.

### While Investigating the Indonesian-Dutch Ceasefire Situation, British and Australian Consuls-General Were Sniped At. Order is Chaotic in the Dutch-Occupied Zone of Java.

[Reuters, Batavia, December 11] The Dutch news agency said that the acting British Consul-General in Batavia, Lambert, and the Australian Consul-General in Batavia, Eden, were shot at while inspecting the Dutch military area in Malang District, eastern Java. The two were invited by the Security Council to investigate the implementation of the ceasefire order. They left Batavia on Tuesday for Surabaya and then went to Malang for inspection.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, December 11] My Consul-General in Batavia, Chiang Chia-tung, has returned to Batavia after inspecting various places for two days with the Belgian consul. According to Chiang, the city of Sukabumi is unstable even during the day. Indonesians of the Republic of Indonesia with guns often kill and loot. For example, the day before yesterday, a Chinese woman and her son-in-law were killed in their home four kilometers from the city.

[Central News Agency, New York, December 11] Dutch Governor-General Van Mook denied that Chinese participated in the Dutch army, and also did not believe the Indonesian reports that some Chinese participated in the Indonesian war against the Dutch.

### Wallace Speech: Criticizes US Foreign Policy, Especially Harshly Attacks Hoover's Line

[United Press International, New York, 11th] Today marked the one-week anniversary of Wallace's forced resignation. Wallace delivered a speech in Madison Square Garden, where a large crowd filled all the seats. Wallace stated that the United States is currently implementing the reactionary foreign policy led by former President Hoover. Since his speech last year attacking the United States' "hardline" foreign policy towards the Soviet Union, the Democratic and Republican parties have entered an anti-communist race, which will breed hatred and fear of war. Wallace attacked the "so-called liberals," who have criticized Hoover's economic and political views on domestic affairs, but have turned a blind eye to the fact that US foreign policy is following Hoover's line. Wallace said, "Some accuse us of trying to control the Democratic Party, but it is more accurate to say that we are trying to prevent the Democratic Party from committing suicide. Military personnel and investment bankers are now manipulating foreign policy; under the Republican Party, Wall Street controlled America, and under the current government, Wall Street is determined to control the world." If Hoover's ideas "continue to be the compass for our country's foreign policy," then all the sacrifices made during the war will have been in vain. America's current foreign policy is carried out in the name of freedom, but it actually protects reactionaries. The sooner we know its true nature, the sooner we can avoid war, without having to spend heavily on preparing for war.

### Yoshida Shigeru Confirms He Will Form a New Political Party

Ashida Claims Peace Treaty Can Be Signed Next Spring

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Yoshida Shigeru, president of the Liberal Party, who was recently giving speeches while travelling in Hokkaido, firmly stated yesterday at the city branch convention of the party in Asahikawa City, regarding the recent rumors of forming a new party movement: in order to save the national crisis, it is necessary to have two major political parties standing side by side and competing with each other to seek progress. Recently, there have been rumors that I intend to form a new party, but in fact, there are no concrete activities yet. I only hope that a strong cabinet will be responsible for the peace conference, and therefore I keenly feel the necessity of forming a strong and unified conservative party with the Liberal Party as the center.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Foreign Minister Ashida, who arrived in Osaka on the 11th, said: judging from the general situation, the peace treaty with Japan may be signed next spring.

### Japanese Cabinet Passes Economic Decentralization Plan; Fierce Debate to Unfold in Parliament; MacArthur's Headquarters Refuses to Withdraw Order

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The Katayama Cabinet today passed an economic decentralization plan, which will soon be submitted to Parliament for discussion. It is reported that this plan, which is being hotly debated by the Japanese government and the public, was given to the Katayama Cabinet by the Allied Headquarters. Katayama had an audience with MacArthur and his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Mueller, to request the withdrawal of the order, but was unsuccessful. The economic decentralization plan aims to smash the Japanese zaibatsu organizations and prevent the revival of any future monopoly control, but most people in the Japanese financial and economic circles believe that this plan will fragment Japan's economy. Chief Cabinet Secretary Nishio Suehiro declared today that the Cabinet will take the most prudent attitude so that the plan does not affect Japan's peacetime economic production and avoid causing "unease and disturbances." It is expected that after the new plan is submitted to Parliament, it will become an explosive center of debate.

### Four Banks and Two Bureaus Scheduled to Reduce Salaries; All Employees Submit Appeals; Representatives Say the Salaries of Low-Wage Employees Will Be Reduced the Most; Others Claim that Lower-Level Employees Will Not Be Greatly Affected

Employees of national banks and bureaus will have their salaries reduced as scheduled, starting with the payment of salaries on the 20th of this month. Employees of the respective banks and bureaus are extremely apprehensive about this and have already collectively signed documents to appeal to the persons in charge of the respective banks and bureaus not to reduce salaries and allowances. According to employee representatives, the numbers of the salary cuts are the same for everyone; according to this proportion, employees with lower base salaries will have their salaries reduced the most, and employees with higher salaries will have their salaries reduced the least. If this request is unsuccessful, they will continue to fight for it. Currently, the treatment of employees in the national banks and bureaus is not high, while the treatment of civil servants is too low. Therefore, if they want to improve administrative efficiency and enable civil servants to work with peace of mind, it is better to increase the treatment of civil servants.

According to a reliable source at the Central News Agency yesterday, there are no concrete plans for layoffs in national banks and bureaus. As for treatment, the Joint Treasury has already given instructions to the national banks and bureaus in accordance with the orders of the Executive Yuan, and the banks and bureaus will make reasonable adjustments in accordance with the regulations. It is also understood that there is currently no significant difference between the salaries of senior and junior employees in the national banks and bureaus. Since the outbreak of the war, the national banks and bureaus have fully taken into account the lives of low-level employees when adjusting their salaries, and the lower the base salary, the higher the increase multiple. If compared with the treatment of bank employees before the war, the difference in multiples between senior and junior employees has gradually decreased, almost approaching. Therefore, low-level employees will definitely not be particularly affected by this salary reduction. The rumors that the treatment of trainees and clerks will be discounted by 60% or 70% are completely untrue.

### Civil Servant Salaries to Be Calculated According to Index; Senators Jiang Hao and Others Make This Suggestion

[Our Newspaper] The fourth meeting of the Municipal Senate is about to be held, and it has received proposals from senators for several days. As of yesterday, there were a total of nineteen proposals, including those from Jiang Hao, Gao Shuan, and others, to stabilize the lives of civil servants, eliminate poverty and corruption, encourage the able and virtuous to enter politics, and improve political efficiency. They requested that the central government handle two points: (1) Regarding the adjustment of civil servant salaries, 1. Refer to the precedent of the Executive Yuan's Bureau of Material Supply, and civil servant salaries should be issued uniformly according to the cost of living index, starting from October of this year. 2. All cost-of-living subsidies and in-kind benefits previously given should be cancelled after the adjustment. 3. The additional expenses required after the adjustment should be handled by the Ministry of Finance in a unified manner to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. (2) Regarding the effective implementation of the personnel system, 1. Current civil servants who have been qualified by the Ministry of Civil Service Affairs or through selection should be guaranteed, and supervisors should not arbitrarily change them in the future unless they have made mistakes. 2. Those who have passed the examination but have not yet been employed should be assigned to jobs. 3. Those who have not been qualified should be gradually eliminated. 4. After the implementation of constitutional government, administrative officials should be employed through examinations.

Shi Bangfan also proposed a plan to organize the Shanghai Municipal Air Defense Headquarters as soon as possible, and Zhang Yiqu and others proposed to establish at least five municipal national schools in the Lao Zha District. The reason is that the district pays the most taxes, but no national school has been established there.

The students feel very difficult in their daily lives at school. Now, as the school year is approaching, there is a risk of dropping out. Fortunately, the leaders of Sichuan have enthusiastically done good deeds, which has greatly benefited the youth.

On May 18th, Xie introduced Chen Wuhua, the chief of the first section of the third division of the bureau, and Ding Aichang, the chief of the second section of the third division, to Chen Delai at the Mainland Hotel to discuss the tax investigation methods.

Bar Hostesses Also Subject to Crackdown

Regarding the issue of banning dancing in Shanghai, Secretary-General Shen Zonglian of the Municipal Government, who recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, told reporters yesterday that the ban on dancing in Shanghai is inevitable. Minister Zhang Lisheng of the Ministry of Interior has expressed his views on this issue, stating that it can be extended to the end of this year. Within this deadline, phased bans or lottery elimination methods can be adopted, and the Municipal Government will formulate and implement the specific measures. When asked whether bar and nightclub hostesses and dance schools are also subject to the ban, Shen replied that hostesses are also engaged in business activities and should be subject to the ban. Dance schools, although teaching dance skills, do not necessarily train dancers, so a ban can be postponed. The Municipal Government will strive for thoroughness when formulating the ban on dancing, to ensure that there will be no "disguised" commercial dance halls discovered.

### Father Unfatherly, Daughter Undaughterly: Meeting in Court; Elderly Man Accuses Daughter of Abandonment; Cursed as "Little Ghost" in Court

[Our Own Dispatch] Li Buying sued his biological daughter, Li Bilian, for abandoning a direct blood relative of the senior generation. The case was heard in the local court yesterday by Judge Xie Zhiying. Li Buying married Li Meihua early in life, and the following year they had a daughter named Bilian. In August of the 12th year of the Republic [1923], the couple disagreed and divorced. Bilian, who was ten years old at the time, left with her mother. Her mother remarried to a man surnamed Dong, and since then there had been no communication. Recently, due to old age, poverty, and illness, Li Buying remembered his biological daughter from whom he had been separated for more than twenty years. After several inquiries, he learned that Bilian had married Tian Yongsheng. He wanted to re-establish the father-daughter relationship and have her responsible for his support. Bilian ignored him, so Li Buying filed a lawsuit in the local court. According to Li Bilian's testimony yesterday: "Thirty years old, from Hangzhou, formerly a prostitute, previously married to Tian Yongsheng, now divorced. There is no father-daughter relationship with Li Buying." Li Buying still wanted to assert his authority as a father, saying to Bilian: "You have to speak properly in court." Bilian cursed: "Strange, why should I let you tell me how to speak, you little ghost." According to Li Buying: "I don't want money, I just want my daughter back, to seek family reunion." After the questioning, the court adjourned the hearing for further trial.

### Rescuing Out-of-School Children, Eliminating Illiteracy: Earnestly Hoping for Wide Response from Readers, Fulfilling the Mission of the Aid-to-Education Movement

After eight years of arduous and magnificent national resistance, China has leaped from the status of a semi-colonial country to become one of the five major powers. This victorious result was achieved by the flesh and blood of our fellow countrymen. Now that the enemy has been defeated, our motherland should embark on the broad road to prosperity. Every Chinese citizen has a sacred mission to maintain this victorious result. To maintain this result, we must first conduct a strict self-examination and critique. We must frankly and consciously examine everything about ourselves. Are our industries up to the standard of a strong power? Can our culture be classified as strong? We should frankly admit that all our cultural construction is still far from the standard of a strong power!

Among the five major powers, China still has the most illiterates, as well as the most out-of-school youth. Dear readers, every Chinese citizen has a mission to eliminate illiteracy and rescue out-of-school children. If you have spare time, you should voluntarily teach an illiterate person to recognize the writing of the motherland. If you have money, you should donate some to poor young people so that they can continue

For this reason, we launched the "Reader Aid-to-Education Movement" on August 22nd, widely soliciting donations from the community. For the future of the motherland, for the rise and fall of the nation, every Chinese citizen should shoulder this sacred mission, which is: "Rescue out-of-school children, eliminate illiteracy!"

### Eight Times the Regular Tax Levied, No Receipts Given for Surtax: Director of the Xuzhou Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Shao Zulan, Gross Corruption: Conclusive Evidence Prosecuted by the Local Court

[Our Own Dispatch from Xuzhou, 10th] The major corruption case of Shao Shenglan, Director of the Xuzhou Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and Cheng Xiugang, auditor and business section chief of the bureau, which caused a sensation in the nine counties and cities of Xuzhou and Maba, has been investigated and tried by the Xuzhou Local Court Prosecutor's Office since the 22nd of last month. The investigation has now been concluded and it has been determined that the evidence is conclusive and the corruption is true. Public prosecution was initiated on the 9th of this month. According to this year's profit tax collection system for business operations, there are two types: (1) Account Audit Taxation System, which is to check the accounts and calculate the tax amount to be collected based on the profit amount obtained this year; (2) Standard Tax Calculation System, which is to sample the accounts, calculate the classification of capital turnover rate and classification of net profit rate to determine the tax amount to be taxed. This city was originally a standard tax calculation system, but Shao Zulan, director of the Direct Tax Bureau of this city, and Cheng Xiugang, chief of the business section, used their authority to collect so-called "surtax" when collecting the profit tax for the 35th year of the Republic [1946]. In April of this year, when Shao and Cheng investigated the business situation and exchanged opinions with the various trade associations of this city, they said that the profit tax for this city this year must be collected according to the account audit taxation system, in order to intimidate various merchants, and declared that it must be collected at eight times the total amount collected last year as the standard. As a result of Shao and Cheng's haggling with various trade associations, the regular tax was collected at four times last year, and a "surtax" of 50% to 70% was also required. When collecting the "surtax", no receipts were given, saying that it was collected on behalf of the bureau. Subsequently, the silk, department store, watch, stationery, and rice trade associations of this city, in order to avoid account audits, endured and paid the "surtax" in full. The amount of "surtax" admitted to be paid by each industry is 10 million yuan at most and 5 million yuan at least. With 50 industries in the city, the average is 6 million yuan per industry, then the amount of illegal extortion by Shao and Cheng should be more than 300 million yuan. The illegal behavior of this massive corruption case was reported by Bethlehem and other merchants in this city. Upon receiving the report, the Xuzhou Municipal Council, after many days of investigation, obtained conclusive evidence. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Finance, the Executive Yuan, and the Supervisory Office in the name of the Municipal Council, all the documents were transferred to the Xuzhou Local Court Prosecutor's Office for reference. After the case occurred, Shao Zulan, in order to silence the witness, quickly transferred Cheng Xiugang, the business section chief who had collected the money, out of Xuzhou. Later, Wang Songling, supervisor of the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau, came to Xuzhou under orders to investigate. After Wang returned to the District Bureau, he telegraphed the Xuzhou Municipal Council: "Chief Cheng Xiugang of the Bureau does have suspicions of malfeasance." He lightly shifted the massive corruption case of Shao Zulan to Cheng alone, which made local people very angry. Fortunately, the case has been prosecuted by the Local Court Prosecutor's Office, and all parties are now quietly watching how the state will punish the scene of corruption.

### Zibo Mining Area Survey: "House of Struggle"

[Our Zichuan Dispatch on the 6th] Recently, the communist bandits have dug the trenches of class struggle deeper and wider. From "land struggle" of "returning land to the home" to "property struggle" of "sweeping out the door," and recently progressing from "sweeping out the door" to "bloody struggle" of "stones stewed with meat," the blood feuds of the human world have become increasingly fierce!

During my visit to Zibo this time, I interviewed several "houses of struggle." One of them was the family of a colleague, Mr. Cheng Baihua, a current reporter for the Jinan Zheng Bao newspaper. He lived at No. 23, Houjie Street, Taiwei Temple. His father operated a Zhenye coal mine with a daily output of over one hundred tons of coal. During the period when the communist bandits occupied Chuanshan, his

entire family fled

to Jinan. When the bandits launched the struggle, they had no choice but to write his father's name on a piece of paper to represent him. Then, they gathered the people to hold a struggle meeting, during which all the furniture in his house and the equipment in the mine were completely struggled away. Another family was that of Zhang Huanzhen, a highly respected and impartial gentleman widely recognized in Boshan. Whenever people in Boshan had any difficult disputes that could not be resolved, they would be resolved by him and everyone would be convinced. Zhang is now seventy-eight years old, a former Qing Dynasty Jinshi (successful candidate in the imperial examination) who served as a magistrate and was the president of the Chamber of Commerce in this county for ten years. His son, Lianxi, is fifty-nine years old. He has six grandchildren, five of whom are in Qingdao. It is said that his family also runs a bank there. The whole family totals eighty-two people, with over thirty mu of land and two large buildings. His distant cousin, Zhang Jingtao, serves as a political commissar in the communist bandits. During the period when the bandits occupied Boshan, Zhang called him and reprimanded him. Six days before the Eighth Route Army prepared to abandon Boshan for the third time (August 11th), the gate of his house was first sealed and locked by the "Boshan Avenue Town Joint Post-War Committee" of the communist bandits. Subsequently, he and his family were forced to participate in a struggle meeting presided over by Liu Zhengxiang, the "Chairman of the Turn-Over Committee" of the communist bandits. This was what the communist bandits called "locking the door to hold a meeting." In a meeting actually controlled by village cadres, his crime was determined to be "old feudal, old die-hard, killing people with hidden knives without seeing blood," a "Jiang root." Today, they were going to "uproot the Jiang root" and said that the five mu of land he returned to Qiugu after the victory over the Japanese occupation during the war was encroached upon the people, and that he had forcibly occupied more than thirty mu, so he had to be struggled and turned over. Then, it was passed that all the furniture and sundries in his house were struggled as clean as sweeping the floor. This new term added by the communist bandits is what they call

Swept out the door

. After the struggle meeting ended, Zhang and his grandson were detained in Baoen Temple. On the 12th and 13th, they were paraded through the streets, with a paper hat more than three feet high on his head, inscribed "Former Qing Dynasty Jinshi, Republic of China Magistrate, Kuomintang Councilor Zhang Huanzhen." When some people saw his old age during the parade and asked to allow him to sit down for a while, they were ordered not to. On the same day, two "feudalists," Cui and Zhao, who were also paraded through the streets, were stoned to death, which the communist bandits called "stones stewed with meat." On the 14th, Zhang was first stoned and was in so much pain that he almost died several times. His grandson could not bear to witness it and asked to join the Eighth Route Army to redeem his grandfather's life, but it was not allowed. He asked to die in his place, but it was also not allowed. In the morning, Zhang was finally plunged into the misery of

Stones Stewed with Meat

and died. Before Zhang died, he told his son, "Don't learn from me in the future. I have never done anything against my conscience in my life, but in the end, I ended up like this!"

After Zhang died, when his family collected his body, they planned to put it in a good coffin, but the bandits did not allow it. Until now, it is still placed in a thin wooden coffin in Wujialing! When the reporter asked his grandson why the communist bandits did not harm him but only asked him to accompany him in the parade, he told me, "This is what the communist bandits call carrying the Jiang seedling! The purpose is to show me, to let me know how powerful they are!"

Zhang's house is on Xiguan Street, one with three courtyards and one with a large quadrangle courtyard. When the reporter visited, they had returned home because the National Army had arrived. However, because the

Furniture and Sundries

had been struggled away, only an empty shell remained. Many people in the family still slept on the floor. Director Fan Qijun, who was sent by Chairman Wang to offer comfort, promised them that as long as they could recognize their original items, they could ask County Magistrate Liang Ru to recover them.

In addition, according to Director Wang Yanqing of the News Office of Hu Yingyuan's department, when their troops entered Wangcun on August 16th, he witnessed several pieces of

Large Stone Slabs

on the side of the road in the river valley, under which twelve people were pressed. Eleven of them had been crushed to death. One person, named Fu Tang, was known to have been struggled by the bandits after the National Army lifted the bluestone from his body. First, they used stones, wooden sticks, or knives and axes to smash or beat them to the point of near death, and then they pressed them under huge stones for the public to watch. Director Sang of the Boshan Youth League told me that three or four li outside Boshan City, the local Eighth Route Army is still carrying out widespread and fierce struggles. In Yuanquan (fifty li southeast of Boshan) alone, as many as forty-nine people suffered the torture of "stones stewed with meat" in one day. (Special Correspondent Li Tian)

### Zichuan Large Trunks Waiting for Original Owners to Claim

[Our Zichuan Dispatch on the 6th] The "struggle" in Zichuan is even more intense than in Boshan. According to a preliminary investigation by the county government, over 18,000 households in Zichuan were struggled, over 1,700 people were struggled to death, and over 6,300 people were taken away by the bandits. In the urban area, over 370 families were struggled. Over 50 commercial shops and over 20 hotels and sauce gardens that originally existed last year were all struggled away. Most of the over 10 coal and porcelain industries were also struggled. The largest Fengyong Sauce Garden in the city had over 200,000 jin of wild vegetables, which were also struggled away this time. Each person in the urban area was given an average of 70 jin. In the Zichuan County Government, there are still large numbers of trunks struggled by the bandits, filling several rooms, waiting for the original owners to come and claim them.

The communist bandits' endless "struggle" includes "rich peasants," "middle peasants," and even self-cultivating farmers with about ten mu of land. In Shilipu, outside Zichuan City, with a total of seventy-five households, five families have been struggled by the communist village cadres. The families of Councilor Geng Zhanyuan and his brother were both struggled. The communist bandits still did not think this was enough. Their village cadres held a meeting and decided to struggle forty families. The people knew this, and they could not bear it any longer, so they joined forces to tie up three village cadres and send them to the communist public district. As a result, the bandits replaced the three cadres, and the decision was dropped. On September 1st, five more people were abducted by the communist bandits. Therefore, after the reporter visited farmers in various parts of central Shandong, their unanimous conclusion was: The so-called "struggle" and the so-called "turn over" means the rich become poor, and the poor become poorer. The more you struggle, the poorer you become, and the more you turn over, the deeper you sink!

### Zou Lu Writes to Hu Shi to Discuss University Plan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Fu Wei Zou Lu recently sent an open letter to Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, to discuss Hu's proposal that the government should stipulate the first five-year plan to fully assist the development of five universities. The original letter is as follows: "Mr. Shizhi has said: I recently read in the newspaper that you have published your opinions on the ten-year plan for education in our country. Your ability to achieve academic independence, your far-sightedness, your long heart, and your heavy words are admired. However, you propose that the government should stipulate the first five-year plan to fully assist the development of five universities, namely Peking University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University, Wuhan University, and Sun Yat-sen University, restricting them to become the best universities in the country and have a place in the world. I don't know if the Sun Yat-sen University you are referring to is Nanjing Central University or Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University. If it refers to Nanjing Central University, then there are Tsinghua University and Peking University in the north of our country, and Central University, Zhejiang University, and Wuhan University in the middle, while the south is completely lacking, which should not be so biased; if it refers to Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University, then the capital city has no good university, which is also inappropriate. I think you must have other brilliant insights on this point, and I hope you will clarify it. There are more than one person who shares the above sentiments. I am specially writing this to send my best regards, Zou Lu, September 11th."

(Gift from the British News Office)

### Sing Tao Loses to English Strong Team by One Goal, Corinthian-Casuals Wins 3-2

[Reuters, London, 11th] The Hong Kong Sing Tao football team played against the Corinthian-Casuals, one of the most famous amateur football teams in England, today and lost 2-3. At the end of the first half, the score was tied at 1-1. Sing Tao's shooting technique has improved, and the short passes are particularly outstanding. Losing by one goal is truly due to bad luck. Individual performances were best from Zhou Daqia, Zhang Jinhai, and Portuguese left winger Xiaogao Shannu. Corinthian-Casuals captain, veteran footballer Liu Yitu, also personally took to the field. 36 minutes into the game, Corinthian scored first. Two minutes later, Sing Tao's He Yingfen returned the favor. In the second half, Corinthian scored two more goals. Two minutes before the end of the game, He Yingfen scored again.

### Economic Commission Review Group Advocates Strict Auditing of Yarn Factory Production Costs, Yarn Quality, and Export Quantities

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the review of the development of the textile industry by the National Economic Commission's review group, and the implementation plan of adjusting the supply and demand of yarn and cloth proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a portion of the article was published in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. It is now known that the review group's opinions on the plan, in addition to deciding on: (1) Strengthening joint distribution, consolidating all yarn production from national and private yarn factories for distribution; (2) Unifying the purchase of domestic cotton, temporarily starting from the negotiation of prices on both sides, also includes several review opinions: (1) Strictly auditing the production costs of each factory. For factories with excessively high costs, the Textile Adjustment Committee should send personnel to supervise and reduce them. The quality of yarn produced should be strictly assessed and graded. (2) The export of yarn and cloth should be limited to 20% of the total production volume. (3) When calculating the profit of cotton yarn, each yarn factory should not include raw cotton. (4) The prices of finished products of the re-processing industry should also be strictly controlled to ensure fairness. It is reported that these review opinions still need to be submitted to the National Economic Commission for discussion. If approved, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will modify the original plan based on the approved review opinions, and then submit it to the National Economic Commission for final approval.

### Chinese Stock Market Rebounds, Many Close at High Prices

The Chinese stock market showed a glimmer of hope yesterday. First, the exchange rate of the British pound tightened, making foreign stocks very popular. Then, there was talk of a deadline for the delivery of yarn and cloth. Speculative funds seemed to be shifting their ground from material goods, and securities firms were hopeful and lent their support from time to time, causing prices to rebound after falling. Except for Yong Gong's capital increase, which failed to meet public expectations and fell by half a percentage point, many stocks closed at high prices. In the morning, due to the large difference in the exchange rate of the National Bank from the previous day, people were inevitably fatigued. Currently, Yong Sha, manipulated by broker No. 223, opened low at 235 yuan, causing other stocks to lose color. After the opening, there was scattered selling to cover short positions. Yong Sha immediately rebounded from 225 yuan for spot delivery and 235 yuan for forward delivery, gradually improving. Most other stocks also rose from low prices. Brokers such as No. 89 bought spot Yong Sha, and brokers such as No. 232 also bought forward Yong Sha, gradually pushing the price up to 239 yuan and 245 yuan. Broker No. 218 took the opportunity to supply at high prices, and broker No. 133 also closed out spot Yong Sha, causing the price to fall back to 240 yuan. Foreign stocks were surging, and brokers such as No. 117 came to buy, causing the price to rise several times to 245 yuan, but it was ultimately blocked by Guangbang's broker No. 218, who sold at high prices.

Extending to after 11 a.m., the buying support from foreign stocks and material goods continued. Brokers such as No. 116 bought actively, and the China Silk Association raised the price to the limit from broker No. 61. Near noon, news of a deadline for yarn and cloth to leave the warehouse triggered rumors of controls. Speculative funds shifted their ground, and securities firms increased their positions in many ways. Yong Sha rose to a closing price of 244 yuan and 252 yuan. Except for Yong Gong, other stocks were also driven up to close at high prices. After the closing, the asking price for Yong Sha was slightly hesitant.

As a result, compared to the previous closing price for spot delivery stocks, Yong Sha, Jingfu, and Zhongfa rose slightly. Xinhe, Meiya, Huafeng, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by half a percentage point. Yong Gong alone fell by half a percentage point. Xinhua, Lian'an, and Shangping. The China Silk Association rose by the limit, gaining over 10% strongly. The rest rose slightly. As for forward delivery stocks, Xinhe, Meiya, and Qinxing each rose by half a percentage point. Yong Sha, Huafeng, Jingfu, and Xinguang rose slightly. In the over-the-counter market, the fortunes of old stocks varied. Dasheng saw a decline, while China World and China Merchants rose slightly.

Also, it is reported that since the establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange on September 9th last year until September 8th this year, the total transaction amount of stocks in one year reached 20,222,243,447,545 yuan. The transaction tax totaled 9,961,281,375 yuan.

### Unified Bonds Fall, Foreign Stocks Rise

The transaction volume was no more than 5 million.

Foreign stocks were even more excited yesterday. Securities firms were even more enthusiastic in buying, and foreign firms stopped selling and switched to buying. Banks and Guangbang sold slightly, but it was difficult to contain the rising trend. The exchange rate of the British pound tightened. Yisha opened at 104 and rose from 103,500 yuan to close at 108,500 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Yeguang and Paper remained stable, Kenzhi rose by nearly 20%, Yisha rose by slightly less than 10%, Steel rose slightly, and the rest rose by half a percentage point.

[Our Dispatch] The negotiated price for cotton yarn at the Textile Adjustment Conference increased again yesterday. The price for 20-count yarn was raised to 11.8 million yuan, an increase of 400,000 yuan from the previous price. The prices for other counts of yarn will be proportionally increased accordingly.

Yarn Prices Flat and Weak

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was generally flat and weak at the opening due to news that the authorities would strictly enforce yarn and cloth management and that credit was tightening. Subsequently, prices varied due to differing positions among market participants. Although the negotiated price at the Textile Adjustment Conference was raised again, demand was not as strong as the previous day. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell by 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day, while other 20-count, 16-count, 10-count, 6-count, 42-count, 40-count, and 32-count yarns of various brands experienced fluctuations of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth Stable

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was weak due to the large amount of national bank transfers and the tightening of credit. However, because actual sales were still brisk, Hankou dealers continued to purchase Yuan Bijii cloth, pushing the price from 580,000 yuan to 900,000 yuan. Longtou fine cloth fell slightly by 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 522,000 yuan. Other cloths remained stable.

Spot Cotton Stable

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was slightly weaker than the previous day because cotton yarn sales were not strong, yarn prices were flat and weak, and yarn mills' enthusiasm had waned. Traders shifted from buying to selling due to tighter credit. Subsequently, trading became slightly more active as retail investors covered short positions. Total transactions were 1,220 bales. Prices for delivery to factories were: N.T. 2.68 million yuan, 100 bales traded; warehouse delivery prices were Lingbin 2.55 million yuan, 2.58 million yuan to 2.6 million yuan, 260 bales traded; Hankou fine lint 2.38 million yuan to 2.43 million yuan, 540 bales traded; Shandong wooden frame 2.25 million yuan, 50 bales traded; Guide 2.37 million yuan, 75 bales traded; Huoji 2 million yuan to 2.05 million yuan, 200 bales traded; Zhoupu cottonseed 385,000 yuan.

### Active Domestic Tea Market

Since the domestic red and green tea market has seen continuous sales from this street and guest merchants, the market yesterday remained active due to sustained buying interest. Prices also remained firm, as holders were unwilling to lower their prices. The outlook is predicted to be upward, with no decline. The foreign tea market, however, remained weak and lacking activity, with declining transactions and a quiet and stable situation. The Anhui Tea Company recently displayed samples of dozens of this year's Qimen black teas. Currently, companies such as Wang Yutai Hua Tea are inspecting them for selection.

### Eleven Associations, Including Rubber, Push for Representatives to Petition in Nanjing

[Our Dispatch] Eleven industrial associations in this city, including rubber, paper, wool spinning, cement, leather making, and silk weaving, have been in contact with the Import and Export Management Committee and the Central Bank regarding the issue of converting foreign exchange for the imported goods that were granted quotas in the first and second quarters at the official exchange rate. This has been going on for three weeks, but no solution has been reached. These industries believe that: (1) raw material inventories in the factories are dwindling, (2) foreign exporters are increasingly pressing for payment and may cancel orders, (3) the black market exchange rate is rising sharply, and the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. At a meeting held recently, it was decided to send Hong Nianzu, Yang Liren, Zhang Shanzhang, and Xi Zhengxiu as representatives to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, hoping to obtain a solution as soon as possible to alleviate the difficulties faced by these industries.

### External Injuries Can Worsen Existing Illnesses

— Liang Junqing

When I was young, I enjoyed reading novels, and whenever I read about someone "becoming bedridden and dying after suffering an injury, lingering for months," I always thought it was an exaggeration. I never believed that such a thing could actually happen, because according to common sense, a serious injury could be fatal within a few days; and a minor injury, after a period of recuperation, would naturally heal completely. I certainly didn't believe that an injury could lead to death months later. As for the rumors about martial arts techniques that claimed that "an enemy who has been struck with a certain acupressure technique could die months or half a year later," I thought these were even more mysterious and unbelievable.

Later, when I studied medicine, I did not change this belief. However, since practicing medicine in Shanghai, I have seen and heard many things that have truly moved me, and all my previous beliefs have gradually been shaken by unexpected miracles. The following is an example of the type of incident I am referring to in this article:

"A fifty-three-year-old man, who had always been strong and well-nourished, had family members who suffered from tuberculosis, but he himself had never had any record of illness.

At lunchtime on November 26th of last year (at which time he was completely healthy and working), he accidentally tripped over a barbed wire hidden in the snow while walking quickly. His right foot got caught in the wire, and he immediately fell forward, striking his chest heavily on the hard ground. His right chest was hit particularly hard. It seemed that his lungs were also affected, but he soon recovered and did not feel any pain. After returning home, he did not feel any pain, but occasionally experienced chest pain and tightness in the evening.

The next day, he felt slightly unwell, so he rested at home for the day.

Eight days after the injury (on December 4th), he felt that he had completely recovered, so he went to a public bathhouse. On December 6th, he was riding on a streetcar when he suddenly vomited blood several times and returned home immediately. On December 8th, he went to the hospital for treatment. At this time, an X-ray examination of his lungs revealed calcified lesions in both lungs and the lower lobe of the right lung. There were also calcified lesions near both lung hilums. These symptoms could of course be considered to be a combination of hardened early-stage tuberculosis lesions (Toc. Primaercomlpex). Both of his lungs had Simon's tuberculosis lesions. The blood sedimentation rate was 10/20mm. The results of a complete blood test were completely normal. From December 7th to 9th, he had a slight fever, but it soon subsided. Subsequently, on December 19th and 20th, he had a high fever of 38.6 degrees, but after treatment, it subsided completely. After that, he was without fever for seven days. However, from December 31st to January 10th of this year, he developed a fever again.

On January 11th of this year (46 days after the injury), he suddenly developed a high fever accompanied by numerous chills. At this time, a clinical examination led to a diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis (the most malignant form of tuberculosis). The results of his X-ray examination are recorded below:

(1) December 8th (12 days after the injury): Both lungs were clear and free of disease. Both lower lung angles were normal. The diaphragm had slight curves. The shadows of both lung hilums were enlarged, and the right lung hilum had old calcified spots, forming a small cluster. This was of course a combination of early-stage old tuberculosis. And the old lesions of its early erosion could also be clearly identified at the bifurcation of the trachea. There were also a few calcified tuberculosis lesions in the left lung hilum. A few of these lesions were located near the upper left chamber of the heart shadow. (To be continued)"

### Japanese Schistosomiasis, Popular in Southern Jiangsu (Conclusion)

— Shen Luo

The second stage, from larva to adult worm, until the liver and spleen enlarge. At this time, the patient's stool contains blood and mucus, similar to dysentery. Initially, there is tenesmus and urgency, with more than ten bowel movements per day. The worm eggs can be found in the stool under a microscope. Bleeding occurs in the mucous membranes of the intestines, nose, gums, and uterus. There are also irregular menstruation, anemia, weight loss, emaciation, weakness, palpitations, difficulty breathing, excessive saliva secretion, thirst, stomach pain, heartburn, noisy stomach, vomiting blood, belching, and a feeling of stagnation and pressure in the stomach. The liver and spleen are enlarged, the temperature increases in the afternoon, and the destruction caused by the adult worms in the body intensifies day by day.

In the third stage, if left untreated for several years, the liver and spleen become cirrhotic and atrophied, with tenderness and an uneven surface. There is congestion of the portal vein. At this time, the disease becomes serious, causing a vicious cycle of dysfunction, fluid accumulation in the abdomen (distension), reduced urine output, nutritional disorders, severe anemia, swelling of the lower extremities, night blindness, and visual deterioration. The number of eosinophilic leukocytes in the blood increases. The globulin protein precipitation test is positive, and the knee reflexes are exaggerated. Eventually, the patient dies of exhaustion.

This disease can also be classified into acute and chronic types based on the severity of the symptoms. The acute type can be cured in a few weeks or two to three months, but it is prone to recurrence. The chronic type can last for two to three years, or even ten to twenty or thirty years, eventually leading to systemic weakness and death. The "big belly disease" and "bloating disease" commonly referred to in the rural areas of southern Jiangsu are this type of schistosomiasis.

E. Prevention and Treatment: Prevention is more important than treatment. Early treatment has a good chance of recovery. If the liver and spleen are severely damaged, or even if the heart and brain are affected, it is difficult to save. The most effective drugs for schistosomiasis in the past were trivalent antimony preparations, such as antimony potassium tartrate (Stiblc-Kali Tartaricum) or Fuadin, Stibosan, Neo-Stibosan, administered intravenously or intramuscularly, once every other day, for a total of twelve injections. Do not exceed the dose to avoid poisoning. However, these are rarely used by physicians recently.

Antimony potassium tartrate is the most effective drug for treating this disease. After treatment, the worm eggs can no longer be found in the stool in about 85% of patients. However, it is somewhat toxic, and side effects such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and cough often occur after injection. Fuadin, produced by Bayer, is administered intramuscularly, initially at 1.5 cc, followed by 3 to 5 cc, once every other day, until a total dose of 40 cc is reached. The advantage is that the reaction is milder, but the efficacy is lower and recurrence is more frequent. Moreover, the current market price is very high, about 300,000 yuan per box of ten injections. According to a clinical report from the Southern Jiangsu Local Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute of Jiangsu Province on the application of Fuadin, among 24 patients who completed treatment with this drug, 13 (54.2%) had no worm eggs in their stool after re-examination, 8 (33.3%) had reduced symptoms, and 3 (12.5%) died of severe illness. (See Volume 1, Issue 1 of "Southern Jiangsu Prevention and Treatment Monthly," compiled by the author and published on July 1, 1947).

The United States also produces Fuadin injections. The Shanghai Shinyi Pharmaceutical Factory has recently produced "Solu-Stisin," a pentavalent antimony preparation (which is more advanced than trivalent antimony), which has therapeutic value for schistosomiasis and kala-azar?

In addition, the use of quinine, iron preparations, arsenic acid (Acid. Avsenisosum), etc., for nutritional therapy, as well as the administration of laxatives, is also important. It is even better if the patient can move to another place for recuperation.

The key points of prevention are to actively prevent this disease and fundamentally eliminate Japanese schistosomiasis and its intermediate host (Oncomelania hupensis snails), such as spreading lime or copper sulfate solution in the riverbank to kill the snails, deepening the riverbed where the snails are found, and increasing the slope of the river beach to prevent the snails from breeding, etc. However, these measures are extremely costly, and given the current economic situation in rural China, they cannot be universally implemented.

The passive measures rely on the popularization of health education, strengthening prevention and control propaganda, and improving environmental hygiene. In schistosomiasis-prone areas, there are two points that are particularly important:

First, regarding public aspects—strictly implement fecal management and closely manage patients, because the feces of patients with schistosomiasis often contain worm eggs, which are the medium for transmitting schistosomiasis, spreading the disease to others. Therefore, we must achieve the following two points (which, of course, require political force to promote):

1. Strictly prohibit washing toilet bowls in rivers.
2. When using feces for fertilization, never use fresh feces; stale feces should be used, and should be left for at least ten days (at least one month in winter) to allow the feces to ferment and kill the larvae and eggs for safety.

Second, regarding individual aspects:

1. Do not swim or wash in rivers or ponds that contain Oncomelania hupensis snails.
2. Boil drinking water and food.
3. When farming, fishing, or draining water, wear long rubber boots or oilcloth boots and thin cloth socks to protect your legs and feet from invasion by schistosomiasis cercariae.

G. Recent Prevalence in Wu County: The Southern Jiangsu Local Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute of Jiangsu Province is the competent authority for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, directly under the Jiangsu Provincial Health Department. The current director, Dr. Chuan Guang, has extensive experience in the prevention and treatment of this disease. According to an investigation report, stool samples were collected and widely examined in more than 20 townships in Wu County, including Mu Mai, and schistosomiasis eggs were found in all of them. The infection rate ranged from 0.9% to 29.4%, with Xu Kou Township being the highest. In addition, the institute collected Oncomelania hupensis snails from various townships in Wu County for examination to provide supporting evidence. Schistosomiasis cercariae were found in 0.3% to 23.7% of the snails, also with Xu Kou Township being the highest. In addition, a recent survey of seven primary and secondary schools in Suzhou City examined 317 people and found schistosomiasis eggs in 6 people, or 1.9%. A survey of 5,322 snails collected from five rivers and lakes outside Panmen, Loumen, Fengmen, Guanmen, and Xumen found 348 cercariae, or 6.5%. This is just one example from the survey, and the extent of the epidemic in the vast rural areas can be imagined! (Author's note: Due to space limitations, the details of the above survey are detailed in my "Southern Jiangsu Prevention and Treatment Monthly," and will be reported in another article later to inform readers).

### My Views on the So-Called "Thirst and Polyuria Disease"

— Tsuchikichi Makoto

Recently, I read Dr. Wang Zhirong's article "Random Talk on Thirst and Polyuria Disease in Children" in this publication, and I deeply admire his spirit of research during his spare time. Dr. Wang also requested fellow doctors and patients to provide relevant information, so I will present two cases based on what I have heard, seen, and personally experienced, to serve as reference.

The pathology of the so-called "thirst and polyuria disease" still needs to be further explored. However, according to Dr. Mitsutoku Karasawa, Professor of Pediatrics at Keio University in Japan, regarding similar diseases, it is believed that the thermoregulatory center of infants and young children has not yet fully developed, causing their body temperature to increase proportionally with the increase in air temperature. This is not only true in summer, but also at other times of the year. If you try using three or four hot water bottles, wrapped in a quilt, and place this type of infant in it, you may find a high fever of 38, 39, or even 40 degrees. If you remove the hot water bottles or reduce the clothing at this time, the body temperature can drop rapidly. Therefore, during the hot summer months, infants often have a persistent fever of unknown cause, reaching 37.5 degrees to 39 degrees or higher, without any other symptoms. As soon as the outside air cools down, the body temperature naturally returns to normal. If the child is bathed when the fever rises, the body temperature can be reduced. These cases can all be regarded as cases of fever due to incomplete function of the thermoregulatory center (Stauungs fteber). Other scholars also call this disease summer fever, although the names are different, their clinical observations and theories are generally the same.

Based on my personal diagnosis and treatment experience, I encounter many such children every summer. The younger the child, the higher the fever, with body temperatures sometimes reaching 39 degrees or 40 degrees or higher. However, all examinations reveal no particular abnormalities. As the weather cools down, the fever also subsides. When the same patient relapses the following year, the fever is milder and the duration is shorter. If it relapses in the third year, the fever is even milder and the duration is even shorter. Although there are occasional complications with other diseases, they heal quickly with treatment. However, the fever does not subside until the weather cools down. As for the infectious theory mentioned by Dr. Wang in his article, I have not yet found any evidence to support it. I have also not seen diarrhea as a necessary symptom. The treatment method, in addition to having the patient rest, emphasizes nutrition first. In terms of medication, I give Vitamin B and heart tonics to those with higher and longer-lasting fevers, and the results have all been good, with no adverse outcomes seen.

There was another case where I diagnosed it as this disease and then referred it to another doctor, who diagnosed it as indigestion or typhoid fever, thereby reducing the child's nutrition. As a result, the fever became even higher, and the patient came back for treatment. I used the same method as before, and the fever became lighter again. More than a month later, the weather became cool and comfortable, and the body temperature returned to normal. From this, it can be seen that since there is currently no specific treatment for this disease, increasing nutrition is certainly necessary. As for moving to another place for recuperation or living in a room with air conditioning, it should be effective, but few families' economic conditions are suitable.

### A Telegram from the Shanghai Medical Association

The Shanghai Medical Association, feeling indignant about the Nanjing District Court judge's disregard for forensic medicine and medical institutions, and the lack of solid evidence to refute the testimony and physical evidence, arbitrarily sentenced Dr. Qian Mingxi of the Nanjing Municipal Hospital to imprisonment, sent a telegram requesting the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Justice Administration, the Ministry of Health, the Supreme Court, the Capital High Court, the National Medical Association Federation, and medical associations in various regions to uphold justice. The original telegram is reproduced below: To the Honorable Courts, Ministries, and Associations: After reading the newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai and receiving letters and telegrams from medical organizations in various places, we are all extremely indignant at the Nanjing District Court judge's disregard for forensic medicine and medical institutions, and the lack of solid evidence to refute the testimony and physical evidence, arbitrarily sentenced Dr. Qian Mingxi of the Nanjing Municipal Hospital to one year and six months in prison for manslaughter. We believe that this will leave medical professionals without legal protection in the future, endanger patients, cause doctors to become reluctant to act, hinder scientific construction, endanger national health, and bring ridicule to the international medical community. The members of this association are panicked and feel insecure. We earnestly request that you (Court, Ministry, Association) uphold justice, safeguard the nascent field of medicine, and are extremely concerned. Shanghai Medical Association Chairman Yu Ling and two thousand members respectfully request this.
