The First Batch of Japanese Reparations Obtained by Me to be Shipped Starting in Early June; Preliminary Results Obtained on Transportation Issues
[This City Report] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei specially telegraphed representatives of the shipping industry union in this city, Li Yunliang, Hu Shiyuan, Cheng Yuqi, Dong Haoyun, Zhong Shandao, and others, to Nanjing some days ago for consultations and instructions. The representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing their public duties. It is reported that after Minister Yu consulted with the representatives, he convened a transportation preparation meeting at the International Club at noon on the 18th, chaired by Vice Ministers of Transportation Tan Boyu and Ling Hongdong, and Director of the Navigation Administration Department Li Jinglu. In addition to representatives of the shipping industry, the attendees included Chen Bozhuang, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus, Director of the Japanese Reparations Committee Xue Zue, and various committee members, directors of various departments of the Ministry of Transportation stationed in Japan, and others. After a three-hour meeting, preliminary results were obtained on the transportation of reparations materials. It is learned that the first batch of reparations materials totals approximately 600,000 tons, mostly factories, machinery, including heavy industry and chemical industry equipment, and a floating dock, which is planned to be located in Wusong in this city to establish a central shipyard. The unloading of these reparations materials will be supervised on-site by personnel from the Resources Committee, the Ministry of National Defense, and other relevant agencies. Transportation matters will be managed by the Ministry of Transportation, which will organize a transportation committee to handle the priority procedures and various detailed methods. Ships will be dispatched by the Civil Aviation Maritime Transport United Operations Office and the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to jointly take responsibility for transportation, using chartering methods to ensure simplicity. After preparations are completed in the short term, representatives will be sent to Japan to inspect and deploy everything on-site, with shipping scheduled to begin in early June.

It is Rumored that Japanese Reparations Do Not Include Textile Machines
[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Reporters learned from authoritative sources that the 30% interim reparations from Japan, which Washington ordered to be moved as soon as possible, do not include electric textile machines. Other reliable sources further predicted that even in the final reparations plan, Japan's textile industry would not be touched. However, the report has not yet been confirmed. If this report is true, it would be tantamount to accepting Strick's reparations plan. Regarding Japan's textile industry, Strick, who led the reparations investigation committee to Japan two months ago, told the local community upon arriving in Japan: "We do not advocate reducing Japan's textile industry." If the Japanese reparations plan does not include the textile industry (or reduces reparations in the textile industry), it would be a major blow to countries with underdeveloped heavy industries. These countries (including China and the Philippines) will likely feel fierce competition from Japan's future textile industry, as Japan's textiles will be exported to Sweden, the Dutch East Indies, the United States, Hong Kong, and various parts of Southeast Asia. The fact that Japanese reparations do not include the textile industry is an even greater blow to China and the Philippines, as the textile industries of both countries were destroyed during the Middle East occupation. Even the US textile industry feels threatened by Japan's textile industry. According to reports, the Allied policy of abolishing Japan's heavy industry and concentrating Japan's future economy on so-called light industry has caused increasing anxiety among people in the US textile industry.

### Philippines Refuses Re-Entry of 7,600 Overseas Chinese
[Associated Press, Manila, 19th] Regarding the request from Gaines, the representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in the Philippines, to allow 7,600 Overseas Chinese who were deported from the Philippines in 1945 to re-enter the Philippines, Commissioner Valbuena of the Immigration Bureau recently submitted a memorandum to the Philippine government rejecting the request. The reasons given were: the deadline for the re-entry of the 7,600 Overseas Chinese has expired, so they no longer have the right to re-enter. Moreover, given the current housing, food, and unemployment situation in the Philippines, it is not appropriate to allow them to enter. The Immigration Bureau is aware of the current friendly relations between China and the Philippines, but during this period of Philippine reconstruction, normal procedures must be followed for the entry of foreigners to avoid exacerbating social and economic problems in the Philippines.

### Suzhou Muduo Obtains 8,000 Shi of Hoarded Grain; Transported to the City for Price Control Sales

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, 19th] The Muduo grain hoarding case was previously dismissed by the Wudi Prosecutor's Office.

Therefore, it was decided to send personnel on the 19th together with the Chamber of Commerce, Grain Association, and District Office to Muduo to order price control sales. The price is 80,000 yuan per stone.

### Declaration of the Founding Congress of the National Banking Federation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Federation of Bank and Commercial Associations of the Republic of China issued the following declaration of establishment:

The Federation formally held its founding congress in the capital on April 15, 1947. Members from 35 bank and commercial associations from all over the country attended, representing 9,600 people. They traveled through difficulties and participated enthusiastically. After four days of meetings, 155 proposals were made. Retrospectively, although the Federation of Banking Associations was founded in 1920, it was reported in 1924 that it met once a year for five years. However, it has never been as extensive and profound as today's congress. This is an unprecedented event in China's financial industry and is sufficient to open a glorious page in China's economic history. During this congress, the representatives from all over the country showed a spirit of sincere unity and harmonious consultation, which is not only admired by our colleagues in the financial industry, but also sufficient to prompt the people of the whole country to pay serious attention. The far-reaching significance and great future of this are beyond words. Our country's bank and commercial associations have 35 units, representing 96 people, traveling through difficulties and participating enthusiastically. After four days of meetings, 155 proposals were made. Looking back, although the Federation of Banking Associations was founded in 1920, it was reported in 1924 that it met once a year for five years. However, it has never been as extensive and profound as today's congress. This is indeed an unprecedented event in China's financial industry and is sufficient to open a glorious page in China's economic history. During this congress, the representatives from all over the country showed a spirit of sincere unity and harmonious consultation, which is not only inspiring to our colleagues in the financial industry, but also sufficient to prompt the people of the whole country to pay serious attention. The far-reaching significance and great future of this are beyond words. Our country's banking industry has a history of 50 years since its inception. In these 50 years, the political and economic situation has been turbulent, and our industry has been fighting against a difficult environment every day. Finally, we have been able to overcome difficulties and achieve a rough scale, and have been able to make slight contributions to the promotion of national construction and the development of social economy. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, our industry followed the national policy under the leadership of the government, and spared no effort to assist the national finances and adjust the financing of all industries. This is especially gratifying and can be reported to the public. Now, at the beginning of the establishment of this association, we must carry on the past and open up the future. What we must do to assist the government in implementing economic reform plans, guiding industry and commerce, and increasing production in order to achieve the goal of national rejuvenation and construction is what our banking industry seeks day and night, and it is also the greatest goal of the establishment of this association. However, there are things that must be told to our public: China's economic crisis has reached its extreme. Production is in chaos, trade is stagnant, finances are overstretched, and inflation is rampant. The entire financial system has not been established, and banking regulations are heavily restricted. The relationship between the banking industry and the social economy is inseparable. Under such economic and financial conditions, it is difficult to expect the development of the banking industry. Since the military uprising, the economy has been abnormal, prices have risen daily, and the value of currency has fallen daily. Funds are concentrated in speculative markets, and production funds are often insufficient and have to resort to usury, resulting in high black market interest rates. Banks want to absorb capital at low interest rates and use it for legitimate purposes, but cannot. Banks are originally centers of capital. Today, social floating capital cannot be concentrated in banks, and with the depreciation of currency, the capital strength of banks is far from comparable to before the war. Whenever social floating capital is rampant and major fluctuations occur in the market, it is not something that general banks can control or be responsible for. However, wanting to rely solely on the capital strength of general banks to assist in the recovery and construction of the domestic economy is inevitable. Therefore, what this association wants to suggest to the government and financial authorities, and what it hopes from our solid industry, summarizes the opinions of representatives from all over the country, and there are several points:

(1) Balance Finances and Stabilize Currency Value: The relationship between currency value and the banking industry is most important. Only a stable currency system can make people have the psychology of storing, and our banks can give play to their function of concentrating and using social funds. However, to seek a stable currency value, we must first stop inflation, and to stop inflation, we must balance finances first. We are willing to cooperate with the government and the people of the whole country to promote its realization.

(2) Improve Financial Institutions and Establish a Banking System: The industrial and commercial financial system and the agricultural financial system must be established. In the industrial and commercial financial system, we especially hope to actively strengthen the effectiveness of the central bank, implement the task of "bank of banks," universally handle key loans and rediscounts, participate in the open market, and all funds that benefit industry and commerce, whether long-term investment or short-term use, should be passed through general banks as much as possible and reach the path of production, so that there can be full development. The adjustment of the deposit reserves of general banks should be based on the urgency and strive for flexibility to achieve stability. As for the distribution of the financial network, the branch system should be adopted, and the implementation of financial policies should adopt the regional management system. In the agricultural financial system, short-term funds should be distinguished, and strong central institutions should be established to handle land mortgages, promote low-interest agricultural loans, promote the rediscounting of agricultural bills and the rediscounting of agricultural products, and promote credit cooperation and agricultural insurance, which are all important current tasks.

(3) Remove Passive Controls and Engage in Active Guidance: The current methods of regulating banks mainly include the "Provisional Measures for the Financial Department to Manage Banks" promulgated in March 1946 and the "Measures to Strengthen the Management of Financial Business" promulgated in February this year. Among them, there are many restrictions on the scope of banking business, the use of funds, and the establishment of branches, which make banks have the feeling of moving with difficulty. Not only does it hinder the operation of banks, but it also affects the development of the industry. The government should remove various regulatory laws, remove them as much as possible, to benefit finance and facilitate the development of industry and commerce.

(4) Promulgate a New Banking Law and Establish a Permanent Scale: The draft of the new banking law has been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan several times. The suggestions of the former Shanghai Banking Association have been adopted in many places. However, the revised draft still has many rigid provisions. In order to make the fundamental law smoothly implemented, we must set up more flexible articles, mainly with active guidance as the purpose. We deeply hope that the government will give this association the opportunity to contribute its opinions again before formal formulation.

(5) Promote Inter-Industry Joint Discussions to Replenish Production Funds: Our banking industry colleagues should also strive for self-discipline, increase communication and cooperation among colleagues, and strive to increase production, promote investment and loans, and coordinate with the national economic construction plan.

(6) Promote Banking Academics and Standardize Systems and Procedures: The progress of foreign banking business is due to the progress of banking academics. The promotion of banking academics in our country cannot be delayed. If we want to develop banking business, we must first rectify the lives of colleagues and arouse the interest in research. Other standardization, such as accounting systems and contract documents, should also be realized as soon as possible.

(7) Seek Cooperation from All Industries and Win Social Sympathy: If we want to make banks give their greatest effect, we must rely on social economic activities. The operation of industry, commerce, and various industries is closely related to banking business. For example, the production, transportation, and sales of industry and commerce, their specific plans, and detailed reports are valuable guidelines and necessary references for the banking industry. And the social people can give more cooperation to stabilize the market, and that is more benefit to finance.

In short, what this association seeks from the government and financial authorities is nothing more than to establish national credit, strengthen financial institutions, fulfill the function of regulating funds, and guide banks to a proper outlet. And our banking colleagues, even in this difficult situation, should still uphold their previous spirit, support national policies, and cooperate to promote them. No matter whether the environment is favorable or unfavorable, or the size of the achievements, we must make the greatest efforts to develop the economy, stabilize the people's livelihood, and complete the mission that we should bear.

### The Issue of Issuing 10,000 Yuan Notes

Recently, due to rising prices, the amount of paper money needed for transactions has also increased. As a result, cash transactions in the market have become very inconvenient. All banks, firms, and manufacturers have had to hire extra staff to specifically count money. Ordinary citizens also find it very troublesome. Moreover, due to the inconvenience of counting, people are too lazy to count, leading to many disputes. A few unscrupulous individuals deliberately mix in small denomination notes to seek illegal gains, deceiving each other and greatly affecting trust. Recently, the Federation of Banking Associations held its first general meeting in Nanjing. It specifically resolved to request the Central Bank to issue 10,000-yuan notes, which is undoubtedly a resolution that meets the needs of society.

The reason why the Central Bank has not issued 10,000-yuan notes and is unwilling to issue more 500-yuan customs gold notes is simply because when customs gold notes were issued, speculators spread rumors saying that it would stimulate prices, taking the opportunity to raise prices. Therefore, the Central Bank has some concerns. In fact, since the start of the war, prices have been rising steadily. At that time, there were no 10,000-yuan notes, or even 5,000-yuan notes, but general prices did not stabilize as a result. Although there are many reasons for rising prices, the main points are nothing more than a shortage of materials and currency inflation. Increasing the denomination of notes can certainly contribute to currency inflation, but currency inflation does not necessarily require raising the denomination of notes. In other words, even if the denomination of notes is small, if the issuance is increased, the currency can still inflate. Conversely, if the issuance is appropriate and not excessive, even if the denomination of notes is high, it may not necessarily lead to inflation, and consequently, general prices may not necessarily be driven up. It can be seen that prices and note denominations are actually two separate things and should not be confused.

At the meeting of the Federation of Banking Associations, a representative from Guangdong said that remittances from overseas Chinese all have to be sent to the interior, but the local areas are not peaceful, and it is not easy to transport banknotes, resulting in a significant reduction in remittances from overseas Chinese. He also said that currently, the discount on banknotes on the street is as high as nine yuan per hundred yuan. If the Central Bank does not issue large denomination notes, remittances from overseas Chinese will inevitably disappear due to the inability to make payments. The severity of the situation has reached this point!

Therefore, the request of the Federation of Banking Associations is based on actual needs. Originally, currency is a medium of exchange. Now, with high prices and a larger base, the medium needed will naturally have to increase correspondingly. For example, before the war, the price of rice was only about ten yuan, but now it has risen to 160,000 or 170,000. Fortunately, the face value of ordinary legal tender notes is mostly one or two thousand yuan. Although a dozen stacks of banknotes may not be able to be fully counted, they can still barely cope. If we still used five-yuan or ten-yuan notes as before the war, imagine how cumbersome it would be in practice! I am afraid that many transactions would become impossible due to the difficulty of payment.

Therefore, in order to stabilize prices, rather than restricting the denomination of notes and not allowing it to increase, it is more practical and effective to limit the amount of issuance. Moreover, the 500-yuan denomination customs gold note is practically equivalent to a 10,000-yuan note. The issuance and circulation of 10,000-yuan notes can be said to have become a reality, not a true innovation. Therefore, our requirements are: (1) After the new 10,000-yuan notes are issued, small denomination notes should be withdrawn and destroyed as much as possible to reduce the difficulty of accepting and giving them; (2) Pay attention to the regional supply and demand situation, and do not focus too much on a few places with excessive hot money, which would deepen the degree of inflation; (3) Use the issuance of 10,000-yuan notes as a means to facilitate circulation and reduce small denomination notes, and do not regard it as a shortcut to make up for the deficit in public finances.

Some people believe that the issuance of banknotes and public finances have long been intertwined, and the third point mentioned above may inevitably be close to ideal. This kind of concern is indeed worth paying attention to. However, increasing the amount of issuance does not necessarily have to be done through 10,000-yuan notes. That is to say, even if 10,000-yuan notes are not issued, it does not necessarily mean that currency inflation will stop, or that currency inflation can be prevented. Moreover, the suggestion to issue 10,000-yuan notes still comes from the National Federation of Banking Associations. Its motivation is of course in the currency itself, and there is absolutely no financial meaning in it. According to the authorities, it will indeed be issued in the short term. But it is also for the sake of flexible transactions and meeting needs. Therefore, judging the matter on its merits, we always believe that the issuance of 10,000-yuan notes meets the current needs.

### Austrian Border Issue Submitted for Discussion, Foreign Ministers' Conference Faces Another Test, Definition of German Assets in Austria Still Undetermined

[Our Newspaper News] London, 19th (Radio): U.S. Secretary of State Marshall requested this evening to discuss the Austrian border issue, and the four foreign ministers have agreed. This issue includes Yugoslavia's claim to southern Carinthia, which the Soviet Union has expressed support for, while the Western powers have expressed opposition. If this issue cannot be resolved, the Austrian peace treaty will inevitably be shelved. Although Marshall and Bevin have not officially announced the end of the conference, considering that there is no hope of reaching an agreement on both the German and Austrian peace treaties, they are eager to return home early. Marshall's proposal today is probably to make another test to prove that unless one party's policy is completely changed, the conference cannot make progress. Although there was slight progress on some issues as a result of the two-hour meeting, there was no achievement of any value.

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] The four foreign ministers discussed the issue of German assets in Austrian territory in the Austrian treaty today, and their opinions have not approached, so it is expected that the Austrian peace treaty cannot be completed or signed at the Moscow conference. Marshall tried to establish a compromise, but was rejected by Molotov. Marshall then stated, "Judging from Mr. Molotov's opinion, Austria does not seem to be able to obtain freedom and independence, and its economy and exports seem to be subject to foreign control. I feel that our opinions are getting further and further apart. If Molotov's proposal regarding German assets is accepted, Austria will become a puppet state under foreign rule, and the United States will never sign a treaty that creates such a state." Bevin and Bidault both expressed their willingness to accept Marshall's compromise proposal regarding German assets in Austria. Bevin also recognized that the primary task is to determine the definition of German assets in Austria. Bevin said that no one denies that the Soviet Union has the right to obtain compensation from German assets, but judging from the system proposed by Molotov, the property accepted by the Soviet Union could allow the Soviet Union to control Austria's financial interests. If all factories, land, and forests that can be transferred according to Molotov's plan are considered to be detached from Austria's economy, then Austria's economy may have no hope of recovery.

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Marshall's compromise proposal on Article 35 of the Austrian Treaty regarding German assets is intended to establish an agreement on this issue so that the Austrian treaty can be completed at this Moscow conference. The content of Marshall's proposal is as follows: (1) Austria should recognize that the four powers have the right to dispose of German assets in Austria in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding German reparations, and Austria should take all necessary measures to facilitate the transfer of these assets to the four powers; (2) The definition of German assets is the property rights or interests enjoyed by the German government or German people before May 8, 1945, and these property rights or interests were acquired by the German government or people on March 12, 1938, or acquired by the German government or people after March 12, 1938, without violence or coercion; (3) After the aforementioned assets are transferred to the four powers, they should still be governed by Austrian law, but the Austrian government will not nationalize them within a certain period after the peace treaty comes into effect; (4) The eastern region of Austria referred to in the Potsdam Agreement refers to the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria and the Soviet zone of Vienna. Marshall believes that after the definition of German assets is determined, the disposal of these assets can be carried out immediately. After an understanding of this definition is established, each government of the four powers shall take necessary measures to immediately order the Austrian government to formally transfer these assets in the eastern region of Austria to the Soviet Union.

### Although the Foreign Ministers' Conference is in a Stalemate, There is Still Hope for an Agreement

[United Press, Moscow, 19th] Marshal Stalin recently met with U.S. Secretary of State Marshall. Today, according to well-informed sources on the scope of their talks, although the current four foreign ministers' conference is in a stalemate, it should not be regarded as there being no hope for a future agreement on the German peace treaty. The talks between Stalin and the foreign ministers Bevin and Bidault have been made more forceful by the Stalin-Marshall meeting. Both were able to show statesmanship and contribute to promoting understanding among the nations of the world. Time is important, and we all need time. Although the future seems bleak at the moment, there is no need to be pessimistic. A solution will eventually be found, or development may still require one or two more meetings. The Kremlin has not expressed pessimism about the possibility of reaching an agreement and the future of American foreign policy.

### Britain and the United States Intensify Economic Unification in the German Occupation Zone

[Our Newspaper News] London, 19th (Radio): It is reported that after the four-power conference reached a stalemate, Britain and the United States will intensify their efforts to promote the effective merger of the British and American occupation zones. Britain and the United States hope that France will join in the effort to unify the three western occupation zones of Germany economically, but the prospect of France's participation is slim. Due to issues such as the Ruhr and the Rhineland, France disagrees with Britain and the United States, so the merger of the three occupation zones may be difficult to achieve.

### British Foreign Office Receives Protest from Yugoslavia

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] The British Foreign Office officially announced today that it has received a note from the Yugoslav government, which is strongly worded and accuses the British occupation forces of carrying out terrorist activities against the Slovenian people in the southern Carinthia province of Austria, and lists various examples. Officials here have expressed doubt about these accusations, but have decided to investigate them.

### Austrian Cabinet Prime Minister to Go to Moscow

[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 18th] Officials have recently announced that Austrian Cabinet Prime Minister Figl will depart for Moscow on the 22nd of this month.

### Liu Kai Discusses the Trusteeship System, Says Its Basic Goals Are Consistent with China's National Policy

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Kai (currently the Chinese representative to the United Nations Trusteeship Council) said in a solo interview with a Central News Agency reporter today that China believes the work of the Trusteeship Council is extremely important, as its work includes enabling millions of people in non-self-governing territories to achieve political, economic, and social progress. Liu pointed out that the basic goals of the trusteeship system are fully in line with the principles of Sun Yat-sen, the father of China, and the guiding policies of the Chinese government. The progress of the peoples in the trust territories has a significant impact on other non-independent peoples around the world. When asked by the reporter to review the work of the Council since March 26, he replied: Although the administering countries pay attention to maintaining their power in each territory and fear the inappropriate interference of the Council, the representatives of the Council have gradually developed a spirit of shared goals, and the boundary between the administering countries and the non-administering countries is not as clear as it was earlier. Liu believes that there is currently an encouraging sign that each representative is gradually realizing that they are responsible for a job, which is to pay attention to the welfare of the peoples of the trust territories. Liu discussed the future of the Council, saying that the success of the Council depends on the cooperation between the representatives of the administering countries and the non-administering countries, and also requires the support of public opinion. The reporter asked about the Council's rules of procedure for handling submissions and applications to the Council, which have always been a major concern for the Council. Liu said: The rules of procedure regarding applications have been drafted on the basis of fairness and freedom. Liu said that the Council has so far been engaged in drafting rules of procedure, and he said that this preliminary work is extremely important, as the entire development of the trusteeship system is bound by these regulations.

### Security Council Passes Fact-Finding Mission to Remain in Greece, Soviet Proposal Rejected, U.S. Aid Plan to Greece Wins an Important Victory

[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] The Security Council rejected the Soviet resolution on the 18th, which authorized the United Nations to supervise U.S. aid to Greece. This is a major victory for the United States and an endorsement by the Security Council of Truman's proposal to aid Turkey and Greece. Earlier, the Security Council also rejected Poland's proposal to prohibit U.S. aid to Greece as a "political weapon," which was intended as an amendment to the Soviet resolution, but also advocated authorizing the United Nations to supervise the U.S. aid plan. The United Nations then decided to establish a permanent Balkan commission to monitor cross-border and other disputes. This was proposed by the United States and consists of eleven Security Council representatives. However, Soviet representative Gromyko strongly opposed it and stated that he would use his veto power during the vote. As a result, it was passed by a vote of nine to zero. The Soviet Union and Poland refused to vote. At this point, Gromyko demanded that the debate on his resolution to authorize the United Nations to supervise U.S. aid to Greece be expedited. The U.S. side immediately stated that it would not need to use its veto power to oppose the Soviet proposal, as there were already enough countries opposing the Soviet proposal, so there was no need for the United States to use its veto power. It is also learned that the United Nations Balkan Fact-Finding Commission in Geneva is currently drafting a report on the facts of the Greek border dispute. According to the secretary of the commission, Colonel Lant, a certain document related to the investigation has gone missing.

### Churchill Criticizes Government, Calls Wallace a Communist

[Reuters, London, 18th] Britain's wartime Prime Minister Churchill spoke at a rally of Conservative supporters here today, saying that Britain is being led into bankruptcy, the empire has been forfeited, and India has been shamelessly abandoned. He criticized the government's fiscal policy, saying that the Socialist government is surviving solely on the alms of the United States, but the loans obtained from the United States are being wasted and abused. These loans should only be used to revive Britain's postwar industry, which would be reasonable. Regarding Wallace's recent visit to Britain, Churchill called Wallace a Communist and lacked the courage to explain his goals. Churchill said he could not tolerate those who used the hospitality of friendly countries to slander their own country. He believes that policy toward the Soviet Union should be based on strength, and establish honorable friendship, and should never be appeased to show weakness. In diplomacy, Britain should make it clear that it will never allow the relationship between Britain and the United States to be alienated, and Britain will never participate in any action that hinders the unity of English-speaking nations.

### Wallace Criticizes Warmongers Again in Speech in Sweden

[United Press, Stockholm, 18th] Wallace said in a public meeting at the University of Stockholm here today that the people of the United States and the Soviet Union are both in dire need of peace, but unfortunately they are inflamed by propaganda. There are now a large number of people who believe that the world is still divided into three, with capitalism, socialism, and communism each occupying one side, so we must engage in war; these radicals are criminals against the welfare of all mankind.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Regarding the invitation from the Greek left-wing united front to Wallace to visit Greece, it is learned that Wallace has declined and said that he will return home in the shortest possible time.

### Far Eastern Commission Sets Japanese Industrial and Agricultural Production Levels

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] The Far Eastern Commission recently announced that it has instructed MacArthur to immediately determine Japanese industrial and agricultural production levels in accordance with the levels of Japanese industry and agriculture in 1930 and 1934. The Commission believes that these levels are sufficient to supply Japan's peacetime needs until 1950. Some heavy industries will be reduced to the levels of 1930-34, but other important peacetime production will be raised, because the living standards of 1930-34 must be maintained.

### The United States is Studying the Details of the Peace Treaty with Japan

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson said at a press conference that the United States is continuing to study the detailed agenda of the peace treaty with Japan, and has been doing so for a long time, but it is only being studied by the State Department, and has not yet been done in conjunction with other governments. The date of convening the peace conference has not yet been determined.

### U.S. Interior Secretary Krug Advocates Statehood for Alaska, Most Members of Congress Express Approval

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Interior Secretary Krug argued before a House subcommittee today that Alaska is crucial to U.S. national defense and is a key hub for future trade with Asia, advocating that the territory be made a state. It is said that Alaska's defense status is well known. We must develop its agriculture, industry, commerce, and various professions to support the defense plans of the army and navy. The great circle air route from San Francisco via the Aleutian Islands to Japan is about 1,700 miles shorter than the old route via the Hawaiian Islands, and the former may become the main air route to Japan and China. Many members of Congress agree with Alaska's statehood, but say that the United States should not rush to build proper defenses in Alaska.

### Hoover Reports to Senate Foreign Relations Committee that World Food Shortage Remains Serious, Relief Fund Expected to Be Approved Quickly

[United Press, Washington, 19th] After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee secretly heard relief expert Hoover report today that the world will face a greater food crisis next year, it has prepared to take action on the $350 million relief fund to provide relief to China and five European countries on the 22nd of this month. After Hoover finished reporting on the food situation in Europe to the committee, he told the press that the current world food shortage situation will be more serious next year, because Europe first encountered severe cold, then suffered floods, and the Allied countries dismantled the Axis powers' armaments industries, which destroyed factories that could be used to produce fertilizer.

### Japanese House of Councillors Election Scheduled to Be Held Today

Conservatives Expected to Win

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Japanese voters will elect 250 members of the House of Councillors tomorrow. Left-wing candidates will work hard to compete, attempting to break the majority held by the Conservative Party, but considering that the Conservative Party won a great victory in the recent local elections, it will still be able to maintain a majority in this House of Councillors election. According to the new constitution, the House of Councillors is the upper house of the Japanese parliament, and its function is to maintain a check on the House of Representatives. Members of the House of Representatives are scheduled to be elected on the 25th of this month.

### Eight-Nation Rice Conference to Be Held in India Next Month

### Widespread Sales, Large-Scale Counterfeit Drug Organization Cracked, Number of Deaths from Past Two Years Unknown, Main Culprit Arrested, Large Quantity of Raw Materials Seized

Recently, the market has been flooded with counterfeit drugs, which has greatly affected the health of citizens. The authorities are paying close attention to this. Recently, Zhang Hanguang, the chief of the Third Inspection Division of the Garrison Command Inspection Office, received a tip and ordered investigators Shang Wu, Zhou Ji, and Zhang Linxiang to investigate. On the morning of the day before yesterday, at six o'clock, on the pretext of buying medicine, they obtained evidence of counterfeit drugs, and arrested the main culprit Gao Qilong at 400 Weihaiwei Road, and Zhang Liangzhu, who was solely responsible for the sales of counterfeit drugs, at the cross-street building of Yongkangli, Chengdu Road. More than ten large boxes of counterfeit drugs that had already been packaged and their raw materials were seized from the two locations. Among them, aspirin, 606, and Ren Dan accounted for the majority. According to confessions, the main counterfeit drug manufacturing organization is said to be in Suzhou. It has been operating for more than two years. The Suzhou side is responsible for manufacturing the drugs, and the Shanghai side is responsible for packaging and sales. The counterfeit drugs include aspirin produced by Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory, Dumartin (morphine injection), Cadang, Neo-Salvarsan, Black Lion 606, Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory's Tianlin, Ke Fa Drugstore's Wakulin, Takeda Pharmaceutical Factory's skin disease medicinal liquor Ertu-fu, Red Granule Ren Dan, and more than a dozen other kinds. The counterfeit drug packaging and printing are almost indistinguishable from the real ones. For two years, they have been sold extensively along the Beijing-Shanghai line in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and as far as Beiping, Tianjin, and the northeastern provinces in North China. According to their own claims, some people have gone blind after using the counterfeit Wakulin eye drops, and some patients have died immediately after using the Dumartin morphine injection. The other counterfeit drugs also have no medicinal ingredients. Recently, they even planned to expand the scale and manufacture them in large quantities. Therefore, if this were not cracked, the consequences would be even more unimaginable. All the suspects were transferred to the Inspection Office for interrogation yesterday, and their accomplices are being strictly pursued (the image below shows the two culprits Gao and Zhang and the seized counterfeit China News Agency)

### The Seymour Road Fire Case

Verdict on the 26th

The Parts of Robbery, Public Danger, and Theft Were Concluded Simultaneously Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] The court yesterday opened a court session to hear the case of the Seymour Road fire, in which 23 firefighters were suspected of committing robbery, public danger, theft, and other crimes, and the verdict will be announced on the 26th of this month.

At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Meier and Tuo first conducted a pre-trial hearing on Shang Zhikui, Li Chengjun, Dai Guangrong, Cai Zhiying, and other four defendants on charges of robbery. The statements of the four people were not much different from before. According to Wan Shengjun, a staff member of the first section of the fire department, who was a witness: I went to inspect with the section chief when the fire was spreading, and the boxes of items had been pressed under the collapsed wall and did not seem to have been moved. The defendant's defense lawyers unanimously criticized the prosecutor, believing that it was inappropriate to cite the provisions of the Regulations on the Punishment of Robbery.

Summoning Multiple Witnesses

In the afternoon, the hearing continued on the charges of public danger and theft against Huang Baoqi, Li Xuan, Zhu Qinglan, and other nineteen people (including Zhou Yuehuan who had died of illness), and the court summoned Godman, the captain of the American fire brigade, Jukefu, the station chief of the American military camp on Xinzha Road, Wang Wentao, the section chief of the first section of the fire department, Song Zhipeng, a military police officer, and many others as witnesses. According to Godman: I arrived at the fire scene at 12:10 AM on the day of the fire and saw more than a dozen firefighters watching from the side. As for whether they were taking turns resting, I don't know. For the convenience of firefighting, I broke the glass on the window with a gun, but I don't know why the Chinese firefighters did not break the window and pierce the roof to rescue. Jukefu said: I am only responsible for protecting the American military camp and I am not very clear about the situation during the firefighting. Song Zhipeng, a military police officer from the 23rd regiment, said: I saw some firefighters talking and laughing in the tailor shop across the street, and I also saw firefighters eating candy at the fire scene. He also said that there were things being taken, but he could not specifically point out who it was.

Denying Allowing It to Spread

The defendant Huang Baoqi stated: When the No. 30 car faucet entered the No. 29 garden, the smoke was very thick. In order to avoid touching the electric wires, I borrowed a fluorescent light for use. Later, I could not find the original owner to return it, so I temporarily kept it in the team. Zhu Qinglan and Li Xun both said that they tried their best to fight the fire and did not allow it to spread. The other defendants also denied stealing property. Later, Wang Wentao, the section chief of the fire department, was summoned as a witness to inquire about the cause of the fire and who was responsible for it. It is said that there was a wooden overpass in the alley connecting to No. 29, which was the biggest reason for the fire to lead to No. 29. The firefighters did try to tie the roof to fight the fire, but because the roofs of these houses were all covered with lead sheets, they could not be pierced. Since the fire could not rise, it spread everywhere, causing a major disaster. According to my observation, the firefighters were not at fault. The weather, the wind, and the unreasonable construction were the biggest reasons. Finally, the court ordered that Huang Shiqi, who was in custody, was allowed to pay a written guarantee of 20 million yuan, and the rest were handed over to the original guarantor, and the witnesses were ordered to return.

### Subsidized Housing

Can Still Be Renewed

The housing allocated by the Housing Allocation Committee of various agencies of the Executive Yuan to public school staff for residence will expire at the end of April this year. However, the housing shortage is still serious. If the owners insist on taking it back, there will inevitably be many disputes. Therefore, the municipal government requested instructions from the Executive Yuan last month. The municipal government has recently received Directive No. 17272 from the Executive Yuan, which roughly stated that "The allocation of housing will expire on April 30, 1947. If the current residents want to continue renting, they should still negotiate a lease with the original owner."

### Police Officer Injured Soldier Conflict Resolved

Determining Responsibility and Ordering Separate Handling

[Our Newspaper's Report] The conflict between police officers and injured soldiers that occurred at Pingliang Road, Meizhou Road, Yangshupu on the afternoon of the 6th of this month has been satisfactorily resolved after the Songhu Garrison Command sent personnel to investigate and handled it carefully with a fair attitude. The handling process and the telex from Commander Xuan to the 20th Rear Hospital of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, the Municipal Police Bureau, and the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police are recorded below; (1) Wang, Director of the 20th Rear Hospital: After investigation by our headquarters, the incident of the conflict between the custodian and the injured soldiers has been clarified and handled separately. In addition to the police officers who have ordered the police bureau to handle the dereliction of duty, and the medical expenses for the injured soldier Zhao Xingchang are allocated by our headquarters, it is also wrong for the injured soldiers to gather crowds to gamble, commit violence, and beat people. You should order the following to be handled: (1) Investigate and identify the ringleader who led the crowd to destroy the police station and the patrol pavilion and send him to the Department for handling according to law. (2) The accomplices of gambling and violence shall be punished separately by the court. (3) One pistol taken from the police officer must be investigated and handed over to the Department for return. In the future, you should strictly manage it to maintain discipline. Please report the handling situation as necessary. (2) Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau: It is known that the case has been investigated and clarified by our newspaper, and handled separately. In addition to the injured soldiers, another telegram will be sent to the 20th Rear Hospital for handling. Regarding the police officers, although banning gambling and implementing security is within the scope of their duties, according to the security situation at the time, it was not necessary to fire a gun to the extent necessary, but they hastily shot, causing stray bullets to injure people, and their defense was excessive, which is also undeniable, and should be discussed separately as follows: (1) Police officer Chen Lifang, No. 855, should be punished for shooting and injuring people due to excessive defense. (2) The police officer who fired the gun on Meizhou Road, and the commanding officer in charge at the time, were incompetent in commanding, and the chief of the police branch in charge failed to quell the chaos immediately, causing the incident, and should be discussed separately. (3) The family members of the passerby Sun Caisheng who was killed should be given preferential treatment. (4) The injured child Wang Zhenjia should be properly treated. You must handle and report separately. The injured police officers should also be treated as necessary. (3) Wu, Commander of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police: The area around Pingliang Road, Meizhou Road is remote, and hooligans and injured soldiers use each other to set up gambling stalls, which not only harms military discipline, but also affects public security. You should quickly work with the police branch in charge to ban them effectively. If they dare to resist, send them to the Department for handling according to law.

Otherwise, we are unwilling to continue negotiations." Huang's fellow villagers and his family were extremely angry after hearing the attitude of the company's authorities.

### Yang Ge's Smuggling of Weapons Case: Air Transport Team Received Secret Tip in Guangzhou, Telegraphed Shanghai to Alert and Seize; Xingzong Repeatedly Stated Yang's Status as Passenger

[Our Newspaper Report] The case of American pilot Yang Ge, who took a Xingzong Air Transport Corps plane from Guangzhou to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM and privately carried weapons, has been detained by the authorities in the Police Headquarters, and yesterday continued to investigate the inside story of his smuggling.

Reporters gathered reports from various sources, knowing that Yang Ge is 26 years old this year. He used to be a pilot for China Airlines. Later, he asked the company for leave. During the leave, Yang Ge was employed by the UN Transport Team as a pilot. This time, the UN provided the Xingzong Air Transport Corps with an airplane, which was transported from Honolulu to China. The plane was flown by Yang Ge after it arrived in China. However, according to regulations, the pilot should be sent back to his place of employment by the team. Therefore, after Yang Ge flew to Guangzhou from Honolulu, he was sent back to Shanghai by the Air Transport Corps. Yang Ge then flew to Shanghai from Guangzhou the morning before yesterday. One minute before the flight took off, the Guangzhou office of the team suddenly received a secret tip that someone had seen Yang disassembling a machine gun when he boarded the plane, along with more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and a left-handed pistol with more than 20 rounds of ammunition, and carried them into the plane. However, due to lack of time, he could not be detained at that time. Therefore, the office immediately notified the Shanghai office by radio at 9:15. After receiving the report, General Chen ordered Colonel Li, an officer of the Inspection Section of the team, to report to the US Consulate and send someone to search. However, the consulate stated that it did not want to advise, so it reported to the customs officers and police station at Longhua Airport. (According to the original schedule, the Air Transport Corps plane was supposed to take off and land at Hongqiao Airport, but it was stipulated that it must first fly to Nenghua Airport for customs inspection before it could fly to Hongqiao Airport for landing.)

At 3:30 PM, Yang Ge arrived by plane, and the people in charge at the airport were ready to thoroughly search the plane. In Yang's luggage, they found a machine gun, a left-handed pistol, and 1,341 rounds of ammunition. The pistol had a license, but the machine gun had no proof of documents and was indeed smuggled. The police station detained Yang Ge.

Yesterday, Delancey Wash, a spokesperson for the Xingzong Air Transport Corps, repeatedly stated to reporters that "Yang Ge is not a pilot of the Air Transport Corps, but a pilot of the UN Transport Team. Yang Ge's trip from Guangzhou to Shanghai is entirely as an ordinary passenger."

Yang Ge to be Transferred to District Procuratorate Tomorrow

Yang Ge, a suspect in arms trafficking, was interrogated in detail yesterday by the Foreign Affairs Investigation Section of the Criminal Division of the Police Department. Yang claimed that the weapons were brought by a friend. Whether this matter has political implications remains to be investigated.

### Prodigal Son Steals, Seeks Death After Spending All the Money

[Our Newspaper Report] Zhu Gengxin, a young man from Ningbo with no occupation, resided at No. 26, Lane 569, Shaanxi South Road. On the 16th of last month, together with his friends Yao Zhengtai (a manager at Canada Flour Mill) and Zhang Jinrong (who runs a restaurant business), he went to the home of Mr. Weina Jian, the Russian manager of the Canada Flour Mill at No. 1, Lane 12, Yuzhou Lane, Nanjing West Road, and jointly stole 95 pieces of coffee-colored and dark green American glass leather wallets, worth 4 million yuan. They sold them to a used goods stall in the Republic of China for 3.2 million yuan. At 7 PM on the 19th of the same month, Zhu Gengxin's girlfriend, dancer Yu Wenzhen, divided the money equally in a rented room at No. 11, Yongqing Lane, Shunchang Road. At that time, Zhu and Zhang each received 1 million yuan, while Yao Zhengtai received 1.2 million yuan alone. On the other hand, Yao, after the theft, had reported the theft to the Lujiawan Police Station on the 18th of the same month on behalf of Mr. Weina Fu, the Russian manager of Canada Flour Mill, and requested an investigation. After investigation by the police, they learned that Zhu was a suspect and went to his home to arrest him but failed. According to Zhu's father, Gengxin used to work in the Green Field Restaurant and had committed theft and had been expelled. Who knew that Guangxin had spent all the money after getting it. On the first day of this month, he went to Suzhou and attempted suicide in a Suzhou hotel. After interrogation by the Wuxian Police Station, Zhu said: His father was the manager of the Green Field Restaurant and had a lot of property, but he was abused by his stepmother, so he came to Suzhou to commit suicide. At that time, policeman Lu Tingming persuaded him to stay, paid 89,000 yuan, and the two of them came to Shanghai on the 12th. At the entrance of Ningbo Merchants Hotel opposite the Great World, Zhu told Lu to wait a moment, pretending to go home to get the money, and never returned. Lu then returned to Suzhou to report. The Suzhou Police Station suspected Lu of being involved in Zhu's escape, so Lu was detained. When he committed suicide in Suzhou, the Wuxian Police Station notified his family by phone to pick him up. His father reported to the police station here and sent the police to Suzhou to meet and bring him back, which happened to be in the opposite direction of Zhu and police Lu's arrival in Shanghai. Later, the bureau learned that Zhu was hiding in the home of his cousin Gu Yinshu at No. 39, Lane 598, Dongyuhang Road, Hongkou, and was finally arrested on the morning of the 18th. Yao Zhengtai and Zhang Jinrong were also arrested and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation after the interrogation.

### Xingzong Fishing Boat Caught Fire, Exploded, and Sank; Two Engineers Burned

[Our Newspaper Report] At 9:30 AM yesterday, a gasoline boat of the Xingzong Fuxing Island Fisheries Management Office caught fire and exploded due to sparks from repairing the electric box igniting the gasoline tank. Although efforts were made to put out the fire, it eventually sank due to the excessive flames. At that time, two Chinese engineers were slightly injured.

Wang Renlin, director of the Fisheries Management Office, reported the detailed process to the authorities, stating that at 9:30 AM yesterday, the gasoline fishing boat No. 6624 of the office was repairing the electric box when a spark suddenly flew onto the gasoline stored in the machine room, causing an immediate explosion. At that time, nearby personnel quickly drove the surrounding boats away and used fire extinguishers to put out the fire. However, because the ship contained gasoline and other flammable materials, the fire could not be extinguished for a while. As a result, they could only tow it to the center of the Huangpu River and pour river water to sink it. At that time, two Chinese engineers who were setting up the electric box were burned, and their injuries were minor.

### Measures for Chinese Edition of American University Textbooks Not Yet Finalized

Many of the textbooks used in universities in our country have always been American books. Since the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was agreed upon, our country can no longer reprint them as before, and due to foreign exchange restrictions, American books cannot come to China in large quantities, so domestic universities are suffering from a book shortage. Recently, a representative of the American McGraw-Hill Book Company was specially sent to China for inspection. The Ministry of Education had discussed with him to ask them to hand over the publication of Chinese editions to major Chinese publishing houses and agree on a contract. The representative of the company agreed to consider it. According to insiders: Chinese political institutions and the general public still need to develop respect for copyright and law-abiding habits.

### Ministry of Education Cables Shandong Provincial Department of Education to Establish Normal Junior College, To Be Reorganized from Existing Political College, Dividing into Five Departments

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th] The Ministry of Education believes that the existing provincial education colleges are for cultivating social education personnel, not for cultivating teachers for secondary schools. Now provinces such as Shaanxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi have established normal junior colleges specializing in cultivating teachers for their own provinces. In view of the fact that Shandong has not yet returned to normal and has limited financial resources, it is not appropriate to run a large-scale independent college. The Ministry of Education specially cabled the Shandong Provincial Department of Education, in consultation with Chairman Wang Yaowu, to reorganize the original Political College into a normal junior college, divided into five departments such as Chinese.

### New School in Guanwai, Changchun University

— Our Newspaper Shenyang Reporter Zhao Zhan

Changda students are very disciplined, and the general Northeastern students have the virtue of being disciplined.

The history of the establishment of National Changchun University is very short, and the problems that have occurred in a very short period are worth noting. The future of Changda is something that people who pay attention to Northeastern education are very concerned about. Changda opened in the winter of last year, and is now facing a barren spring. The impact of spring on the psychology of young students is very profound. How to develop this barren land in spring is not only a problem for Changda, but also a major problem for the Northeastern education community.

The issue of university education ideology has attracted special attention from people in society in recent years, and many scholars and experts have studied it with great care. In the Northeast, this issue is especially important. Northeastern youths and Guannei youths have the same hopes and impulses for politics, and their feelings of the bitterness and annoyance of reality are more sensitive and dangerous than those of Guannei youths. Generally speaking, Northeastern youths' political understanding is extremely superficial, and Northeastern youths' ideological direction also needs active leadership. The smartest way is to lead them in a positive way and encourage their self-confidence. Discarding them, coercing them, or letting them go are all foolish behaviors. To give an example: When Mr. Huang Jinru, President of Changda, reported on his work in Beijing last year, he talked to reporters about the problem of Northeastern education and said that the "enslaved" education received by Northeastern youths was the most profound. When Northeastern youths heard this, they were very dissatisfied, and Changda students also roared against the word "enslavement" in the readers' column of the newspaper here. The fact is the fact, but the language stung the patriotic heart of Northeastern youths. This proves that Japan's education in the Northeast was a complete failure.

The more than 2,000 students in Changda's six colleges and twenty-three departments are now concentrated in the old site of the puppet Manchukuo University of Technology for classes. The dormitories are the residences of Japanese officials during the puppet Manchukuo period, not far away. Changda originally took over a lot of houses, but in winter they had to concentrate together for classes because of the lack of coal. In the spring, they can repair some of the houses they have taken over that have few doors and no windows, and they will be very comfortable in the summer. I went to visit their dining hall, which was originally an affiliated factory of the puppet Manchukuo University of Technology. All the machines have long been moved, and the students eat sorghum rice for three meals. In the morning, it is porridge, and for lunch and dinner, each person has a bowl of cabbage soup, with very little oil. Their lives are very hard. Poor students and demobilized youths from the Youth Army account for 80%, and they are all publicly funded students. Self-funded students account for only 20%. Their dressing and clothing are the same as the students in the rear universities during the war. On the surface, although the clothes they wear are not very ragged, they are by no means tidy, and 80% of the students cannot talk about family support.

Books and professors are both problems in Changda. The supply of books is difficult. In addition to Japanese books, there are no reference books at all. This is a very heavy task in teaching. Many professors hold concurrent positions, and some treat teaching as a sideline, often missing classes. Students are very dissatisfied with this, because students' desire for knowledge is very urgent, and they feel that missing a class is a debt owed to them. They all hope that this phenomenon can be improved as soon as possible. The dialect of the professors has also become a major problem. A philosophy professor from Hunan, the students could not understand his full-mouthed Hunan dialect. Fortunately, this professor was a student in Japan and spoke Japanese very well, so he changed to lecturing in Japanese, but demobilized youths from the Youth Army who were not from the Northeast were helpless. Also, because the students' levels are uneven, the professors can only cater to the students with lower levels, so the students in the third grade of the Department of Economics are still taking bookkeeping courses, and the students with higher levels feel boring and tasteless. There is a Department of Journalism in the College of Arts, and the people who attend the lectures are very crowded, probably because journalism is a relatively new thing. It is said that Changda will add a Department of Journalism in the next semester.

Changda students are very disciplined, and the general Northeastern students have the virtue of being disciplined. In terms of the management of the school authorities, they emphasize discipline. The need for disciplinaryization of young students has its value in the Northeast. The country and society today give young people too much spiritual stimulation, and its impact is very profound. Although young students' emotions are rich, they are not very rational after all. If students' behavior is not restrained at all and they are allowed to indulge, it will not only affect students' studies, but also be terrible for the corruption of their physical and mental health and morality. In terms of Changda students' discipline, it can be seen from one thing that their classrooms and dormitories are about five miles away from the auditorium, and students automatically run there every Monday for commemorative weeks, and no one is lazy. The school authorities' restraints on students are stricter than those of universities in the interior, and the students do not feel that their freedom has been deprived. Because they are used to a disciplined life, they do not feel any inconvenience.

Because Changda's members include students from 17 universities in the puppet Manchukuo, the content of this combination is very complicated. Feudal consciousness is still at work, forming the opposition of small groups, and even openly causing trouble. When electing the chairman of the student union in the Law School, there was a big fight for a while, and later the officers' school faction prevailed. This kind of factional struggle will undoubtedly affect the future discipline of the school. So far, the gulf between factions clearly exists, which is unfortunate for the school. In any case, their student union has been organized.

Changda students have a thrifty style. Their material lives are very hard, but they can be self-reliant, study hard, and about one-fifth of the students are working and studying. They cherish this school with such a spirit of learning, and the future of Changda is bright. April 14 in Changchun.

### Mayor Summons Rice Industry Representatives for Talks; Strict Punishment for Black Market Activities; Municipal Government Sells Rice at a Limited Price of 135,000 Yuan per Stone

[Our Newspaper Report] Mayor Wu is determined to thoroughly realize the issue of suppressing and stabilizing rice prices in the city and has great confidence in this regard. At 9:00 AM yesterday, he specially summoned nine representatives of rice shops and merchants in the city, including Cui Zhenhua, Yang Runhui, Hu Chenggang, distributor Zha Baoshan, Yang Jiuzi, Yin Fuxiang and Hu Wenan from the Nanshi Market, and Xu Songren and Cai Shengming from the Beishi Market, for a lengthy discussion. Mayor Wu stated that prices in rice-producing areas are now trending downward, and rice prices in the city should also fall back. He hopes that the merchants will work together to overcome the difficulties of the times and not hoard or speculate. As for the 9,000 dan of rice required daily in the city, the government has decided to allocate and sell it at a limited price of 135,000 yuan. If there are still black market activities thereafter, once discovered, they will be severely punished without leniency.

Three Major Decisions to Suppress Rice Prices

After meeting with the grain merchants, Mayor Wu met with reporters and spoke about three decisions to stabilize rice prices: (1) Since the implementation of the economic emergency measures in February to suppress and stabilize prices in the city, we have taken a two-pronged approach from both economic and political perspectives. The rise in rice prices has the greatest impact on people's livelihoods. The municipal government will continue to sell white japonica and indica rice until the rice price in the city is balanced with that of the producing areas. Today, the limited price in the city has been slightly increased, but only downwards and not upwards, suppressing it to the target of 144,000 to balance with the 130,000 in the producing areas. (2) Suppressing rice prices in the producing areas. Since Chairman Thirteen arrived in Shanghai and issued strict orders for implementation, on the 15th, the central government immediately dispatched officials to cooperate with the Jiangsu Provincial Government to vigorously implement it. The municipal government currently has 130,000 tons of rice in storage, totaling 450,000 bags, and foreign rice and Sichuan rice continue to be transported and sold without problems. Rice prices will definitely fall in the short term. (3) If there are any cases of exceeding the limited price, the authorities have established measures to crack down and will severely punish without leniency. The municipal government has telegraphed the police局 that violators will be arrested.

Investigating Rice Shops for Raising Prices

[Our Newspaper Report] Economic investigators yesterday again discovered that the Daxin Rice Shop on Ouyang Road and the Yixing Rice Shop were raising market prices and were suspected of hoarding. The Daxin Rice Shop sold white japonica rice at a black market price of 180,000 yuan per stone and foreign indica rice at 170,000 yuan per stone at 4:00 PM on the 18th. The Yixing Rice Shop raised the price of white japonica rice to 200,000 yuan per stone. Yesterday morning, the fourth section of the administrative department of the police局 summoned Liu Fuqing, the accountant of Daxin Rice Shop, and Liu Yongchang, the manager of Yixing Rice Shop, to the bureau for questioning and detained them as a warning to others.

Prices in Producing Areas Fall; Japonica Currency Continues to Plunge

Yesterday, a total of more than 3,600 shi of rice grain arrived in the north and south markets, and rice allocation continued to be sold. Prices in the interior fell, shops were cold and slack, the market was quiet, and the supply exceeded demand. Japonica and indica rice all continued to plummet by 10,000 yuan, and Ziyin and Yuanyin also fell back by 5,000 yuan successively.

Flour sales were sluggish, and prices fell by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Wheat bran continued to be cut by 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were very strong, plummeting by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans, with oil cakes downstream, were sluggish and fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

The oil market retreated rapidly, plummeting by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were extremely sluggish, falling sharply by 20,000 yuan. Sesame followed other items in falling by 10,000 yuan, red sorghum followed by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and corn was hoped for by households, but only by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Only mung beans were scarce and firm, and broad beans were lively, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

Edible oil, due to merchants selling to distant merchants, oil factories, etc., and the oil industry association jointly strengthening the sale of parity oil and prohibiting the export of edible oil, the pressure was great, and it became a tragic plunge.

### Unified Bonds Firmly Strong

The public bond market still felt good yesterday. The National Banking Association had various proposals, and it was heard that the multiple of court rulings in other ports was even higher, and the buying sentiment gradually moved. The unified C started at a low price of 13,800 yuan in the morning and returned to the market, finally rising to 15,000 yuan outside the market. The asking price continued to rise after closing, and as a result, each price reported rose by more than 1,000 yuan compared to the previous closing, with a turnover of about 6 million.

### Foreign Stocks Mediocre

Foreign stocks were only mediocre yesterday, and a slight weakness appeared in the middle. The prosperity of the black market exchange rate finally showed stability. Yisha started at 40,600 yuan in the morning and broke into the 40,000 yuan level in the middle, finally hovering outside the level. As a result, the telephone association, Jardine Matheson, was flat compared to the previous closing. Paper, shipping, land reclamation, and Kwong each rose by half a percent, and the rest reported a slight increase.

### Remittances from Four Banks and Two Bureaus; Exchange Rate Slightly Revised

[Our Newspaper Report] The exchange rate for remittances from the four banks and two bureaus in the city to various places will be slightly revised again starting from the 21st.

A new place, Wanxian, has been added, with an exchange rate of 8 yuan per thousand yuan. The exchange rates for other regions remain the same.

It is reported that after the exchange rate for remittances to Guangzhou and Shantou has repeatedly risen, remittances to the two places are often remitted through Guangxi, so the exchange rate in Guangxi has also increased. In addition, recently, new cotton in Central China has entered the market and urgently needs funds for procurement. However, transportation is still inconvenient in various places, affecting the transfer of cash. Therefore, the exchange rate for various places in Central China has also increased. It is said that the exchange rate of commercial banks to Hankou and Changsha is in the range of 80 to 90 yuan.

First, Wang reported that he had discussed with various relevant authorities the day before, and the authorities expressed great sympathy for the current difficult situation of the cotton textile industry. However, it is hoped that the industry can make its own plans and find ways to stabilize yarn prices. At the same time, consider enriching the members of the private yarn factories in the Textile Management Committee. It is proposed to expand the existing 11 members of the committee to 15, and then hire 4 more members from private yarn factories, and also propose to add a vice chairman, who will also be concurrently held by a member of the private yarn factory. Then, the discussion began, and two important cases were passed: (1) Approved and agreed to the following three principles: (a) The legislation of the Textile Management Committee should be confirmed. (b) The resolution of the Textile Management Committee should be respected. (c) The policy of the Textile Management Committee should be determined to improve the direction. (2) In addition to the original standing directors, Liu Jingzheng, Lu Zidong, Cheng Jingtang, Rong Erren, and Tong Runfu were elected to participate in the study of how to enrich the Textile Management Committee.

The Cotton Allocation of the Joint Relief Completed

[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that, except for 25,000 bales of cotton that have been allocated to 22 yarn factories in the city with weak cotton storage, the 90,000 bales of cotton that the Joint Relief arrived in Shanghai must be allocated to large yarn factories in other ports, about 10,000 bales. In addition, the state-owned China Textile Construction Company can also be allocated about 40,000 bales within days. Therefore, the cotton storage of the Joint Relief in Shanghai has been allocated.

The Textile Management's Number of Yarn Purchases is Determined

[Our Newspaper Report] Liu Wensheng, director of the business department of the Textile Management Committee, went to Beijing on the 17th to report to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the allocation of foreign cotton by the Joint Relief, and returned to Shanghai yesterday. He told reporters: The Textile Management Committee first issued this month's purchase of cotton yarn, each piece is 3.4 million yuan. This number is calculated based on the cotton cost of each factory in December last year. However, it is still a large number, and it is not the decided purchase price for April. As for the cotton allocated by the Executive Yuan this time, and the cotton imported with the quota limit from February to April this year, if it has been used by each factory, it will also be used as a reference for determining the purchase.

### Silk Market Continues to Weaken

### Export Tea Market Lacks Vitality

Recently, the export tea market has not only failed to improve but has also continued to weaken. The reason is that most goods owners, aware that the new tea of this year is gradually approaching the picking and production season, are eager to sell off their old tea in order to acquire new tea. However, buyers are not eager to absorb it and are taking the opportunity to push down prices. Transactions are sporadic, and the market is difficult to improve. Recently, suppliers' willingness to sell has slightly rebounded, but purchasers are only taking advantage of opportunities to buy at low prices, so the trend remains stagnant and difficult to improve. The situation for various types of domestic tea remains similar to that of the previous day, as supply meets demand and sentiment lacks momentum.

### Hard Coal Dust Prices Surge

High-grade hard coal dust, such as Kailuan dust, Keelung dust, and Fuxin dust, continues to sell well, and prices are rising again. Intermediate-grade hard coal dust, such as Polot dust and Fengcheng dust, and low-grade hard coal dust, such as Baoshan dust and Changshan dust, continue to arrive, and although prices have also risen, traders' willingness to buy is weaker, and transactions are average. Sales of briquettes in various coal shops have recently gradually increased, but prices in various factories remain the same. The market for white coal is thin in terms of both arrivals and inventory, and prices are firm. The market is quite strong. Firewood and charcoal lack momentum to rise, and prices remain mediocre.

### Random Notes from Northern Shaanxi (3): North of Yan'an

— By Our Reporter Zhang Xianzhou, Sent from Xi'an on the 8th

In the battles of Northern Shaanxi, the Chinese Communists (CCP) have consistently miscalculated strategically in their "defensive war." This was the case in the Battle of Yan'an, as well as in the battles around Yan'an and in areas to the north, such as Wayao Fort.

On the afternoon of the 8th, Deputy Chief of Staff Xie of the First War Zone said in his operational report: "Ideally, we thought that in the Battle of Yan'an, because Chen Fa's troops were transferred from Jin (Shanxi) to the west of Yan'an, about 80-100 li away, Yan'an had already been liberated, so this fresh force did not catch up with 'defending Chairman Mao,' and 'Greater Yan'an' was already 'lost.'" We thought that north of Yan'an, a fierce battle would be inevitable. In fact, this was not the case at all, and our army continued to pursue smoothly."

Heavy Troops Deployed Around Wayao Fort

After recovering Yan'an, the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) spent three days clearing up the remnants of the CCP near the city. They began to advance on the 24th. At this time, the CCP's headquarters had moved to Wayao Fort. In the CCP's estimation, the NRA would take advantage of the momentum of capturing Yan'an and definitely attack Wayao Fort to the north. Therefore, heavy troops were deployed around Wayao Fort, intending to show the attacking NRA some resistance in this area. According to what we heard at the time, the CCP's 3rd Brigade and 4th Brigade of the police force were in Panlongzhen, the 358th Brigade was in Yongping, the Training Brigade was north of Yongping, the New 8th Brigade was in Wayao Fort, the New 9th Brigade was in Dantou, and the Honor 1st Brigade and 2nd Brigade were near Anding. Of course, the actual number of troops was not that many, but these were indeed the unit designations. From this, it can be seen that the CCP's defense of Wayao Fort was quite tight at the time. They also declared that they would return to Yan'an."

The Most Exciting Scene: Capturing Wujiazhai

The attack began with a small number of NRA troops slowly advancing north, feigning an attack on Panlong and Yongping. In fact, the main force advanced towards Yanchuan. At the same time, south of Yanchang, NRA troops also coordinated by advancing north from Linzhen. On the 27th, they captured Yuguyi, and on the 28th, the troops advancing east recovered Yanchuan. The remnants of the CCP outside Yanchang were attacked from both sides and had their retreat cut off, and they scattered in panic. Yanchang was also captured by the NRA. On the 30th, they cleared the area near Yanchuan and Yanchang. At this time, the CCP had transferred two brigades from the west to reinforce Jianjian to the east. After several fierce battles on the 31st, the CCP forces collapsed, and Jianjian was also captured.

From Yanchuan to Jianjian, it is Suide to the north, which is a main road, just like from Luochuan to Yan'an. Therefore, after the NRA entered Jianjian, the CCP assumed that the NRA had changed its route and would advance north along the highway, launching a frontal attack. Therefore, they transferred another batch of troops to deploy south of Suide, waiting for the NRA to advance north. However, the NRA turned around and attacked Wayao Fort, and captured it on April 3rd. On the 4th, they began to pursue northeast. At the same time, they captured Wujiazhai, where they captured a lot of the CCP's supplies. Important items included a radio station, automobiles, the Xinhua Printing Factory, a yarn factory, etc. After the Battle of Yan'an, this battle should be considered the most exciting scene.

"Second Yan'an" May Be Wutai Mountain

Although the CCP forces in Northern Shaanxi were discouraged after the NRA captured Yan'an, they did not lose hope. Therefore, in those few days, after the CCP lost a place, they mostly retreated to the northwest. This sign indicates that although Yan'an was "lost," the CCP had not forgotten about Northern Shaanxi. They were waiting for an opportunity to counterattack, so "returning to Yan'an" was not just a bluff, but they had the strength and intention to do so.

The NRA's victory during these ten days from March 24th to April 3rd (advancing 420 li) changed this idea of the CCP. According to intelligence I heard in Yan'an, after Wayao Fort changed hands, the main force of the CCP began to retreat east. At the same time, on the evening of the 6th, the CCP's Wang Zhen's troops, with the designations of four brigades and the actual strength of eight regiments, launched a surprise attack from west to east in Wujia South and north of Yongping. At the same time, the CCP's defending forces in Wayao Fort exceptionally did not retreat to the northwest towards Suide. From these two events, it can be seen that the CCP may no longer defend Northern Shaanxi stubbornly and not commit its main force. When necessary, the main force will withdraw east, leaving behind some guerrillas, and then try to take the opportunity to rise again. As for where the CCP's "Second Yan'an" should be, according to CCP prisoners of war: "It may be Wutai Mountain in Shanxi."

General Hu Zongnan on the Future of the Shaanxi War

How will the war in Northern Shaanxi develop in the short term? This reporter asked many senior officials, and their opinions can be summarized into two points: First, the NRA's purpose is to destroy the CCP's old nest, so that the CCP understands the power of the government, and does not want to kill a certain number of people to show the public. "In the strategy of war, winning back the hearts of the people is the best policy, and encircling and annihilating them is the worst policy." (Words of a senior official) We judge that there will not be a large-scale war in Northern Shaanxi, and neither side will sacrifice more people. Second, the NRA's strategy may tend to be a frontal attack. In the past two days, the NRA in Yulin may attack Mizhi to the south, and another route will capture Hengshan and then Jingbian, possibly joining forces with the NRA forces under Ning Ma, and then joining forces with the NRA forces advancing north from Yan'an to the southwest. In this way, the NRA's three-sided encirclement of the CCP in Northern Shaanxi will be completed. Before the encirclement can be tightened, it is feared that the pincers of Qingjian and Mizhi will force the main force of the CCP to fight one or two more fierce battles, and then withdraw east, leaving behind a part to resist and conduct guerrilla warfare.

General Hu Zongnan said in a press conference on the evening of the 7th: "...I think that before this goal is achieved, Suide can be taken down, and by the end of May, all of Northern Shaanxi can be gradually recovered." Then the next month and a half should be the end of the war in Northern Shaanxi. (Completed in Xi'an on April 8th.)

### Characteristics and Essentials of the New Banking Law

— Zhang Zhaoyuan

Introduction

China's Banking Law, promulgated by the National Government on March 28, 1931, has remained unimplemented for sixteen years. However, the Savings Bank Law, promulgated and implemented on July 4, 1934, has been in effect for over twelve years. During these years, including the eight years of the War of Resistance, the socio-economic landscape has undergone tremendous changes. The government's regulation of banks has inevitably involved the issuance of orders or the establishment of measures as needed. This has led to concerns about the government focusing on one aspect while neglecting others, and banks facing difficulties in adapting. In August 1945, with the end of the war, the economy was expected to transition to a peacetime state. Under the direction of President Sun, the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Committees began to revise the Banking Law. Sixteen committee members, including Zhang Zhaoyuan, Ma Yinchu, Lou Tongsun, Chen Changheng, Dai Xiujun, Wei Tingsheng, Di Ying, Liu Tong, Li Qing, Yao Chuanfa, Huang Yunsu, Chen Zifeng, Jian Guansan, Li Yuanbai, Liu Butong, and Sun Jiulu, were appointed for the initial review. Zhang Zhaoyuan was designated as the convener to begin drafting. After multiple discussions and seven revisions, the draft was finalized at a joint meeting of the Finance and Economic Committees on April 12, 1947. It was then thoroughly discussed at the Legislative Yuan, passing the first reading with reservation for a second reading during the 322nd session on April 17 of the same year. The motivations, principles, and process of revising the Banking Law are detailed below:

There are three motivations for revising the Banking Law:

(1) The Banking Law promulgated on March 28, 1931, has never been implemented. It would be more accurate to consider this the enactment of a new banking law rather than a revision of the old one. For the past decade, all bank regulations have been implemented through orders or measures. During the turbulent political and economic conditions of wartime, these ad hoc arrangements were tolerated by the people. However, in peacetime, with increasing stability, there must be clear and legally defined regulations for both the government and the people to follow.

(2) The old Banking Law was never implemented, and the Savings Bank Law is also outdated. Furthermore, trust companies, which are a type of bank, and money shops (錢莊), which are local financial institutions with centuries of history predating modern banks, and the legal status of foreign banks following the abolition of unequal treaties, all need to be clearly defined in one law.

(3) Banks are the linchpin of all industries. Whether it is agriculture, industry, commerce, or any other business, or even individuals, they all rely on financial institutions to facilitate the receipt and payment of funds, ensuring the flow and activity of capital between production and consumption. Therefore, the importance of banks in society is evident. To achieve progress in all industries, it is essential to have sound and compliant financial institutions. Therefore, the swift enactment of a banking law is necessary.

Principles for Revising the Banking Law

There are ten principles for revising the Banking Law:

(1) Except for national banks and provincial and county banks, which are subject to separate regulations, all private or joint government-private banks are governed by a single law. Based on the experience of regulating financial businesses and the needs of the financial industry, the law broadly adopts and incorporates various elements, clarifying all previous orders and measures, summarizing key points, aiming for permanence, simplicity, and clarity, and seeking to align with reality. The goal is to ensure that there are no supplementary clauses outside the Banking Law that misinterpret or alter its true intent.

(2) Banks are divided into five types. Each type conducts its business, enjoys rights, and fulfills obligations according to its category. Those already approved to establish and operate can either maintain their current status or gradually make corrections. Those applying for establishment must strictly adhere to the new Banking Law, ensuring that in the near future, all types of banks are brought into compliance, preventing deceptive practices, and promoting parallel development.

(3) Increase legal flexibility to avoid Procrustean solutions, simplify government intervention, and encourage free development. For example, bank capital is not fixed due to fluctuating currency values and different economic conditions in various regions. The central regulatory authority will divide the country into regions and separately approve capital amounts (Article 19). Banks' guarantee reserves can be offset by government bonds, treasury bills, and corporate bonds, benefiting both the government and banks (Articles 48, 57, 67, etc.). Government regulation is based on regional standards, taking into account the economic and financial conditions of each region. Within the same region, there should be no preferential or discriminatory treatment.

(4) Be pragmatic, eliminate pretense, emphasize guidance, and remove passive restrictions. Past laws, due to extraordinary times, had to impose strict restrictions, addressing problems piecemeal. As a result, banks, for their own benefit, were forced to feign compliance, avoid important issues, and take the easy way out. Initially, a few attempted to exploit loopholes, but eventually, many followed suit, becoming a common practice. Ultimately, making false statements became an open secret, deviating from the fundamental principle of trustworthiness in banking. Instead of correcting abuses, it aided wrongdoing, contradicting the intention of the legislation. Therefore, the new Banking Law, on one hand, allows freedom of business development, specifying regulations according to each category, such as setting loan limits based on total deposits (Articles 29-51, 52, 61-63, 71-74, 86, 92, and 94). On the other hand, it strictly prohibits false accounting. (Articles 43 and 79, etc.)

(5) Establish a clear system applicable nationwide. The central regulatory authority can divide the country into regions and separately approve capital amounts, and also determine the required capital for each region and the amount needed for a certain type of bank to concurrently operate other banking businesses (Article 19). It can also prohibit the establishment of new banks or certain types of banks based on the economic and financial conditions of each region (Article 23). For example, China has a vast territory with significant differences in economic conditions. What is suitable for the southeast may not be suitable for the northwest. What is surplus in large metropolitan areas may be urgently needed in remote areas. The new Banking Law has a high degree of flexibility, adapting to different environments and adjusting the supply and demand in various regions.

(6) Different types of banks are subject to separate regulations based on the nature of their business. Commercial banks prioritize flexibility, industrial banks value stability, savings banks aim to strictly protect depositors, trust companies must faithfully fulfill trust agreements, and money shops (錢莊) emphasize their customs. All types of banks take credibility and realism as fundamental principles. For example, commercial banks are not forced to invest in industry (Article 50), industrial banks must prioritize industrial lending (Articles 58 and 60), specialized banks should increase their business loans to over 50%, savings banks and trust companies, under certain conditions, are required to hold their responsible persons jointly and severally liable with unlimited liability (Articles 77 and 88), and the credit loans of money shops (錢莊) are limited to below 50% (Article 94).

(7) The scope of business of trust companies is wider than that of any other bank. Trust companies also aspire to be all-encompassing and do everything, wanting to cover banking, trust, insurance, notarization, real estate, stocks, construction, law, accounting, and even matters relating to personnel before and after death. However, China's trust industry is still in its infancy, and it is questionable whether it has such a strong capacity. Furthermore, services that require qualification through examination, such as those of lawyers, accountants, and architects, do not seem to be appropriate for trust companies to provide, as they may encroach on free professions. Article 86 stipulates that when trust companies perform trust services involving legal, accounting, personnel, or other non-financial matters, they should engage registered and qualified lawyers, accountants, or other specialized technicians to perform them, which effectively avoids major negligence by trust companies and protects the interests of the trustors.

(9) Money shops (錢莊) have a long history, established customs, and strong local ties. In China today, where banks have not yet become widespread nationwide, towns and villages cannot do without money shops to regulate local finance. Although some money shops in large metropolitan areas are larger than banks, the majority of money shops nationwide are smaller than banks. The new Banking Law permits the existence and establishment of money shops (Chapter VII), emphasizes their local customs (Article 93), and relaxes the limits on credit loans according to their customs (Article 94). In addition to commercial banking business, they may also engage in other banking businesses (Article 95). However, due to their strong local ties and the significant differences in the customs of money shops in various regions, the establishment of branches is restricted (Article 96). Moreover, when their capital meets the minimum capital requirement for banks, they should be renamed as banks (Article 93, Paragraph 2). This is to ensure that, at a suitable time in the future, when China's economic strength is strong, banks will be established nationwide, and money shops will become a historical term.

(9) The regulations for foreign banks do not adopt the lenient approach of the UK or the restrictive measures of the US. They are based on China's own position, economic needs, and the nearly century-long history of foreign banks in China as factors in determining the legislative intent. China needs foreign investment to aid its construction as an established economic policy, and the fact that foreign capital is more abundant and interest rates are lower is undeniable. Furthermore, China lacks connections in foreign trade and does not yet have a linked organization for handling foreign exchange, so it seems necessary to rely on foreign banks to expand China's foreign trade and serve as a guide for Chinese banks to establish branches abroad. Therefore, the new Banking Law permits foreign banks to engage in commercial banking business to benefit China's foreign trade and industrial banking business to aid China's domestic construction (Article 102). However, they are not allowed to concurrently engage in savings bank or trust company business (Article 103), and their fixed-term deposits are limited to use within China (Article 105). These are extremely reasonable provisions and have no discriminatory intent. Article 101, which concerns the areas where foreign banks can be established, is consistent with the intent of Article 22 and is particularly reasonable.

(10) Banks are a type of company. According to Article 12 of the Company Law, companies are divided into five types. The establishment of a bank can choose one of the five types of companies to organize. Foreign banks are also a type of foreign company and can apply for special permission according to the regulations for foreign companies in the Company Law. Therefore, the procedures and fees for banks applying for business registration, foreign banks applying for special permission, and other registrations of banks shall be governed by the provisions of the Company Law. This simplifies the registration procedures and provides convenience to both Chinese and foreign banks. The Banking Law is a special law of the Company Law, so the provisions already existing in the general law are not listed in this special law.

The above ten points are the major ones and are therefore called principles. In addition, the revisions and additions to the articles, as well as the results of textual refinements, are scattered throughout the articles and will not be listed individually. Regarding bank accounting, there were originally some clauses in the draft, but because the Commercial Accounting Law is currently under review in the Legislative Yuan and is expected to be passed and promulgated soon, so that the national commercial accounting will have uniform measures, it is not listed in the new Banking Law either.

Since the Banking Law promulgated on March 28, 1931, has not been implemented, and the Savings Bank Law promulgated and implemented on July 4, 1934, is largely the same as the savings bank provisions of the new Banking Law, there is no need for a clause-by-clause comparison. Since there were no previous regulations for industrial banks, trust companies, money shops (錢莊), and foreign banks, this is the first time they have been created, so there is no object for comparison either, so they are also omitted.

When revising laws, three points should be paid attention to: (1) Whether it is in line with reality and can be promoted smoothly. (2) Whether it is flexible and extensible and can be popularized nationwide. (3) Whether it has fulfilled its potential and can be passed down for a long time. Although the author has studied it in detail for more than a year, there is no guarantee of perfection. There are many difficulties in this revision of the Banking Law, and the major ones are about five points:

(1) During the War of Resistance, there was currency inflation, and now, nearly two years after the end of the war, the currency value has not yet stabilized. It is even more difficult to predict what will happen in the future, and in some areas, the situation is special, with locally used currencies, so where a specific number should be determined, another standard of calculation has to be sought.

(2) China has a vast territory, with great differences in customs and even greater differences in economy and finance. It is impossible to find a common standard suitable for all regions. Moreover, the situation during the war is different from that in the early years, and the situation after the war may not be similar to that before the war. In this period of drastic economic changes, the former is not sufficient as a law, and the latter is difficult to grasp, but it is impossible to write out of thin air and close the door to build a cart.

(3) Although opinions from all parties are widely solicited, many are inevitably based on their own interests, with each having its own position and reasons. Different people have different views, making it difficult for the intermediary to make a decision, and it is not possible to do one's best by compromising and compromising.

(4) Money shops (錢莊) in China have a long history and deeply ingrained habits, while the history of banking is temporary but extremely complex. The process of development is different, and it is not easy to unify the regulations. If the legislative standard is low, one will lose sight of the other and be stretched thin. If the legislative standard is high, there will be evasion and trickery, and it will be difficult to implement the law. It is also not easy to find a standard that is not too high or too low, and that is moderately lenient and strict, so that everyone can easily abide by it.

(5) During peacetime legislation, it is natural to replace the passive restrictions and constraints of the extraordinary period with active guidance and incentives. However, in recent years, the vast majority of those engaged in the banking industry have been engaged in their banking business, but there are also those who use banks as a cover to engage in speculation, manipulation, and hoarding for profit. Actively guiding and rewarding them would be beneficial to this group, while passive restrictions and constraints would inevitably harm legitimate bankers. Good and bad are mixed, and it is difficult to distinguish between black and white. Therefore, in the guidance and incentives, there are still traces of restrictions and constraints.

The above difficulties are not easy to overcome, and the regulations are tentative and can be used as a reference for future sages.

### Raphael's Paintings

— Xu Fan

One day, as Raphael was painting, a friend from afar came in and watched the artist's work. "You are making great progress in painting, Raphael..." he said passionately, "I have just returned from Florence, and I wish you could see Leonardo's paintings, especially the horses! Their four feet are firmly on the ground, and their manes tremble with anger. I do not deny that Perugino is a good painter—but, but Leonardo's horses!"

Raphael abruptly threw aside the brush beside him. "Go there?" his friend asked. Raphael replied eagerly, "Go to Florence!"

Raphael had often heard about the beauty of Florence. Perugino also often mentioned to his students the great artists living in that city, described their marble palaces, depicted the lovely gardens, and told them about the dome in the cathedral, which was more beautiful than any building in the world. Raphael's heart was filled with the desire to go to beautiful Florence.

Now, he had arrived in this beautiful city. He was quickly familiarized with and loved by the great artists of Florence. His beauty and gentle face made him quickly acquainted with many friends wherever he went. The beautiful paintings in his studio won people's admiration, among which a painting called "Saint Mary of the Garden" was painted in Florence and is still hanging in the art exhibition hall in Paris.

Florence is a large city in Rome, famous for its beautiful paintings and magnificent architecture. Among them is the palace of the Roman Pope, called the Vatican, which has more than a thousand rooms. Many of the rooms have paintings on the walls. The Roman Pope is always paying attention to famous artists and sending them out on visits. When Raphael was twenty-five years old, he received an invitation from the Roman Pope to go to Rome to paint part of the Vatican Palace.

After that, Raphael's first task was to paint frescoes in the Roman Pope's palace. The Roman Pope liked Raphael's work there very much. He decided to let him decorate the entire hall of the Vatican Palace.

There were many paintings by Perugino and other artists in this hall. In order for Raphael to paint, the Roman Pope ordered all these paintings to be removed. Raphael felt very uneasy when he heard that his teacher's paintings had been removed for his work. He asked the Roman Pope to keep Perugino's paintings, which can still be seen in Rome today.

There is a "Madonna Enthroned" In this painting, we see the little angel lying lovingly in his mother's arms, as if the mother is holding her own child. There is a very moving record in the ancient legend about the entire plot of this painting.

Almost all of Raphael's paintings have lovely children. Look at the young Saint John the Baptist in the Madonna Enthroned, and the little angels in the Sistine Madonna, all of which tell us that the angels in these amazing paintings are second to none.

Also, Raphael's colors, if you pay attention to them, are very gentle and full of enthusiasm, like the almost fantastic power of a brilliant sunset. The colors on his canvas are painted thinly and transparently, and the lines in his paintings sometimes seem to be a bit worse.

In Rome, Raphael's painting was amazing. He became famous like those great artists in Italy. Some people called him the greatest artist in the world. His studio was crowded with artists who hoped to discover some of the subtleties of his painting. This also tells us that Raphael was loved by these many students. Sometimes, there were as many as fifty people walking with him on the street. They were very happy to be close to this painting teacher.

When you see the entire Sistine Madonna, you will definitely feel its extraordinary beauty. It is the most adorable of Raphael's Madonnas. It exists in Germany, hanging in a separate room near Dresden. When people see the mother and angels on it, their eyes are filled with tears. Everyone raises their hats involuntarily and walks past silently. The room is very quiet, and even the slightest noise can be heard.

Raphael unfortunately passed away at the age of thirty-eight, but he will live forever in the hearts of all who have seen his paintings. No one will ever see another painter's paintings that are so loved, so moving, and so perfect.

### Inscriptions on Paintings

— Hongwei Old Man

Mandarin Ducks and Peach Blossoms

Returning from fishing, rarely ask about the ferry, a fairyland surpassing the secular world, separated by clear dust. Peach blossoms reflect their shadows in the melting place, allowing graceful birds to occupy the beautiful spring.

Hibiscus and Secluded Bird

So much like heavy makeup looking in the mirror, a red shadow ripples in the clear waves. The secluded bird understands the taste of autumn, and the frost falls on the Wu River, yet it is not cold.

Peach Willows and Swallows

In the clear and new weather, the willow wind is light, and a branch of spring enters the small peach red. The swallows from faraway Bali in February seem to say that the scenery of Jiangnan is different.

Azaleas and Orchids

Flowers on the branches like snow, hear the cuckoo in the moonlight. The spiritual root is pure and exquisite, first competing with spring.

### Visiting Gu's Tomb on Qionglong Mountain

— Shi Chongpeng

Qionglong Mountain is thirty li southwest of Suzhou. The tomb of Gu Yong, the Prime Minister of the Three Kingdoms Wu, is here. The picture is a work of the author and Mr. Gu Yiqiao visiting the tomb and traveling. The lake and mountains are beautiful, and the brush and ink are vigorous and unrestrained. It is full of misty charm. — Editor's Note

### Two Poems

— Weng

Mourning Scholar Songcen

After returning from the battlefield, the jade fragments are emerald, and driving to the underworld loses the rugged mountains; a lifetime of offending things is due to the heavens' jealousy, and today the benefactor can only dream of his relatives; growing old, the wheels turn and the hatred of the family and country, in poverty, the words and verses are sold for rice with difficulty; the maple leaves fall in the west mountain and his Wu song ceases, (the gentleman invited to enjoy the red leaves of the west mountain but failed) still thinking of the lonely people by the river.

The hands are skillful and the old are still restored, and the wild history pavilion flowers are blooming on all sides; the integrity can only resign from the official position, and the secluded sorrow can only lie among the weeds; people pity the heavens for belittling the Confucian arts, and I grieve for the country for the tragic talents; rising at night to cry for the gentleman, becomes faint and dim, and there is no curtain shadow to illuminate the deep cup.

General Junzuo of the Poetry Society is going to Lanzhou. Brother Hu Guigeng hosted a banquet to send him off at his residence Lu, and two scholars Xu Shiqi and Wu Zishen immediately made paintings as farewell gifts. Sing this and inscribe it.

Hearing that you will be going to a distant road, I set up a liquor to gather young and old for you. Poets and painters draw their brushes and ink, and a hundred-foot-tall stream falls toward the sky; below are tall pine trees embracing each other, and the empty pavilion is unmanned, and the wind is vast. Discussing the talent of the world, you are in high spirits, and the people in your eyes are not old. The western pass is desolate and the sick horse is nearing its natural lifespan. I want your strong brush to melt the barriers to comprehension. The envoy's tour is not yet finished, and I am drunk and my poems are suddenly completed and overturned.

### Viewing the Painting Exhibition of Old Man Hongwei

— Chen Honghui Zhongtao

Old Man Hongwei's painting skills are meticulously refined, and his reputation spreads at home and abroad. This time, he held a painting exhibition in Shanghai. Hui humbly is in the ranks of the initiators, and it is impossible not to say a word. The old man's paintings, the setting colors and brushwork, are ancient and secluded, and he has obtained the spirit of Song paintings. And his works of inscription on paintings, both poetry and calligraphy are wonderful, such as reeds and crabs: "The newly brewed golden tulip wine for the Double Ninth Festival, a beautiful gathering to hold a goblet of crab roe, I want to overturn the basket and listen to the cracking sound, and travel sideways back to the water and cloud village." Red parrot hanging bellflower: "Opening the curtains at dawn, the moon has not yet set, the winding corridor is stacked with deep green clouds; do not be surprised that the frost bell in front of the garden is silent, the raven's words can convey the sound of the Brahma's fall." Double ducks and wild rice stems: "The scenery of Jiangnan in March is extraordinary, the peach blossom water is warm and grows new green; the bamboo bow advises you not to shoot lightly, the fighting ducks know how to call for themselves in the wind." Red azalea flowers and cuckoo birds: "The red cliffs and green mountains love this flower, go down to the three Bas in the third month of spring; the urging to return of the pair of crows is really verbose, it is not that the traveler does not miss home." All are excellent and can be passed down. Since ancient times, painters of meticulous flower and bird paintings have found it most difficult to have a lively charm in the ancient and secluded. Therefore, those who have a lively color are the ultimate in skill. Only the old master's paintings are sufficient to match it. The old man has no less than 5,000 disciples; only Miss Wu Huang Zhuoqun can obtain his true biography. Her paintings are delicate and otherworldly, and the high ones are almost indistinguishable from the real ones. Therefore, discussing the old man's artistic achievements, I have hastily written it.

### On the Characteristics of Ancient and Modern Beauty: Discussing Artistic Creation in the New Century

— Shen Yan

The modern culture and art following the Renaissance, based on individual self-awareness, represent the expression of individual beauty, which is entirely the opposite of antiquity. Modern people's beliefs and spirit can be said to be the respect for individuality. In other words, this indicates that humans replace gods as the supreme existence, and with the development of human thought and culture, there has been a transformation of ideals and beauty.

It is undeniable that modern people's individual beauty is much freer than the feudal ideal beauty of ancient people; and it is precisely for this reason that modern society should have a higher cultural evaluation than ancient society. Furthermore, in all senses, the progress of modern people or modern society's civilization may simply be incomparable to antiquity, which is also an undeniable fact. However, conversely, it is also an undeniable fact that under the beautiful name of cultural progress, people are caught in extreme respect for individuality, which leads to ideological fragmentation, unconsciously lose reverence for gods, forget the joy of communal life, and are unconcerned with the pursuit of national ideal beauty.

Ancient times had their ideals and beauty, and modern times have theirs. This is only natural because social conditions differ. Therefore, it is also only natural that the holistic beauty of antiquity and the individual beauty of modern times cannot be discussed in the same breath. This is an issue worthy of our reflection.

Ancient beauty, in the monumental concepts of Egypt, the symbols of valor in Babylon, and the expression of ideal beauty in Greece, had its own independent development in these three themes, and it was on this basis that the great themes of the entire nation were constructed. The cultural will of ancient people was expressed in these forms of art as "eternal compositions." In other words, it was the "creation of national art." However, it also had its shortcomings, namely, the art production of feudal or autocratic politics that underestimated individual and personal power. Conversely, modern beauty takes the manifestation of individuality as its goal, with sensitivity or freedom as its characteristics, and seems to emphasize delicate, keenly sensitive feelings, and takes intellectual artistic expression as its main body. Especially in modern art after Impressionism, this tendency has become increasingly prominent. Modern writers who fully express the joy of personal life in the "festival of light" can be said to be much more civilized than the crude and valiant ancient artists. Therefore, ancient art shines with the state or nation as its background, while modern art shines with the excellence of each writer.

The problem of ancient beauty and modern beauty, in their relative, two major ideological trends, contains important significance, and we should not rush to a conclusion. The importance of this problem lies in juxtaposing ancient beauty and modern beauty, and from the results of this comparative study, creating an ideal of beauty that can benefit the next new era. We must discover the path that leads from antiquity to modernity, and from modernity to antiquity, and from this harmony of classical art and modern art, create the art of the new century.

### A Brief Account of Wang Ge-yi's Pre-Exhibition, In Response to Ding'an's Verse

— Zhu Yingpeng

His talent is used to train people as if he can summon immortals, his family's three unique skills are known throughout the land; do not simply listen to the rain in empty mountains, you have already made yourself in Shandong. (Mr. Wang has lived in Shanghai for many years, focusing on painting and calligraphy, rarely involving himself in external affairs.)

The moonlit ground and cloud stairs are doubly cold, it is naturally difficult to write about Lü and Tian'an's women; plum blossoms and chrysanthemum shadows have been consulted throughout, let the ink flow freely in light washes. (He excels at painting plum blossoms and chrysanthemums.)

Gathering scattered anecdotes into one school, who will inherit the literary heritage of the Southeast? Having just washed away the chaotic state, I luckily take advantage of the wine being ripe when the brush becomes blunt. (Mr. Wang is a high-achieving student of Wu Changshuo.)

Lake and mountain are expansive, robbed from the lands of the three Wus, the older generation fills their chests with night rain and sink; luckily old friends are still everywhere I look, allowing only the richness of spring to be stored in my heart. (Those at the same table were Du Heying, Wu Changtian, Jian Huajing, and Shan Bainian.)

Two parts Liangfu, one part Sao, I personally received the words of the heavenly man in the azure sky. I refuse the worldly praises in狂言, why must I commit myself to Gao Tao? (Du He spoke about the art of living, inspiring this reflection.)

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 401

— Ye Jingfeng

"Yes, only five people were initially dispatched; after receiving the phone call, ten more were added… I didn't expect to have disturbed you, sir, I am truly sorry!" The old man apologized for the third time.

"Phone call?" Tsurumi expressed surprise.

"Yes, it was also a female comrade from our country who reported it by phone."

"Oh!" Tsurumi immediately thought of that woman at the Banzai Mansion.

"Then it seems my phone call was for nothing." Tsurumi added a hint of disappointment.

"Not at all;" the old man said with certainty, "this gave our comrade a chance to deliver a merciful message—since she can only borrow a phone outside the mansion, the mansion's phone cannot be used casually—so when your subordinate called, we could also hear the news."

"The old gentleman also has concerns about Miss Nakamura's disappearance..."

"I dare not;" the old man saw that Tsurumi's attitude had begun to change, seemingly lessening his depression; "upon hearing this unfortunate news, we have already mobilized all our manpower. But until now, we have not received any information. Alas!"

"Very good," Tsurumi took out his notebook, waved it slightly, and smiled, "The records here have probably been reviewed by the old gentleman. Most of it is written in code, so it may be difficult to understand, but at least some of it can be understood. Please remember: My temporary office is the International Hotel…"

"I already have it memorized!" The old man also showed a hint of a smile, while also expressing unease, "I only wanted to know a little about your identity and the nature of your position, so I took the liberty. But there was absolutely no intention of searching for your other secrets. In any case, I must ask for your forgiveness, because of the painful state of mind of our group..."

"I understand very well, and I am twelve times sympathetic, and I am willing to do all I can to cooperate with the old gentleman." Tsurumi suddenly stood up straight and shook the old man's hand.

This was an unexpected gain for Tsurumi, and also an unexpected gain for the old man. Just as the two were warmly shaking hands, Masae had already returned to the room:

"Captain, there is no news from the Banzai Mansion, but there is a person waiting there for the Captain, insisting on speaking with the Captain. As for the International Hotel, I have already given the instructions…"

"Very good, please make a trip to the Banzai Mansion," Tsurumi said, immediately taking out a business card, writing two sentences, and handing it to Masae, "This represents me personally. Please consider the situation of the person who came, either dismiss them on the spot or bring them to the hotel to see me."

At this time, wine and food had already been laid out on the rectangular table in the room.

"To express our sincere apologies, on behalf of our country, I offer a toast to the two of you." The old man personally handed over two glasses of wine.

Masae drank a glass and hurriedly left. Tsurumi talked with the old man for a few minutes, and the old man sent two of his subordinates to escort Tsurumi.

### Gandhi's Fast

— A Lin

As far as I can remember, Gandhi has fasted more than once for the Indo-Muslim conflict. According to a recent Associated Press report, he will fast again if riots occur again in the villages of 　Jialuo. I remember that in a fast that occurred several years ago because of conflicts in the All-India independence movement, it lasted as long as twenty or thirty days, barely continuing with only fruit juice. People generally worried that this old man, who at first glance was as thin as a rake and seemed to have no fat at all, would fast to death. In the end, it was a miracle that this old man ultimately lived through the end of his fast. However, already at an advanced age, his physical condition today absolutely does not allow him to fast again. No wonder the people of India feel increasingly worried when the news arrives.

From Gandhi, one is reminded of the Cynics of Greece. This ascetic is probably the only remaining standard of human morality in the world today. His restraint is further demonstrated by sleeping with his wife's daughter not long ago. However, this is ultimately a virtue from the spinning wheel era. Just like his spinning wheel and his concepts, his conduct cannot exert force in today's society.

Gandhi and the Indian independence movement are inseparable, but he is quite distant from today's India. Although his fasting and suffering show his whole personality, it is not enough to save the current world. That is why Nehru today can only respect him but not follow him, and it is up to him.

The pursuit of freedom and the reform of society probably cannot be done simply as ideological changes in behavior. The conflict between India and the Muslims will naturally not end because of Gandhi's fast. We hope that the riots in Bengal will not become a reality. No matter what, Gandhi's existence is still a symbol of humanity and peace in this world.

### Professor Arthur's Farewell Concert — On the 20th at the Lyceum Theatre

— Pei Lin

The famous violin expert Professor Arthur is about to leave Shanghai and return to Vienna, in the United States. Many music lovers in this city who admire him will have the opportunity to hear his last farewell concert at the Lyceum Theatre this month on the 20th (Sunday) at 5:30 pm. The great program that evening, in addition to Brahms' "Sonata" and Mendelssohn's "Concerto," includes major works by famous musicians such as Saxe, Szymanowski, Shkota, and Sarasate. It will certainly have a grand effect. The piano accompaniment will be provided by the famous Austrian pianist Professor Marcos.

I remember that Professor Arthur fled to Shanghai eight years ago, in 1939, from Vienna, which was under the oppression of the Nazi regime. After experiencing many hardships, he was gradually recognized by the music community in Shanghai, and was finally hired as the principal violinist of the Shanghai Municipal Council Symphony Orchestra and professor of violin at the National Conservatory of Music. In the past, he often performed many great concertos with the accompaniment of the symphony orchestra, fully demonstrating the extraordinary nature of his technique. He also has a unique interpretation of chamber music. During these eight years, which are neither long nor short, he has indeed captured a group of listeners who admire him, and at the same time trained a group of excellent young disciples. Therefore, his sudden decision to return home is truly a regrettable thing for the Chinese music community, which has few talents. We believe that this farewell concert, in indescribable emotions, will certainly reap unexpected grandeur and success. Tickets for the concert are on sale at the Lyceum Theatre and the Mottelee Music Store at the same time.

### Lending at High Interest Rates

— Ji Shui

It is said that lending at high interest rates is currently the most profitable, but this is not entirely the case.

I had a colleague with the same surname as me. At that time, people called him Old Zhou, and me Little Zhou. In the first half of last year, Old Zhou retired and received a retirement bonus of more than two million yuan. He settled in Hangzhou with his only son and made a living by lending at high interest rates. He could earn three to four hundred thousand yuan each month, which was more cost-effective than being a company commander in the army, so he was quite comfortable.

But recently, a friend in Hangzhou wrote to me saying: "Old Zhou has changed careers again. He has become a smuggler. The reason is that he wants to smoke, and his son wants to study. Although the interest is still being charged and the income is still the same, prices have risen; in terms of hoarding goods, two million yuan now is less than one-third of what it was when he received it. So Old Zhou panicked and quickly abandoned his 'sitting and eating' plan, and changed to 'traveling and eating.'"

It is true that lending at high interest rates is profitable, but prices are like the target elevators in the Great World Company. It rolls upward, and you run downward. Its speed far exceeds yours. Even if you run until you sweat, you are still on it. What can you do!

But Old Zhou's dream of high interest rates has been shattered. When his dream of being a smuggler is also shattered in the future, what will he do then?

### Making Friends with the Prime Minister's Son

— Jin Jie

I am a squad leader in the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department. On the night of the 13th, I was ordered to work on the Blue Funnel Line's Calchas ship. This morning, I read Shen Bao and learned that Prime Minister's son Martin Edley was on the same ship as me. I found the clerk and asked him to introduce me. As a result, we met in his bedroom. He was very polite and offered me a cigarette. He said, "How did you know my name?" I showed him today's Shen Bao. The other two sailors who shared the bedroom with Martin, upon seeing the Prime Minister艾's photo, insisted on taking this newspaper back to England as a souvenir. We sat down and talked. Martin Edley said, "Everyone should learn real skills in their youth, so it will not be difficult to be a ship owner in the future. Many Chinese reporters came to the ship to see me yesterday, but some were not allowed to meet me by the shipowner because we were too young." We talked until about 11 o'clock. He said, "We will play soccer this afternoon. I feel extremely tired now." I took out my duty book and asked him to sign it as a souvenir. He signed his name with his left hand, and said, "I hope to see you again next time." I then left his bedroom. I think our Chinese youths should not take their status too seriously and should also learn some specialized knowledge like Martin Edley.

Sir: I have written poorly. Please correct it, and I have attached his signature. Respectfully to the Free Talk Editor

### Sinful Pleasure

— Tang Shan

—Thoughts from the Popular Songs of the City

Whether it is day or night, when we pass through a bustling city, we can always hear those popular songs lingering on the streets. What "Darling, darling! My beloved enemy:" What "Hurry to find a passionate lover," What "Oh my darling! Is your love true?"... In short, these new songs that people sing and enjoy are only full of sensuality and carnality, making people feel lightheaded!

I have a friend who came from Shanghai and stayed in a hotel for three days. When he returned to the countryside, he said to me, "Shanghai has not made any other progress, except for advertising, which is quite developed."

"How do you say that?" I asked.

"That can be seen from the sound and color that is expressed in this city today. All the sounds and colors do not represent the culture of this city, but are only used as a way to attract advertisements."

That's right, Shanghai has not made any progress, except for sound and color. The popular songs sung in dance halls, shops, and teahouses, and the neon lights and mercury lights that are installed are the representative works of sound and color in this city. And the creation and design of these sounds and colors has indeed taken some ingenuity, so that the people in this city can fall into the net of his sounds and colors, become intoxicated, and never wake up!

Everyone will linger and forget to return to the pleasure of sound, color, dogs, and horses, not to mention that drinking tea, chatting, eating melon seeds, and listening to storytellers are praised as the traditional artistic life of the Chinese people? But we want to ask, is this kind of real life considered a cultural creation of ours? Or can it enrich the country and strengthen the people, and even assimilate foreigners in the future? If not, if we continue to sing and enjoy ourselves like this, are we not afraid of having a day when our voices change and our colors fade?

The high and low of sound, the stimulation and harmony of color, can represent the living conditions of a nation, as well as its emotions and thoughts. The Marseillaise has completed the victory for the French Revolution, and the "Drizzling Rain" era has caused many young people to commit suicide by throwing themselves into the river. Therefore, becoming a kind of artistic life is not about transcending reality to create a selfish, selfless state; but about shouldering the responsibilities of the era, and moving forward with both sorrow and joy. The opposite of serious work is not licentiousness. This should be understood by artists. Go away, those decadent sounds! Those colors that make people drunk! In these days of national suffering, we want to live in tragic and solemn sounds and colors, which can strengthen the atmosphere of our lives.

### Reflections on Huibinlou — Remembering Tian Shouchang

— Lin Weizhong

Last month, on the 13th, so many friends celebrated Shouchang's birthday, so many friends and young people, as well as our relatives and friends, came to participate in that grand celebration. I am so grateful and so happy. But in the midst of happiness, there are still countless tears. Even when I saw Mr. Pan Gongzhan and Mr. Tang San, whom he knew, I did not go out to greet them. As the saying goes: "A pair of small feet, a jar of tears." From the Republic of China year 13 to now, I don't know how many jars of tears I have shed for him.

I remember one autumn evening sixteen years ago, he used Tian Minggao, and I used Lin Qingzhen, which were both our childhood names. We sent out a hundred large red invitations and invited more than a dozen tables of guests at Huibinlou. Almost all the old friends in the cultural, film, and theater circles were there. Old Mr. Yan Gongshang spoke in various dialects, and Mr. Liu Yazi even wrote a poem. Ms. Cai Wen, Hong Dou, and Hu Ping, and other friends sang songs and performed plays. In short, although Huibinlou at that time was much more lively than it is now, it was far from comparable to today. Today's Huibinlou has not only changed its facade and been repainted completely, but the personnel have also changed. At that time, Mr. Tang Louqiu was the host, and we went and returned together. Now, Mr. Hong Shen is the chief greeter. Before the banquet was over, I heard him say to Shouchang, "The car is here, boss, you and Hong Zhen will leave first." I was alone, all alone, returning to my residence in the vast darkness, inevitably thinking back and forth. Living to this age, I have become incomprehensible to myself!

I often ask myself: What is called "life"? I'm just having an empty dream!

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

July 3rd of the Same Year

The nameplate on the door of Room 306 of the Lequn Society reads Mr. Liu, but in reality, it is the headquarters of Zhu Xinong, the red-nosed associate manager of the China Tea Company.

Today, the importance of this room is simply no less than that of the Pacification Commissioner's Office on Guixi Road. From early morning until 10 o'clock, more than twenty groups of guests have come one after another, and there have been more than ten phone calls. Old Zhu is using various methods, either soft, hard, polite, or arrogant, to deal with them, and he himself feels particularly great. His guests are almost all here for the sake of freight cars. Some hope to ride along with the people, others hope to ride along with the goods; except for very few one or two people who have letters from bigwigs like Commander Li and Minister Bai, wanting to use their power to force their way in, the rest are prepared to pay money and are determined to take a heavy hit from him. As long as he agrees to let their goods or people get on the truck, no matter how high the price, they are willing to pay.

Old Zhu keeps stroking his red nose, feeling quite complacent.

But there is one thing that makes him feel not so satisfied, and that is that the attitude of those truck drivers is really too bad. He has already discussed with Team Leader Chen, who is in charge of the trucks, and plans to use a method of circulating every other stop to use six trucks as twelve or even eighteen trucks. This way, he estimates that he can make at least one or two thousand yuan. But those drivers seem to be as clever as he is, and they have put forward various demands, making it difficult for him to cope.

He lay on the rattan chair by the bed, slowly drinking the fourth bottle of fresh orange juice that the waiter had just brought in, looking out the window, and thinking about how to replace the driver who spoke the rudest.

On the bed, leaning against the inside, was the very bored Jin Aili. When Old Zhu was talking to people about buying freight car shares, she had no chance to interrupt at all. She wanted to go out alone, but she was afraid of making Old Zhu suspicious. The only way left was to lean on the bed and sit like a clay sculpture, or occasionally think about many unrelated things.

The room had been quiet for only five or six minutes when the door was pushed open again by a new guest.

"Ah! Mr. Zhu." Old Zhu and Jin Aili shouted almost at the same time. Jin Aili even immediately stood up from the bed. The air of an associate manager is of course different. He only accompanied them with smiles, nodding repeatedly, without personally standing up to offer them a seat.

Zhu Zhaonian was as usual, smiling slyly, and his mouth seemed to be holding a large piece of unfinished candy. (49)
