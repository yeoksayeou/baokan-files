### Gu Zhenggang Arrives in Tianjin from Tangshan; Says Pacification Work in Eastern Hebei Will Soon Come to an End; Bai Chongxi Attends Welcome Rally in Haimen

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 14th] Gu Zhenggang arrived in Tianjin by special train at 2:00 PM on the 14th. He told reporters that the Communist troops in eastern Hebei have collapsed both in spirit and in strength, and the pacification work will soon come to an end and enter the construction phase. According to captured 共軍, the general cadre of the Communist Party used the slogan of resistance during the war, but after the victory, they launched an internal rebellion, which is a case of "selling dog meat while hanging up a sheep's head." They have all deeply realized this. Awakened elements know that national interests are above class interests. Gu believes that the recent expansion of internal unrest by the Communist Party is only meant to cause chaos and will inevitably further lose their credibility internally, prompting more people to awaken. Gu will stay in Tianjin for two days to inspect social and labor administration before going to Beiping and then to Chengde and other places.

[Central News Agency, Nantong Dispatch, 14th] Minister Bai Chongxi, Chairman Wang 慰功, and Commander-in-Chief Li 獃閹 and his entourage arrived in Haimen at 11:00 AM on the 14th to attend a public welcome rally.

### Allocation of Physical Goods to Civil Servants

Decision Made After Consultation Between the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Various Agencies; Can Be Implemented Starting March 1st

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The government's proposed method of allocating daily necessities to civil servants, which was intended to stabilize prices and secure the livelihood of the people, has been preliminarily decided after consultation between the relevant agencies at the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the afternoon of the 14th. Civil servants in 京, 滬, and other places can purchase six daily necessities—rice, coal, oil, salt, sugar, and cloth—at prices lower than market prices starting March 1st. It is said that each civil servant will be allocated goods based on a standard of three large 口 and two small 口, which is a considerable improvement over the method implemented in Chongqing and other places in the past. The meeting held by the Ministry of Economic Affairs today was chaired by Wang Yunwu. Attendees included Shen Xulun, Xiao Zheng, and Long Dajun from the Ministry of Economic Affairs; Pang Songzhou from the Ministry of Food; Bao Huaguo and Shou Miancheng from the Ministry of Social Affairs; Wu Weijing from the China Textile Corporation; Zhang Shanyang and Huang Peng from the Fuel Commission; Wu Zhaohong from the National Resources Commission; Zhang Decheng from the Vegetable Oil Factory; Chen Jiesheng from the Materials Bureau; He Weining from the Ministry of Finance; Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau; and Xie Zhengfu, Director of the 京 Social Affairs Bureau, totaling approximately 20 people. The meeting began at around 2:00 PM and ended at 5:45 PM. It was decided that civil servants, regardless of the number of people in their household, would all be calculated as three large 口 and two small 口. This can eliminate the past malpractice of falsely reporting household registrations. There will be six types of allocated goods. The Ministry of Finance will provide salt, the Ministry of Food will provide rice, the National Resources Commission will provide sugar, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will provide cloth, coal, and oil.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, who was summoned to 京 to attend the meeting of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, arrived in 京 on the morning of the 14th and immediately visited the relevant officials to exchange views on the plan for allocating daily necessities at subsidized prices. In the afternoon, he attended the meeting of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, providing several suggestions. After the meeting, he accompanied Wang Yunwu to meet with Song Ziwen.

Allocation Quantities

The allocation quantities are as follows: Each civil servant, including his family, will be allocated four jin of salt, eight dou of rice, four jin of sugar, four dan of coal briquettes, and three jin of oil per month. Civil servants themselves will receive 1.5 zhang of khaki cloth in the summer and 1.5 zhang of uniform wool in the winter. Family members will receive three zhang of cloth per year (0.5 dou and 1.5 pi per person).

Allocation Methods

The allocation method is that each agency will submit a roster to the Executive Yuan for review, which will then issue 物資配購證. The civil servants will then use their certificates to purchase goods at the cooperative. The entire method is named the "Applicable Goods Allocation Method." After the principles have been agreed upon, Pan Xulun is responsible for drafting them, which will be submitted to a small group committee tomorrow morning for detailed review. The entire method will be finalized at a general meeting tomorrow afternoon and then sent to the Executive Yuan for approval. It will be submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council on the 16th, and it is expected to be implemented in 京, 滬, and other places on March 1st.

### Civil Servant Compensation

To Be Adjusted Again

### Suggestions from the Beiping City Party Headquarters

Methods for Dealing with the Gold Rush

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The current financial turmoil has stimulated soaring prices, greatly affecting the people's livelihood. The Beiping City Party Headquarters Executive Committee convened a meeting to discuss the matter in detail. They believe that the government should quickly take effective measures and decided on five proposals to recommend to the central government for implementation. The contents are as follows: (1) Investigate the names of those who created the financial turmoil, confiscate their gold, and punish them for the crime of disrupting finance. (2) Prohibit the buying and selling of gold; violators will be severely punished. (3) Implement the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session, register the assets of officials, and suppress bureaucratic capital.

He has also notified the police bureau and the social affairs bureau to seal up gold. From now on, those who engage in gold transactions will be arrested and their gold confiscated. At the same time, the market price of U.S. dollars has fallen from 16,000 to 11,000 yuan.

### Sufficient Grain Reserves in Beiping

[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 14th] According to officials of the Beiping City Government, there is no shortage of grain reserves in Beiping. Although the city's population has increased slightly, and the daily consumption is considerable, the large quantities of grain recently purchased and transported from the Northeast and Northwest will be shipped to Beiping continuously. Some speculators, after selling gold, have turned to buying grain in an attempt to profit. If no major problems occur in transportation, their dreams of profit will certainly be shattered.

### Guangzhou Finance Department Cracks Down

Illegal Businesses

Rice Market Prices Enter a Stable State

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch, 14th] At 3:30 PM, the Finance Department issued an emergency order to crack down on 銀錢行號 operating without approval. Relevant agencies were dispatched to enforce the order. As a result, the business operations of eighty-three large businesses and thirty-three exchange shops operating concurrently as silver shops were suspended. The order was based on supplementary measures to the methods for the recovery of industries. According to this method, all 銀錢行號 established in Guangzhou after June 1936 are not allowed to operate. According to the person in charge of the Finance Department, after the method is implemented, only twelve shops in the city will be allowed to continue operating. This move will be very beneficial in preventing future financial speculation.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch, 14th] Due to the authorities' decisive actions and the effective implementation of measures, rice prices have fallen rapidly to the level before the 11th. On the 14th, the price of top-grade rice in the market was 120,000 yuan per dan, and medium-grade rice was 110,000 yuan, which is in a stable state.

The provincial government has a solid grasp of the grain situation, and the central government has policies on financial issues, so there will be no problems.

### Council Resolution Passed

Organize a Financial Review Committee; Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, and Others Attended and Reported Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Council Resident Committee held a regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th. Over 20 people were in attendance, including Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Wu Yifang, Chuan Sinian, and Luo Heng. Mo Dehui presided, and Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Gu Zhenglun, and Zhou Yichun attended. First, Shao Lizi delivered a written report on diplomacy. Then, Zhou Yichun reported on recent agricultural and forestry administrative facilities. He stated that the cotton harvest last year was 8 million dan, and it is expected that this year it should be 12 million dan. The use of land for tobacco is mostly in the豫, 皖, and 魯 areas and is currently being planned. The silk industry has been severely damaged by the Japanese, and efforts are now being made to improve it. Taiwan produces the most tea, and in the future, attention will be paid to the production in Qimen, Tunxi, and other places in China. Last year, the export of tung oil totaled 37,000 tons, and this year it may reach around 50,000 tons. Other items such as wool and sugar will also be improved to increase production. Then, Wang Yunwu explained the reasons for the recent surge in prices, stating that the main reason is the excessive amount of floating capital. Shanghai is a concentrated area of industry and commerce, and capital from various places is also concentrated there. Due to the instability of the situation, many people are afraid to invest in fixed businesses, so capital becomes floating capital. In addition: (1) The issuance of large-denomination banknotes. (2) Limited foreign exchange, unlimited supply. (3) Exported goods adopt subsidies. Merchants scramble to buy gold and U.S. dollars, so foreign goods rise, and domestic goods follow suit. Although the government has adopted a policy of selling gold and grain, it has not had a significant effect. Wang advocates: (1) Adopting effective methods to make gold and currency lose their role as intermediaries. (2) Strictly controlling prices and restoring the wartime control system. (3) Stabilizing industry and commerce.

After Wang's report, Yu Hongjun reported on the reasons for the rise in gold and foreign exchange. Stabilizing gold prices is the most important task at present. The government has decided to adopt a comprehensive method of financial control, which is being drafted. He also said that the current problem is not with finance itself but that the fundamental problem should be solved.

Then, Gu Zhenglun reported, stating that the reason for the high grain prices is the rise in prices. To prevent grain prices from increasing, it is necessary to suppress prices first.

Then, council members raised inquiries. Chuan Sinian first said that Song, the army commander, should be held responsible for the current chaotic situation. He suggested that the government immediately implement effective measures to save the current crisis; otherwise, they would all resign from their positions as council members. Later, Luo Heng, Su Ting, Wang Puhan, Xue Mingjian, Wu Chunwu, Yin Shuxian, Zheng Kuiyi, and others successively raised questions. There was much criticism regarding the handling of foreign exchange and gold. Wang and Yu answered each question in turn. Finally, it was resolved to pass a resolution to form a financial and economic review committee by the council members, which was scheduled to hold a review meeting at 9:00 AM on the 15th and a plenary meeting of the resident committee at 9:00 AM on the 17th.

### Current Financial and Economic Policies: Legislative Yuan Conducts a Comprehensive Review; Today's Meeting Will Focus on Commodity Prices

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] The Legislative Yuan held its 314th plenary session on the morning of the 14th. The legislators, with heavy hearts, conducted a comprehensive review of the current issues of gold notes and commodity prices. It was generally agreed that China is now facing a severe economic crisis, and a thorough review of the entire financial and economic policy is necessary. Some legislators even proposed inviting Premier Song to report on his administration's policies to the Yuan. Finally, it was decided to continue the meeting on the morning of the 15th to conduct a more detailed review of commodity price issues. Today's meeting was presided over by President Sun, with 68 legislators in attendance. After amending and passing the draft legislative principles for the Four National Banks Law, the agenda was changed to hear reports from the Nine-Member Committee. First, Lou Tongsheng, chairman of the Economic Committee, reported on the joint meeting held on the 11th. Then, Li Qing, convener of the Nine-Member Committee, reported on the conclusions reached by the committee over the past few months in studying current financial, economic, and monetary issues, which were divided into seven points: (1) commodity prices, (2) gold and U.S. dollars, (3) state-owned enterprises and illegal overspending, (4) public bonds, (5) import and export trade, (6) salaries of public servants, teachers, military, and police personnel, and (7) institutions. He added a detailed review and explained that he resigned due to his inability to work. Wang Yuxiang believed that the current economic and financial situation has reached this point, the people's livelihood is increasingly difficult, and society has such high expectations for the Legislative Yuan. There should be a solemn expression in the meeting to curb the rising trend. Lou Tongsheng pointed out that the situation in Shanghai is chaotic, and the adverse impact on the country is significant. American newspapers say that we are on the verge of chaos and at the end of the world. Standing in the position of government officials and in the position of the people, I fully agree with the report. For the sake of seriousness, the Legislative Yuan should hold a special meeting on the issue of commodity prices and invite Army Chief Song to come to the Yuan to explain, so as to give a frank review of the current overall situation. Lou expressed his support for the proposal of some legislators to nationalize gold, believing that this proposal could have a positive impact on the chaotic financial situation. He cited the words of a U.S. government official, explaining that the U.S. had hinted at why we did not use the $35.64 million currently frozen in the U.S. If this amount could be nationalized, it could at least have some impact. Jian Guansan pointed out that after the surge in gold notes, the living standards of the general salaried class have been reduced by half. Our country is now facing the final economic juncture, and it is necessary to invite Premier Song to explain. Sun Jiuxi, who recently returned to Nanjing from Shanghai, reported on the truth of the gold rush he witnessed in Shanghai, pointing out that the prices at which the Central Bank sold gold were sometimes higher than the market price, which clearly had a suspicion of leading the rise. Peng Chunshi pointed out that this gold rush was related to loans, citing that food prices rose soon after agricultural loans were issued. After industrial loans were issued last autumn, commodity prices rose. At the end of the year, as production loans were issued, gold notes were frantically poured, which sufficiently proves that loans fueled the rising trend. Zhong Tianxin, Qi Zhihou, Li Jinfang, and others also made serious criticisms of the current situation. Finally, it was decided to continue the plenary session on the 15th to discuss the financial and commodity price issues again. The meeting adjourned at about 1 p.m.

Revised Draft Legislative Principles for the Four National Banks Law

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] The draft legislative principles for the Four National Banks Law of China, China, Communications, and Morning were amended and passed at the 314th plenary session of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 14th. Among them, the discussion on the draft legislative principles for the Central Bank Law was the most detailed. Ji Chaoding, director of the Economic Research Institute of the Central Bank, and Cui Weiwu and two others were also present at the meeting to answer questions. After the proposal was put forward, Chen Changheng, chairman of the Finance Committee, first reported on the repeated review process, explaining that the current draft has been greatly simplified compared to the past. The board of directors was originally scheduled to be composed of 21 people, but due to the excessive number of people and the difficulty of selecting candidates from professional groups, it was decided to reduce it to 15 people, with the following distribution: (1) five ex officio directors from the central government, (2) four economic and financial experts, (3) one person each from the banking, agriculture, mining, industry, commerce, and labor sectors with rich experience, and (4) the president of the Central Bank, for a total of 15 people. Items 3 and 4 are appointed and selected by the government. Then, the legislators discussed whether the Central Bank should be supervised by the Ministry of Finance. The debate was particularly heated. The representatives of the Central Bank, Ji Chaoding and others, hoped to change "supervised by the Ministry of Finance" to "supervised by the government," arguing that if the Central Bank is supervised by the Ministry of Finance, it would be subordinate to the Ministry of Finance in the organizational system. The missions of national finance and monetary policy are not entirely the same, and it seems necessary to have separate systems. Zhang Zhaoyuan and others argued that it is better to maintain the original plan, because all kinds of banks are supervised by the Ministry of Finance. If the Central Bank forms its own system, it will be difficult to supervise, and if the Central Bank has no supervisory relationship with the Ministry of Finance, there is a risk that financial and political policies will run counter to each other. It was later decided to maintain the original proposal. Another controversial issue was whether the Central Bank has the special privilege to buy and sell raw gold and silver. Some legislators, in view of the current surge in gold notes, believed that this kind of special privilege of the Central Bank should be restricted. President Sun and others believed that this was only a temporary phenomenon and should not be restricted in the law stipulating a century-long plan. It was also decided to follow the original proposal. Finally, there was a heated debate on whether the president and staff of the Central Bank should be subject to qualification review. After the entire proposal was amended, it was passed. The draft legislative principles of the Bank of China Law and others did not have much discussion and were passed smoothly. The difference from the past is that the number of directors has been reduced to 15, and the chairman has been changed to the chairman of the board of directors.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 14th] After the Military Mediation Headquarters in Beiping implemented the dismissal, the first batch of government representatives, totaling 17 people, returned to Beijing on two U.S. military transport planes on the morning of the 14th. These 17 people were all government military police who had assisted the U.S. and the CCP in guarding the Military Mediation Headquarters. Communist Party representatives are also retreating. Three British aircraft also took 29 CCP representatives, carrying luggage and equipment, back to Harbin today. Most of the U.S. representatives will leave China on the "Boni Les" and "General Buster" from Qingdao and Tanggu on March 1st and March 7th.

### Bizarre Assassination Case in Beiping; U.S. Soldier Shot and Killed; Incident Occurred at the Same Location as the Shen Chong Case

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 14th] A bizarre case of a U.S. soldier being shot occurred in the ancient capital last night. At about 10 p.m., three U.S. soldiers went to the Dahua Cinema to watch a movie. Because the cinema was out of power and there was no performance, they went to a club instead. While walking along Rongchang Hutong, the three U.S. soldiers, walking arm in arm, heard a very faint sound. Immediately, one soldier fell to the ground. The other two soldiers were shocked and rushed forward to check. They learned that the soldier had been shot from behind and was injured. They immediately helped him to the U.S. Army Hospital. However, the injured soldier was a first-class private in the Marine Corps, and the Army Hospital did not dare to perform surgery rashly to remove the bullet from his back. Today, he was sent to the Tianjin Naval Hospital for treatment by the Marine Corps. The U.S. military has not announced the name of the injured U.S. soldier today. It is only known that his two companions were Sergeant Choi Erchak and Private Srobort. The occurrence of this case is very bizarre. Two hours after the incident, the Ping Police Bureau received a report and is currently investigating the murderer. (Note: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Beiping, the U.S. soldier was a cook in the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Marine Regiment. He died 20 minutes after being shot. This case occurred in the same area as the Shen Chong incident. According to an Associated Press dispatch, the U.S. Marine Corps Investigation Bureau convened a meeting at 1 p.m. on the 13th to discuss the investigation of this case.)

### U.S. Issues Statement

[Associated Press, Beiping, 14th] U.S. authorities have recently issued the first detailed statement regarding the mysterious shooting death of a Marine Corps soldier. U.S. authorities have also confirmed that the soldier was shot in a small street in the urban area of Beiping, suffering a small-caliber bullet wound. The murderer fled into the darkness.

The U.S. military statement is as follows: "A first-class Marine Corps private in Beiping was shot and killed on the way back from the outside on the evening of the 13th. Officials believe that the deceased died from a small-caliber bullet wound. The exact cause of death will be determined after an autopsy by the U.S. military headquarters in Tianjin.

The soldier was sent to the Army Hospital at 9:50 p.m. on the 13th with a gunshot wound to the back. He died five minutes after being admitted to the hospital. According to Sergeant Choi Erkerk and Private Sri, who were with the deceased at the time, when they reached the British Embassy on Morridge Street, they heard a sound similar to an explosion. The deceased suddenly shouted, 'I've been shot! I've been shot in the back!' At first, his companions thought the deceased was joking, but then they saw blood flowing from his mouth, so they quickly called a rickshaw to help him into the car and went to the Army Hospital. However, he died without treatment.

According to later informal reports, three Marine Corps members were traveling together. The one who was shot and killed was in the middle. The bullet hit near the center of the heart. The U.S. soldier died 20 minutes later. According to most eyewitnesses, only one shot was fired, and no one else was injured. The murderer disappeared into the darkness in an instant. They also said that the U.S. soldier was shot and killed after leaving the cinema. The cinema closed at 8 p.m., and many Chinese people left at the same time. Beiping usually implements a curfew starting at midnight every night, but after the incident today, martial law was declared at 10 p.m."

### Canadian Ambassador to Come to China; Building a Gold House as Embassy

[French News Agency, Ottawa, 14th] The new Canadian Ambassador to China, Davis, is scheduled to travel to China by ship from San Francisco in late this month.

The houses and furniture will be shipped from Vancouver Port by Chinese ships. A Canadian carpenter, who has lived in China for 30 years, will go to Nanjing to supervise the construction of the houses, so that everything is properly arranged, waiting for the new ambassador to take office.

### German Overseas Chinese in China, After Repatriation, Fall from Paradise into Hell

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The reporter interviewed a dozen German families who were repatriated from "paradise"-like China a few months ago. They are currently living a miserable life of hunger and hardship with other Berliners. Most of the Germans who were repatriated were Nazi Party members. Their current plight is a stark contrast to their luxurious lives when they went to China before the war, with delicious food and maids. Among them, some people are still able to endure and face the situation calmly. A German named Hao said, "Good! Everyone has their own experiences. It's our turn now!" Among the Germans who were repatriated to Germany, there are also a small number of British wives who also live in the war-damaged city of Berlin. They are former employees who were repatriated to their home countries along with their husbands. A man named Yobo, who used to work at the Shanghai Siemens Electric Appliance Company, has found a job as a wireless repairman. His British wife works as a translator for the British military government. Another employee of Siemens, named Bosteng, was originally born in China and has "no skills." Because he is a Nazi Party member, he had no choice but to find a carpentry job.

### The Democratic Socialist Party's List of Participants in the Government to Be Submitted Within the Next Week; A Special Person Will Be Sent to Beijing for Government Announcement

[Our Report] According to an estimate by a senior official of the Democratic Socialist Party, the list of personnel from the Democratic Socialist Party who will participate in the government can be submitted before the 20th of this month. At that time, a special person will be sent to Beijing for the government to formally announce. In terms of procedure, the first to be announced will probably be the members of the Legislative Yuan. The selection of candidates this time is quite cautious, especially for members of the Legislative Yuan and members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association. Taking the candidates for the Legislative Yuan as an example, in addition to being familiar with political matters, they also need considerable academic cultivation in order to be successful. It is heard that the list submitted will include many presidents, professors, and scholars. The current difficulty is that the work of the Legislative Yuan is a regular one, and those who take office must resign from their original positions. However, the Legislative Yuan will have to be completely re-elected at the time of constitutional implementation, and the period is too short, so there is inevitably some hesitation.

Editorial

### Key Points for Handling Rationing

The rationing system has gradually become concrete due to this wave of commodity price increases. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is coordinating the measures. The municipal meeting has concluded, and the general consumers, especially the wage-earning class, are naturally very excited. The main reasons for implementing the rationing system are twofold: one is the shortage of materials, using rationing to seek a reasonable distribution, and the other is the high commodity prices, using rationing to seek stability in life. Judging from the current situation, high commodity prices are an undeniable fact, and although material shortages are not a universal phenomenon, at least part of it is also true that demand exceeds supply and the source is not sustained. Therefore, adopting rationing measures as a means of emergency action is theoretically undeniable.

Now, the specific measures have not yet been fully decided. In terms of implementation, we would like to contribute a few opinions.

(1) We must first grasp the materials. Whether it is to supply the public or to suppress commodity prices, the first step is to grasp the rationed materials. Especially for the sake of suppressing commodity prices. Without grasping all the materials, there is no hope of success. Therefore, we must pay attention to this point at the beginning. Fortunately, there are now many daily necessities, such as cotton cloth, sugar, oil, coal, and rice. The central government has established special management or monopoly institutions. As long as the competent authorities sincerely cooperate and are willing to provide all the materials for rationing as an example, then, the news will spread, and it seems that it will not be difficult to gradually promote it. What becomes a problem is that rationed items must be sold at a fair price, which is different from purely profit-making businesses. In the UK, the US, Hong Kong, and other places, many ration prices are even set below the purchase price. That is to say, the government is willing to lose money in order to maintain the lives of the public. Do we have this spirit of sacrifice prepared? It is worth considering carefully beforehand.

(2) There must be meticulous planning. Whether it is overall rationing or partial rationing, the number of people receiving rations is not small. The types, quantities, prices, dates, and all procedures for rationing must be simple and clear. This method is by no means comparable to the official writing of this kind of command, nor can the official writing of this kind of command be effective. During the Anti-Japanese War, in the occupied areas and in the rear, we can still recall the lessons of this kind of failure. Therefore, how the methods are stipulated, how the institutions are organized, and how the funds are raised must be planned in advance. It is not advisable to create names out of thin air and add many redundant personnel, nor is it advisable to simplify and facilitate matters, which will hinder the progress of the work. Because this work is a business, and a very complex business, not just an administration, it requires scientific methods and systematic cooperation. If you intend to save trouble, only seek convenience, generalize and cover up, and perfunctorily deal with it, then the future effect seems easy to guess.

(3) There must be an iron-like discipline. The so-called iron-like discipline refers not only to the personnel handling the matter, but also to the general recipients of rations. Such as falsely reporting the number of people, one person with two registrations, relying on strength to extort, deliberately squeezing, and other malpractices, without the sincere cooperation and self-restraint of the general recipients of rations, it is really not easy to be meticulous and achieve a state of eradicating malpractices. But looking at the example of the British in recent days, in order to relieve the coal shortage, everyone恪遵功令, automatically stopping the power supply, we can know that their political orders are so effective, it is indeed not accidental. We are now handling rationing. On the one hand, we hope that the authorities will be fair and impartial, to eliminate the past bad habits of营私舞弊. On the other hand, we also need the public to adhere to discipline and not give economic people a chance to manipulate it.

In order to stabilize commodity prices and stabilize life, we are forced to implement the rationing of daily necessities. This seems to be the last resort. Therefore, we only hope that this method will succeed and can no longer watch it fail. Because we only allow it to succeed, we hope that they will carefully study personnel, funding, materials, and methods in all aspects, and never take it lightly.

### Government Suppresses Commodity Prices with Utmost Determination, Five Agencies Form Economic Supervisory Group, Emergency Measures to be Completed within Five Days, Aiming to Restore Prices to the Levels Before February 1st

[News from this newspaper] The current general price surge triggered by the gold rush has drawn great concern from Chairman Chiang, especially the impact of financial fluctuations on the national economy. In addition to dispatching Group Leader Xiang Jiemin of the Second Group of the Military Command Department to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the matter, he also dispatched a special envoy yesterday, ordering Shanghai Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu to immediately organize an economic reconnaissance outline and formulate emergency measures to suppress commodity prices. After receiving the order, Xuan has already begun to implement it and held a press conference at the headquarters at 4 pm yesterday, making the following important remarks:

Chairman Chiang, in light of the abnormal fluctuations in finance and commodity prices in Shanghai, which are obviously manipulated by someone, specifically instructed me to organize an economic reconnaissance outline immediately, determined to use human power to suppress the artificial price surge. This reconnaissance outline will be jointly organized by capable and experienced personnel selected from the five institutions of the Garrison Headquarters, the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, the Police Bureau, the Military Intelligence Bureau, and the Central Intelligence Bureau, and I will be in overall command. The emergency measures to suppress commodity prices must be completed within five days.

Xuan continued that the organization of the reconnaissance outline, this morning (14th), has been designed and decided with the persons in charge of the relevant agencies to establish an economic supervision group, responsible for decision-making and command, and according to the current three objectives that must be done and can be done, three groups have been set up, a gold and banknote group, a food group, and a yarn and cloth group. The work of each group will first investigate the illegal merchants who speculate, manipulate, or monopolize the market. As for the emergency measures, although they still need to be designed with the relevant parties, the principles have already been decided. Once the illegal merchants who deliberately raise prices, manipulate, or hoard goods are found to be true, they will be sanctioned. If there are legal grounds for sanctions, they will be strictly dealt with according to the law. If they exceed the law, they will be dealt with according to military law in accordance with the emergency measures or the regulations for controlling commodity prices during extraordinary periods. In order to immediately launch practical work, the reconnaissance outline has already begun to take action.

The existence period of the reconnaissance outline will depend on the actual needs. If it is indeed necessary to exist permanently, a permanent economic reconnaissance agency will be established separately. In addition to being presided over by personnel from the five units of the military, police, military police, and military intelligence in accordance with the Chairman's instructions, the agency will also invite experts familiar with market conditions and economic experts as consultants.

Xuan finally emphasized that the government has absolute determination to suppress commodity prices this time. At a minimum, it must restore the standard before February 1st. At the same time, he hopes that the city will only report as many illegal merchants who hoard and manipulate as possible, because the current selfishness of a few people harms the survival of the majority, which is no different from being an enemy of the public. In order to protect the interests of the majority of the people, the government will resolutely dispose of them, so that the crazy commodity prices will return to normal, and he hopes that the press will assist them.

### Preventing Gasoline Hoarding: Implementation of a Rationing System

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the increase in gasoline prices, gas stations continue to face supply shortages daily, with cars waiting to refuel still causing congestion and impacting traffic. In light of this, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, after consulting with oil companies such as Asiatic Petroleum, Standard Oil, and Texaco, has decided to implement a rationing system starting March 1st to prevent hoarding. The rationing method involves each car owner obtaining an application form from gas stations, filling in the vehicle type and registration number, and the required amount of gasoline. The company authorities will then, based on reasonable standards, determine the monthly fuel consumption for each vehicle and issue a ration card. From then on, all vehicles must present the ration card to refuel at gas stations, and the total monthly amount must not exceed the approved amount. No vehicle owner may obtain ration cards from more than two companies. The three oil companies have scheduled to publish a notice in the newspaper today, informing all car owners to register and apply.

### Thorough Investigation of the Gold Rush Begins: Inspecting All Account Books, Extracting the Names of Buyers, Sharp Drop in Gold Prices, Market Stalls Invisibly, Investigation of Gold Shops and Silver Exchanges Continues Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] After Chairman Chiang dispatched Zheng Jiemin, Director of the Second Department of the Military Affairs Commission, to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the gold rush in the city, starting yesterday noon, officers dispatched by the Garrison Headquarters and the Police Bureau went to Tong Feng Yu, Tai Kang Run, and Da Feng Heng, three gold shops, and Fang Jiu Xia Chang Ji and Yang Qing He, two silver exchanges, which are normally authorized by the Central Bank to allocate and sell gold. They inquired about daily transactions, confiscated all transaction ledgers from the five establishments, and extracted the number of gold allocations and sales, names of purchasing customers, business licenses of trading counterparts, addresses, etc. At the same time, summons were separately issued to the five responsible individuals, Zhan Yunsheng, Ying Minghe, Ni Zuguang, Zhang Yuanbai, and Xie Bingquan, to the Police Bureau for questioning, with statements recorded separately. It is said that the confiscated account books are undergoing strict review to thoroughly investigate whether there were any actions manipulating gold prices and disrupting the financial market during this gold rush. It is reported that for thorough investigation, a second round of investigations will be launched today, with the investigation targets including gold trading houses, securities firms, and small private banks. If solid evidence of illegal activities is found, the most severe penalties will be imposed. The details and truth of the investigation are expected to be released publicly soon.

The Central Bank's daily gold sales are divided into two methods: allocation and sale. For allocation, gold shops collectively apply to the Central Bank through Tong Feng Yu, Tai Kang Run, Da Feng Heng, and Fang Jiu Xia. Silver shops collectively apply to the Central Bank through Yang Qing He silver exchange. The Central Bank allocates gold at its discretion at 10 a.m. every day. After the allocation, the Central Bank entrusts the gold shops to sell gold on its behalf based on market fluctuations. Since the 10th of this month, the Central Bank has temporarily suspended the allocation to gold shops under orders from the authorities. According to the person in charge of Tong Ying Yu gold shop, the shop has suspended trading since the Central Bank stopped allocating gold to gold shops.

Yesterday, the gold market invisibly stalled as the authorities began a thorough investigation of gold shops and silver exchanges. Gold shops collectively suspended trading. Unofficial after-market bids broke through the six million yuan barrier, reaching a low of 5.8 million yuan. At silver shop retail outlets, more people were selling than buying. According to the person in charge of a major silver shop on Nanjing Road: statistics for the past two days show that daily revenue at retail outlets reached 90 taels, while sales only reached over 60 taels, a reversal of the run on silver shops during the gold price surge. Since silver shops' revenue exceeded sales, the amount of gold applied for from the Central Bank daily also greatly decreased, with 49 bars yesterday and only 450,000 bars the day before.

The executive directors of the union admitted to holding several meetings nine days ago to discuss preparations for the meeting. The letter to the Xindu Theater renting the venue stated that it was an economic issue lecture, but the theater found out the purpose of the meeting and refused, indicating impure motives, and the executive directors of the union should be responsible. According to the investigation results, the causes of the incident were nothing more than: 1. The attendees were crowded, and some people could not enter the venue; 2. The content of the meeting did not match the name, causing public dissatisfaction, resulting in conflict. Although the department store unions in the three districts believed that there were special elements directing the incident, the union specially set up pickets with marked badges during the meeting, and the arrangement seemed to be quite thorough, indicating prior preparation.

### Dredger "Jianshe" Discovered in the Baltic Sea: Has Been Salvaged by the Soviet Side, Notifying Our Country to Provide Proof for Verification and Release

[Our Newspaper's Report] The dredger "Jianshe," ordered by the Shanghai Shenpu Bureau from the Xue Gao Shipyard in Germany before the war, has been discovered in a certain location in the Baltic Sea in the Soviet-occupied area. It has been salvaged by the Soviet Union, which is notifying our country to submit various documents for verification and release. In order to dredge the Shentan shoal at the mouth of the Yangtze River, the Shanghai Shenpu Bureau planned to dredge the Shentan to facilitate the passage of ships with a high tide draft of 37 feet and a water draft of 33 feet. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, it formulated a plan to dredge the Shentan and mainly relied on two dredgers built at the Xue Gao Shipyard in Germany, one named "Fuxing," weighing 8,400 tons, and one named "Jianshe," weighing 9,500 tons.

Preparing to Restore and Dredge the Shentan

The "Fuxing" arrived in Shanghai in 1936, and the "Jianshe" was built in 1937. When it was about to leave the factory, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, and the national army withdrew to the west. The bureau entrusted the factory to take care of it and signed a contract. The "Fuxing" was occupied by the enemy and sailed to Tokyo. After the victory of the War of Resistance two years ago, the bureau requested the government to demand the "Fuxing" from Japan last year. At the same time, it urged the Xue Gao Shipyard to deliver the "Jianshe." In February of last year, the bureau learned that the "Jianshe" had sunk in the Baltic Sea in the Soviet-occupied area during the German-Soviet war, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs inquired with the Soviet Union. In July, the Soviet Union salvaged the "Jianshe" and notified our country to submit documents for verification and release. The Shanghai Shenpu Bureau was ordered to retrieve the shipbuilding contract, entrusted custody puncture copies, and payment receipts, and sent them to the Ministry of Finance at the beginning of the month for transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in preparation for notifying the Soviet Union. It is learned that the "Fuxing" is currently being repaired intensively, and the landmarks and buoys of the Shenntan shoal must also be newly manufactured. The dredging work of the Shenntan can be restored in three months.

### Visiting the Nanshi Beiqu Fire Brigade: Private Fire Organization, Excellent Performance

[Special Report by This Newspaper] On the first day of the New Year, a big fire on Seymour Road burned for thirteen hours, and half a street's worth of houses, property, and the years of hard work of the victims were instantly turned to ashes. "Natural disasters" are already unfortunate, coupled with the "man-made" exploitation of the fire, what could be more poisonous than this?

Li Zhiliang, Director of the Nanshi Beiqu Fire Brigade (Photographed by This Newspaper)

Because the Seymour Road fire itself included many complex causes, after nearly twenty days of investigation, the truth has come to light, and human factors account for an important portion. In addition to the investigation work, the five-member fire investigation committee then visited the fire department and several privately run fire-fighting organizations, with the aim of making a comparison between official and private. Mao Jingchou, the current chairman of the Nanqu Fire Brigade Federation, replied to Director Ge of the investigation committee: "Whether it is official or private, it is not easy to do well with money, and it is not easy to do well without money." The fact is indeed like this, the only good thing is that "private operators can 'save a lot of paper.'" In recent days, many people have advocated for private fire brigades, and their reasoning is aimed at strengthening the efficiency of fire-fighting work.

The reporter interviewed Zhao Zhiliang, the director of the Nanshi Beiqu Fire Brigade in Shanghai. He gave a general overview of the current fire-fighting organizations in Shanghai and the situation of the fire brigade in the district.

The current fire-fighting organizations in Shanghai, in addition to the fire department under the jurisdiction of the police bureau, also include the fire brigades in the districts of Husi, Zhabei, Zhenru, Wusong, Jiangwan, Pudong, and Hunan. After the destruction and destruction by the enemy and puppets, most of the equipment in the various districts has been lost and cannot cope with the current needs. Only the two districts of Hunan Zhongbei, because they were划入into the refugee area, have been able to partially preserve the fire-fighting equipment.

Founded in the Late Guangxu Period: Expenses Raised by Residents

The Hunan District Fire Brigade was founded in the 33rd year of Guangxu, and the expenses have been automatically donated by the residents of the district on a monthly basis since the beginning. At that time, there were more than 30 fire-fighting groups inside and outside Shanghai's city walls. Because the organizations were divided, the highest efficiency could not be achieved when fighting fires. Later, after discussion by the persons in charge of each group, the groups were merged to form the current Hunan Fire-fighting Federation, which is divided into five district fire brigades in the east, west, north, south, and middle. It is stipulated that the members of the volunteer team in each district must not only provide their own uniforms but also be responsible for fundraising in the district. They must immediately mobilize during an alarm. Most of the employees and team members are residents of the district. The highest monthly salary is now 160,000 yuan, and the lowest is only 40,000 yuan, but because of the work, they almost cannot leave the office all day. Since its opening, it has had a very good performance. In terms of fire-fighting equipment, before the war, the five districts had more than 30 pump cars, ladder cars, belt cars, and ambulances, and more than 1,000 fire hydrants. After being destroyed by the enemy and puppets, the five districts now have a total of more than 20 vehicles and only more than 300 fire hydrants left, most of which need to be repaired before they can be used. The Beiqu currently has five pump cars and one belt car, and 20 belts. Recently, the team members raised more than 20 million yuan and installed a new ambulance. Director Zhao said with a smile, "If it were run by the government, I'm afraid it wouldn't be installed in half a year."

Do Not Object to Government Assistance: Just Afraid of Not Knowing How to Make a Budget

Talking about their work and the situation of dispatching fire alarms, he said: The association stipulates that two fire trucks should be dispatched for fire alarms in this district, and one fire truck should be dispatched for each of the other districts. The number of dispatched team members is determined according to the fire situation. They do not object to government assistance, but they are afraid of not knowing how to make a budget.

They hope to become a national model of private fire brigades. They have a high degree of service spirit.

### Initial Trial of the Collision Case of Two Ships: Two Captains Released on Bail
### Uproar Erupted from the Gallery After the Verdict Was Announced
### Xin and Zhang's Statements Both Claimed All Passengers on Board Were Rescued
### Ticketing Manager Testified That At Least Twenty or Thirty People Drowned

[Report from this newspaper] The case of the collision between the Zhijiang and Huatong ships has been investigated by the District Procuratorate, which believes that both captains were at fault. After public prosecution was initiated against both, the District Court held a preliminary hearing yesterday, with a full audience. According to Xin Chengfang, the captain of the Zhijiang, the ship left the Shanghai dock at 10:30 PM on January 17th of this year, sailing out of the Wusongkou. The collision occurred around midnight. When the red light of the Huatong ship was first spotted, the two ships were about 500 to 600 feet apart. Two whistle warnings were immediately given, but the Huatong did not respond. Therefore, the Zhijiang steered to the right. At the same time, the Zhijiang ship was also equipped with red and green lights, but because the two iron barges towed by the Huatong did not display lights, the collision occurred. After the accident, all passengers on board were rescued. Before the ship sank, he had checked each section and saw that no one was left. The Zhijiang ship began to sink ten minutes after the Huatong left, so there were no passengers in the ship at that time. According to Zhang Jinsheng, the captain of the Huatong, his ship entered the Wusongkou at 0:25 AM on November 18th. The whistle was sounded once at Shigeng Port. Four minutes later, he heard a whistle from the Zhijiang ship. It seemed that the two ships were already very close at that time, and before a response could be made, the accident occurred one minute later. The iron barges were tightly attached to both sides of the ship, which did not violate navigation regulations. He also stated that after the accident, he inspected his ship and found that it was not damaged, so he immediately assisted in rescuing the passengers of the Zhijiang. More than 500 people were rescued by iron barge No. 45, and more than 100 people were rescued by the Huatong ship. Seeing that there were no more passengers on the old Jiang ship, they left immediately. However, according to witness Zhou Gen, he and his three brothers took the Zhijiang ship back to their hometown. The three were separated when the accident occurred. After he was rescued, the whereabouts of his two brothers remain unknown. He also presented a letter from his family as evidence. According to Yang Yi, the service director of the Zhijiang (who was also a survivor), the Zhijiang carried nearly 1,000 passengers, with more than 900 tickets sold. During the collision, the order was chaotic, and dozens of people were injured on the spot. When the Zhijiang ship sank, he estimated that at least twenty or thirty people in the lower levels drowned. Subsequently, the defense lawyers requested bail for their clients. The court ordered that the defendants, Xin Chengfang and Zhang Jinsheng, be respectively entrusted to their respective shipping companies, Gongyi and Tongji, and that two solid merchants be found as guarantors for bail. After the verdict was announced, the families of the victims in the gallery erupted in an uproar, with some shouting loudly. As the trial was over, the bailiffs shouted, "Court adjourned." The two defendants also followed their lawyers out of the court to complete the bail procedures. The audience then gradually withdrew.

### Reportedly, Materials Were Stolen and Sold
### Old Case of the Puppet Jianghai Customs Reopened

[Report from this newspaper] The 23rd Regiment of the Military Police received a tip that the puppet Jianghai Customs in this city had transferred confiscated military supplies to the Maritime Affairs Section in 1933, and that a large number of military supplies were stolen during the transfer. About a week after the Japanese surrender, a large amount of kerosene stored in the Jianghai Customs warehouse was colluded and sold by a Lin, the head of the Maritime Affairs Section, and a Guan, the head of the Altitude Section. Thousands of boxes were transported away by ship. It was also said that these two matters were related to A.F.S., the British director of the Maritime Affairs Inspection Company, who was temporarily borrowed by the Maritime Affairs Section. After the case was transferred to the District Procuratorate by the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, the District Procuratorate sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs for inquiries. Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs replied, stating that the case had been investigated by the Port Police Bureau. It was discovered that a military supply theft incident did occur at 5:00 PM on September 19th and 9:00 AM on September 20th in 1933. However, very few military supplies were lost, only six pistols and some bullets. On August 17th, 1934, a Japanese man, Lin Ersaburo, transported 1,000 boxes of kerosene from Pudong to another location. On September 21st, 898 boxes of the batch of kerosene were handed over by Guan, the head of the Altitude Section, and the remaining hundred or so boxes could not be recovered. As for A.F.S., he was a former employee of the Jianghai Customs. He was recalled to England during the war, and returned to Chongqing in January 1934 to continue his service. He was sent to Shanghai to handle the takeover when victory came in August 1934. The previous two cases seem to have nothing to do with A.F.S. in terms of time.

### Liu Xun's Retrial
### Covers His Face and Weeps
### Says Qian Minxing Made False Accusations
### Prevaricates About the Origin of the Gold Jewelry

[Report from this newspaper] Liu Xun, the supplementary captain of the third company of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Security Brigade, who had been sentenced to death, was sent back for retrial by the Supreme Court. The High Court brought the defendant to court for trial yesterday afternoon. The defendant had a new haircut, wore a coffee-colored Russian hat, and a gray-brown line flannel cotton robe, speaking with a Hunan accent. He denied all kinds of crimes interrogated in court, claiming that he was originally a soldier of the 62nd National Army Division, and was captured after being injured in battle. He was released on bail by Cheng Wanjun, the commander of the puppet First Division. In November of the 31st year, he was registered in Cheng's department as a lieutenant-level service member. He left after his injury healed. In February of the 32nd year, he opened a cigarette shop in Lianshi Town, Wuxing County. After the puppet security third company came to Lianshi Town, because the captain of the team, He Jianzhang, was from Hunan and was a fellow villager, he sent me to be the deputy captain of the supplementary team, without rank, salary, or duty. Judge Qiu interrogated the defendant strictly about various crimes committed during the time in Lianshi, including rape, looting, and harming human lives. The defendant claimed that the accuser, Qian Minxing, coveted his property and colluded with the township chiefs of the area to make false accusations. He repeatedly claimed to be "we ordinary people" and "we anti-Japanese elements." He covered his face and wept, as if he had endless grievances. Judge Qiu continued to investigate, asking why he did not do business in Lianshi Town, and what was the purpose of sneaking into Shanghai in the spring of the 34th year? Why were there as many as thirteen pairs of gold bracelets and more than ten gold rings found in the defendant's home, and the store names engraved on them were different, such as Tongxiang, Huzhou, and Wuzhen...? Isn't this proof that they were plundered from various places? The defendant claimed that they were his wife's family's belongings, and his answers were evasive. Finally, he asked the court to summon the puppet Zhejiang Governor and Security Commander Chuan Shishuo, who had been sentenced to death, and the puppet captain He Jianqun to testify, and to summon the families of the victims to court for confrontation. The court ordered an investigation and retrial, and the defendant was remanded.

### Trial of the Zang Case Concluded
### Judge Conducted a Private Visit Under the Guise of a Fake Reporter
### Witnesses' Statements Were Inconsistent and Immediately Reprimanded
### Family Members Claimed More Than 100 Million Yuan in Compensation
### Defendant Said It Would Take a Thousand Years to Repay
### Court Ordered Sentencing on the 20th

[Report from this newspaper] The re-trial of the Zang Dazier murder case, a suspected instigator of murder, Spanish sailor La Lingnai, was held in the District Court yesterday, and witnesses Zhao Adi, Liao Yuanshou (both rickshaw pullers, the latter testified at the US military court in Qingdao), Jiang Depei, Zheng Shengchu (both employees of the Qundu Ballroom), and family members of the victim, Zang Gensi, Zang Haicheng, etc. were brought to the court to confront La Lingnai. After legal arguments from both sides, the court ordered: "The case will be sentenced on February 20th, La Lingnai will be remanded."

After Judge Wu Ronglin took the seat, he brought La Lingnai and questioned him about his age and origin, then said: The previous trial of this case has exceeded the legal time limit, and the trial should be renewed. After the verdict, the prosecutor pleaded again. Then, the witness Zhao Adi was questioned. He claimed that on September 22 last year, he was waiting for business in front of Huadu, and did not leave until after closing. He did not pay attention when La Lingnai came, but Zang Dazier had asked him to pay attention, saying that a one-eyed foreigner (namely La Lingnai) took a ride without paying. Later, when Lai came out, Zang asked him for the fare. While arguing, a US Tsar suddenly intervened and punched Zang Dazier to the ground. According to Jiang Depei, Lai came to Huadu around eight or nine o'clock. He came alone. He did not know whether he paid the fare, but he said that Lai was indeed drunk when he left.

Zheng Shengchu was called again. Zheng was a worker at Huadu. Judge Wu had visited Huadu under the name of a newspaper reporter and met Zheng Shengchu. At that time, Zheng did not know that Judge Wu was "privately visiting," so he described in detail how La Lingnai instigated the murder and how Loutelik beat Zang Dazier. However, Zheng suddenly denied witnessing the event in court yesterday. He had previously told Judge Wu that La Lingnai and the US Tsar came out of Huadu at the same time, but he also denied it yesterday. He was reprimanded by the court. Finally, Zang Haicheng, the niece of the victim , filed a civil suit, requesting compensation of 8.704 million yuan for Zang's expenses, 134 million yuan for the cost of the deceased's production compensation, and 5 million yuan for the survivor's pension. However, the defendant La Lingnai said in court: He only earns 70 US dollars a month , such a number would take a thousand years to pay off , he is really unable to bear it, and said that he did not instigate murder, so there is no need to pay compensation.

Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor, after reading your newspaper's publication on the 13th regarding a dispute over the sale of gold at our store, there was a slight misunderstanding. On the afternoon of the 12th, Sun, a martial arts actor from the Gong Stage, and two others came to sell gold. They underreported the quantity and tried to force the transaction. The counter staff advised them politely but to no avail. They tried to break into the inner room. Their momentum was fierce and the transaction was not kind. Therefore, our store reported the case to the police and detained Sun and the other two at the Taishan Branch. Although they have been released on bail by the theater authorities, our store reserves the right to negotiate. The above is the factual process. We hereby send a special letter, hoping to publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Yongfeng Silver Shop.

After reading your newspaper's publication on February 7th, "Young Thief Commits Another Crime and Falls into the Net," the contents involved the Arctic Fruit Shop. After checking, Zhu and Li Jun are not personnel of our shop. I hereby write to request a correction. Sincerely, Arctic Fresh Fruit Shop.

### Reader Consultation Legal Inquiries

Following the Example of Superiors

Wang Cheng asks: A certain A is doing business outside and has not returned for two years. His wife stole all the public property at home and lived with someone. After A's family discovered this, they invited the local Baojia chief to advise her. She not only ignored it, but also eloped with her lover. As a result, the family affairs are chaotic and no one can handle them. Someone wants to harass a certain woman. To avoid future entanglements, A filed a petition with the local county government to divorce his wife on the grounds of her elopement with someone and malicious abandonment. Is this procedure legal? A certain woman has nominally been a concubine for sixteen years (with a son of thirteen). Due to disagreements, they have been separated for eight years. The concubine has been living with someone for six years. Now I heard that A's wife escaped without a trace, and planned to take the opportunity to please A, and wanted to obtain the position of the principal wife, but A had already made an engagement with someone, so he refused her request. Because her purpose was not achieved, she slandered him. A made a statement in the newspaper to explain all the relationships, and filed a lawsuit with the court to accuse her of defamation. Is this legal?

[Lawyer Chuan Kuangling answers] A formal divorce lawsuit should be filed with the county government and requested a judgment. It is not legal to just file a record. There is nothing wrong with publishing and investigating by letter.

Forced Engagement

Zhu Xianzhu asks: During the Anti-Japanese War, I was brought to Shanghai by my parents. After the victory, I returned to my hometown with my parents to sweep the tomb. A few days after returning to my hometown, I was suddenly forced by my parents to get engaged to a man surnamed Zhang. Although I tried my best to oppose it at the time, it did not take effect. May I ask, can I dissolve the engagement if I am under 20 years old? If the other party forces the marriage, will it be effective if I don't attend? If I am forced to marry the other party by my parents using high-pressure tactics in the future, is it illegal for me to leave the family? Is it possible to freely engage with others in the future? If I am found by my parents after leaving home, is it a crime? Is there a proper way to protect freedom without violating the law?

[Lawyer Chuan Kuangling answers] This engagement is legally invalid at all. The engagement cannot be enforced. Moreover, it is an invalid engagement. It is not illegal. You can freely engage in marriage when you are 20 years old. If you are under 20 years old, you should obtain the consent of your legal representative. See the answer in the third paragraph. If you simply do not fulfill this invalid engagement without other illegal acts, you will not violate the law.

### Hope Readers Donate to Help the Liang Family

Mr. Liang Renda was innocently beaten to death by thugs this time. I think readers must be deeply saddened! The Liang family is poor, and the widow is alone. How will they live in the future?

I hope you will donate generously.

Donation report: 12,000 yuan from a pair of sister workers, 5,000 yuan from a group of mechanical workers, 100,000 yuan from Mr. Yi, totaling 117,000 yuan.

### Relaxing Price Negotiations and Smoothing Sources
### The Situation in the Rice Market Is Improving
### The Highest Retail Price of White Rice Is Not Allowed to Exceed 130,000
### Trial Operation for One Week Before Re-Negotiating New Price Limits

[Report from this newspaper] The Rice Industry Association believes that the price of rice in the producing areas is high. If the city continues to maintain the highest transaction price of 69,000 yuan and the highest retail price of 76,000 yuan, it will not only be impossible to transport rice to Shanghai, but the entire rice industry will not be able to operate. And if there is no rice to buy from the society, they will generally complain. Yesterday morning, representatives Wan Molin, Qu Zhenhua, Yang Jiuci, Yang Runqin, Yin Fuxiang, Xu Chongren, and other six people were sent to visit Mayor Wu, detailing the various difficulties that the cost was higher than the negotiated price, and sincerely requested that the price negotiation be relaxed so that the rice shops could resume normal operations. After consideration, Mayor Wu immediately verbally ordered that the negotiated price of white japonica rice be 120,000, the market transaction plus a commission of 3,000 yuan, and the highest retail price be 130,000, not to exceed it. This method will be maintained temporarily for one week. We will see how the situation is and want to be able to lower it in the near future.

Yesterday, the food rice market situation gradually improved. The japonica rice, which had not been heard from for a long time, was registered for delivery. According to the Nanshi Market, 796 piculs of white japonica rice, 168 piculs of thin rice, and 90 piculs of early rice arrived, totaling 1,054 piculs. According to the Beishi Market, 904 piculs of white japonica rice, 190 piculs of thin rice, 175 piculs of sheep rice, 95 piculs of Du rice, and 70 piculs of white yuan rice arrived, totaling 1,434 piculs. There were a total of 2,488 piculs in the North and South markets. The number of various gangs coming to Shanghai gradually increased, and people's hearts softened. Many sellers intended to sell, and the retail stores were selling slowly. The trend continued to loosen, and the market continued to weaken by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. However, the transactions were sparse, and the high white japonica rice had retreated to within 130,000 yuan.

Flour

The market regained its color. Due to the sharp drop, people's hearts were slightly stabilized. The shops added purchases at low prices, and there were rumors of good news, which completely eliminated the exhausted atmosphere. Lilang was the first to have a transaction, with a price of 76,000 yuan, 3,000 to 4,000 yuan higher than the last time. The prices of other flours also increased by about 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran was secretly firm. It was heard that the Relief General Administration had 15,000 piculs open for sale, and speculators tried to buy them at low prices. They deliberately shouted the market price 3,000 to 4,000 yuan lower in the market. Small packages were shouted down to 18,000 to 19,000 yuan, but in reality, small packages were 24,000 to 25,000 yuan and were still difficult to buy. Loose bran was about 34,000 to 35,000 yuan. Only Pudong's net goods of wheat were sold for 73,000 yuan, and the market was firm.

Edible oil

After continuous declines, most of the cargo owners wanted to price increase, it seemed that it had dropped to the limit, but they were still struggling, changing from selling to guarding, and the shouting price rose again. The shops took the opportunity to absorb, and zero sales were still good. The center of the Denggao transaction was still raw oil. The south side gradually retreated. The first opening of raw oil was 240,000 yuan, and the noon closing was 250,000 yuan. The last shouting price of Jitong raw oil was 280,000 yuan, which was about 20,000 yuan better than the previous day. Because there were few transactions of soybean oil, the price was balanced, and the market was also firm. Small carts of sesame oil also rose by 5,000 yuan. Qingma and other oils were still popular.

Miscellaneous grains

Mostly turned from tired to firm, because the sellers were not as eager as before, and the street gradually had inquiries. The decline in yellow beans was set, and the market returned to peace. The prices of various goods were slightly firm by about 2,000 yuan. The sesame market was similar. After the rapid decline of raw peanuts, there were actual sales, and the price rose by more than 10,000 yuan. Yidou was still peaceful and tired, mung beans were firm, corn was cut by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, red grains were flat, and the bean was firm and then tired, resulting in a slight increase of 500 yuan, and broad beans were balanced.

Foreign Stocks Flat and Tired

The foreign muscles were firm in the morning and tired in the afternoon, and the situation was vague. The opening in the morning was slightly higher, and the highest at noon. After noon, there were many sales and rapid returns in unfavorable rumors. As a result, Yipi and Guang Paper were slightly higher than the previous closing, steel rose by half a percent, and the rest were flat and slightly lower.

### Idle Funds Seek a Way Out
### Government Bonds Rise Sharply Again

There were not many transactions in public bonds yesterday, only 3 million transactions. According to reports, the Legislative Yuan's inquiry to the Ministry of Finance about the interest-buying news, people's hearts were prosperous. Tongbing opened at 2,800 yuan in the morning, and the buying tide surged, rising to a high price of 3,800 yuan to end. As a result, it rose sharply by 1,050 yuan compared to the previous closing. A and B each rose by 500 yuan, D rose by 400 yuan, and E also rose by 450 yuan. Continued to rise after closing.

### Wool Textile and Import and Export Industry Association
### Please Relax the Import Quota of Wool

[Report from this newspaper] The Wool Textile and Import and Export Industry Association of this city held a seat meeting yesterday to discuss the import of wool raw materials. Many people in charge of the two associations attended. After discussion, it was decided to ask the Export Control Committee to relax the import quota of wool raw materials. For the goods that the industry ordered from abroad before November 17th last year, they planned to apply for import permits quickly. Otherwise, the fixed cargo contract will have to be cancelled by the seller, and it will affect the progress of the next ordering procedure.

According to a person in charge of the Wool Textile Industry Association, the monthly raw materials required by each wool textile factory in this city are estimated to be 800,000 pounds of wool tops and 10,000 pounds of wool. The current propaganda by the export management department is that the possible allocation quota is very limited. Due to the lack of raw materials, one-third of the factories have been reduced in size or reduced in work. If there is no hope for the arrival of raw materials in mid-January, then all factories will be forced to stop work or reduce work, so it is necessary to request a relaxation of the import quota. As for the imported raw materials in the future, in principle, they will be allocated according to the equipment of each factory.

### Money Exchange Houses Stop Trading; Black Market for Gold and Currency Gradually Dissipates; Gold Price Falls by 950,000 Yuan

The price of gold bullion did not break out of its holding pattern yesterday. In the early morning, it opened at 7.1 million to 7.3 million, and some people took the opportunity to sell at the high price, causing it to fall back to 6.65 million. After that, it went into a holding pattern. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 49 bars at a price of 6.7 million. From then on, it remained in a holding pattern, struggling between 6.7 million and 6.9 million. There was no special change at noon. In the afternoon, the market was still relatively balanced. After 2:00 PM, money exchange houses stopped trading, so forward transactions also came to a standstill. Amidst the urgent rumors, the black market retreated to around 6.2 million. As a result, the closing price was 950,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Gold jewelry was priced at 700,000 yuan, and silver dollars further declined to below 5,000 yuan. As the silver market tightened slightly, interest rates ranged from 15% to 18%.

Foreign currencies also showed some weakness yesterday. The black market for U.S. dollars opened in the morning fluctuating between 13,500 yuan and 444,000 yuan, and the situation was very sluggish. Rumors of audits of Rong's business and accounting inspections circulated one after another, and money exchange houses stopped trading. Lacking normal trading activity, asking prices were slightly lower. As a result, the closing price was about 3,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Hong Kong currency also fell by 300 yuan. Hong Kong dollar exchange rates had transactions at 2,750 yuan and 3,800 yuan yesterday, with the immediate rate at 3,400 yuan. The British pound exchange rate was 45,000 yuan. All of these had quotes but no market.

### Silk Market Situation Calm

The silk trend is gradually returning to calm. Yesterday, 120 "Xu" brand bright rayon fluctuated around 6.34 million yuan all day, with little difference from the previous day's price. 75 "Golden Rooster" semi-gloss silk traded at 10.5 million yuan, slightly firmer than the previous day. The "bi jing" (warp-faced satin) was also very quiet. C-grade traded at 7.35 million yuan. Spot prices for "gan jing" (plain silk) remained the same as the previous day. Silk fabrics were also quite stable. Yesterday, besides the Meiya bedspreads and large-checkered crepe de chine being slightly higher, the rest were roughly the same as the previous day's prices. However, transactions were very scarce.

### Paper Imports Difficult

Inventory Can Last for Six Months

[Our Report] According to a person in charge of the Paper Industry Association: Since the Transport Control Commission placed paper in the second category, paper imports have become very difficult. The paper currently arriving in Shanghai is all from orders placed before November 17th. Applications submitted after November 17th have not yet received import licenses. Therefore, paper prices continue to rise. Newsprint prices were 46,000 yuan before the Lunar New Year, but are now as high as 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, an increase of about two to three times. The prices of other types of paper have also increased similarly. Currently, 90% of the paper used in this city is imported. Although domestically produced paper is cheaper, the production is very small and insufficient to meet demand. Based on current paper inventory, it can last for about six months. If the paper import situation cannot be improved, there is a possibility of a paper shortage in a few months.

Shilin Cloth Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially continued the firm trend of the previous day. Later, because the Textile Construction Company supplied "Dragon Head" fine cloth, and all applicants were able to purchase it, floating accounts from banks sold off, with "Dragon Head" domestic cloth at 167,000 yuan and "Five Blessings" at 164,000 yuan, a decrease of 1,000 yuan from the previous day. However, the high-end 190 Shilin cloth continued to rise by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan because dyeing costs had not decreased.

### Yarn Market Still Lingering in a Weak State; Textile Construction Company's List Price Higher Than Market Price

[Our Report] Yesterday, the yarn market was still lingering in a weak state. There were still few customers. The price of 20-count yarn continued to fall by about ten thousand. The Textile Construction Company released its list price at 11:00 AM, offering ten types of yarn. The price of 20-count "Water Moon" large package was listed at 3.5 million, but the market price was only 3.4 million. Also, 42-count "Blue Phoenix" was listed at 7.35 million, which was 200,000 higher than the market opening price. Therefore, very few people applied to purchase it. Market sentiment was still weak, and it did not become invigorated by the Textile Construction Company's high listing price. The trend seemed to be entering a holding pattern.

Also, it is reported that the China Textile Construction Company sold a total of 576 pieces of yarn yesterday. Among them, manufacturers accounted for 473 pieces, and trading houses accounted for 103 pieces. There were a total of 217 applicant households. Among them, manufacturers accounted for 175 households, and trading houses accounted for 42 households.

### Cotton Fabric Reproduction Industry Requests Advance Yarn Allocation

After the sharp rise in yarn prices, factories in the cotton fabric reproduction industry have been greatly affected. The Reproduction Products Industry Association held a meeting of representatives from affiliated associations to discuss countermeasures. As a result, it was decided to request the Textile Control Commission to allocate in advance the cotton yarn purchased by the association from various yarn factories and to improve the allocation method. The submission will be sent out within days.

### Woolen Fabric Spring Sales Progress

The spring sales of woolen fabrics continue to progress. Local shops and customers are constantly purchasing. However, the transaction volume has decreased compared to the previous days. The reasons are: First, prices have risen sharply since the tariff was increased by 50%. Second, people are afraid to try again due to the pain of high-interest loans. Third, most transactions require cash, making it difficult to issue checks payable in ten days or half a month. Fourth, in general, buyers are carefully assessing their strength and trading according to the principle of "selling when the price is high and buying when the price is low."

### Sixth Sugar Allocation by Taiwan Sugar

Taiwan Sugar Corporation held its sixth allocation of sugar yesterday, allocating a total of 29,913 bags, totaling 2,436 tons, including 21,392 bags of coarse granulated sugar priced at 190,000 yuan per picul, 3,768 bags of refined white sugar priced at 200,000 yuan, 3,103 bags of white honey sugar priced at 170,000 yuan, and 1,650 bags of broken sugar priced at 140,000 yuan. Except for coarse granulated sugar, which is packaged in hemp bags with a content of 180 catties per bag, the rest are packaged in straw bags with a content of 120 catties each. It is understood that the company's approved allocation volume this time is based on one-fourth of the actual total amount of each sugar merchant's allocations in the first, second, third, and fourth allocations as a reference standard, with each unit of coarse granulated sugar given a flexible allocation of ten bags in the above four allocations.

### Pig Bristle Market Chaotic

The pig bristle market price has recently been stimulated. The price of Shanghai bristles has risen from around 900,000 yuan per picul to 1.8 million yuan. Sichuan bristles have risen from 1.1 million to 2.12 million yuan, an increase of about 100%. In addition, current labor costs are also adjusted according to the cost of living index. The industry is taking a wait-and-see attitude, with few transactions. As for the overseas market, prices have not improved due to the U.S. government's sale of inventory. The price of Sichuan bristles is still fluctuating between 2.5 and 2.6 yuan per pound, while Shanghai bristles are only 2.1 to 2.2 yuan, with quotes but no market. The industry is not daring to export due to the current sharp rise in prices and the chaotic market. Also, before the implementation of the export method through the "Bu Zhong" system, the China Trust Bureau ordered a total of 4,100 piculs of pig bristles from four companies: Zisan, Heyuan, Xianfeng, and Chongde, including 8 piculs of Hankou bristles and the rest were Sichuan bristles. Hankou bristles were priced at 4.5 yuan per pound, and Sichuan bristles were priced at 3.2 yuan per pound.

### Tung Oil Firms Again

The daily increase in tung oil has far exceeded the export limit. According to people in the industry, prices in the tung oil producing areas have been rising. In order to maintain costs, merchants in the Shanghai market have no choice but to raise prices at any moment. Among other vegetable oils, the highest increase is in castor oil, which has reached 500,000 yuan per picul. Yesterday, the market price for tung oil was 3.6 to 3.7 million yuan per picul, and the foothold was very firm. The price of West Hong goods also surged, and the market was extremely short of goods, with each barrel priced at 3.4 million yuan. (Another report) According to a certain merchant, the Shanghai tung oil market price is based on the rise and fall in Hankou, and Hankou tung oil prices are mostly based on the Hong Kong market price. Therefore, regular export prices cannot fully control the entire market.

Statistics on Multiples of Wage Increases in Major Industries; Average More Than 10,000 Times Half a Yuan

Chemical Raw Materials - 0.71 - 5225 - 7308

The daily wage of the ten major industries listed above has increased by an average of 11,728 times.

(Fish Prices Balanced)

Amidst this round of skyrocketing prices, fish prices have remained normal without a sudden surge. According to General Manager Tang of the Fish Market, the supply of fish has been smooth recently. Sales are made as soon as the fish arrive, especially for fish from fishing vessels, which are sold through auction. Daily auctions allow transactions to be concluded at normal and reasonable prices, which is a major stabilizing force. Given the current supply situation, neither cornering nor price gouging is likely to occur in the fish market.

### Announcement by the Transport Control Executive Committee; Slight Changes in Commodity Classification; Import Licenses for Jeeps Temporarily Suspended

Furthermore, the commission's Guangzhou office originally had a gasoline import quota of more than 300 tons for the first quarter, which has already been used up, causing a gasoline panic in Guangzhou. The commission has now specially approved the request of the local authorities and allocated the second-quarter quota for emergency relief. At the same time, it will request a thorough investigation of whether there is hoarding.

### British Merchants Need Chen Qimen Black Tea

Although there were inquiries about both domestic and foreign sales in the tea market yesterday, sellers still held onto their goods in the hopes of a better price, and transactions remained weak. However, the market situation continues to improve. According to news from British export merchants, they are also planning to resume purchasing Qimen black tea from 1946. There is currently a considerable amount of inventory. It is said that the buyer and seller are in negotiations. If an agreement can be reached, the situation will likely improve.

### Coal Supply Scarce; Allocation May Be Reduced

[Our Report] According to news from the Fuel Control Commission, the Qin Huangdao area has been heavily frozen recently, making coal transportation difficult. It is estimated that only 100,000 tons of coal will arrive in February. Also, because not much coal arrived in the previous two months, coal reserves have been constantly used, and currently only about 60,000 tons remain. Therefore, the allocation of coal in February must be reduced accordingly. The price will be 15,000 yuan per picul higher than last month.

### China and the United States Ban Copyright Infringement; Translation Remains Unrestricted; Minister Zhu Stated to Reporters Yesterday

[Our Report] Reporters visited Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua yesterday and asked many questions. Minister Zhu answered them one by one as follows: (1) On the issue of government-funded students, the Ministry of Education stipulated the previous year that funding would not be based on departments but on need. Among new students, 40% are fully government-funded, 40% are half government-funded, and the other 20% receive no funding. In this unstable living situation, those who have already applied will be maintained until graduation. Whether new students can apply again in the second half of the year has not yet been decided, but it is generally intended to maintain the current system.

Textbook Issue

(2) On the issue of nationally standardized textbooks: Because a long time has passed since the last review, the content has become outdated. The Ministry of Education is currently holding meetings to discuss this, hoping that the public will contribute their opinions, which the Ministry of Education will adopt as much as possible. Nationally standardized textbooks were originally printed exclusively by "Seven United," but printing has now been opened up to everyone. The Ministry of Education has set standards for calligraphy, paintings, paper, etc. Samples can be sent to the Ministry for review starting March 1st. Those deemed qualified will be issued licenses. After printing, they can be distributed and sold starting July 1st. (3) Military training for high school students may not be implemented this year. The conscription law stipulates that all citizens must serve for two years. If students receive one year of military training and then have to serve for two years, the time of intellectuals is valuable and should not be wasted. Therefore, it is now planned to integrate military training with the conscription system, stipulating that high school graduates only need to serve for one year to save time.

Guidance System

(3) Regarding the guidance system for colleges and universities, it has been decided that each school will organize a guidance committee, with the president as the chair, the dean of guidance as the secretary, and the deans of other colleges, department heads, and professors who can lead students as members, so that teaching and guidance are integrated. (5) After the signing of the Sino-American treaty, copyright infringement is prohibited, which will certainly affect textbooks used in Chinese universities, but translation remains unrestricted. (6) The Ministry of Education is very concerned about the two beatings of students in Chongqing, but has not yet received a detailed report. It has sent a letter to inquire. In the event of such incidents, anyone who disrupts social order can only be dealt with according to the law. (7) The report that a large number of students at Peking University have suspended their studies is probably not true. I have not received any report related to this matter so far. (8) The issue of providing relief to students who fled from the "Liberated Areas" is currently being handled by the Education Assistance Committee. The committee was originally affiliated with the Youth Corps, then the Executive Yuan, and now it belongs to the Ministry of Education.

Wuhan University Student Protests

(9) The Wuhan University student protests stemmed from a misunderstanding. The second batch of funds for reconstruction issued by the Ministry of Education was intended for the construction of school buildings. The school is still in session, and the students' point of contention is only to request a reduction in the school's punishment for those who caused the first disturbance. However, the punishment is very peaceful and lenient, so it must be carried out. Some students may have been instigated, so they caused a second disturbance, and they will also be punished once they are identified. The Ministry of Education has sent the Director of Higher Education to Wuhan to observe, and President Zhou will also return to the school in Beijing shortly. (10) The 35% of educational funding stipulated in the Constitution will be implemented when the Constitution is implemented. (11) On the issue of party groups withdrawing from schools: The party has probably withdrawn, but this is not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education.

### Self-Funded Students in the US Can Apply for Foreign Exchange in the US

[Nanjing, 14th - Central News Agency] The Ministry of Education announced: In order to facilitate self-funded students in the US to apply for foreign exchange, students can submit their admission certificate and transcript or photograph to the Chinese consulates in the US, which will then transfer the application for foreign exchange.

### Chinese People Value Children's Education

New Discovery by Mrs. Cowell of America

[US Information Service, Miami, Florida, 14th] Mrs. Cowell, executive director of the China Relief Committee, who recently returned from China, estimates that about half of China's 200 million children are in school. She found that Chinese parents are very eager to promote their children's education.

### Children's Handicraft and Art Exhibition to Be Held for Three Days Starting June 6th; This Semester's Mandarin Competition Limited to Senior Grades

[Our Report] The first meeting of the principals of central national schools in Shanghai and the first preparatory meeting for the children's handicraft and art exhibition were held jointly yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Fifth District Elementary School on Yingshi Road. Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau, Director Zhu Junti of the National Education Department, and more than 40 principals and art experts attended. It was decided: (1) The children's handicraft and art exhibition will be held in one place for three days starting June 6th. Each school district will hold a preliminary exhibition in its district from May 11th to 20th. The exhibits will be primarily children's regular schoolwork to ensure authenticity. Handicrafts will be divided into five categories: clothing, food, housing, transportation, and others. Art will be divided into five categories: sketching, free drawing, patterns, collage, and others. (2) The topics for this semester's Mandarin speech competition in each school will be freely chosen and limited to senior grades. Schools without senior grades can have middle grades participate. (3) The investigation of school-age children and out-of-school adults in each district will be handled by the guidance directors of each district in consultation with the district offices and reported.

### Municipal Bank Continues to Offer Education Loans

Total Amount Set at 200 Million National Currency; Applications Begin on the 15th of This Month

The Municipal Bank of this city, recognizing that public educators and impoverished citizens in this city have difficulty raising the funds necessary for their children's education, has held two education loan programs successively last year, which have been very effective. It has been heard that the bank has been ordered by the municipal government to continue the program as before. The total amount of loans for this period is set at 200 million national currency. The allocation method is as follows: 150 university students, 200,000 yuan per student; 250 high school students, 140,000 yuan per student; 350 junior high school students, 110,000 yuan per student; 1,200 elementary school students, 80,000 yuan per student. The interest rate is 1% per month, limited to six months, and repaid in equal monthly installments, with interest decreasing as principal is repaid. The application period is from the 15th of this month to March 6th, for a total of 20 days.

### Pan Wenzhen Yesterday Received the Press, Denying Assaulting a Teacher

[Our Report] The disaster-stricken teachers and staff of the Municipal Shaanxi North Road Elementary School hosted members of the local press at the Atlantic Restaurant at 3 p.m. yesterday, denying that the principal had assaulted a teacher after the fire. Zhang Baineng, the school's director of general affairs, presided over the meeting and reported that Chen Suyun was a substitute teacher at the school. He stated that the allegation that Principal Jing Qing was not transparent was a malicious slander, among other things.

Following this, Principal Pan Wenzhen stood up to speak, refuting the points made by Chen Suyun as follows: (1) Regarding the accusation of taking advantage of the fire: Chen Suyun has absolutely no reason to inquire about whether the school has money or not. At the same time, whether something burned down or not has nothing to do with corruption. I have not reported anything to the Education Bureau so far, so what corruption are we talking about? (2) Regarding the two million yuan in relief funds allocated by the Education Bureau, I only affixed my seal of approval for the withdrawal. All distribution methods were handled by the school's colleagues themselves. (3) The fact that teacher Wu Baoqin said that she could not even get a drop of water to wash her feet should not be my responsibility. The school automatically organized a meal group due to extremely tight funds, stipulating that hot water would only be provided during work hours. (4) Chen Suyun's claim that she was my principal must also be denied. When I was studying at Zhejiang Normal School, Chen was only my teacher, not the principal. Moreover, I later served as the principal of that school. So, if I respect her, I acknowledge her as my teacher. Otherwise, I could also say that she taught at my women's normal school. (5) The accusation of misusing private connections is even more inconsistent with the facts. I have always handled matters impartially, without considering personal relationships. The current Director of Academic Affairs of our school, Tian Min, is indeed my own brother, but she is a graduate of Jinan University and has taught for seven years. I ask, is she qualified? Furthermore, Chen Suling is my personal acquaintance. Because of her weak abilities and constant sowing of discord, hindering the school's administration, I disregarded personal feelings and asked her to seek other employment. This alone proves that I do not misuse private connections. (6) You say that the principal should protect the careers of teachers, then I ask: Are all Tom, Dick, and Harrys included in that protection? (7) Regarding the matter of Li beating a teacher, apart from being more serious in my attitude during meetings, speeches, and lectures, I am usually praised as "kind and amiable." The so-called invitation of the masses to beat a teacher is incomprehensible. In reality, after leaving the school, Chen lost all sense of shame and disfigured herself, claiming to have been beaten, in an attempt to frame someone else.

The reception, which had a theatrical air, ended around 5 p.m.

### Private School Subsidy of 500 Million Yuan to Be Allocated as Student Loans for Needy Students

### Basketball Friendly Match: Shantou Team vs. Columbus

The basketball league originally had three matches scheduled tonight, including the Group A match between the Shantou team and Enkas. Due to unforeseen circumstances, Enkas was unable to play. With the consent of the Shantou team and the approval of the Basketball Committee, the match was rescheduled. The time will be used for a friendly match between the Shantou team and the Western Columbus team. The competition will still be held at the Municipal Gymnasium, with tickets priced at 2,000 and 3,000.

The first match is the women's group match between the Women's Youth Purple and Women's Youth Red teams, with the sister teams competing against each other.

The second match is the Group B match between the Indian team and the V team. The V team recently suffered a crushing defeat against Jia Shen, which was uncharacteristic. It is difficult to predict the outcome of today's match against the Indian team.

The final friendly match is between the Shantou team and Columbus. This is the first time the foreign Columbus team has appeared in Shanghai. However, it is said that their skills are above those of the Sealand Youth team. Today, the two teams will meet, and it remains to be seen who is stronger. Today's schedule is recorded below:

Women's Youth Purple – Women's Youth Red (Women's Group) 5:30 PM

Indian – V Team (Group B) 6:30 PM

Shantou Team – Columbus (Friendly Match) 7:30 PM

### Morning Friends Cup Awards Ceremony, Two Exhibition Matches for Groups A and B

The 6th Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament concluded successfully last week. As a result, Morning Friends won the Group A championship, and New Life won the Group B championship. The organizers held the awards ceremony last night and arranged two exhibition matches to add to the fun.

### Minister of Education Zhu Declares That the National Games Will Be Held in Nanjing, Budget Application Submitted to the Executive Yuan, Renovation of Venues Requires Hundreds of Millions

[Our Report] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua told reporters yesterday that the National Games are planned to be held this year on Double Tenth Day. Because it is the first session after the victory, the venue is planned to be in Nanjing, the capital. The sports venues are in urgent need of repair. The total funds previously planned were about hundreds of millions, and a request was submitted to the Executive Yuan for allocation. Now that prices are soaring, this budget may be insufficient.

Wang Weijun, a standing director of the Municipal Sports Association, paid a visit to Minister Zhu yesterday morning on behalf of the sports community in this city, sincerely hoping that the National Games can be held as scheduled.

### Self-Encouragement for the "Drama Festival"

— Hong Shen

The annual "Drama Festival" is approaching again. People in the drama circle have decided on some commemorative measures, such as holding commemorative ceremonies, performing spoken dramas, Peking operas, and several types of local operas and variety shows simultaneously. These can only be said to make the festival not seem too deserted, which is still far from the "Drama Festival" full of enthusiasm that we envision.

During the War of Resistance, the spoken drama movement had unprecedented development. Everyone thought that once victory came, the golden age of spoken drama would follow. This dream was finally shattered by cruel reality! In a time when the flames of war raged across the country and countless lives were lost, spoken drama shrunk and declined sharply. If we were to draw a curve to represent this, it should look like this: At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the curve gradually rose. The Battle of Wuhan—the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance—should be the peak of the "rising arc." Afterwards, although it gradually declined, the trend was slow. When victory came, the "falling arc" became very significant. The increased recession last year seemed to have reached the bottom of the "falling arc."

We must have the courage to face the following inevitable difficulties: (1) Due to the continued malignant inflation of currency, the purchasing power of the general public will continue to weaken, especially the audience for spoken drama, who are mostly junior civil servants, students, and intellectuals. They will become even more impoverished, which means that attendance at commercial performances will be even more unreliable; (2) Two theater spaces are still waiting to be fought for and obtained; (3) Hollywood films will invade in an even more aggressive manner and expand their occupation; (4) Raising funds for performance expenses will become even more difficult and affect the quality of performances; (5) The lives of spoken drama actors will become more strained; (6) Due to the difficulty of publication and performance, the output of script creation cannot be increased, which means that the script shortage will not be resolved and may even become more serious…

Of course, these difficulties do not exist in isolation, but are interconnected, adding up and multiplying each other. Weak purchasing power of the audience leads to poor attendance, and the front office is unwilling to continue ordering; the rampant Hollywood movies further increase the economic difficulties of spoken drama, which is already struggling under high-interest loans. Performances cannot help but be simple and crude, and the actors' salaries cannot help but be affected. As a result, playwrights cannot help but give up.

This seems to be the most pessimistic view, but it is also a fact that will inevitably come. We must have the courage to face these difficulties in order to overcome them. I also believe that these difficulties will not only be unique to spoken drama, but will also be shared by Peking opera and local operas.

Today, as we commemorate the Drama Festival, on the one hand, we must stand on the position of the drama circle itself to strive for the development of the drama movement. More importantly, we must lead the people to strive for peace and carry forward the glorious tradition of the spoken drama movement over the past 30 years!

### Reflections on the Drama Festival

— Lu Si

Was the drama movement in the past year really as "meaningless" as some people say? This is naturally another question. Therefore, on this day of the Drama Festival, I want to specifically raise it and urge everyone involved in the drama movement to conduct a rigorous self-criticism. You need to know that reviewing the past is for planning the future, and settling old scores and using past failures to guide future successes is not entirely meaningless.

In my personal opinion, the decline of the drama movement in the past year was certainly greatly affected by the economic recession, but the drama movement itself lacked a clear goal, or rather, the drama lacked a central point, which was also a major reason. Most of the performed plays of various theater groups are used as stepping stones to "commercialize drama." They are testing the fate of drama, seeing which types of plays are easiest to sell. This has to be a fatal wound to the drama movement.

Based on past failures and experiences, if we want to save this year's drama movement, we must first determine its direction, so that our future drama has a central point.

So, what is the central point of drama that we need? In a word: "Strive for national construction and peace!"

During the war, we made our drama serve the War of Resistance; today, we must guide our drama to serve national construction. Now, the civil war is deepening, the national economy is on the verge of total collapse, and the common people are on the line of death. We must make every common person understand the meaning of national construction and stand up together, devoting all their efforts to peace and striving for unity, which is already not enough to break through the current greatest crisis! And for propaganda and education to the common people, the most effective weapon is, as everyone knows, drama; therefore, we must ignite our passion, strengthen our combat power, and ensure that the drama movement and the national movement are tightly linked together, calling on the people of the whole country to unite and work hard!

Waiting for the improvement of objective conditions before engaging in the drama movement again is like waiting for a rabbit to hit a tree, and it is also the most ignorant of the drama movement!

Interesting Stories of Writers

### Hugo

— Shen Si

The French romantic novelist Victor Marie Hugo (1802-1885) was always very casual in life. When he was young, he was once talking about love with Miss Adele Faucher, and Miss Faucher promised to give him twelve passionate kisses. Later, in a letter he wrote to her, he actually wrote: "Dear! Please forgive me, and please allow me to take just one of the twelve passionate kisses you have allowed me!"

### Minor Remarks on the Drama Festival

— Liu Canglang

Just like a person stranded in a foreign land is afraid of encountering his birthday, I am afraid of our festival. Because when this "happy" day comes, the stranded person cannot forget his home; the person engaged in drama cannot forget his own painful industry—not being able to forget is the greatest pain.

We offer the most laughter to celebrate, but in our hearts, we are choked with sobs.

From "new actors" to "abnormal behavior," from "those who sing spoken drama" to "artist registration," from "social ornaments" to "lacking loyalty, filial piety, and moral integrity"... Art itself and the workers themselves have always been thrown into a very absurd position in this absurd country. During the War of Resistance and the victory, drama and theater people did their best.

During the War of Resistance and the victory, those who slandered drama also did their best.

We cannot forget!

From prosperity to decline, from enthusiasm to cooling, from collectivism to selfishness, from sincerity to hypocrisy, from being immersed in art to worshiping gold, from "social value" to "box office value," from living for drama to acting for the sake of living... The test of history is terrible; the result of the test of history is even more terrible. The iron whip of life has swept people off their center of gravity, like spinning tops, spinning rapidly and randomly before falling down.

"People must live on," "Existence is power!"

Under the loud slogans, baseness became nobility, crookedness became uprightness, darkness became light, and wrong became right.

How to live? What method to use to exist?

Whoever asks such questions is an idiot; whoever stubbornly clings to "how" and "what" is a mental patient.

We cannot forget!

On the stage, we are watching a brand new theatrical style being born. It is not a tragedy, not a comedy, neither a farce nor a tragicomedy. It should be called a "play play." A kind of "play play" that is fun to perform and even more fun to watch.

On the stage, we are watching a brand new performance system being born. It is not the Shanghai school, not the Beijing school, neither naturalism nor psychological realism. It should be called the "non-human performance system," using all methods to make the audience feel that there is no "human" feeling at all.

On the stage...

But "existence is power," but "it is a smile with tears," but it is:

Not being able to forget is the greatest happiness.

On this "happy" festival, I have the clearest memory.

### Introspection

— Chen Baichen

Written for the Fourth Drama Festival

The main significance of commemorating the Drama Festival at this time and place is probably not to showcase ourselves. The achievements of the ten years of the War of Resistance are naturally there, but a hero does not mention his past achievements. In today's low tide of the drama movement, there is no need to revel in the past, but there is even less need to bitterly complain about the current difficulties. The road of the drama movement has always been tough and hard-won. Back then, the Southern National Society performed for the only audience in the theater—a mouse. They never complained. Today, there are still two theaters in Shanghai. Are you still not satisfied? As long as you are moving forward, heading towards the bright path, don't be afraid of failing. So today, introspection is perhaps more important.

I am a playwright, and I can only talk about my own profession. I want to introspect myself.

In fact, there is no need to introspect myself today, so I introspected myself once a month or two ago. That was when Mr. Hong Shen, the editor of the "Drama and Film" section of Ta Kung Pao, asked me to write an article, so I wrote one called "A Question." The content of the article was: I think that the current form of drama is too restrictive for writers, especially too restrictive for the audience. The audience has a traditional view of watching plays. Our current form of spoken drama has not been truly accepted by the broad masses. We should look for a more suitable form. Today, I am introspecting myself again, and I feel that I am very stubborn and still insist on my prejudices: The current form of spoken drama is "a question."

What makes me so stubborn are the opinions of several seniors and a gentleman who considers himself a layman. They all said, "Content determines form." They said I was wrong; if your content is accepted by the masses, your form will naturally be accepted!

Whatever kind of content a play has, it will have its own form of expression. This is natural. But, heaven, what I mean by "form" is not this at all! Ibsen wrote "Ghosts" with Norwegian life as its content, and Cao Yu wrote "Thunderstorm" with Chinese life as its content. Does that mean that "Ghosts" is a Norwegian form and "Thunderstorm" is a Chinese form? What is the difference between the forms of "Ghosts" and "Thunderstorm"?

I am clearly saying that we now need a national form, but people are talking to me about content—if you make bread from Chinese flour and tell the farmer that it is called a flatbread, he will still shake his head.

Because I believe that the failure of this form of spoken drama to be accepted by the broad masses is one of the reasons for the decline of drama today, I have provoked a gentleman who calls himself a layman to ridicule me thoroughly. He believes that drama was so prosperous during the War of Resistance, and today's low tide is entirely due to political reasons. He means that I am emphasizing the unimportant and neglecting the important. I have not denied the political reasons, but if everything is attributed to the objective environment and we stand idly by subjectively, I think it is not very right. If politics gets on the right track, will our form of spoken drama be completely accepted by the broad masses—especially the farmers? —In fact, this is already unnecessary to assume, we only hear that farmers welcome the yangko dance, but do not feel interested in spoken drama, is that not enough to illustrate?

Drama cannot leave the audience, everyone knows that. But to talk about the audience and ignore the vast number of farmers is unacceptable. I am very stubborn, I feel that to offer today's form of spoken drama to Chinese farmers is ultimately "a question."

It is very difficult to throw off the baggage of inheritance. I also know that the national form cannot be drawn with one stroke by anyone. Introspecting myself is only to encourage myself. This short article is of course not a defense or anything like that, and it is appropriate to attach a statement.

### Trivial Feelings on the Drama Festival

— Zhao Qingge

In the past, writing plays was a hobby, but recently I haven't written plays for a long time. In theory, I am not qualified to make random comments on this memorable Drama Festival today, but the editor kindly urged me to write a short article, and I couldn't refuse his kindness. Since I have a connection with drama, I might as well "indulge in elegance" a little bit. What I say may be wrong, and I hope that people in the drama circle will not take offense to the words of an outsider.

I have been associated with drama for ten years, and I can be said to know a little about the situation in the drama circle. There are satisfactory aspects, but there are also regrettable aspects. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the Drama Festival, I would like to offer two points of shallow views that I hope the drama circle will pay special attention to, and I hope that they can be considered.

(1) Regarding plays, no matter what kind of drama is performed, the scope of script selection is very narrow, either limited by sectarianism or limited to the works of professional playwrights of that professional theater group. And these playwrights cannot help but write for performance, or even write for making money (the so-called suitable for business). Their creative attitude is naturally impossible to be strict and serious, and the literary style can be imagined. This phenomenon has been common in recent years. Of course, this is also an inevitable transitional period under the high pressure of the entire economy, but I think this is not an absolutely insurmountable problem. The government's imposition of heavy taxes is also one of the contributing factors. Assuming that Chinese drama needs to make progress and compete with world drama, this is worth noting.

(2) Regarding theater people, on the surface, it is undeniable that theater people have close emotional and career connections and cooperation, but in their hearts, there may still be a considerable distance. This has a serious impact on the drama movement. This is about the attitude that living theater people should have towards living theater people. There is also the respect and remembrance that living theater people should have for dead theater people. Because today's drama can have this foundation, those dead theater people have their respective meritorious contributions, such as Zhu Shuangyun, Zuo Ming, Shen Shuofu, He Mengfu, Shi Chao, and Li Shifang, who recently died in a plane crash. They sacrificed for the War of Resistance, and it can also be said that they sacrificed for drama. After their death, there should not only be a superficial and vain memorial, but there seems to be a particular need for sympathy and assistance to their surviving families. This is not only a comfort to the spirits of the dead, but also an encouragement to the spirits of the living. However, these have been neglected by theater colleagues today, so I often feel chilled for those theater friends who "people die, feelings die"! I hope that the drama circle can pay close attention to this issue and find ways to make concrete expressions.

The above are rough words, written out of feeling. If there are any errors, I am willing to accept criticism.

### Money is Not Omnipotent; Cars Get Hungry Too

— Fang Wen

These past few days, the entire city of Shanghai has been shaken by the giant waves of soaring prices. Gold is like a horse with a loosened rein, white rice like a boat without mooring. All commodities are running and jumping wildly, rushing forward. Taking white rice alone, in just a few days, it has leapt from seventy thousand-plus to one hundred and forty thousand. Moreover, there is a market but no goods; to buy even a small amount, one must rely on personal connections and plead for favors, running around and exhausting oneself. "The people regard food as heaven," so what else can ordinary people do but tighten their belts?

Coincidentally, amidst the clamor about the rice shortage, Shanghai's cars are also experiencing a "fuel shortage." For days, dozens of cars with rumbling stomachs have been parked at various gas stations, forming a long, snake-like queue, waiting to be fed. Waiting one or two hours, they still can't get their fill, just like citizens waiting for rationed food during the occupied period—a pitiful sight!

Money is omnipotent! Science is omnipotent! The gentry and wealthy merchants of Shanghai, relying on the giant arms of money and science, were fearless. They never imagined that when faced with a shortage, the giant's arms would also fail! Therefore, this recent car fuel crisis seems to provide some enlightenment to Shanghai's gentry and wealthy merchants!

### "Please Help"

— Xiao Kangshi

As gold prices soared for days, affecting commodity prices, Mayor Wu, concerned about the people's livelihood, specially convened an emergency meeting at 4:00 PM on the 12th, gathering various trade associations related to daily necessities to discuss ways to curb soaring prices. During the meeting, he repeatedly said, "Everyone, please help. Otherwise, if I have to deal with a few of you, it would be too boring!" (See the 13th issue of this newspaper).

How "polite" and how "humorous" these words are from the mayor! Suppressing prices requires the leaders of various industries to "please help"—this precisely demonstrates the "hard work" of the rulers! But it is also a "painful cry"! However, the mayor also said: "If I have to deal with a few of you, it would be too boring!" These two sentences are just like what Shanghai people call "knowing what to think"!

But based on several past "cases," those with "backing" and "patrons" can still "swagger around" as usual. There's nothing you can do to them!

At the end of the meeting, the Mayor also hoped that "everyone should not have their minds full of gold." This sentence truly "hits the nail on the head"! From the high-ranking officials to the common people, who isn't dreaming of gold?

Whether the plea for help will be effective depends on whether you can really "deal with a few of them."

### Truman's Private Life

— Yu Qiang

Truman doesn't sleep in Lincoln's bed—a prized antique in the White House. He believes it might be considered presumptuous. He has his own bed, and every morning, when Washington is still snoring, he leaves it, full of energy.

He has four White House cars; the one he uses most often is a black Packard called "Mary Queen." He is an impatient traveler, so he prefers to fly in his four-engine G54 plane, "Sacred Cow," rather than take the train. He believes planes can fly in any weather, so last Christmas, despite the wind and snow, he flew back to Missouri to celebrate the holiday.

He sometimes also takes the presidential yacht "Williamsburg" for short trips on the Potomac River. These trips aren't exactly leisurely; he takes some work with him to do on the boat, but it allows him to escape the noisy telephone. Eighty miles from the White House, in Catoctin Mountain, Maryland, there is a rustic, isolated camp built for Roosevelt, called "Shangri-la."

The White House, where the Trumans live, is quieter than it was during President Coolidge's time. Truman rarely invites a prominent family, and there are no social activities. When he has guests at his table, they are mostly relatives visiting him from Missouri.

Truman's large glass and mahogany desk is a model of neatness compared to Roosevelt's cluttered desk. The chair next to Truman's desk is a newly designed one made of metal and blue leather.

On his desk, there is a telephone, a thermos, a small silk American flag, a small wooden donkey, and a small electric clock. His papers are neatly stacked, pressed under a blotter.

Behind the desk, there is a table with some family photos, and behind that is a large window with a view of the waving American flag and the presidential flag.

Roosevelt's stamp collection and tongs have disappeared from Truman's office, replaced by the new owner's collection of early airplane portraits. The room also contains a large glass case containing a model of the battleship "Missouri" and several photos of that battleship, as well as several photos of the battleship "Augusta," which took him to the Potsdam Conference, and three large metal airplane models.

"I'm asking you where are you calling from?"

"You say where are you calling from?"

"I want you to say where are you calling from!"

"Where I'm calling from is none of your business! Bastard!"

### Manjianghong

— Pingzhang

Commodity prices soar to the sky, when will the straight-line surge stop? Raising my eyes, I look up to the sky and shout: the "Yellow Peril" threatens! Gold and currency change several times a day, all things closely following the rise and fall; don't idly let the wind of soaring prices pass, only to feel empty and sad!

Black-hearted ghosts are not yet eradicated; when will the hatred of the poor be extinguished? To catch the profiteers, the traces are broken but Shanghai lacks! With lofty aspirations, I will eat the black-hearted flesh when hungry, and laughingly drink the silkworm blood when thirsty; waiting to stabilize great Shanghai from the beginning, the court and the people will rejoice!

### Here and Now

— Fang Wen

Sacrificing oneself for the country

A "democratic gimmick" of "selling dog meat under the pretense of selling lamb" was staged at the Quangong Building, with excitement on the spot.

Before national goods are promoted, fellow countrymen actually sacrifice themselves for the country!

Free from worldly affairs

Gold ascends to heaven like a Buddha, white rice hides from the world, doing nothing, despite the throwing, pressing, limiting, prohibiting, and making a fuss. One deity, one hermit, free from worldly affairs, leisurely and carefree.

The only culprit

Plane crashes injure people, planes smuggle gold, planes traffic drugs, planes engage in inappropriate acts. A series of social evils are all on the plane.

Today, the plane has almost become China's only culprit!

Forgetting Knowledge

A law student complained, he opposed the diploma system. Little does he know that only a diploma is a legitimate qualification.

Since he studies law, he has forgotten the most important knowledge in law, the crystallization of this knowledge is four words: "no legal basis".

I think he will never be outstanding when he graduates in the future.

Looking at the Invoice

For example, you buy a bottle of Remy Martin VSOP (whether this bottle of wine is good is another question), pay the money, and take back an invoice. The market price is different morning and night. Apart from this invoice, it is quite difficult to say its price.

A diploma is also like an invoice, stating how much youth and money you have paid (whether what is in your stomach is good Remy Martin is another question). What do you think? Do you think entering school to get a diploma is not a transaction?

Marathon

It's like a strange sports meeting: at the end of a 1,500-meter race there is a line. The athletes are exhausted and almost about to touch it, but suddenly it moves away, moving to 10,000 meters. So the athletes have to desperately rush forward again. Before rushing even halfway, it is suddenly announced that this race is a marathon.

This is the current price of goods, and we athletes can only faint on the spot and end it.

Changing Quality

Commodity prices are soaring, and expenditures are increasing sharply. But there is a good way to maintain the original expenditure amount.

For example, when the price of rice is 50,000, you spend 50,000 yuan to eat a dan of rice. When it is 100,000, you can buy five dou; when it is 200,000, you can buy two and a half dou to eat. And you always maintain an expenditure amount of 50,000. Or, you originally ate white rice, and as the price of rice soars all the way, you can change to eating second-grade white rice, good brown rice, second-grade brown rice—even chaff. Expenditures always remain the same.

But the Social Bureau is very helpful, and the cost of living index always increases every month, although not necessarily too much. If you are paying new based on the index, and living as above, it will be very cheap. Wouldn't your income increase sharply?
