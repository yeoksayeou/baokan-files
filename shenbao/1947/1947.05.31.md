### Chairman Leaves Nanjing by Plane to Inspect Military, Political, and Economic Situation in Shenyang; Sun Liren Flies from Shenyang to Changchun to Take Charge

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] Chairman Chiang departed Nanjing by plane at 10:50 AM on the 30th to inspect the military, political, and economic situation. Yu Chi-shih and others accompanied him.

[Our Newspaper Changchun, 30th] Sun Liren arrived in Changchun by special plane at 1:40 PM on the 30th to take charge. According to Sun, the Communist army's southward invasion has penetrated deep into northern Liaoning. Their forces are dispersed, and their supply lines are difficult, making a disastrous defeat possible at any time. Currently, there are minor skirmishes north of Kaiyuan and in southern Liaoning, but they will have no major impact. As for the Communist army's intentions, they are merely to plunder supplies, disrupt transportation, and conscript able-bodied men. They have no ambition to attack fortified cities. He stated that Changchun's situation is as important as Shenyang's. When asked whether he would inspect Jilin, he replied with a smile that it was possible.

[Our Newspaper Changchun, 30th] Army Commander Pan Yu-kun told reporters that he had not yet received an official report of the Eastern Mongolian Army (i.e., the old troops of Ma Zhanshan) occupying Harbin, but he believed it was highly possible.

### Legislative Yuan Appoints Nine Committee Members to Discuss Ways to Ease Student Unrest; Hu Shi Discusses the Student Movement in Peiping

[United Press, Peiping, 30th] Hu Shi, President of Peking University, told foreign reporters today that it would not be fair to say that the recent student movement was directed by the Communist Party. In any country, if there is dissatisfaction with the political system and there are no democratic means to express that dissatisfaction, young students often take on the responsibility of political movements. This general formula can be applied to all countries. China's history of over 2,000 years since the Han Dynasty shows that the student movement is in line with this formula, such as the Xinhai Revolution and the later National Revolution, which were both student movements. The situation in Europe is also the same. Since the establishment of the University of Paris, there has never been a political movement that was not led by students. The Russian Revolution was also started by students. Today's Britain and the United States are exceptions. Both countries have appropriate institutions to express public opinion, and young people can study and relax in peace without having to hold demonstrations to seek political reform. Students across the country are now planning to hold an anti-civil war parade on June 2nd. Peiping may be able to avoid clashes at that time, but there is also some danger. Today's student movement, strikes, and parades cannot achieve any resolution. Peace and war are both matters for both sides, and the issues are complex, which students do not seem to understand. If students believe that they should participate in politics, they should leave school and actively participate in the political arena.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] At the temporary meeting held by the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 30th to discuss the student unrest, the following two temporary motions were passed: (1) Proposed by Sun Jiulu and others, the general assembly would appoint a number of legislators to immediately study ways to ease the student unrest, go to the universities to persuade students to resume classes as soon as possible, and maintain contact with the Executive Yuan to urge the fair acceptance of student demands within a reasonable scope; Resolution: Chen Guyuan, Liu Kejun, Fu Tongxian, Jiang Shoushi, Lu Fu, Tan Tiwu, Sun Jiulu, Xia Taosheng, Sun Qu and other nine legislators were appointed to study methods of easing the situation immediately and start work. (2) Proposed by Chen Haicheng and others, it was suggested that local public opinion organs and professors should jointly persuade students to resume classes as soon as possible. At the same time, the government was advised to abolish the temporary measures to maintain social order at an appropriate time and to reform the political system. Resolution: Passed and submitted to the government. After the Legislative Yuan passed the above resolutions, Liu Kejun and other committee members held a discussion meeting that day to exchange opinions. They will meet with student representatives in the coming days to persuade them, listen to their opinions, and convey them to the government.

### Minister Zhu Responds to Student Unrest Issues at the Legislative Yuan

Encourage resumption of classes using educational methods

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] Zhu Jiahua replied to questions regarding student unrest at the temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 30th, stating: The causes of this student unrest are extremely complex. Insufficient funding and inadequate facilities in various schools have led to student unrest and vulnerability to external stimulation, and their actions have failed to follow the right path. Therefore, since before and after the outbreak of student unrest, the Ministry has been using educational methods to patiently guide them, hoping to eliminate it invisibly. Regarding the middle school and university entrance examinations, there are original systems. The official announcement of this year's entrance examination was issued in March. While various regions were preparing, the social situation was not very stable. It has been approved to postpone it for another year at the request of the educational bureaus of various provinces and cities. The university entrance examination was created during the War of Resistance. Last year and this year, due to restoration relations, schools have been handling it based on the actual situation. The establishment of the British University in Jinhua was a decision made at the National Education Post-War Restoration Conference based on the principle of balanced educational development. Most of the problems at Jiaotong University are based on rumors and misunderstandings. The main issue is the demand to restore the navigation and marine engineering departments, which is not suitable from the perspective of the school system. I approved their request in response to repeated requests from the local authorities in Shanghai. Regarding the public funding system and the public-funded students' demand to increase their benefits, the current public-funded students receive two dou and three sheng of rice, and the non-staple food allowance has been adjusted to 46,000 yuan per month. Based on the current rice price, student public funding has reached over 120,000 yuan per month (in areas such as Nanjing and Shanghai). If we must increase the non-staple food allowance to 100,000 yuan per month, it would not only be unsustainable for the national treasury but also unreasonable. I have dedicated myself to education for nearly 30 years. As you gentlemen said, I also participated in the youth movement in my early years and deeply understand student psychology. Therefore, since before and after the outbreak of the student unrest, I have always been protecting the youth and repeatedly sent important personnel from the Ministry to guide them. Since the outbreak of the student unrest, the Ministry has also frequently gathered the presidents of various schools and department heads to discuss and encourage students to cherish their studies and resume classes as soon as possible. All methods of persuasion have been exerted to the best of our ability. This is how we have dealt with it in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future, properly planning to quell it; however, young students should prioritize their studies during their studies. The government loves students, just like parents love their children, and should not be too indulgent. As for the difficulties students feel, the Ministry will do its best to resolve them within its capabilities. In the future, we will allocate more funds and seek further improvements, so that teachers can be content with teaching and students can be happy to graduate, and education across the country can progress in stability.

### Students at National Central University Sign Petitions Advocating Immediate Resumption of Classes

[Our Newspaper Peiping, 30th] The Railway College is scheduled to resume classes on June 2nd, and a joint council of professors, students, and alumni has been formed to organize a "Resumption Committee" and has elected seven members to continue to negotiate with the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, a general meeting of students from the Beiyang Engineering Department, originally scheduled to be held today to decide on the date for resuming classes, failed due to insufficient attendance.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 30th] Regarding the resumption of classes at Henan University, the opinions of students, professors, and the school administration are converging. The school administration discussed the resumption of classes on the afternoon of the 29th and decided that the Academic Affairs Office would notify the professors to resume classes immediately. The resumption of classes can be expected soon. More than 200 students from this year's graduating class have requested to take the exams on time on June 2nd (Monday) as scheduled, so there should be no problem with students resuming classes.

### Patriotic Protection of Education Movement in All Middle Schools in Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After the students of the Fifth Municipal Middle School launched a patriotic protection of education movement to "oppose strikes and fight for continued learning freedom," middle schools across the city responded, and more than 30 schools have joined, formally establishing the "Nanjing Patriotic Protection of Education Student Union" at Saoyemo on Qingliang Mountain on the 28th. On the 29th, they actively launched a publicity campaign, pointing out that this student unrest was an exposure of the conspiracy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League, and issued a declaration. On the 30th, more than 100 students from various schools rode in six trucks to conduct anti-strike publicity in the city, which received sympathy from the community. Furthermore, the association sent representatives to visit Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, at 6 PM to submit a letter to the Political Consultative Conference, proposing the following specific opinions: (A) Hopes for the government: (1) Establish a clean, honest, and efficient political style and resolutely punish corruption. (2) Be true to its word regarding various decisions and plans. (3) Immediately take thorough and effective measures to salvage the current economic crisis. (4) Strictly enforce laws and regulations to maintain social order and protect the safety of the people. (5) Openly suppress the rebel party that harms the country and the nation to reassure the people. (6) Value education and culture and increase funding. (B) Hopes for the Chinese Communist Party: (1) Quickly abandon the policy of violence, stop the so-called "three strikes and one tragedy." (2) Practice the slogan of "opposing civil war, stop the rebellion, and return the military to the country." (3) Give students, workers, and farmers quiet schools, factories, and villages. (4) Abandon cruel methods such as struggle, assassination, and liquidation and become a true political party. (5) Do not rape public opinion, engage in malicious slander, or make unfounded rumors in propaganda. (6) Stop all provocative and destructive political struggles. (7) Recognize that they are descendants of the Yellow Emperor.

### Discussions in the Legislative Yuan: Student Representative Attends as Observer

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Legislative Yuan held a temporary meeting on the morning of the 30th to discuss the student movement issue. President Sun concurrently presided. Over a hundred legislators attended. Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Lisheng, and Dong Xianjue were present to answer questions. A student representative also attended as an observer. Zhang Qun was absent due to other engagements. During the meeting, various legislators offered several constructive suggestions on how to handle the current student movement, hoping it could be guided properly. The closure of newspapers was also mentioned, and it was hoped that the ban could be lifted soon or that the case could be transferred from military to judicial authorities for legal proceedings.

The first legislator to speak today was Chen Guyuan, who, in addition to his role as a legislator, also teaches at Fudan University in Shanghai and is therefore very familiar with the truth of the student movement. Chen believes that the best way to handle the student movement is through guidance. He suggested three basic measures: (1) Emphasize the role of professors in providing guidance. Although professors may have different ideologies, they all have a sense of responsibility towards the country, and students trust them. This is more effective than if President Tian of the school were to come forward to provide guidance. (2) The government should invite relevant figures from various schools and knowledgeable individuals, such as senators and legislators, to go to the schools to provide guidance. (3) It is not against the law for students to be involved in politics. According to the constitution, citizens over the age of 23 have the right to be elected as legislators and supervisors. The government should allow students to participate in politics within legal boundaries.

### Inviting Reputable Figures to Offer Sincere and Open Guidance

The next speaker was Traditional Hsien, who is also a professor at St. John's University in Shanghai. Mr. Fu pointed out that student movements can be divided into three stages. Regarding future handling, in the passive aspect, the "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order" should be repealed. In the active aspect, it is best to replace pressure with guidance, and the government should invite reputable, impartial, and enlightened figures to engage in sincere and open discussions with the students. Lu Fu, a former member of parliament in the early Republic, pointed out that educational administration is different from other administrations. It should only be active and not passive. He hoped that the authorities would pay more attention to proactive actions in all future measures. As for the student movement issue, it is inevitable both in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. The key is to guide it according to the circumstances. Hasty and panicky actions will not help but will only increase disturbances. He hoped that the matter would be handled carefully and that the Zhujiang Road incident would not be repeated.

Zhong Tianxin pointed out sadly that this student movement has its political nature, but the students did not put forward anti-government slogans, which proves that they have not lost hope in the government and do not have much hope in the Communist Party either. Two points are worth considering when dealing with the student movement: (1) Reasonable non-political demands should be adopted. (2) For political demands, it is hoped that a delegation can be formed to go to the Communist-controlled areas to call for peace. If this can be achieved, it is the wish of the people of the whole country. If there are still no results, then who wants peace and who does not want peace will be clear to the world. Chen Ruyan also believes that the main reason for the student movement is politics, and hopes that the government can play the role of a revolutionary leader. Cheng Yuanzhen pointed out that there is an inseparable relationship between the National Government and the students, and that today's students are even more lovable than those of 20 years ago. Their legitimate demands should be met. Xia Taosheng and other Youth Party legislators believe that the most effective way to solve the current student movement is for all parties to withdraw from schools.

During the meeting, various legislators also raised questions about the closure of the three newspapers. From a legal point of view, Lu Fu believed that the authorities' handling of this matter needs to be reconsidered. Tan Tiwu asked why the newspapers were not warned before being closed. Chen Guyuan pointed out that the imposition of martial law in Shanghai should be ratified by the Legislative Yuan. Zhou Yizhi hoped that the matter could be changed from military to judicial handling.

Today, legislators spoke eloquently about the stories of Zhaojialou and Tiananmen that year, while the student representative, who was twenty years younger, sat to the left of Minister Zhu, a former leader of the student movement, and was questioned together. Although the atmosphere was serious, from a historical point of view, it was indeed an interesting contrast.

### People's Political Council Continues to Hold General Meeting Today to Review Peace Proposals Case of Absorbing Floating Capital at High Interest Rates Has Been Cancelled

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The People's Political Council will hold a general meeting starting on the 31st to begin discussing proposals. The review work was completed on the evening of the 30th, with all 455 cases reviewed. The special review committee for reviewing the peace issue and related proposals is scheduled to be held at 8 p.m. on the 31st. People's Political Council members who have not participated in the special review committee can freely participate in the review work. The agenda of the general meeting is scheduled for three days, from the 31st to June 2nd. Meetings will be held in the morning and afternoon of each day. The secretariat of the general meeting has notified all People's Political Council members on the 30th that if there are too many cases and they cannot be completed within the scheduled date, it may be extended.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] During the review meeting of the People's Political Council on the 30th, there was a heated debate when reviewing the case of absorbing floating capital at high interest rates. Qian Xin Zhi said: If the interest rate of the national bank is raised to more than 10%, then the black market interest rate may be higher than 20% or 30%. Moreover, with such interest on interest, the country's expenditure will increase, inflation will rise, and floating capital will definitely increase. Therefore, not only is the high-interest rate method not feasible, but the recent rumor of issuing high-tech short-term treasury bonds is also inappropriate. As a result, the case was rejected.

[United Press Nanjing, 30th] Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan told reporters today: "The government is willing to negotiate peace, provided that the Chinese Communist Party has sincerity: First, they should abandon the demand to restore the military status of January 13th last year and abolish the constitution. Second, they should agree to restore transportation. The improvement of the economic situation depends on the restoration of transportation. Even if the civil war does not stop, we still hope to restore transportation to reduce the economic crisis." Zhang also said that the traffic on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has almost been restored to the border of Hebei and Shandong, and the section in the hands of the Communist army will soon be controlled by the government. Although the CCP is taking a large-scale offensive in the Northeast, the situation is not very bad. As for whether the National Army will recover the points occupied by the Communist army, it is a matter of military strategy.

[Central News Agency, This City] Mr. Liang Shuming of the Democratic League came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. On the 30th, he told reporters that the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is essentially a cultural conflict. The root of politics lies in culture. Only when everyone has a fundamental understanding of the issue, deeply examines it, and abandons superficial and impetuous attitudes, will the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have the possibility of rapprochement. Liang also said that the People's Political Council's call for peace has failed. Liang is scheduled to return to Beijing tonight to attend the People's Political Council. On the 3rd, he will leave Beijing and return to Chongqing. He is currently engaged in writing the book "Characteristics of Chinese Culture," which will take five more months to complete.

### Rumors of Abolishing Foreign Exchange Controls Are Inaccurate Executive Yuan Holds Review Meeting Yesterday to Revise Organizational Regulations of the Foreign Exchange Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] A senior official of the Ministry of Finance said on the 30th: The rumor in Shanghai that foreign exchange controls will be abolished is completely inaccurate, because whether from the perspective of the domestic situation or other factors, now is not the time to abolish controls.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The review meeting of the Executive Yuan was held on the morning of the 30th, chaired by Zhang Qun. The meeting discussed the supply of rice and coal. Since the source of coal is still in the Northeast, and the situation in the Northeast is turbulent, the first step is to find ways to facilitate transportation to transport the coal stored in the Northeast to the Nanjing and Shanghai areas for supply. The rice issue also adopted the method of mutual exchange and unimpeded transportation. There is no fear of a shortage of coal and rice. In addition, the organizational regulations of the Foreign Exchange Review Committee were also revised.

### Xie Bingxin Speaks to Youth Corps Members About Impressions of Japan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Famous writer Ms. Xie Bingxin, recently returned from Japan to attend the Political Participation Council, spoke to over two thousand Youth Corps members at 7 p.m. on the 29th about her impressions of Japan. The main points were as follows:

Clothing, Food, and Housing are All Difficult

After arriving in Tokyo, I realized the extent of the war's destruction there was more than a thousand times worse than in Chongqing. After 8 p.m., it was difficult to see anyone on the streets. The housing shortage in Tokyo is currently severe. Original houses were either burned down, bombed, or left standing. The more orderly ones were requisitioned by the Allied forces. As a result, Japanese civilians often squeeze eight people into a small tatami room. Because some people live in the countryside, transportation is also a problem. People are often crushed to death on the subway. Food is very scarce. If you try to buy food at a restaurant, you probably will not succeed nine out of ten times. Speaking of clothing, the Japanese Emperor, when he appeared on May 3rd to accept the cheers of the people, was wearing a worn-out Western suit. Generally, professors and students wear tattered clothes. If they have a relatively decent pair of shoes, they only dare to wear them when meeting important guests.

Women Are Both Lovely and Sad

Japanese women are the most lovely, but also the most pitiable. They have no status in the family or in society and politics. Even the leading Japanese women's magazines, "Shufu no Tomo" (Housewife's Companion) and "Fujin Kōron" (Women's Public Opinion), are edited by men. Some female council members came to present me with flowers and fruit, accompanied by male council members. When I asked them something, the male council members answered on their behalf. I know a family where the husband studied in England and the wife studied in the United States, both studying politics. At home, they never exchange words about academic matters other than daily necessities. Under MacArthur's administration, the Japanese education system has been changed to a 6-6-4 system: six years of elementary school, six years of middle school, and four years of university. All universities are open to female applicants, but male students generally do not approve. This is different from China's May Fourth era, when women demanded equal access to education, and men were very enthusiastic about this movement.

Youth Are Innocent and Lively

The students are all innocent and lively. When I lectured at the National University in Xijing (i.e., Kyoto), I found that many of them spoke fluent Mandarin Chinese. It was difficult to distinguish whether they were Chinese or Japanese. Upon asking, I learned that they had never been to China; they had only studied Chinese language at a foreign language school for four years. American and British youth are now engaged in a correspondence movement with Japanese youth to establish good friendships. Japanese youth hope that Chinese youth can correspond with them more and exchange publications. I have talked to many professors who are not only knowledgeable but also very polite, listening attentively to your speech, very quietly and peacefully, even during meals. Perhaps this is because they eat a lot of fish, as fish are silent (loud applause throughout the venue).

Overseas Chinese Are Treated Well

The treatment of overseas Chinese in Japan now is certainly better than before the war. Many rations are given preferentially. The Chinese military delegation stationed in Japan has a larger site than the embassy in any other country. It is divided into four groups: military, political, economic, educational, and cultural. There are over one hundred people working, and the total number, including family members and workers, is over two hundred. They live together as an organic whole, and everyone is happy and loving. The house we live in is large, with a large auditorium. It is also very convenient for us to go anywhere, with cars and jeeps at our disposal.

Lack of Capable Leaders

I believe the reason Japan has reached this point is the lack of a capable leader. We, on the other hand, should now use the power of love to care for them, just as we would forgive a younger brother who has done something wrong. Forgive them, because after all, China and Japan share the same script and ethnicity. Those who have a bit of sense admire and appreciate China.

Moving Towards Democratic Revival

Many people are afraid of Japan's revival, which is wrong. What we should fear is our own failure to revive. Although Japan has suffered major wounds from the war, and lacks basic necessities such as alkali, sugar, oil, and salt, it is nevertheless gradually moving towards democracy and revival under MacArthur's support. Looking back at ourselves, I feel extremely pained.

Transportation is so difficult that I may not return to China for another year or two. I hope that China will be a democratic, unified, prosperous, and happy country by then.

### Nanchang Newspapers Resume Publication Today

[Our Nanchang dispatch, 30th] With a 90% increase in printing worker wages, newspapers will resume publication tomorrow.

### Letter

Having read the Wuxi dispatch in the news column on page 2 of your esteemed newspaper on May 27th, regarding the embezzlement case in the DangKou district granary, I have verified that the warehouse director of Daqiangmen warehouse is not Zang Zonghuang, nor has there been any adulteration with mud and sand. I have also not reported to the county government. I fear that the rumors are inaccurate, and I hereby send this letter to correct them. Yang Zhaobo, May 28th.

According to a telegram from our Nantong correspondent: In the telegram "Eligible Draftees in the Subei Eastern Military District Granted Deferment" sent on the 6th (published on the 27th, page 2), the phrase "all eligible men..." should include the phrase "eligible under the various clauses of Article 26 of the Military Service Law". We hereby issue this correction.

Editorial

### The Consequences of "Unfreezing" the Cost of Living Index

The "unfreezing" of the cost of living index, which has been anticipated by all parties, was announced yesterday by the city's Cost of Living Index Review Committee. The total worker index for this month in the city is 23,534 times, calculated as 23,500 times. The total employee index is 16,357 times, calculated as 16,400 times. These figures are nearly three times higher compared to the January worker index of 7,946 times and the employee index of 6,614 times. Of course, we are not surprised. In these short three months, due to the rise in general prices, the multiple of the cost of living index will have such an increase. What worries us is that, on the one hand, the announcement of this figure indicates that the effects of inflation will worsen, and the national economic crisis will deepen. On the other hand, the "unfreezing" of the cost of living index will be used as a standard for general wage calculation, making it impossible for industrial and commercial enterprises to bear the burden, causing them to further decline, and bringing the national economy to the brink of bankruptcy. The result of this may lead to greater insecurity in the lives of the general population!

Originally, the announcement of the cost of living index did not have a serious impact on the lives of the general population. As a result of inflation, the rise in prices and the decline in currency value are constantly progressing. Those who depend on wages or salaries for a living find it insufficient to sustain themselves if their wages or salaries remain fixed while prices continue to rise. With the daily increase in living expenses, the standard of living can only decline. However, the decline in the standard of living has its limits, while the increase in living expenses, under inflation, has no end. Under these circumstances, using the cost of living index as a standard for calculating wages or salaries is justified. In February of this year, drastic fluctuations swept across various city markets. The government announced an emergency economic measures plan to save the serious crisis of the national economy, which was unavoidable for the government. In this emergency economic measures plan, there was a provision to "freeze" the cost of living index; wages and salaries should no longer be based on the monthly cost of living index, and the monthly cost of living index should no longer be announced. Instead, the January cost of living index would be used as the standard for wages and salaries, with the provision to issue necessary goods or differential payments based on price conditions. The effectiveness of this method hinges on whether the government can control price fluctuations and prevent them from rising wildly. The purpose of "freezing" the cost of living index was to stabilize prices. In this sense, we welcome the promulgation of this emergency measures plan. However, the causes of price fluctuations are not simple; relying solely on the "freezing" of the cost of living index cannot stabilize prices. In the past three months, they have become even more rampant. Under these circumstances, we cannot but sympathize with the demand to "unfreeze" the cost of living index.

Now the cost of living index is "unfrozen"; the increase in its figure has reached threefold in just three months. This means that employers who pay wages and salaries based on the cost of living index will bear a burden that is three times heavier. However, during the same period, their ability to bear the burden has not increased equally by three times. This heavy burden will make it impossible for them to bear it, bringing their businesses to the brink of bankruptcy. As a result, not only will the lives of employees not be protected, but the national economy will be in even more serious crisis. If the chicken is gone, how can there be eggs? Moreover, if general prices cannot be controlled, the multiple of the cost of living index will inevitably increase, while the employer's income will never catch up with the multiple increase in the cost of living index. What can result from this other than "bankruptcy"? Although the government has regulations for discounts on wages paid according to the cost of living index, in light of the sharp increase in the index, the employer's burden is still not reduced by much. If this situation continues to evolve, it will destroy the existing foundation of the national economy; we are really worried!

Originally, wages and salaries are an agreement between employers and employees. Under inflation, price changes are inevitable; how to have changes in wages and salaries based on price changes is a matter between employers and employees. If the government orders employers to pay wages and salaries based on the cost of living index, the necessary condition is that the government has the ability and confidence to control price changes, so that the cost of living index can become stable. If the government cannot control prices, it cannot force employers to bear the negative consequences of inflation. Furthermore, if the government has a policy of paying wages and salaries according to the cost of living index, it must also supplement it with a subsidy policy to reduce the employer's burden. Otherwise, if the employer's ability is not taken into account, the future of the national economy is really worrying. We hope that the government can have wise measures to resolve this unprecedented crisis.

### The Aims and Purposes of Establishing This School

— Zhou Zhaoshao

Education is the foundation of a nation. The intelligence and ignorance, good and evil of the people, the prosperity and decline, rise and fall of the nation, all depend on the universality of education. Its importance goes without saying. Our nation's education has always been considered backward. Schools cannot reach all areas, resulting in a knowledge panic and a large number of illiterate people, especially women. Often, when ten people gather, none of them are literate. If we do not urgently seek remedies, the nation's future is truly unthinkable! The establishment of this school is precisely to meet the needs of the times, to increase the knowledge and skills of adult women who have missed education. I will briefly describe the aims and purposes of the establishment below:

(1) To Seek Opportunities for Remedial Education for Women Who Have Missed Education. Adult women who have missed education feel the inconvenience of lacking knowledge and skills. Although they aspire to seek knowledge and progress, they have no suitable school. Entering elementary school is difficult because they do not want to be with children, and entering middle school is difficult because their level is insufficient. Moreover, elementary and middle schools are full-day classes with many subjects, which does not seem suitable for women's environment and needs. Although remedial schools and public schools have been established in various parts of the country, they are either limited by time, hindering their family work, or their teaching materials are inappropriate, failing to meet their actual needs, or their facilities are simple, reducing their interest in learning, causing them to hesitate to move forward. This is not only a regrettable matter for women themselves but also affects the improvement of family and society. This school aims to remedy this defect. Therefore, it takes a different approach, slightly changing the system. Its facilities are different from ordinary remedial schools. The time can be chosen at will, and the subjects are not limited. Knowledge and skills are chosen according to needs to cater to women's environment, needs, and interests, so that adult women who have missed education can happily come to learn. This is one of the aims and purposes of the establishment of this school.

(2) To Seek Opportunities for Working Women to Learn Skills. Although gender equality has long been recognized in law, there is still a difference in reality. Taking employment as an example, only a small number of women can serve society. The reason for this is the lack of knowledge and skills. Women's studies have greater fluidity and often cannot last long. Therefore, only a few can receive complete education. Those who drop out of elementary and middle school without graduating and those who have never entered school are numerous. It is extremely difficult for them to establish themselves in society without relevant occupations. Therefore, this school has specially set up vocational subjects for women to learn a skill to achieve economic independence and not become appendages of men. This is the second aim and purpose of the establishment of this school.

(3) To Seek Opportunities for Housewives to Learn Common Sense of Housework. "Only when the family is in order can the state be governed" is an ancient saying. Therefore, whether the family is sound is sufficient to affect the governance and chaos of society and the country. Women are the pillars of the family, and their lives are tied to the lifeline of the whole family, their responsibilities being enormous. Everything from helping their husbands and teaching their children, sweeping and answering, cooking and tailoring, and handling miscellaneous affairs, large and small, all depend on the virtuous and wise housewife to manage, so that a harmonious and happy family can be created. However, such work is trivial and heavy. Without rich common sense and experience, it is difficult to cope with it. The saying "learn to be a woman before marrying" is wise! Therefore, this school has specially compiled and selected teaching materials on common sense of housework to instill various knowledge and skills in daily life. It also deeply understands the importance of maternal education, which is related to the future of children. It specially teaches methods of disciplining children and the psychology of children so that they can become models of virtuous wives and good mothers after graduation. This is the third aim and purpose of the establishment of this school.

In addition, after the school was opened, many female students preparing to enter higher education came to take remedial classes. Therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned aims and purposes, tutoring for female students preparing to enter higher education has also become one of the aims and purposes of the establishment of this school. In summary, this school is set up for adult women who have missed education, working women, and female students preparing to enter higher education. Its purpose is to teach women the knowledge, skills, and character needed in modern life, so that they can manage household affairs and serve society, so that all women in the country can give full play to their inherent talents to shoulder the great mission of building a new China.

### Brief History

— Editor

Shanghai Women's Remedial School was founded in August 1932, and it has been fifteen years since then. The founder, Zhou Zhaoshao, after graduating from the Department of Social Education of the College of Education of Great China University, served as the director of education at the Zhenjiang Public Education Center in Jiangsu Province and the director of the experimental public school attached to the Experimental Public Education School in Zhejiang Province. Based on his many years of research in social education, and in view of the fact that adult women in our country who have missed education have no opportunity to receive education, they cannot serve society to seek equality in employment for men and women, nor can they be good at managing their households to seek happiness in family life. Therefore, he rented No. 22 Yuanchang Lane, Hualong Road, Shanghai as a school building to establish this school, pioneering women's remedial education in our country. The founder himself served concurrently as the principal. On November 16 of the same year, he submitted a request to the Shanghai Education Bureau, which was approved for registration under Instruction No. 2395.

In July 1933, to promote the development of school affairs, Liu Wangliming, Wang Xiaoying, Jiang Wenyu, Zhou Feicheng, Chen Gongsu, Chen Heqin, Ma Zongrong (deceased), Gao Jianji (deceased), Cheng Junying, Zhang Yaoxiang, Dong Renjian, Zheng Tonghe, Pan Wenan, and Ou Yuanhuai were invited to serve as consultants to answer questions and fill in omissions.

In August 1934, in view of the vast area of Shanghai and to facilitate students' remedial studies nearby, the Jing'an Temple branch was added at No. 138 Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai. In the spring of 1935, the main school moved to a new building at No. 54 Hualong Road due to insufficient space in the original school building. In the autumn of 1936, the Jing'an Temple branch was reorganized into the First Branch and moved to No. 26 Difeng Road. In the spring of 1937, the Second Branch was added at No. 630 and 632 Baike Road. Wang Xiaolai and Yu Qingtang were also hired as consultants. Soon, the main school was renamed the First School, the First Branch was renamed the Second School, and the Second Branch was renamed the Third School. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the Second School was forced to close due to its location, and the Third School was promoted to the Second School.

Since 1938, the war has moved inland, and the number of residents in Shanghai has increased sharply. The school has a slight reputation, and the number of students has increased year by year, and the internal facilities have become increasingly complete. All aspects of the curriculum, the distribution of time, the teaching methods, and the selection of teaching materials all consider the practical needs of women and the convenience of learning, and constantly research and strive for improvement.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in August 1945, according to the order of the Shanghai Education Bureau, the procedures for re-registration were carried out. Therefore, the board of directors was organized, and Tian Dazhi, Tao Xinqiao, Gu Yingchuan, Wu Gusheng, Wu Yizhi, He Zemin, Zhou Zhaoshao and others were responsible for handling the registration procedures, which were approved in February 1947. In April of this year, No. 17 Dielai New Village, Jing'an Temple Road, was rented to restore the Third School, so as to facilitate the schooling of women who had missed education in the west of Shanghai. It has now been renovated and started enrollment. It is scheduled to open on June 4 at the same time as the First School and the Second School.

In the past fifteen years, a total of 35,338 students have come to study, with 58,593 students in total, divided by subject. After teaching and edification, they can all share the responsibilities of society and family. However, the elimination of illiteracy among women and the supplementation of knowledge and skills still depend on the development of women's remedial education. Therefore, in the future, we not only want to make the framework more solid, but also strive to make the school flourish.

### School Song

— Zhang Lunqing

Is the rise and fall of the world the responsibility of every man?

Pity our female compatriots, most of whom are illiterate! Do you also know that learning can cure ignorance, but you are addicted to pleasure, driven by poverty and hunger!

The phenomenon is like this! How can we talk about equality between men and women, the future of the country! Although the eastern corner is lost, there are mulberries and elms to be harvested!

I wish my peers to use the remaining time, knowledge and skills, each take what they need! Accumulate over time! Is it just a small supplement?

The soil can become Mount Tai, and drops of water can become rivers and lakes! Strive! Strive! Now I overcome myself because of my past.

### General Overview of Our School

— He Zemin

Since the term "Adult Education" was introduced from the East, many contemporary figures have been eager to catch up and engage in it. However, due to its initial stage, biases were unavoidable, leading to the neglect of adult illiterate women. Mr. Zhou Zhenshao, the founder and principal of our school, recognizing this deficiency, took the lead in establishing a women's supplementary school, aiming to fill the gap in our national education system. From the very beginning, the path was fraught with challenges, and the operations were arduous. Eventually, thanks to the guidance of enlightened members of society and the effective management of Principal Zhou, the school was able to achieve its current scale. As we approach the fifteenth anniversary of the school, I am presenting an overview of our school to seek corrections from the nation.

I. Organization and Structure For the purpose of adapting to practical needs and enhancing administrative efficiency, the organization of our school strives for simplicity, ensuring that each task has a dedicated responsibility and each individual performs their duty. The principal, following the decisions of the Board of Directors, has full authority to handle school affairs. Under the principal, there is a secretary, followed by five sections: Documentation, Accounting, General Affairs, Academics, and Library. Each section has one to two officers. All administrative matters within the school are discussed in school affairs meetings attended by all staff members; matters related to teaching and guidance are discussed in teaching and guidance meetings attended by all faculty members. In addition, there are subject-specific teaching research groups to improve teaching in each subject.

The structure of academic levels in our school differs from that of ordinary schools due to the difference in nature. In terms of subjects, there are Chinese, English, Mathematics, Stenography, Typing, Home Economics, and Music. In terms of time, there are morning, afternoon, and evening classes. In terms of level, it ranges from beginner to advanced. In terms of teaching methods, there are class-based teaching, mixed-level teaching, and individualized teaching. Based on the convenience and needs of the enrollees, subjects and times can be freely selected.

II. Overview of Teaching and Guidance Education is a tool for improving life, and the school's role for students is not only to enlighten them with knowledge but also to guide and improve their overall lives. The student body of our school comes from diverse backgrounds, and most are adult women, so there are no established rules to follow for teaching and guidance, and we must explore alternative approaches. Teaching facilities are based on the students' psychology and needs, and to promote teaching efficiency, we adopt a teaching and guidance integration system, so that the responsibility of guidance extends to all teachers, and students' intelligence, thinking, and character can be developed simultaneously. The teaching and guidance overview is listed separately below:

A. Teaching and Guidance Goals: To provide a consistent and concrete plan for teaching and guidance, our school has formulated ten major teaching and guidance goals based on the educational purpose of the Republic of China as a guideline for implementation:

(1) Enrich women's practical knowledge (2) Enhance women's productive skills (3) Cultivate women's good character (4) Develop women's industrious habits (5) Promote women's physical exercise (6) Improve women's leisure entertainment (7) Guide women's homemaking experiences (8) Train women's group living (9) Stimulate women's service interests (10) Inspire women's patriotic thought

B. Teaching and Guidance Principles: (1) Based on the characteristics of women's psychology and physiology (2) Focus on the guidance and effectiveness of adult learning (3) Suitable for the allocation and utilization of learning time (4) Observe the purpose and needs of students' further study (5) Refer to the principles and methods of general teaching

C. Teaching Methods: Because our school is special in nature, the teaching methods are interesting, active, and improving, with the principle of inspiring students' self-learning. Therefore, they vary depending on the subject and differ according to the individual, with no fixed method to follow. Teachers constantly research and improve based on their practical teaching experience. The teaching methods are divided into three types:

(1) Class Teaching This is the most common teaching method, which involves gathering students of the same level and teaching them with the same teaching materials.

(2) Mixed-Level Teaching Our school generally uses class teaching for various subjects, but when the number of students in a certain subject is too small, mixed-level teaching is used to remedy the situation.

(3) Individualized Teaching All technical subjects generally use individualized teaching. Our school hires specialized talent to serve as teachers, so that students can apply what they learn.

D. Key Points of Guidance: The guidance affairs of our school adopt a tutor system, in which teachers of each subject provide guidance directly or indirectly based on the key points of guidance. The implementation method is to first inspire students' good motives to change old habits in women's lives. Teachers lead by example, pay attention to the influence of personality, and use positive suggestion methods to subtly influence students. The key points of guidance are as follows: 1. Civic Training: (1) Health: Healthy body and happy mind (2) Agility: Alert and agile, quick in action (3) Precision: Careful thinking, clear discernment, precise judgment (4) Humility: Humble attitude, kind to others (5) Honesty: Trustworthy and reliable, realistic and pragmatic (6) Compassion: Filial piety and love for children, love for people and things (7) Diligence and Thrift: Hardworking and enduring, thrifty and frugal (8) Politeness: Polite in words and deeds, elegant in manner (9) Responsibility: Responsible service, never shirking (10) Enterprise: Progressive thinking, continuous improvement (11) Courage: Bold and careful, unafraid of difficulties and dangers (12) Enthusiasm: Chivalrous and righteous, helping the weak and supporting the poor (13) Sociability: United as one, united in purpose (14) Justice: Upholding justice, not seeking personal gain (15) Law-Abiding: Obeying regulations, abiding by laws (16) Patriotism: Sacrificing the individual, protecting the country and the people 2. Vocational Training: (1) The meaning of vocation (2) The analysis of vocation (3) The choice of vocation (4) The preparation of vocation (5) The cultivation of vocation (6) The effectiveness of vocation (7) The adjustment of vocation (8) The improvement of vocation (9) The success of vocation 3. Home Affairs Training: (1) The Function and Importance of the Family (2) The Responsibilities and Cultivation of the Housewife (3) Economic Management and Record Keeping (4) Clothing Tailoring and Preservation (5) Food Selection and Nutrition (6) Residence Sanitation and Arrangement (7) The Life and Care of the Sick (8) The Education and Management of Children (9) Family Health and Entertainment.

III. Curriculum and Teaching Materials The subjects offered by our school have special characteristics, so the curriculum content is different from that of ordinary schools. The Chinese language course is divided into six levels and includes Mandarin conversation. The curriculum includes readers, correspondence, general knowledge, applied writing, conversation, and calligraphy. The English language course is divided into five levels, with readers, grammar, conversation, correspondence, and calligraphy. The mathematics course is divided into five levels, with arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and spherical trigonometry. The bookkeeping course is divided into two levels, elementary commercial bookkeeping and advanced commercial bookkeeping. The typing course is divided into English typing and Chinese typing. The home economics course includes sewing, embroidery, and knitting, teaching clothing tailoring and sewing methods, machine embroidery methods, and wool knitting methods. The music course includes piano, harmonica, singing, and Peking opera, teaching piano and harmonica playing methods, various songs, and Peking opera, etc.

Selecting teaching materials is the most difficult aspect of supplementary schools. Most textbooks published on the market are not suitable for supplementary schools, either because the content is not appropriate or because the amount of teaching material is too large. Therefore, our school has formulated curriculum standards and compiled and printed our own teaching materials accordingly. The principles of compilation and selection focus on adapting to the psychology and needs of adult women in their lives, and each reprint is based on the opinions of the teachers, with additions and deletions to strive for continuous improvement. Practice has proven this approach to be very effective.

IV. Extracurricular Activities To increase students' knowledge and interest in learning, we cannot limit ourselves to the fixed scope of books. Extracurricular activities are also important. Based on the knowledge, skills, physical and mental health of the students, our school organizes various activities outside of class so that students can have proper entertainment and work in their leisure time and develop good habits. The methods are divided into regular and irregular types, which are briefly described below:

(1) Regular: Regarding various academic and artistic competitions, the school stipulates the date, items, and methods at the beginning of each semester and holds them in sequence. In advance, the responsible teachers are responsible for guiding and practicing, and select the best to participate. Those who win the competition are given certificates and prizes to encourage them. The types of competitions include: Calligraphy, composition, general knowledge, literacy, rapid calculation, Chinese and English recitation, current affairs, dictionary checking, home economics, speech, singing, piano performance, Peking opera, etc.

(2) Irregular: The school has a library and entertainment room, where students can freely read books and newspapers after class and participate in various entertainment activities. Teachers also lead and organize sightseeing tours, women's issues research associations, etc., and participate in group gatherings outside the school.

In addition, each subject offered by our school has regular extracurricular assignments, which also fall within the scope of extracurricular activities. The Chinese language course has copying books, composing essays, making sentences, writing diaries, taking notes, and writing large and small regular scripts. The English language course has copying books, making sentences, translating, composing essays, and practicing writing. The exercises for the mathematics and bookkeeping courses are also mostly practiced outside of class. Although each subject has only one hour of class per day, the time spent on extracurricular assignments is more than one hour. The school's emphasis on extracurricular assignments has greatly benefited the students.

The overview of our school is roughly as described above. However, the internal rules and regulations and various records for the past fifteen years cannot be fully recorded due to space limitations. We are now planning to organize and compile them into a booklet and publish them for the reference of those who are concerned about women's supplementary education.

Statistics of Students in Various Subjects Over the Years

### British Foreign Secretary Bevin Delivers Speech, Reviews the Overall World Situation, and Says that the Handling of Far East Issues Requires Utmost Care

[Reuters, The Hague, 29th Dispatch] After listening to Foreign Secretary Bevin's 75-minute speech, the Labor Party Congress rejected, by a majority vote, all motions opposing Bevin's foreign policy. Bevin's speech began by stating Britain's position on the Far East peace treaty issue, demanding that the Potsdam method no longer be used in discussing the peace treaty with Japan, and that all eleven countries that had fought against Japan participate from the beginning to the conclusion of the treaty. Referring to the Far East situation, Bevin said that the danger in the Far East was no less than that in Europe. China had fallen into the pain of civil war, and Korea was an extremely dangerous point. He said that the situations in India, Burma, and the Dutch East Indies were also in turmoil. In short, Asia was undergoing major changes and needed to be handled with utmost care.

Bevin then addressed the Middle East issue, saying that we should bear a major responsibility for the establishment of independent Arab states there. The area has oil resources, and our policy is not limited to oil interests. We should encourage the social and economic development of the region.

He also discussed the German issue, saying that the recent agreement to establish an economic committee in the British and American zones of Germany was by no means intended to create a final division of Germany. It was only because other countries refused to unify the entire German economy that Britain and the United States had to take this temporary step. Regarding the Greek issue, he said that he would not apologize for Britain's intervention there. The civil war had broken out there, but Britain would not participate in its civil war. He felt that the most dangerous thing was the participation of powerful countries in the civil wars of small countries, which often led to major wars. After Britain withdrew from Greece, the United States would take over its responsibilities.

Finally, he said that at the beginning of his tenure, he had said that anyone who expected him to achieve significant results in four or five years would be disappointed, because the world had become fragmented, and the future was full of difficulties. Therefore, he had to maintain a patient attitude, hoping that the countries that had been negotiating since November of this year could finally reach an agreement.

### Soviet Union Asks Britain for a Loan of 50 Million Pounds; British-Soviet Trade Negotiations to Resume

[Reuters, London, 29th Dispatch] Authoritative sources say that the Soviet Union has asked Britain for a credit loan of 50 million pounds, with an annual interest rate of 1.5%, to be repaid in 15 years. The Soviet Union also told Britain that before any new British-Soviet trade agreement is signed, Britain must accept this loan request. It is said that the British government is still studying this proposal.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th Dispatch] Officials here recently said that British-Soviet trade negotiations will soon resume, which will greatly improve the political relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. However, the first problem to be solved in the trade negotiations is the conditions for the British loan to the Soviet Union to purchase British exports. It is said that the Soviet Union has proposed the following three conditions: (1) Installment repayment; (2) Reduce the interest rate to 0.5%; (3) Extend the installment repayment period to 16 years. All three of these are unacceptable to Britain. According to reports, Britain has announced that it cannot provide commercial loans to any foreign country. However, because Britain urgently needs Soviet wheat and timber, it has no choice but to lend to the Soviet Union.

### U.S. Army Budget Reduced by More Than 400 Million Dollars

[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Although U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson warned that cutting military spending would weaken the post-war army's strength, the House Appropriations Committee today still reduced the army's 1948 budget by $475,800,977, or 8.3%. President Truman's Budget Bureau and national military leaders had requested $5,716,679,105 to strengthen the foundation of the U.S. Army, but now that it has been reduced by nearly $500 million, Patterson believes that the air force and the occupying forces will be particularly affected.

### Eisenhower Warns of Danger of U.S. Being Attacked

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th Dispatch] The U.S. House Appropriations Committee today discussed the military spending stipulated by President Truman for next year's budget. Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower was present to present his views, requesting the Appropriations Committee to approve it in its entirety. He said that the United States is extremely vulnerable to a sudden air strike and could be miserably defeated in a matter of hours. He deeply believes that if the United States cannot make its victory in World War II a safe victory, then what will follow will be a nightmare of death, terror, and destruction that no one has ever dreamed of. If a major war breaks out again in the world, the first to be attacked will not be Warsaw but Washington, not London but Los Angeles, and perhaps not even Pearl Harbor but Pittsburgh.

### Atomic Energy Commission Subcommittee Passes Soviet Resolution

Atomic Control Subject to Security Council Control

[United Press, Lake Success, 30th Dispatch] The United States and the Soviet Union are on the verge of a showdown over the issue of whether the veto power should be used to control the use of atomic energy. The issue of contention between the two sides is whether all control work in the atomic field should be subject to the veto power of the major powers in the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet Union today obtained a small resolution in the Standing Subcommittee of the Atomic Energy Commission of the United Nations, which has given the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union a preliminary form. The resolution proposed by the Soviet Union reaffirms the resolution of the General Assembly, that any international atomic control measures should work within the scope of the Security Council. This proposal has been unanimously approved by the Executive Subcommittee of the Commission. Although U.S. Deputy Representative Osborne voted in favor, he repeatedly emphasized that if this proposal is passed, the Soviet Union can demand that atomic control work be subject to the veto power. Osborne proposed an amendment, strongly advocating that a clause be inserted in the Soviet resolution stipulating that this proposal "in no way modifies the Committee's initial report," but his wish was not fulfilled. The debate on the veto power issue is scheduled to begin next week. The United States, Britain, and Canada all firmly believe that those who would destroy the atomic treaty must not be given a legal way to escape, so the use of the veto power must not be allowed in atomic control matters.

### U.S.-Soviet Joint Committee in a Standoff

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 29th Dispatch] According to responsible sources, the U.S.-Soviet Joint Committee discussed the issue of allowing Korean political parties to be present to present their views in the afternoon today. They could not agree on how many political parties should be allowed to present their views, resulting in a stalemate. The Soviet delegation proposed a limit of 30 political parties, saying that it would be almost impossible to solicit the opinions of all Korean political parties, because there are 180 political parties in the U.S. occupation zone alone. To save time, the U.S. representative also agreed to limit the number of political parties presenting their views, but believed that the number of 30 political parties was too small. The United States believes that a small number of political parties presenting their views would only benefit the left-wing parties, because there are fewer left-wing parties. For example, the Communist Party is the only political party in the Soviet occupation zone.

### Our Government Closely Watches the Future Development of the Japanese Political Situation; Katayama's Cabinet Formation Work to Be Completed Soon

[New Asia News Agency, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Since the decision to have Socialist Party leader Katayama responsible for forming a cabinet in Japan, our government authorities have not made any formal statements, but are closely watching the progress of his cabinet formation. According to the impressions obtained by our agency's reporters from interviewing some people in the Political Participation Council who are concerned about Japanese issues, they all seem to have expectations for the success of the Socialist Party's cabinet formation, because the left wing of the Socialist Party has already broken ties with the Communist Party, and its right wing is more progressive than the members of the Liberal and Democratic Parties. Also, unlike some members of the Liberal and Democratic Parties, they have not been able to eradicate the militarist and aggressive thinking. According to a Nationalist Party expert on Far East issues, the reason why the Liberal Party refused to participate in the four-party coalition cabinet led by the Socialist Party is not so much because it truly opposes the left wing of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, but rather because it intends to use the anti-communist banner to ingratiate itself with the United States, in order to allow the party to rise again and come to power in the future, and to deceive the United States into providing aid to Japan. The Japanese Communist Party is different from the Chinese Communist Party. It has no armed forces, and it is difficult to launch riots and strikes under the control of the Allied forces.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio, upon learning of the Democratic Party's decision to participate in the Katayama cabinet at the afternoon's 6:00 p.m. meeting, released a statement that "when the Democratic Party's attitude is finally decided, the cabinet formation meeting of the Democratic, National Cooperative, and Socialist parties can be convened." From tonight, the work of selecting cabinet members will be carried out. After new candidates are put forward by each party, Prime Minister Katayama's opinions will be sought first, and then a meeting of the three party leaders will be held to make a decision. The procedures for reviewing the qualifications of cabinet members will be completed on the 31st, and the cabinet appointment ceremony is scheduled for the first day of next month.

### India Demands Compensation from Japan

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, "The Indian government is dissatisfied with the allocation ratios of various compensations in the Far East Commission Compensation Subcommittee. On the 29th, it officially made a request, stating that India should receive 18% of the total amount of compensation."

### Japanese Business Community Opposes Using Products as Compensation

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Recently, some people in the Japanese business community have opposed the Far East Commission Compensation Subcommittee's decision to use Japanese products as compensation. The reason they have given is that this method is sufficient to increase the inflation rate in Japan. Their purpose is still to use foreign resources obtained from future foreign trade of products to rebuild Japan's factory equipment that has been dismantled due to compensation.

### The Netherlands Presents Five Points of Proposals to Indonesia

Reply Required Within Two Weeks

[United Press, The Hague, 29th Dispatch] Dutch authorities announced today that the Dutch plenipotentiary has presented a note to the Republic of Indonesia, proposing five points and requesting a "satisfactory reply" within two weeks, ending June 10. The purpose of the proposals is to end the stalemate between the two sides on the future of the Dutch East Indies. If a satisfactory reply cannot be obtained, the Dutch plenipotentiary will be unable to implement past agreements and will refer the disputed matter to the Dutch government for consideration. The five proposals are as follows: (1) Reorganize the Indonesian government to become the central organ of the future island federation, and establish various institutions to cooperate with the highest Dutch authorities. (2) Resolve foreign relations and prepare for the establishment of foreign services for the future United States of Indonesia. (3) Establish military cooperation to completely stop conflicts and reduce troops. (4) Resolve the most important economic issues, namely foreign trade, transportation, currency regulations, supply of goods, and the restoration of property rights of non-Indonesians in Indonesia. (5) Resolve the relationship between the Republic of Indonesia and other parts of Indonesia that do not belong to it, and seek cooperation.

### Papen Beaten in Prison

[Reuters, Munich, 29th Dispatch] Former Hitler diplomat Papen, who was sentenced to eight years in prison, was beaten in prison by another inmate, and his nose and jaw were broken.

### U.S. Foreign Relief Bill to Be Implemented Next Week, Marshall Announces at Press Conference

[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall announced at a press conference today that the United States will begin shipping food and other relief supplies to Europe and China, generally next week. It is expected that President Truman will soon sign the $350 million relief bill for seven countries for the next year. Congress restricted this relief to China, Austria, Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary, and the future Free Territory of Trieste. The President is expected to immediately request an advance of $75 million from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in accordance with the Congressional regulations. The Departments of State, Army, Treasury, and Agriculture are now drafting plans for the purchase and shipment of relief supplies.

### Round Table Conference About to Open, Situation in India Suddenly Tense, Armed Riots Spreading Rapidly

[Agence France-Presse, Calcutta, 30th Dispatch] As the Indian Round Table Conference is scheduled to open on June 2, the situation here is becoming increasingly tense. It is reported that several British troops will patrol the streets on that day, and police will be stationed at all major thoroughfares. At the same time, Europeans living here are stocking up on canned food.

[Our Agency News] London, 30th Broadcast. Indian leaders are currently awaiting Governor-General Mountbatten’s return from England with the latest Indian independence plan passed by the British Cabinet. It is claimed that the Congress Party and the Muslim League have both accepted the proposal to establish a separate Muslim independent state to implement the partition of India and Pakistan, but Mahatma Gandhi told his followers at a prayer meeting last night: "We will never tolerate the partition of even an inch of land." It is reported that Mountbatten will announce the British Cabinet's plan on June 2. Gandhi said that at that time, he would continue to promote the Indian unification movement, and there would be an open conflict with the official Congress Party.

[Our Agency News] London, 30th Broadcast: A small-scale conflict occurred between Indian and Muslim tribes 30 miles from New Delhi, and troops have been dispatched to suppress it. Also, there are reports that 1,000 armed civilians rioted in a village near Madras, and police opened fire, killing ten people.

[Reuters, Berlin, 29th Dispatch] As a result of the negotiations in Berlin between Lieutenant General Robertson, Deputy Commander of the British Zone of Germany, and General Clay, Commander of the U.S. Zone, an agreement has been reached. The communiqué announced the content of the agreement as follows: (1) An economic committee for the British and American merged zone will be established, composed of representatives elected by the parliaments of the six states of the British and American zones. Its task is to formulate a plan for the economic recovery of the two zones in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, which will be implemented after being approved by the authorities of the British and American zones. (2) An executive committee composed of one representative from each state will be organized to supervise the implementation of the decisions of the economic committee. (3) Various executive departments will be established under the economic committee and the executive committee, and executive officers will be appointed to take charge of their affairs.

### Preventing the June 2nd Riot; Authorities Order Arrests of Communist Saboteurs; Over Eighty Students to Be Isolated

[Our Own Correspondent] Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan received reporters in the City Hall conference room at 5:30 PM yesterday, providing explanations regarding the arrest of Communist saboteurs. First, Mayor Wu clarified the city government's attitude toward this student unrest, stating: In March of this year, when the National Government ordered Communist elements to withdraw to Yan'an, the Communist office in this city claimed that there were only 34 Communist members in the city. Commander Xuan and I are responsible for local security and knew that the number of Communist members was far more than this. Although we could have used force to order their complete withdrawal at that time, the door to negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communists was not yet closed. It was generally believed that if the Communist elements who had infiltrated could remain peaceful and law-abiding, we would not resort to such measures. However, the reality was different; arson, strikes, beatings, and other actions disrupting public order occurred one after another. The city government had previously received intelligence stating that the Communist Party would choose factories, warehouses, and shantytowns in the city to carry out arson in order to disrupt public order. At the beginning of this month, the city government received intelligence again, stating that the Communist Party was plotting a major riot on June 2nd, inciting city-wide strikes of students, businesses, and workers. During this month, each school implemented strikes based on completely different issues, and then unanimously turned to the same political goal. Moreover, according to the city government's investigation, a small number of students in each school were indeed students with political backgrounds, and these students were the ones inciting the student unrest.

Mayor Wu continued: Based on the aforementioned facts, since they attempted to riot on June 2nd, if the city government allowed it to develop and punished them after the riot occurred, the damage to the citizens would be great. Therefore, we had to arrest the subversive rioters who had infiltrated each school in advance to prevent the occurrence of the riot, so that young students would not be incited by them. According to the city government's statistics, there are approximately 45,000 students in various universities in the city, among whom the number of subversive rioters is not small, but after repeated and careful review by the city government, it was determined that over eighty students had to be arrested. The authorities have compiled a list and are arresting them separately. Some students have already been arrested, and the remaining number will continue to be arrested within the next few days. Regarding the handling of the arrested students, Mayor Wu stated yesterday: We will try our best to be lenient, or transfer them to the Communist area separately. In addition, those who express repentance and provide a reliable guarantee may also be treated leniently. As for the method of guaranteeing, the city government and the garrison headquarters are drafting it.

### The Flames of Unrest Spread to Society; Actions Had to Be Taken to Avoid Affecting Public Safety; Commander Xuan Issues Statement

Following Mayor Wu's speech, Commander Xuan then issued a statement, stating: (1) Some members of society believe that the recent turmoil is simply student unrest, and that the subversive elements arrested by the authorities are innocent students. This view does not reflect the truth. If students were to cause a student strike for their own interests, their actions would be limited to within the school, and the authorities would not want to interfere. However, this turmoil began in early May and has lasted for nearly a month. It has spread from universities to middle schools, becoming an unstoppable force, and has even attempted to incite factory strikes and business closures. Even military and police personnel have been the target of their subversive incitement. The slogans shouted and the posters pasted are no longer characteristic of student unrest. From this, it can be seen that this turmoil is indeed the Communist Party's entire plan to sabotage public order and overthrow the government. The instigators and agitators in each school are undoubtedly Communist Party agents who have been strategically deployed. (2) Some people believe that it is inappropriate for the military and police to interfere in student unrest, but now the flames of unrest are spreading from schools to society, affecting the safety of the entire city. It is the responsibility of the military and police authorities, and it is also the hope of the majority of citizens who need stability. Therefore, we have to take action to protect the majority of the people.

To Be Sent to the Communist Area

(3) Starting yesterday, it is planned to arrest over eighty students who are Communists and other Communist Party members. Of course, the number of Communists who have infiltrated this city is more than this, but we do not intend to arrest too many. We are now only selecting the most important ones who must be arrested. After repeated review, we have decided on over eighty people. We hope that other infiltrators can come to their senses on their own. As for those who have already been arrested, they will be isolated first, and if necessary, they will be sent away from Shanghai to the Communist area. They shout "Oppose the civil war," so they should also go to the Communist Party to shout that. (4) The over eighty people who have been decided to be arrested have not yet all been captured. This is because yesterday, the garrison headquarters used formal procedures to notify the principals of each school with an official letter listing the names and requesting that the listed students be handed over. However, because the principals of each school were unable to take full responsibility in advance, the military police had to be sent to arrest them themselves. Therefore, the Communist Party members in Jiaotong University probably knew that the authorities would not allow them to continue their activities, and most of them had already fled in advance. Therefore, the arrest work has not yet been fully accomplished.

List To Be Announced Soon

(5) The arrested Communists have all been investigated and have solid evidence against them. Their names will be announced by the city government soon. Also, among those arrested this time, there are several reporters. The authorities do not ask whether they are reporters or students. All who are major Communist Party members who conspire to incite turmoil and sabotage stability will be arrested. (6) A small number of students from one part of Jiaotong University are the main elements leading the turmoil and sabotaging public order. The majority of students in other schools are incited by these few people. As long as classes resume immediately, the authorities will not implicate the innocent. However, if the students still do not come to their senses and continue to attempt to riot in the June 2nd parade and launch strikes of workers and businesses, then the security authorities will be forced to take resolute measures.

### Jiaotong University Expels Eighteen Students

[Central News Agency] Jiaotong University President Wu Baofeng issued a notice on the afternoon of the 30th, expelling eighteen Communist students from the school whom the Garrison Department had decided to arrest, and at the same time declared that he had submitted his resignation. It is reported that Mr. Wu left the school that evening.

According to Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan's statement at the press conference yesterday afternoon, the reason for the arrest was that they were suspected of being Communists.

### French Concession Electric Light Company Experiences Another Round of Rolling Blackouts

The high-voltage generator of the Shanghai Power Company recently discovered another air leak, and it is scheduled to shut down for repairs for four days starting today. During this period, in addition to reducing the supply of 3,000 kilowatts to the Zhabei, Huashang, and Pudong electric companies, the supply to the French Concession Electric Light Company will also be reduced by 3,000 kilowatts.

### Land and Others, Who Investigated Japanese War Crimes, Return to Shanghai

[Our Own Correspondent] Military Tribunal Judge Lu Qi and Clerk Wang Shuliang went to Hangzhou to investigate the crimes of Japanese war criminals Zhibara Heizo, former head of the Hangzhou Special Service Agency, Minamihyaku Koji, former commander of the Hangzhou Military Police, and Sogawa Jiro, former commander of the Sixth Army who invaded Hangzhou. They returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing their official duties. It is said that there were absolutely no people from the Hangzhou area and eastern Zhejiang who came to report the crimes of these criminals. However, during this trip, the Hangzhou Higher Court questioned Li Baohe, Feng Tianbao, Jin Dechun, and the other three of the Four King Kongs, notorious Chinese traitors in Hangzhou, and obtained much corroborating evidence of Zhibara Heizo's crimes. According to Li and others, it is true that Zhibara Heizo raped women from good families. Moreover, he protected opium and gambling dens and was a typical Japanese rogue. The people of Hangzhou feared him like a devil, and they did not even dare to look him in the face when they met him on the street, otherwise they would be severely beaten. Also, No. 6 Hubin Road was originally the secret lair of this devil. Judge Lu and others went to investigate the site in person, but because time had passed, they were unable to obtain evidence.

### Council Approves Urban Planning Outline; Utilizing Existing Docks, Six Ports Are Planned; Pudong Is Designated as a Light Industrial Zone; The Assembly Will Hold Its Third Meeting This Afternoon

[Our Own Correspondent] Yesterday was the fifth day of the City Council's general assembly. In the morning, the Finance and Social Affairs Committees jointly convened a meeting to discuss whether the stock exchange should be abolished.

The Urban Planning Review Committee is organized by twenty-nine councilors, presided over by Deputy Speaker Xu. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau reported on the content of the plan, stating that this draft plan took a year and a half to complete. Urban planning work is very important, but it is difficult to please everyone. Zhao also reported that the Executive Yuan had previously issued two orders: one ordering all counties and cities to have urban plans, and one stating that construction funds would be suspended for all those without urban plans.

A Large Airfield to Be Developed Into an International Airport

As a result of the committee's discussions, the overall layout of the Greater Shanghai Urban Plan was largely approved in accordance with the original outline: (1) Regarding ports, it was agreed that the ports should be concentrated at several points in an appropriate manner (excavated or parallel) and, in the near future, the existing docks along the Huangpu River should be used as much as possible. The plan proposes to open six ports, such as designating the Qiujiang dock as an industrial port, the area near Guosong as a fishing port, and the Gaoqiao area as an oil port. (2) Regarding airports, Dachang will be developed into an international airport, and it is planned to build a seaplane base nearby, with the location still preferably on the south bank of the Yangtze River in the northwest of Baoshan.

Restoring the South Station and Expanding the North Station

(3) Regarding railway stations, the review committee amended it as follows: (1) Restore the South Station, (2) Expand the North Station and West Station, and expand the North Station and Maigen Road Station into freight stations. (4) Regarding roads, elevated or double-use excavated roads should be used for direct trunk lines, but this should be decided after further consideration of technical aspects and the situation in this city. (5) Regarding the development of Pudong, it is planned to designate the Pudong area as a light industrial zone, but it should be based on its nature, using those that do not require railway transportation, and several docks should be set up at the ports of the navigable inland rivers to facilitate the development of the industry. (6) Regarding industrial zones, the "Shanghai Municipality Interim Regulations on the Location of Factories" that have been duly decided by the City Council should be reviewed in accordance with the two drafts of the urban plan to make them compatible.

Rickshaw Pullers Should Not Be Treated Harshly

(2) For citizen whistleblower cases, the police station should deal with those with the name and address of the whistleblower, and those without the name and address should be dealt with after verifying the truth. (3) The problem of abandoned babies should be given special attention by the police and social affairs bureaus. (4) Police training should be strengthened to improve attitudes.

### The Committee to Guide Student Unrest Modifies the Message to Students

[Our Own Correspondent] The Special Committee for Guiding Student Unrest of the City Council continued its meeting yesterday afternoon, still chaired by Wang Zhengting. Speaker Pan also participated in person, reporting on the course of the Jiaotong University incident obtained from the city government and the reasons for the authorities' arrest of people who disturbed public order.

### Representatives from Two Universities Petition the Council

[Our Own Correspondent] The representatives from Jiaotong University who went to the Council to petition yesterday were Chui Weicheng, Dean of the Management College, Zhong Zhaolin, Chairman of the Electrical Engineering Department, Professor Chai Zhiming, and students Wang Zhisui, Feng Wen, and Zhang Qishu. After being received by Wang Zhengting and Wang Zhuyi, the three students withdrew first, while Zhong Weicheng stated the course of events on the seat of the Committee to Guide Student Unrest, which was quite impassioned. Finally, he said: "People suspect that I am inciting the strike, and I also suspect that people are inciting the strike. We can find them to confront each other." Zhu Shanyuan, Tian Zhenbang, Zhu Xiangxian, and Hua Yongshen, four student representatives from Datong University, also went to the City Council to petition yesterday afternoon and were received by Tao Baichuan. According to the representatives, the strike at Datong this time was purely an internal incident to reform the school's faculty, but unfortunately, it caused the arrest of students. There are currently eleven students who have been arrested. Except for one person who has been released, the rest are still in custody. Among them, student Hu Ningsheng suffers from tuberculosis and urgently needs treatment. Therefore, they request two points: (1) Immediately release the arrested students, and (2) Urge Acting President Hu to come forward to negotiate. Counselor Tao agreed to transfer the opinions to the committee and discuss the solution with the Mayor.

### The Results of the Joint Review by the Two Committees of the Council; The Stock Exchange Can Be Temporarily Retained; Seven Opinions on Preventing Abuse

[Our Own Correspondent] The proposal submitted by City Councilor Chen Gongda and jointly signed by seventy-two city councilors: "Requesting the Central Government to abolish all stock exchanges in Shanghai, eliminate speculation, stabilize the people's livelihood, and maintain law and order" was submitted to the joint review meeting of the Finance and Social Affairs Committees of the City Council yesterday morning for review. More than thirty councilors from the two committees attended, with Chairman Wang Yansong presiding. Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the Stock Exchange, was unable to attend due to circumstances, and was represented by Yang Yinpu and Gu Shanchang, assistant managers of the Stock Exchange and Hua Wenyu, chief secretary of the Stock Exchange. Councilor Wang Weiyin reported in his review opinion that the Stock Exchange's own organization has a legal basis, and it does not seem to be easily abolished. However, he believed that the delivery trade needed improvement. Gu Shanchang stood up to explain that the delivery trade of securities has made a slight contribution to absorbing floating funds; from the study of facts and theory, it is believed that the stock market has no ability to lead prices.

### Cannot Be Considered A Wen

During the discussion, the representatives of the Stock Exchange were first asked to leave. The councilors then expressed their opinions one after another. Finally, the review result was passed that "In order to assist the circulation of stocks, make it easier to raise funds needed for industry, and to attract a portion of floating funds into the right track so as not to be used for hoarding and speculation, the establishment of a Stock Exchange is naturally indispensable. All advanced countries in Europe and the United States have stock exchanges in all major cities. The existence of stock exchanges in our country has not started today. Before the Anti-Japanese War in this city, in addition to the Stock Exchange, there were also exchanges for cotton cloth, grains, gold, etc., all of which were closed due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, only the Stock Exchange has resumed operations. Other transactions have not yet resumed establishment. This Stock Exchange was approved by the government last year to reorganize and resume business. All legal systems and regulations have been carefully revised and are stationed by supervisory personnel from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The organization system can be called perfect. Its facilities and effectiveness should be more advanced than before the war. If it can abide by the rules and regulations and engage in business, it cannot be regarded as a superfluous tumor, or abandon eating because of choking, so the reviewers believe that the question of whether or not to abolish it can be temporarily retained, but the various points cited by the proposers as concerns are indeed important. In order to prevent problems before they arise and to stop abuses, the following points should be presented to the government to order the Stock Exchange to pay serious attention and supervise them at any time:

(1) The qualifications of listed industrial and commercial stocks should be strictly reviewed, and inferior ones should not be allowed to be mixed in. (2) The types and numbers of listed stocks should be widespread. For example, stocks in the textile, pharmaceutical, rubber, hardware, printing, construction, mining, and shipping industries should be included. At present, there are only more than twenty listed stocks, and the categories are not widespread. They must be relaxed immediately. (3) The assets, profits, and losses, and operating conditions of the listed stock manufacturers should be announced accurately and in detail at any time, so that investors know how to choose. (4) The style of brokers should be strictly supervised and guided to protect customer safety and prevent fueling speculation. (5) The off-site black market should be strictly banned to avoid exceeding the norms due to loss of control. (6) Interest rates for arbitrage should be stabilized at all times. (7) Delivery trading should be stopped after the trial period expires.

### Another Case of Foreign Merchants Disrupting Finance Under Investigation Yesterday

[Our Own Correspondent] The District Attorney's Office yesterday investigated a "Little Foreign Tiger" case. The Zhongyong Foreign Company on Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road was opened by British national Snow Whites and Iraqi national Ace Garden and others. In the past, it violated the Economic Emergency Measures Plan and illegally bought and sold gold U.S. dollars, etc., and was seized by the police station. The District Attorney's Office is investigating the crime of disrupting finance. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Chen Shoutao opened a court for interrogation, summoning Ace Garden and the company's accountant Qian Mengchu. It is said that after the announcement of the Emergency Measures Plan, they traded with 17,000 U.S. dollars, but the U.S. dollars were the remainder before the announcement of the plan. The prosecutor ordered the defendant to be released on bail and ordered him to await trial after the company's books and records had been audited by an accountant.

### Gaoqiao Tragedy: Wife Killed After Taking Poison

[Our Own Correspondent] A murder case occurred at No. 441 Beijie Street, Gaoqiao Town at 11:00 PM the night before.

The eldest daughter is already fourteen years old, and the son is only four years old. Zhu recently suspected his wife of having an affair, so he took poison in advance. While his wife was asleep, he stabbed her in the chest seven times with a sharp knife, killing her. When his daughter ran to tell her aunt, Zhu was taken to the police station, but Zhu had already taken poison and was unconscious. He was sent to the hospital and was still unconscious at noon yesterday.

### Re-examination of Li Ze: Over a Hundred New New Company Employees Carry Banners and Flyers to Observe the Hearing

[Our Newspaper] The case of New New Company General Manager Li Ze being accused of being a suspected traitor has been delayed until now, exceeding one and a half years. On August 6th of last year, the High Court sentenced him to three years in prison. The Supreme Court remanded the case for a new trial. The hearing was held at the High Court at 2:30 PM yesterday, being the third hearing after the re-examination. Approximately one hundred employees of the New New Company traveled to observe the hearing in two trucks, carrying huge banners and flyers titled "Expose Li Ze." After Judge Ding Su Hongsheng took his seat, a bailiff brought Li Ze to the court. Li wore a beige paletot, tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, and yellow leather shoes, with a ruddy complexion. The court investigation yesterday focused on three points: (1) The New New Company's hiring of Japanese individuals Ito Masuzo and Kinoshita Yutaka as consultants; (2) His role as a director and preparatory committee member of the puppet Commercial Control Association; and (3) Supplying steel pipes to benefit the enemy. Li testified: (1) The New New Company's hiring of Japanese individuals as consultants was approved by the board of directors. The chairman, Jin Zongcheng, had already testified to this, stating that it was to deal with disturbances caused by Japanese ruffians. Ito Masuzo was the owner of Ekiji Foreign Firm and had never served as a consultant for the New New Company. Kinoshita Yutaka was a consultant. (2) His role as a preparatory committee member of the puppet Commercial Control Association was assigned by the puppet government. It was true that he served as a director, but he did not perform any actual work. He had been approved by the Military Statistics Bureau to participate in order to cover up underground work. (3) There were over 300 steel pipes in total. In September of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), approximately 190 of them were sold to the Mori Dai Iron Factory and not secretly given to the enemy. Subsequently, the accusers Han Wucheng, Yao Zhuoren, and Shu Yueqiao were summoned to refute Li Ze's testimony, stating that Li Ze initiated the organization of the puppet National Commercial Control Association and served as a director for two consecutive terms, participating in many important resolutions. He also secretly gave the enemy approximately 20,000 catties of hot water pipes from the New New Company. Li first served as the first Lianbao Chief of the Lao Zha District in the puppet Shanghai, and then as the Chief Lianbao Chief of the first district. Entrusted by the enemy army, he opened the military-managed Yongfu Real Estate Company, forcibly seizing real estate. Later, he flattered the enemy and puppets, sending senior officials Fang Xueguo, Liang Gongchen, and Chen Bosong to the puppet Manchukuo to celebrate its 10th anniversary. He hired the Japanese retired soldier Kinoshita Yutaka as a consultant, establishing close ties with the enemy and puppets. At this point, Yang Shenjian, the accountant of the New New Company, was summoned to be questioned about the accounts of selling iron to the Mori Dai Iron Factory. Yang stated: The iron was sold to the Mori Dai Iron Factory on September 15th of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), receiving puppet currency 2,070,348 yuan, paid in three installments. The consultant fee for the Japanese Kinoshita Yutaka was 500 military scrip per month. At this point in the court hearing, it was announced that the case would be adjourned for further investigation. The defendant was returned to custody, and the witnesses were dismissed.

Questioned, Wang Xuexing stated that in June of last year, he was appointed Bao Chief by the Communist army in the former area, and went around conscripting laborers. Because Yuan's brother refused to obey, he was detained by the Communist army for more than 20 days and then executed. The branch bureau stated that the case was not yet clear and would be investigated before further action was taken.

### Robbers Also Smoke Opium, Steal Handguns, and Commit Repeated Crimes

[Our Newspaper] Xu Dong, a 25-year-old single robber from Hangzhou, once served as a section chief in a prison of a puppet organization. Since the restoration, he has been unemployed and idle, and has a habit of smoking opium. His elder brother is currently serving as a lieutenant staff officer in a certain unit. He took the opportunity to steal his brother's official handgun and rob people outside. At around 10 PM the night before last, he was riding his own bicycle, intending to rob someone somewhere. Unexpectedly, while passing through the intersection of Shunchang Road and Ximen Road, he was encountered by Inspector Zhang Yanxun, police officer Xu Yushi, Yang Jinhong, and others from the Songshan Police Station, who were conducting a sweep. They found a loaded handgun and a bag of opium on him and took him to the police station. During interrogation, Xu confessed that on the evening of April 1st, he robbed 10 dozens of socks at 14 Shanggui Lane, Ximen Road; on April 6th, he robbed a jewelry box containing 115 US dollars, 200 Hong Kong dollars, two silver rings, four gold pounds, and 150,000 yuan in cash at 4, Lane 159, Longmen South Road; on May 8th, he stole a bicycle from the back door of 46 Yongnian Road; on May 10th, he robbed pedestrian Weng Zhiliang of 100,000 yuan in cash; and on May 17th, he robbed gold rings and over one million yuan in cash from a gambling den inside the store at 92 South District Street in the Nanshi district, totaling more than twelve times.

### Chief Secretary of Hangzhou Municipal Government Not Prosecuted in Accusation Case

[Our Newspaper] The current Chief Secretary of the Hangzhou Municipal Government, Xu Xiongfei, and Secretary Xu, were previously accused by gentry from Songyang County, Zhejiang Province, to the Zhejiang judicial authorities, stating that during Xu's tenure as the Magistrate of Songyang County in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), he committed six crimes, including illegally detaining prisoners, extorting donations, assigning quotas arbitrarily, illegally collecting emergency funds, misappropriating tobacco taxes, and engaging in corruption in military rations. The case was forwarded by the Supreme Procuratorate to the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The defendant also came to Shanghai for questioning.

### Chu Linsun's Traitor Suspect Case, High Court Opened Re-examination Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The case of Dr. Chu Linsun of this city being accused of being a traitor suspect was previously sentenced by the High Court to one year and three months imprisonment, and the Supreme Court remanded it for re-examination. Yesterday afternoon at two o'clock, the High Court opened the hearing. Chu, wearing a dark blue suit, smiled and testified: When Li Shiqun was the Governor of Jiangsu Province in the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he sent me to serve as the President of the puppet Provincial Hospital. I had no personal relationship with Li Shiqun. I knew him because I treated his illness. The reason for taking the position of president of the puppet hospital was due to (1) Li using my status in the Shanghai medical community, while I took the position because the hospital was a charitable institution; (2) Because I had a relationship with the Military Statistics Bureau, I took the position to cover up my work. The Shanghai Office of the Military Statistics Bureau can prove this. At this point, the court ordered a new trial to be scheduled, and the defendant remained in the custody of the original plaintiff.

After the prayer, Consul General Davis delivered a speech, praising the Flying Tigers' contributions during the war. He then introduced General Chennault to speak. General Chen said that the American soldiers who sacrificed themselves in this war were all over the continents and seas, which proves that the world has been shrunk by the progress of science. If human beings cannot work together for survival, they will destroy each other. After the speech, Davis and others silently laid wreaths in front of the tomb, stood in silence to pay their respects, and the Marines fired a salute. The ceremony concluded with the singing of the American anthem.

### Jiaotong University Dean of Studies, Li Ximou, Beaten Up by Students Yesterday, Requesting President Wu to Severely Punish the Leading Students

[Our Newspaper] The universities in this city have recently resumed classes one after another, and the student unrest has gradually subsided. Unexpectedly, an unfortunate incident of students beating up the dean of studies occurred again at Jiaotong University in Xujiahui yesterday (30th). The Dean of Studies of Jiaotong University is the current Deputy Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, Li Ximou. Li was surrounded and beaten by hundreds of students at Jiaotong University yesterday afternoon, injuring his head and waist. There are a total of over three thousand students at Jiaotong University. The students who caused the trouble this time were only a minority. Afterwards, Li wrote to the school's President Wu Baofeng, requesting that the leading students be severely punished. The original letter is as follows: "Today (30th) when I was leaving the school at noon, I was surrounded by hundreds of students, who verbally abused me, and threw bricks and stones. Then they used their fists and feet, and my head and waist were injured. Under your leadership, brother, I have worked hard on school affairs for several years, and I am deeply saddened to receive such an insult. I think that my personal advancement and retreat are insignificant, but it is extremely heartbreaking that our school's fifty-year-old simple and honest school spirit has been abandoned once. Today, a small number of students despise the rules, disrespect teachers, and act like thugs. If this situation is not investigated in detail and punished severely, then this trend will continue, and the future of the school is unimaginable. I request that you quickly investigate the names of the leading students who caused the trouble, expel them from school, so as to save the declining situation and restore school discipline."

### Fuel Management Committee Convenes Emergency Meeting to Discuss Coal Supply Issues; Encourage Mining and Transportation Within the Scope of Control

[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs convened a temporary emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, given that the coal supply from Qinhuangdao has been disrupted, and no coal shipments have arrived from the 19th of this month until yesterday, leaving only over 50,000 tons of coal in storage at the end of last month. Coal reserves are expected to be only over 40,000 tons by the end of this month, with supplies running dry. In order to prevent such an eventuality, relevant parties were invited to attend the meeting. More than 20 representatives from Qishuyan Power Plant, Junpu Bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Shanghai Port Command, Jinghu Railway Bureau, Textile Construction Company, Industrial Association, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Municipal Public Works Bureau, Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, Shipping Guild, Hangzhou Power Plant, and other organizations attended, and the meeting was presided over by Xu Letian, chairman of the Fuel Management Committee. The chairman first reported that he felt deeply about the deteriorating coal supply situation in Qinhuangdao when he returned to Shanghai from Beijing last week, which made him doubt the reliability of future coal supplies. Fortunately, news has recently arrived that the production of Kailuan Coal Mine and the repair of railways have both improved. The National Army is also paying close attention to the security of the area. Therefore, the daily supply can still be maintained at 3,000 tons, and 90,000 tons can be supplied per month. In addition, Huludao supplies 20,000 tons per month, and Huainan and Taiwan coal mines each supply 50,000 tons per month, so the total supply volume for all regions in June can still maintain 210,000 tons, barely meeting the needs of this region and other ports next month. However, coal-consuming agencies are still requested to find ways to plan ahead so that they can maintain themselves in case of any problems with the coal supply. This committee hopes that the supply of coal can be increased. At present, the output of Huainan Coal Mine has reached 70,000 tons per month. If the government can provide financial assistance, it is expected that the monthly output can reach 90,000 tons by the end of the year. Taiwan also has increased production and is expected to supply 50,000 tons per month. As for commercial transportation, recently, at the request of merchants and civilians, except for the controlled Northeast, Kaijie, Huainan, Zhongxing, Huadong, and Taiwan mines, small mines in Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places are encouraged to mine and transport coal as much as possible under the condition that it does not conflict with the local control scope. The one-time mining and transportation volume shall not exceed 100 tons for coal merchants and shall not exceed one month's demand for manufacturers. At the same time, this committee has discussed with the Central Bank to try to relax the quota as much as possible for coal merchants who have their own foreign exchange and are willing to transport coal from abroad to China, which is also expected to be realized. As for the adjustment of coal prices, it is currently awaiting discussion and approval by the National Price Commission today (31st) in order to increase the supply of various mines. Finally, representatives expressed their opinions, and the meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.

In addition, the committee's allocation of monthly coal tonnage to this region and other ports is as follows: public utilities 40,000 tons, railways 24,000 tons, ships 20,000 tons, power plants in other ports (along the Jinghu-Hangzhou line) 14,000 tons, government agencies 6,000 tons, military, Allied, and charitable organizations 3,000 tons, factories 30,000 tons, Qingdao 20,000 tons, Lianyungang 2,000 tons, Hankou 7,000 tons, other ports (Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou) 10,000 tons, totaling 176,000 tons, plus 40,000 tons for Nanjing, totaling 216,000 tons.

### Artificial Silk Second Batch Arrives: 2,000 Cases Shipped from Japan; Market Price Reported Up Yesterday, Actual Sales Slight

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau yesterday shipped another 2,000 cases of artificial silk from Japan. This is the second batch to arrive this year. The bureau has scheduled to resume rationing next Monday, initially allocating one-tenth of the requested amount to the silk weaving industry. Another report: The Silk Weaving Industry Association, citing a shortage of raw silk materials and subsequent production difficulties among its members, yesterday separately requested the Central Bank, China Silk Corporation, and Central Trust Bureau to allocate 320 bales from their remaining stockpile of over 1,100 bales of raw silk acquired last year for use by the industry.

Yesterday, the factory-level warp market showed no signs of weakening. B-grade was offered at as high as 26 million yuan, and D-grade at 25 million yuan, but due to the excessively high asking prices, there were no counter-offers, and no transactions were made for any grade. Another batch of Blue Double Tiger was offered at 23 loads, priced at 24.5 million yuan. Separate batches of dried warp were also traded at 18 million yuan, an increase of 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. New high prices continued to emerge, leaving buyers helpless.

Silk Weaving Industry Requests Rationing of Raw Silk

The Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association, recognizing the insufficient stock of raw silk in the city and the soaring market prices, which yesterday reached as high as 26 million yuan per load, has stated that its members, except for a portion already weaving export silk on behalf of the production-sales joint venture company, the remaining 300-plus members weaving domestic silk, owning 3,500 silk looms, are unable to purchase the high-priced raw materials and may be unable to continue operations. Yesterday, the association's Chairman Cai Xin-tao separately visited relevant authorities, proposing that the remaining portion of raw silk purchased by the Central Trust Bureau last year, approximately 1,200 loads, be allocated in advance, estimating that each loom could be allocated 20 catties, totaling 360 loads, sufficient to maintain half a month's worth of operating raw materials.

### Sericulture Production and Sales Guidance Council Requests Additional Allocation of 100 Billion Loan; Held its Fifth Committee Meeting Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sericulture Production and Sales Guidance Committee of the Ministries of Agriculture and Commerce held its fifth quarterly general meeting yesterday morning at the China Silk Corporation, 216 Wujin Road, Shanghai. Leng Yuqiu, Tan Xi-hong, Ma Bao-zhi, Zhang Yu-hua, Diao Min-ren, Wang Bo-tian, Tao Ju-ru, Dong Zan-yao, Pi Zuo-qiong, He Bei-heng, Fan Chong-shi, Chen Jun-ren, Ge Jing-zhong, Tang Xi-xiang, and Xia Dao-xiang attended, with Xu Xing-bin, Wang Hua-nan, Shen Jiu-ru, Shao Shen-pei, and Lu Zi-rong in attendance. Chairman Tan Xi-hong presided over the meeting. The minutes of the fourth meeting were read first, followed by reports on silkworm cocoon harvesting in Zhejiang and loan conditions in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Then, the following were discussed:

(1) Cocoon prices will remain unchanged as originally set, but will be appropriately increased based on the quality of the cocoons.

(2) In addition to the loans approved by the Four Joint Banks, an additional 100 billion should be requested. The loans must be allocated to cocoon collection locations before the peak season for silkworm cocoons.

(3) Budget Estimates: Regular and temporary expense budgets will be reviewed by representatives from the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, the Central Bank, the Central Agricultural Bank, the China Silk Corporation, and this committee. The results will be submitted at the next meeting and then reported to the relevant departments.

(4) Measures to suppress cocoon prices were amended and passed.

[Report from Our Newspaper] As of yesterday, 65 cocoon collection companies have opened accounts with the China Farmers Bank to process spring cocoon loans. The bank has already remitted 140.4 billion yuan in cocoon collection loans to various locations.

### Transportation Management Committee Stipulates Import Goods Allocation Methods

The quotas for the second quarter imports have been announced by the Transportation Management Committee. However, recently, there has been intense dispute between importers and industry regarding the allocation of various goods. The Transportation Management Committee has now stipulated that for simple import goods, such as cotton, wool, and newsprint, with few categories and relatively fixed users, the allocation will be handled by the respective industrial associations to their members. However, after the respective industrial associations request and obtain approval, they must have the goods imported by importers and are not allowed to import themselves. For complex import goods, such as chemical raw materials and machinery parts, with numerous categories and users, and without a centralized management industrial association, they will be allocated by the import industry. To avoid importers illegally selling import quotas privately, importers must present and verify sales contracts before being allowed to import. In addition, there are three points of contention that the committee has clarified: (1) some factories that applied to register as importers and were not qualified want to avoid paying commissions to importers but seek to obtain allocation rights by importing themselves; (2) some factories need larger quantities and must consolidate the import quotas of several importers to meet their needs and want to find ways to obtain allocation rights by importing themselves; (3) some factories need raw materials that commercial importers are unwilling to import, and they also want to be able to import themselves. The committee has focused on these three issues and will carefully consider them and gradually improve the situation.

Spring and Autumn

### New Discussion on the Deeds of Shi Nai'an

— Yu Heng

My hometown, Baiju Town, is located on the Fan Gong Dike and is also known as Old Market. The name comes from the meaning of the "Book of Songs": "Bright and white colt, eats my market." This small place was once the birthplace of the national revolutionary hero Zhang Shicheng and also the burial place of Shi Nai'an, the author of *Water Margin*.

The issue of Shi Nai'an's original home has been a long-standing and contentious debate. According to the author's preface in *Water Margin*, he is from Dongdu (Luoyang?), but some say his original home was Huai'an, others say it was Qiantang, and still others say Shi Nai'an was a pseudonym for Luo Guanzhong. However, people with the surname Shi in our hometown and the Xinghua County Chronicle say he was from Baiju, Xinghua. Due to the lack of textual research, everyone is merely making inferences based on their own ideas, which only makes the matter more confusing.

Last autumn, the *Shen Bao*’s *Chunqiu Huikan* published two articles about Shi Nai'an, which had insightful views, but unfortunately, they were not detailed enough. Now, Dr. Shi Fusheng from my hometown has copied and sent excerpts from the "Epitaph of Shi Nai'an" by Wang Daosheng of Huai'an (with slight differences from the Xinghua County Chronicle) and the fragments of "A Short History of Shi Nai'an's Life" compiled by Yuan Jiren from the Shi clan genealogy. I will first transcribe them as they are for the reference of wise and knowledgeable people:

Epitaph: The public's given name was Zi'an, courtesy name Nai'an (the Xinghua County Chronicle says the given name was Er, courtesy name Zi'an). He was awarded the Jinshi degree in the late Yuan Dynasty and served as an official in Qiantang for two years. Because he did not agree with the powerful and influential people of the time, he abandoned his official position and returned to his hometown, where he closed his door and devoted himself to writing, recalling old events, and ultimately died in bitterness. Although I do not know the details of the public's deeds, I can still recount them. Although I did not personally see the public's face, I can only imagine his appearance. The public died at the age of seventy-five, and I was still a child. When I grew up, I met his disciple Luo Guanzhong in Fujian, and we stayed in the same inn. At night, we lit candles and talked about the anecdotes of the master, which were so moving that we could not help but sigh together. The master's works include *Zhiyu, Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, *Chronicles of the Sui and Tang Dynasties*, *The Story of San Sui Subduing the Demons*, and *Tales of Heroes of the Rivers and Lakes*, which is *Water Margin*. Every time a draft was completed, he would revise it with his disciple Luo Guanzhong, and Luo contributed greatly. Alas, heroes are born in times of chaos, so even if they have a clear and harmonious understanding, they still have to end their lives with unrealized ambitions. This is what makes the hermits and recluses of all ages weep bitterly. When the master's home was in Huai'an, it was only a wall away from mine. Unfortunately, I was born too late and did not receive his personal instruction, which I always regret. Last year, his descendant, Mr. Shuyuan, moved his coffin south and lingered with me again and again, asking about his family history, but he refused to reveal it. When asked about his aspirations, he sighed and lamented. What he said about his ancestor and Luo Guanzhong was roughly the same. Alas! When the country is in turmoil, men of ambition cannot realize their potential and are treated like hawks and dogs, so they will retreat from the world and gain fame. (There should be some missing words here.) Moreover, in a world where chaos reigns and villains are in power, the master's life can be said to be unfortunate. However, although the master suffered hardship and adversity, he refused to bow down and seek recommendation. He closed his door and wrote books to (missing word) the master's determination can be (missing word) pure... (the rest is incomplete)

Short History... Nai'an and Shicheng's (missing word) general Bian Yuanheng were friendly. Shicheng prepared armor and weapons, spying on the Yuan court. He regarded Bian Yuanheng as Guangfeng. Hearing of Nai'an's fame, he sent invitations, but Nai'an did not respond. Shicheng visited his door and saw Nai'an writing *Tales of Heroes of the Rivers and Lakes*, which is *Water Margin*. Shicheng smiled and said, "Sir, you do not want to achieve success in this era but instead use your pen to express yourself. Isn't this wasting your time?" Nai'an heard this and put down his pen, kowtowing and saying, "I have no other talent. I only rely on my soft pen as a confidant, wielding my unrestrained spirit. The world looks up to me with admiration. If you do not despise (missing word) and condescend to visit, I would be truly guilty! How dare a man of ambition refuse to serve? However, my family has many troubles. My mother is old, my wife is weak, my children are getting married, and I am burdened with debts. If I leave, my mother will lose her support. General, your benevolence is like rain, showering everywhere. You must pity me and allow me to fulfill my filial piety, so I will be forever grateful." After he said this, he prostrated himself on the ground and refused to rise. Shicheng was displeased and left in a huff. At that time, *Tales of Heroes of the Rivers and Lakes* was at the forty-fifth chapter... These two fragmentary texts are said to have been around for quite some time. Unfortunately, there are no detailed dates to examine, but according to my speculation, they must be true records. People with deceitful intentions would never be so honest. Based on the five clues within, we can deduce the following:

Epitaph: Served as an official in Qiantang for two years...

Short History: Nai'an was friendly with Bian Yuanheng, a general under Shicheng. Shicheng was displeased and left in a huff.

Epitaph: When the master's home was in Huai'an, his descendant, Mr. Shuyuan, moved his coffin south... Refused to reveal.

These clues lead to a novel discovery, which, although not proven, is at least a very reasonable hypothesis: Shi Nai'an once lived in seclusion in Baiju, probably in the years after serving as an official in Qiantang for two years. At that time, the Yuan court was losing its power, and the world was in chaos. A person like him would never be willing to settle in the chaotic political arena. Therefore, he abandoned his official position, initially intending to return to his hometown in the north, but at that time, there were iron horses, golden spears, and smoke filled the sky. It would be very difficult for a poor official with clean sleeves (Shi Nai'an probably did not exploit the people, otherwise the heroes in his writings would not be so opposed to corrupt officials) to bring his family from Qiantang to Luoyang (assuming his hometown was Luoyang). Would he stay in Zhejiang and be captured by Fang Guozhen? Naturally, he could not do that either. At this time, being in a dangerous area, he was in a dilemma and could only choose a relatively close and safe place to go. Looking at the many rebel kings at this time, Zhang Shicheng of Baiju was the most capable of respecting virtue and treating scholars with courtesy (the Biography of Zhang Shicheng in the *History of the Ming Dynasty* has a similar comment). Nai'an was friendly with Bian Yuanheng, a general under Shicheng, and he was also a writer with radical revolutionary ideas. Of course, he might have come to Baiju with a new hope, wanting to cooperate with Zhang Shicheng in some great cause. Therefore, he moved his family to Baiju. Later, he saw through Shicheng's actions and determined that he would not succeed. He simply lived in seclusion and expressed his thoughts in writing, depicting the heroic figures he imagined one by one, contrasting them with the dark reality of the politics at that time, and using the story of Song Jiang at the end of the Song Dynasty to express his pent-up frustration. When Shicheng personally came to invite him to serve, because he already had preconceived notions, he angered Shicheng instead. It was naturally not appropriate to stay in Baiju for long, so he fled alone to Huai'an. This may have been the only way to go to Luoyang, but eventually, due to obstacles on the road, he had to reside in Huai'an. At the same time, it is even more possible that his works aroused the antipathy of the officials. To avoid literary persecution, he could not come forward (the "refusal to reveal" mentioned in the epitaph may refer to this). Until later, he was staying in Huai'an. Later, his children and grandchildren who stayed in Baiju returned his coffin and buried it in the Shi family grave that is now spoken of. One branch of his bloodline has forever become native to Baiju.

Now, what remains for people to mourn is only a desolate tomb next to the Shi Family Bridge near Daying, seventeen miles west of Baiju. According to the Shi clan genealogy, their seventeenth ancestor, Duke Shuyuan (Nai'an's grandson), once stationed troops here. The names Daying (big camp) and Xiaoying (small camp) originated at this time. There are tens of thousands of acres of military-cultivated land nearby, which are still called Tunjun Township.

In the summer of the 29th year of the Republic of China, the Jiangsu Provincial Government moved north, and the Civil Affairs and Education Departments temporarily resided in Baiju for half a year. Wang Gongyu, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Jin Zonghua, the Director of the Education Department, were both interested in excavating this major literary history mystery and planned to investigate Nai'an's tomb. Unfortunately, just when the plans were being vigorously pursued, the situation changed again, and the provincial government moved west to Xinghua. After the two officials left, this matter was slowly forgotten by everyone in the difficult years. 36, 3.21.

### Old Home

— Qinling

Occasionally returning home, I chatted with my mother. She told me sadly that the painted pavilion in the back enclosure had collapsed in a night of wind and rain. - The forgotten pavilions and figures of the old home flashed before my eyes again.

When my grandfather was alive, this painted pavilion was where he rested in his later years. My grandfather studied and became an official, then became a merchant, and then retired to study again. The life of hard work in his early years created a quiet and peaceful character in his later years. He personally designed every plant and tree in the garden. The flowerbeds and trees were distributed appropriately. I especially loved the parasol tree in front of the painted pavilion. In the summer, its branches and leaves swayed, shading the room with green. My grandfather named his study "Silk Fills the Window," which was very fitting. I also remember that the couplet used the lines "Citrus and beans, fresh fruits and vegetables, bamboo cane and straw shoes, old cloth clothes." When I was young, leaning on my grandfather's lap, he taught me to recognize these words day by day. My grandfather liked calligraphy and practiced writing every morning. A young servant specially assigned to him had to grind a tile bowl of ink every night. My grandfather was quite strict about the choice of writing materials. The ink should not be ground too quickly to avoid roughness, and the ink should be left for a certain period of time before it could be used. When that servant was nodding off next to the kerosene lamp, grinding ink, we would always tease him, making him neither fast nor slow, smearing ink all over his face and hands. Unfortunately, my grandfather had too many types of calligraphy models, so he could not specialize and excel. His writing was neither Ou nor Su; neither Zhao nor Wang, so he did not dare to write couplets for others.

My grandfather had a serious and meticulous personality. As soon as you heard his cough, the family members would become as quiet as cicadas in winter. But I was an exception. I often climbed on a small stool to accompany him to write, answering some bold questions. He would always stroke my braid and smile, saying, "This girl is really naughty!" My grandmother also loved books very much. Once she had a book in her hand, she would not ask or hear about anything else. When I was young, the Thousand Character Classic and Tang poetry that I sang were learned from my grandmother. The old nanny (the nanny of my sixth uncle) often said, "The lady's good character is really rare. As long as she is holding a book, she doesn't care if the children break their heads." Indeed, my grandmother didn't like to worry about household chores and left everything to the old nanny. The nanny was truly a hero in our family. My eldest uncle, father, and youngest uncle were all raised by her. However, my grandmother had unique skills in cooking, and my grandfather often took pride in her achievements when he hosted banquets. Only a small part of their specialties remains for us now.

The old nanny was a good companion in our childhood. When my grandfather and father went out at night, we accompanied her to wait for the door. In the dim light, she hugged us and told us about the Classic of Mountains and Seas, singing nursery rhymes in a high-pitched voice. We cousins were all her darlings. We looked for her to solve any difficult problems, asked her to plead with our mothers when we did something wrong, and asked her to judge when the siblings quarreled. Every time she came back from the street, each "darling" (her name for us) had some snacks to eat, so the old nanny was the children's god at that time.

In addition, the gardener Lao Qiao was also a key figure in the old home. My grandfather loved to eat fresh vegetables. A corner of the garden was designated as a vegetable plot. Lao Qiao could recognize my grandfather's preferences and arranged the seasonal vegetables appropriately. At the same time, he could also prune flower branches and knew some planting techniques. Undoubtedly, he and the old nanny formed a unique position among the servants. Lao Qiao regarded the flowers and trees as important as my grandfather. Whoever picked the fruit would be scolded. I remember that once the driver stole a few branches of cherries, Lao Qiao grumbled for a long time. But the next day, half of that cherry tree was chopped down, and Lao Qiao was so angry that he didn't even eat. But when he was drinking, his temper was unexpectedly gentle. After a day's work, a brightly polished kerosene lamp, half a bottle of liquor, and twenty copper coins for sauced meat were his little world. When he had a few drinks, he would tell a series of past events. His wife who eloped, his son who died at the age of sixteen, his three years of military service, the gunshot wound on his arm... Finally, he opened his red eyes and sighed, "I've been through everything."

Among the people above, only Lao Qiao is still alive. Although he is more than sixty years old, his hair is still black, but his back is bent. Closing my eyes, I clearly remember my grandfather's chubby, long face with a few strands of beard, my grandmother's gentle and kind smile, and the old nanny's wrinkled face. But I can't grasp them. They are so far away from me, so far away... Like a kite with a broken string.

In the past twenty years, the old home has undergone too many changes. After the death of my grandparents, the garden gradually became desolate. Because the descendants didn't need them, the paint on the painted pavilion was peeling off, and the window lattices were skewed out of shape. Occasionally running inside, the dust-covered book boxes and the water-stained drafts of my grandfather's writings filled my heart with inexplicable melancholy. The parasol tree in front of the window was riddled with ant damage, and an air-raid shelter was built in the center of the garden. Everything has changed. The prosperity of the garden in the past, along with my grandfather's cough and my childhood, was deeply buried. I am not obsessed with the bones of the old home. I know that all good things will pass and disappear. But when I think of the peaceful atmosphere of my grandfather drinking and reciting poetry at that time, that kind of leisurely and peaceful mood, I can't stop my sadness.

### Revisit to West Lake

— Ma Gongyu

Spring news speaks only of war, yet I come to West Lake to hear singing; twenty years have passed, the scene has changed, ten miles of open space, I let my shoulders jostle with the crowd, dreams of the temple are gone, leaving a sense of loss, the ritual at Longhong has ended, leaving much emotion (with the Spring Festival at Xiling Seal Society); happy that old friends are still abundant, we sat among the thorns for seven days, faces flushed with wine.

### Pine

— Ke Ding

### Family Letter

— Hui Zhi

In the dead of winter, when cold rain tapped at the window and snowflakes fluttered, you secretly left the isolated island in that silver world, enduring bitterness and saying goodbye to your loving mother and me. At that time, although you tried your best to use reason to restrain the melancholy in your heart, how could you have known that the grief of your mother and me was even greater than your own feelings as a wandering son?

In the past, you often told me to "be independent," unwilling to be intoxicated in an ivory tower. You wanted to escape this atmosphere surrounded by low pressure, pursue the highest ideals of young people. I knew that in your heart, that long-stirred emotion had broken through the dike solidified in your heart. This city, this isolated island, this magic city, you had nothing to linger over.

However, in these days, do you know what kind of life your mother and I have been living, and how anxious we are for you to go to a distant and unfamiliar land with no relatives, and how worried we are about your wandering life of climbing mountains and wading through water? Fortunately, after a year, we received your letter from Jincheng, knowing that you had traveled eight thousand miles from Jinhua via Shangrao to Chengdu. The old man and I finally calmed down. However, for a long time, we did not receive any news from you again.

Time passed like a shooting star. When the banner of victory was fluttering on the city walls of the recovered areas, how excited I was! Mother also happily showed a smile that she had not had in the past few years, saying, "This is truly a blessing given to us by God. Your brother can come back soon, and we will reunite to have a good time." After hearing this, I was so happy that I didn't even want to eat, quietly waiting for your return, bringing happiness to our whole family. However, we didn't even have any news from you.

It wasn't until last spring that the green messenger delivered a double-registered letter from Washington. When I received that unusually unfamiliar and heavy letter, I was very surprised. Looking closely, I realized it was your letter. The emotions revealed in your scribbled handwriting gave my mother and me infinite comfort. Unexpectedly, you had joined the air force and even traveled across the ocean to the United States to study. This was truly beyond our expectations.

Batch after batch of air force soldiers have returned home. I think your return is not far away. I hope that you will drive a B29 Superfortress, cross the Pacific Ocean, and safely fly back to the skies of your motherland, returning to the home you haven't seen for six years. Your relatives and friends here are waiting for you.

### One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"Of course, it's good to be on the same path, we can take care of each other - let's do this, we'll advance gradually using a 20-yard increment method; try to avoid the enemy as much as possible, and the best strategy is not to take action; the purpose is only to respond - if we already have someone inside - if there's time to come out, of course we can lead the large team and advance smoothly; if there's not enough time or it's too difficult, we'll provide internal support from inside..." Shouyi determined this method and said to the short man, "Please pay attention, the large team may arrive soon; once they arrive, please ask them to encircle and attack on three sides according to the original plan!"

Why does this original plan only encircle on three sides? What is the intention of leaving that fourth side open? It turns out this is an extremely refined method of using troops; encircling on all four sides will create a "cornered beast" mentality in the enemy; "cornered beasts" may disregard everything and desperately try to break out a bloody path. Moreover, on Hejian Shouyi's side, there is still the weakness of being afraid to harm the valuable object, lest they accidentally kill Pingzi, which would be a waste of effort.

Unbelievably, just when Shouyi Hejian and the short man had finished their discussion and were about to take action, they suddenly heard gunfire coming from the bandit den in the distance, followed by a siren sounding like a ghost's wail, making a chaotic noise. There were actually two searchlights on the roof, emitting two dazzling beams of light, turning around to search in all directions.

"This is a lawless act! What gives these things the right to act so recklessly in someone else's country?" Seeing how rampant the Japanese could be in Shanghai, which had not fallen, Hejian felt strange.

"Quick... follow me!" Shouyi leaped out of the car and shouted in a low voice to Hejian.

Why was Shouyi so anxious? In his imagination, he believed that the four naughty young ladies of Bai Ren Zhuang, and perhaps others, had already attacked this nest and had been discovered by the enemy, which is why they were making such a fuss. With this commotion, he thought that the group of naughty people might already be surrounded by the enemy. Therefore, he could not help but be anxious. Although Shouyi and Hejian were only two people, they could still provide support; moreover, the abilities of the two were quite strong.

The two men rushed forward for dozens of steps, and in the shadows they saw a figure rushing towards them. The man was running and signaling an alert. Shouyi heard that it was one of his own and gave the signal in response.

"09...?"

"...15!"

After confirming the password, the man immediately stopped and said, "The situation has changed!" with a mix of Chinese and Japanese accent.

"What happened? Tell me quickly!" Shouyi simply spoke in Japanese.

"It sounds like there's infighting inside; the tone of one of the leaders is scolding people, and the sound is very chaotic; I couldn't understand clearly for a moment, and I was afraid of being seen by the lights, so I came to report..."

"Go report it then!" Shouyi shouted at the man, beckoned to Hejian, and ran straight toward the wasteland. Both of these men had won championships in running and walking competitions, so a few dozen yards of road, plus a few dozen yards of wide wasteland, were not worth mentioning. But because they had to avoid the enemy's hidden posts and searchlights! Of course, they couldn't be as fast as lightning like in a race; they could only advance by flashing, dodging, running, and stopping, like playing hide-and-seek. They had originally agreed on a 20-yard increment method, but now, due to the change in the situation, they changed it to a 10-yard, or even a 5-6-yard increment.

### Rambling Alone

— Wang Cong

Today, Mr. Ding Tang gave me a piece of calligraphy, which read:

"History says that Du Gongbu died from eating beef. I have tried to investigate the reason, which cannot be separated from two paths: one is that the beef was rotten and poisoned him, and the other is that he was starved for too long and ate too much at once, which he could not digest. I am afraid that the latter is closer to the truth. Gongbu was poor and often starved. Speaking of it, there is still pain."

After reading it, I laughed loudly, and after laughing, I felt great pain. Thinking of myself, those who make a living by writing all suffer the same way.

And the so-called "engineers of human souls" are not as good as the clay sculptures in broken temples that are worshiped by the ignorant people.

What's the reason for the popularity of the land god of wealth over the poems of Du Zimei?

The God of Wealth Bodhisattva enshrined in the temple holds a steel whip in his right hand and rides a fierce tiger under his trousers. I think the original creators must have had other meanings.

The reason why the God of Wealth can be rich is that he has a steel whip and a fierce tiger.

Those who are obsessed with wealth! You don't have to kneel in front of the seat of the God of Wealth. I advise you, if you don't have weapons like atomic bombs or pistols, you should quickly run to the kitchen in the back and quickly grab your kitchen knife. If you don't have a fierce tiger, you can replace it with a fierce dog; otherwise, a fierce man will do.

### The Tragedy of a Fallen Woman: On the Box Corpse Case in Anqing

— Xu Zhou

Recently, Nie Xiequn, a lecturer at Anqing University, murdered his "fallen woman." His behavior was far more sinister than that of "Lin Daojun" in the movie "Return in Glory." Is it that the movie story cannot keep up with reality, or is the sinister nature of reality far beyond the imagination of ordinary intellectuals?

Mr. Lu Xun once said: "Due to deeper worldly wisdom, I cannot help but think more harshly about certain phenomena, but as a result, the harshness of reality is often greater than my imagination. This is really something that cannot be helped." (Approximate meaning) Please don't think this is a joke. The mediocre masses who take truth as a joke will one day eat the bitter fruit of their foolishness. In Chinese society, it is not easy for someone who is willing to think deeply to laugh a few times easily. A romantic intellectual who indulges in dreams, seeing the cruelty of reality, can only be a pessimist, let alone other realists. Even the realist's pen cannot keep up with the cruelty of reality, and can only cry out helplessly. This on the one hand illustrates the lamentable nature of intellectuals, and on the other hand confirms that China does indeed have its "special national conditions."

This Anqing University lecturer, Nie Xiequn, is a complete intellectual with extremely high cultural cultivation. However, let's see how he treats his "fallen woman"?

"(A news report from Anqing) Nie Xiequn is a lecturer at the Law School of Anqing University and a graduate of Wuhan University. His first wife, Chen Zuoqun, has been married for many years and has a daughter named Juying, who is already fourteen years old. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, Nie transferred to the rear, and Chen gradually became a "fallen woman." In the thirty-third year, Nie remarried a woman from Hubei named Yu Liufang as an anti-Japanese war wife. After the victory, Yu Liufang discovered that Nie had another wife and complained incessantly. Nie vowed to divorce Chen, otherwise, he would use force. ... Unexpectedly, on the eighteenth, Chen Zuoqun suddenly came with her daughter. That night, Nie had Chen share the same bed with him. In the middle of the night, Nie stuffed Chen's mouth with cotton, called Yu up, and together they strangled Chen's throat with gauze. Chen could not make a sound... After she died, Nie and Yu put the corpse in a canvas box, planning to throw it into the river..."

This is the sensational box corpse case in Anqing. The main culprit was actually a university lecturer. What is strange is that until the day before the crime, he was still teaching "Ethics" and "Introduction to Philosophy" at Anqing University. I don't know if his "Ethics" included the item "How to deal with a fallen woman." If not, it doesn't matter. His "teaching by example" is much stronger than his "teaching by words."

I am thinking that if someone dares to adapt the Anqing box corpse case into a movie, then Zhao Dan's "Return in Glory" will be overshadowed, which can be predicted.

### Miss Jiang Ying's Solo Recital Held Today at the Lyceum Theatre

### Mr. Wu Zhengqian's Solo Concert

— Sound Harmony

The renowned tenor Professor Wu Zhengqian will hold a solo concert at the Lyceum Theatre on June 1st. This is an outstanding solo recital following the soprano Jiang Ying's concert. I am happy to provide readers with a brief introduction to several special programs.

The repertoire includes songs from various Chinese and foreign composers, and the "Drinking Song" from Verdi's opera "La Traviata." Among them are Purcell's "I Attempt from Love's Sickness to Fly" from the late 17th century—an excerpt from the incidental music of the drama "The Indian Queen," Schubert's "Erlkönig," Tchaikovsky's "None But the Lonely Heart," and Bizet's "Agnus Dei" from the opera "Carmen," all of which are long-established and popular songs.

Regarding the works of Chinese composers, he has chosen Jiang Dingxian's "National Elegy," He Luting's "On the Jialing River," and Zhao Yuanren's "How Can I Not Think of Her," all of which are well-known pieces familiar to music audiences. I would especially like to introduce and recommend the three folk songs from our country's border regions that Professor Wu will be singing this time:

(1) "In That Faraway Place," a Qinghai folk song, with accompaniment arranged by Chen Tianhe.

(2) "Coachman's Song," a Xinjiang folk song, with accompaniment arranged by Yan Liangkun.

(3) Kangding Love Song, a Xikang folk song, with accompaniment arranged by Jiang Dingxian.

These three folk songs are not only extremely popular tunes in the border regions, but their mood and style are also very special, and they are sure to give listeners a fresh feeling.

### "The Lost Weekend"

— Man

"The Lost Weekend" was one of the most moving dramas of last year, winning four Academy Awards: Best Actor Ray Milland, Best Director Billy Wilder, Best Screenplay Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, and Best Producer Charles Brackett. This film has now arrived in Shanghai and will be released soon at the Cathay Theatre.

"The Lost Weekend" tells the story of an alcoholic's drinking spree. He repeatedly tries to quit drinking but fails. He even steals things to get alcohol, causing him shame and hatred, and he nearly commits suicide. The performance is exceptionally tense, and Ray Milland's portrayal of inner turmoil is a great achievement.

### Hirohito Takes to the Streets

— Bao Qing

According to the recent Tokyo Daily News, the Emperor of Japan, after the resolution of the political situation, will tour Kyoto, Osaka, Wakayama, and other places. This descendant of Emperor Jimmu, who in the past "inherited the ancestral legacy and ascended to the throne of an unbroken line for ten thousand generations," and who will henceforth be "the symbol of the State of Japan and of the unity of the Japanese people," knows that in the past "the great power of governing the State was inherited from our ancestors and will be passed on to our descendants," while publicly "his position is based on the will of the Japanese people, who hold sovereign power." He understands the inevitability of the times and the environment. Therefore, on the first New Year's Day after the end of the war, he issued a rescript stating that he was not a god and that the people should not believe in myths. In this way, Hirohito made an unprecedented public statement in Japanese history, beginning to show that he wanted to be close to the people and to grasp the overall will of the nation. The second step was to take to the streets and approach the people.

For example, in mid-February and March of last year: On February 19th, he wore a light suit, sat in a car, and traveled without any guards to Kawasaki, Tsurumi, Yokohama, and other places near Tokyo in Kanagawa Prefecture to inspect the post-war recovery of factories, municipal administration, and residential areas. On March 1st, he went to a place near Tokyo to inspect the lives of war orphans and visited an agricultural association warehouse. Farmers asked the government for rice, and his conversation with the district head, who also served as the head of the agricultural association, was recorded.

Last November, Yang Ge, a reporter from the International News Service, came to Shanghai from Japan and mentioned that when he witnessed Hirohito's tour of Nagoya, the crowd waiting for the Emperor stretched for eighteen miles, including both the old and the young. He also said that 30,000 photos of the Emperor, which had been banned from display, reappeared after the uniforms were changed to civilian clothes.

When the new Japanese constitution was established, Emperor Hirohito and his wife rode in a carriage out of the palace and accepted cheers from the people in front of the palace, but only twenty to thirty thousand people gathered to watch. On the third of this month, when celebrating the implementation of the new constitution, the situation was even more desolate. In the cold wind and drizzle, no more than ten thousand people braved the rain to celebrate in front of the palace. His aides had advised him not to attend due to the bad weather, but he insisted on participating, only appearing in the square for three minutes. On the day before the implementation of the new constitution, he even held an unprecedented press conference, directly answering some unimportant questions from reporters.

The Japanese people under conservative forces always have sharp eyes and know that the wheels of time are moving forward, especially since the Emperor has declared that he is not a god. Therefore, some people believe that if the Emperor is not a god, then it does not matter whether he exists or not; or they say that since it is a democracy, then there is no need for an Emperor! However, the older generation still supports retaining the Emperor, even if it is only as a symbol.

### The White Elephant (Part 2)

— Feng Zikai

After that, the calico cat came often, and the white elephant went often, and no one thought it strange. I found the white elephant even more adorable. Because she wasn't like Mr. Lu Xun's cat, who made strange noises on the roof when in love, disturbing his reading and writing, so he used a long bamboo pole to hit her. Later, her belly gradually grew larger. After about two or three months, her belly became especially large, looking just like a white elephant. We took an old box, removed the lid, and used it as her birthing bed. One day, she went into labor and gave birth to five kittens: three pure white and two calico. Everyone congratulated her, and we immediately called the male worker Zhang Hong to go to the Yue Fei Temple to buy fresh fish to nourish her, and the girls gave her Carnation Milk every day.

The kittens grew bigger day by day, and after two weeks, they could crawl. The white elephant was very patient in raising her children, lying down day and night, letting the five kittens entangle her. Her body was huge, and to the five kittens, she was like a hill. They climbed up and down at will, like tourists climbing Lonely Hill on West Lake. It was truly a beautiful sight!

Unexpectedly, one day, one of the calico kittens died. My young child, Xin Mei, cried a lot and used a beautiful cigarette box as a coffin, giving her a burial in the grass by West Lake. We cherished the remaining four kittens especially. My family had seven children, three of whom were away, and four in Hangzhou. They divided the four kittens among themselves, each adopting one. The eldest daughter, Chen Bao, adopted the calico cat, while the third daughter, Ning Qing, the youngest daughter, Yi Yin, and the young child, Xin Mei, each adopted a white cat. This was just like the villagers adopting out their children to the bodhisattvas in the temple, hoping for protection, longevity, and wealth. Perhaps because they were not bodhisattvas and could not provide protection, after a while, another white kitten died. There were three kittens left, one calico and two white, and they were all very healthy. They could already eat fish and rice and no longer relied entirely on milk. The white elephant's maternal labor gradually decreased as well. She no longer had to lie down day and night to feed them and could go out for walks at any time or jump onto the girls' laps to sleep. The girls laughed at her, "You're a mother, but you still want to be held?" She ignored them and just went to sleep in your arms.

### The White Elephant and Her Five Kittens

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

His mind was even more chaotic now. Many people used to praise him as being the most resourceful, and although he had not openly admitted it, he had always been proud of it in his heart, because he understood the psychology of all kinds of people and knew what methods to use to deal with them. Moreover, he also had a kind of resilient spirit. Even when things seemed hopeless, he would often deliberately look at them optimistically, continuing to work hard against the odds. This method had indeed helped him solve many difficult problems, but today's problem was simply too difficult. He almost dared not trust himself anymore.

He hung his head, clenched his teeth, and walked forward distractedly. He felt that this road seemed much longer than when he had come, as if he could never finish walking it.

When he returned to the highway checkpoint, the situation there was much more lively than before. Four cars from Yishan were parked there, and the people who got off the cars to rest and the people waiting there to catch a ride were mixed together. Seven or eight people from the theater troupe were also mixed in the crowd.

Zhu Zhaonian wanted to squeeze next to the cars to see what was going on, but his head bumped into Lu Qian.

"It's no use, there's no hope!" He limped forward to greet him. "The roofs of the cars are full of people, no one can get on."

Old Zhu frowned. He could vaguely hear Lu Qian forcefully swallowing a long sigh that was about to be released.

The most active and spirited people in the crowd were four men wearing summer cloth Hawaiian shirts and khaki shorts. They were obviously the drivers of the four cars; everyone followed them, going back and forth in a mess, offering cigarettes, and smiling obsequiously, as if they were serving phoenixes.

Zhu Zhaonian stared at the five white characters "Trade Commission" painted on the four cars and pondered for a long time. Suddenly, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a very old pocket diary, flipping through it hurriedly.
