### The National Economic Council Approves Imposing a National Reconstruction Special Tax Starting at 5 Billion Yuan; President Zhang Indicates Resolve to Stabilize Cotton Prices

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the plan for levying a National Reconstruction Special Tax, the National Economic Council, during its meeting on the 28th at noon, based on discussions from the expanded symposium held a few days ago, further deliberated and decided to retain the name "National Reconstruction Special Tax." The target of the levy is Chinese individuals (i.e., natural persons). The objects of taxation are: (1) land and buildings, (2) current deposits, foreign exchange, government bonds, and stocks, (3) gold and foreign currency, (4) movable and immovable property of Chinese citizens abroad, (5) net asset value of sole proprietorships or partnerships, (6) automobiles and ships, (7) machinery, goods, etc. The starting point for taxation is set at 5 billion yuan, to be implemented first in major cities across the country. Nominations will still be made by local public opinion organs, and supervisory bodies will also be established, composed of members from various sectors, so they cannot be regarded as redundant organizations. This proposal will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for revision and formulation in the short term, referencing the original plan, and then sent to the Executive Yuan for approval. It will be implemented after the legislative process is completed. This case has been discussed multiple times by the National Economic Council, and an expanded symposium was held to gather extensive opinions, bringing it to a conclusion. In addition to discussing this case, the National Economic Council also discussed three important cases on the 28th: (1) The Executive Yuan submitted the National Government Committee's proposal on consolidating finance, stabilizing prices, and the National Economic Council was instructed to discuss the fourth item, which is to strictly implement economic inspections and prohibit hoarding and speculation, and private price increases. The meeting resolved to hand this case over to the "Economic Reform Plan Formulation and Implementation Methods Price Group" for handling. (2) The Shanghai fuel supply problem, researching methods to prevent coal shortages. The preliminary discussion mentioned the supply and demand situation and the current situation. As for the famine prevention measures, the temporary solution is to find ways to transport 50 tons of coal stored in Kailuan and 40 tons of coal stored in Fuxin to the south. The fundamental solution includes increasing production, strengthening transportation, and protecting ports. After discussion, the meeting approved the principles and sent them to the Executive Yuan for approval. According to a participating committee member, during the discussion of this case on the 28th, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Communications, and the National Resources Commission expressed different opinions on transportation issues and criticized each other. (3) The "Implementation Plan for Developing the Textile Industry and Regulating the Supply of Yarn and Cloth" submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This case is of great importance and involves the entire policy. Some participants advocated partial control or no management. President Zhang, however, attached great importance to the continuous rise in cotton prices in various regions and expressed his determination to stabilize them, as there was no reason for the price increase. It was resolved to hand this case over to Wang Yunwu, Zuo Juezhong, Chen Qitian, Weng Wenhao, Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Lou Tongsun, Wu Yunchu, Huang Yuanbin, Xiao Zheng, Pan Xulun, Gu Yuzhen and other twelve people for review, convened by Wang Yunwu. The meeting today was chaired by Zhang Qun, starting from 4:00 PM and ending at 7:00 PM.

### The Control Yuan Officially Announces Proposals for Political Reform

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Control Yuan officially announced the revised Proposals for Political Reform on the 28th. The proposals were submitted to the National Government by the Control Yuan on June 11th of this year. The full text is recorded as follows:

Regarding the urgent implementation of matters for suggesting political reform, please consider adopting them. We believe that the eight-year war of resistance has caused excessive losses to the country. After victory, it was originally hoped that post-war recovery and construction would proceed smoothly, gradually leading to prosperity and happiness. However, in the past two years, the economy has been exhausted, prices have soared, industry and commerce have declined, disputes have been frequent, society has become increasingly unstable, and the people's suffering has not diminished. This is mainly because the war has not stopped, and the government has been unable to implement all post-war recovery and construction plans, leaving the people without the opportunity to recuperate and thrive. Moreover, the current personnel appointments and administration are not satisfactory, and a small number of illegal officials abuse their power for personal gain, disregarding the country and the nation, leading to the abandonment of principles and increasing hardship for the people. The decline in administrative efficiency and the decline in service spirit are even more obvious. If this continues, the country and the nation will fall into decline after the victory of the War of Resistance. As supervisors, the members of the Control Yuan, examining the current situation, feel endangered and cannot remain silent. In addition to the various national construction matters for which the government already has plans and has issued clear orders for implementation, it is requested that the initial intentions be thoroughly implemented and that practical results be strived for. Here are the proposals for reforms that should be urgently implemented in the general political aspects, which are presented separately as follows:

1.  Severely punish corruption to restore discipline: (1) Those who commit corruption crimes should be dealt with with the most severe punishment. (2) Encourage people to report corruption. (3) To prevent corruption, officials' property registration should be implemented immediately. (4) Strengthen the work of the Political Affairs Officials Disciplinary Committee and the Civil Servants Disciplinary Committee, and promptly establish a Military Officers Disciplinary Committee. (5) The impeachment cases that the Control Yuan has transferred for disciplinary action should be handled promptly by the relevant disciplinary organs according to the law, and should not be delayed, allowing the impeached persons to remain at large. Furthermore, personnel who have been disciplined and suspended from appointment should not be reappointed under any pretext during the suspension period. (6) The cases of malpractice that have been investigated by the Enemy and Puppet Property Investigation Team should be handled according to the law and the results should be announced. (7) The main illegal personnel and merchants involved in the last gold rush and the current grain and food price rush should be punished according to the law.

2.  Practice strict frugality and severely ban extravagance: (1) Continue to implement the frugal measures during the War of Resistance. (2) Strictly prohibit the import and sale of luxury goods. (3) Heavy taxes should be levied on business and private cars, and the issuance of licenses should be limited. (4) To promote frugality and increase administrative efficiency, civil and military officials should stop going to various places for summer retreats.

3.  Local government officials who are military personnel should be replaced by civil servants within a specified period.

4.  The heads of all agencies should absolutely prohibit concurrent positions to focus on their duties.

5.  Regarding the selection of senior government officials, attention should be paid to talents from all regions of the country, and appropriate distribution should be given to avoid one area or family occupying a majority of important positions.

6.  Implement a meritocracy, improve the personnel system, and break the control of factions.

7.  Implement a clear division of powers and responsibilities. Each agency must have a clear set of powers and responsibilities that cannot be changed due to personnel relationships.

8.  Abolish the special local system.

9.  Abolish redundant agencies, lay off surplus personnel, and adjust the organization of various agencies to increase administrative efficiency and save national treasury expenditures: (1) Agencies with the same nature should be merged, such as the various levels of cargo tax bureaus and direct tax bureaus, which should be merged into one tax agency. The Ministry of Food should be abolished immediately, and food administration and land tax should be unified, and the tax agencies and personnel should be greatly reduced. (2) Agencies that are too large, such as the Ministries of National Defense, Economic Affairs, and Finance, and their affiliated agencies, should be appropriately abolished or simplified. (3) Agencies with too many personnel should be reduced, and it is strictly forbidden for responsible personnel to lay off employees while simultaneously hiring new ones. (4) Agencies that are not properly established should be rationally closed and reorganized, and the agencies should have appropriate mergers or affiliations.

10. Enforce the Public Treasury Law to prevent the misuse of public funds and the use of public funds for personal gain and malpractice.

11. Strictly investigate the registration and disposal of the property and materials of various agencies to prevent malfeasance.

12. Improve and standardize the treatment of public education personnel: (1) The treatment of all public education personnel should be appropriately adjusted according to the price index, the salary based on rice system, or other reasonable standards, to ensure that the treatment they regularly receive can guarantee their livelihood. (2) The treatment of personnel in various public transportation, enterprise, finance, and financial agencies, except for those stipulated by the central government, should not be established under false pretenses, otherwise, they should be considered as corruption.

Collect progressive property taxes within a specified period. (3) Crack down on all bureaucratic capital enterprises and commercial establishments with senior officials as their background. (4) For land tax collection, a minimum exemption amount for all land should be stipulated, and efforts should be made to equalize the tax burden.

(2) Strictly restrict the establishment of commercial banks, money houses, and silver firms, and effectively supervise their business operations. Strictly prohibit commercial firms from selling their signs. (3) Crack down on underground banks and brokerage firms. (4) Strictly supervise and restrict the operations of exchanges and all similar exchanges.

16. Restrict the adverse phenomena of economic and administrative division, divergence, and antagonism: (1) The various economic, financial, and transportation agencies must not create their own special systems in terms of personnel and business by virtue of their responsible functions. (2) Localities must not arbitrarily prohibit the export of local products for local interests, regardless of the national situation. (3) The military, economic, transportation, and other agencies must not purchase equipment and materials from abroad directly in the form of foreign debts. All foreign debts since the War of Resistance must be consolidated and unified. (4) There should be effective supervision and management measures for the reserve of all foreign debts. Respectfully, these suggestions are submitted for review and forwarding to the National Government for adoption and implementation.

However, this will not affect the opening date of the National Assembly. Regarding the guarantees requested by the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, Hong stated: "The Kuomintang is willing to fully assist the two parties in conducting the election, but cannot provide guarantees, otherwise it would be tantamount to admitting to rigging the general election, and at the same time it is indeed unable to guarantee it."

### The Envoy from the United States Issues a Statement in Korea, Denouncing the Chinese Communists for Spreading Rumors; General Howard Calls for Aid to China

[United Press Dispatch from Seoul, 28th] Special Envoy Wedemeyer issued a statement here today denouncing the Chinese Communists for their false criticism of his work in China. The statement said that the Chinese Communist radio broadcast that the special envoy delegation's investigation revealed that the United States had obtained many military bases in mainland China and Taiwan as a reward for assistance, which is completely fictitious.

[United Press Dispatch from Honolulu, 28th] Former Commander of the US Marine Corps in China, Major General Howard, gave a speech at the Chamber of Commerce here today, strongly advocating that the United States aid the Chinese government and extend the "Truman Doctrine" to Asia to stop the advance of communism.

Whether he can pass safely at that time will depend on how the special security agency handles it.

### Watching the Rulers of Poland at the Garden Party at the Prime Minister's Residence

— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

You can't see Russian soldiers on the streets of Warsaw. This is something people outside the "Iron Curtain" can't imagine. During my week in Warsaw, I only encountered three Russian young men wearing red star caps, once on an electric military vehicle, and twice on "Masakowska" Avenue. I didn't find any special friendship between Poles and Russian soldiers. Instead, the groups of Polish troops and those Polish officers wearing "military emblem" diamond-shaped caps were very noticeable. The uniforms of the Polish troops were very inconsistent. Generally speaking, the "Montgomery suits" bestowed upon them by the London government are now very, very rare. When the "curfew" is in effect at night, they are all uniformly armed with Russian bear cat guns. The dirty and tattered uniforms of many "private first class," "privates," and "privates second class" reminded me of the difficult situation we were in during the late stages of the War of Resistance.

A question that is not easy to answer is how many Russian troops are still left in Poland? Some people told me it was 200,000 people, and some Americans estimated it was about 100,000 people. If the creation of historical facts is determined by objective circumstances, then Stalin and Tsar Alexander have both recognized the strategic importance of Poland. Emperor Alexander once said at the Vienna Conference: "Whoever wants to oppose me, just say it outright, I have 200,000 troops stationed in Warsaw, who has the ability to shake me?" I didn't hear Molotov say the same thing at the Paris Conference, but everyone understands that the big bear in the north has never lightly let go of Poland.

The current ruler of the 27 million Poles is the Polish Communist Party. The hero of the Communist Party, Bolesław Bierut, is now the President of the Republic of Poland. Bierut is fifty-five years old this year, a revolutionary who has tasted the "life of exile." In his own biography, he said that he was born into a poor peasant family, and his hometown is a village near Lublin. In his youth, he was the famous leader of the "student movement," and many people called him the "manufacturer of strikes." Before the First European War, Poland was under the iron curtain of Russia, Germany, and Austria. Bierut organized a powerful student group, and after Lenin's revolution, this group made contact with the Russian Communist Party.

It was probably from that time on that Bierut became an international communist party member. In 1922, Poland, under the leadership of Piłsudski, completed the restoration movement. Bierut was dissatisfied with the then independent regime because he was pro-Russia. He translated many pamphlets introducing Russia's new economic system, and was therefore arrested and imprisoned.

Six months of imprisonment forced Bierut to flee to Moscow, and he didn't return to Poland until 1932. Then he was arrested again and sentenced to seven years in prison, until the outbreak of World War I. Some people say that during this period, Bierut did not spend his days in prison. He was sent by Moscow to Spain to serve as a "political worker" in the People's Army. Someone asked Bierut, and he firmly denied it. Anyway, during that period, the Polish people never heard his name. His name appeared in Poland from the time when the "Polish People's Council" was officially established in Soviet Russia.

On New Year's Day 1944, Bierut was elected Chairman of the Polish National Committee. In July of that year, the Polish army, in cooperation with the Russian army, stepped into Polish territory from the Eastern Front. Bierut issued the so-called Declaration of the Polish Restoration Movement on July 22 of that year, which is now the new National Day of Poland. Later, the Lublin government was established, the London government was merged, and then the general election, the party purge, one good show after another, Bierut was the direct leader.

Bierut has a handsome face. Until now, many simple "villagers" in many remote areas still don't know who Bierut is in Poland. Many Poles in Warsaw who are regarded as "counter-revolutionaries" often secretly curse him. What is he, worthy to be the President of Poland? The manager of a large store on Masakowska Avenue told me that Poland is now a world of bandits. The exiles who used to sit in prison all year round are now important government officials. Afterwards, I learned that the Communist Party regime is now planning to add heavy taxes to the stores. They plan to use a "cooperative system" to replace private commercial capital.

### UNRRA Resumes Transporting Relief Goods to Communist Areas; Chairman Approves Ten Measures to Ensure Materials Are Effectively Distributed to the People

[Our City News] The Executive Yuan announced: Since UNRRA proposed strengthening relief efforts in Communist-controlled areas, the transport of relief materials to North China has been suspended for many days pending a response from our government. It is understood that Chairman Chiang has approved ten measures in response to UNRRA's suggestions. The UNRRA Central Committee met this week and, apart from minor technical revisions, has in principle accepted the Chairman's approved measures as a basis for negotiations with the Communists. It is reported that relevant parties are currently in contact with the Communist side based on the principles agreed to by the UNRRA Central Committee. Once an agreement is reached, the transport of relief materials to North China is expected to resume quickly. The ten measures are detailed below:

"Provisional Measures for Distributing UNRRA Relief Materials to People in Communist Areas" (1) The purpose of these measures is to ensure the effective distribution of UNRRA relief materials to the people in Communist-controlled areas. (2) The observation, supervision, and reporting of the distribution of these materials shall be handled impartially, in the same manner as in government-controlled areas. (3) UNRRA, together with the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), will closely monitor the delivery of materials to the end-users. If any misuse or non-compliance with UNRRA's principles is discovered, this material supply plan shall be re-evaluated immediately. (4) UNRRA and CRRRA personnel involved in this work shall regularly report to the UNRRA China Office and CRRRA on the distribution, transportation, and use of materials. (5) To enable its personnel to carry out the supervision stage of material distribution, as stipulated in the basic agreement, and to inspect warehouses and distribution stations within the area at any time, UNRRA will strengthen its personnel in the area and insist on their complete freedom of movement. (6) Within the months of August, September, and October of this year, 50,000 tons of materials will be transported into the Communist areas. The types and tonnage of materials shall be limited to those agreed upon by UNRRA and CRRRA. (7) The first month's materials will be transported through the Yantai port. During the period of UNRRA material transport, the government's army, navy, and air force will provide protection for UNRRA materials and personnel. At the same time, the Communist side must absolutely not use the port for any military activities, including prohibiting all ships except UNRRA vessels from entering or leaving the area. The second route for transporting materials is south along the Grand Canal from Tianjin. The above measures apply to the second route as well. (8) The materials transported to Yantai in the first month must not exceed 10,000 tons. If the UNRRA China Office and CRRRA are satisfied with the work in the area (based on reports from their respective personnel), the distribution of materials will proceed according to the established plan. (9) For the second and third months, the transport of materials will be limited to 20,000 tons per month. (10) The Executive Yuan will designate the Ministry of National Defense and CRRRA to consult with UNRRA on detailed measures for supervising the distribution of materials, protecting transportation, and protecting personnel in the area.

Furthermore, UNRRA authorities have proposed a revision to the above-mentioned item 7 regarding "prohibiting all ships and wooden boats from entering or leaving," requesting that our government consider allowing "boats used by the people of the area for their livelihoods to enter and leave." At the same time, they have also requested that the provision in item 8, which stipulates that materials must not exceed 10,000 tons, be increased to 25,000 tons.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 28th] It has been learned that Cleveland stated yesterday before leaving for the provinces that 90% of the UNRRA materials for China have already arrived, with 10% still to be transported. Once the ban is lifted, they will prepare to transport 50,000 tons of materials to the Chinese Communist areas in North China and 38,000 tons to the Tianjin area.

### Four Banks Jointly Decide to Tighten Lending Policy; Stipulate Five Principles to Align with New Foreign Exchange Regulations

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Four Banks Joint Treasury held its 351st board meeting on the morning of the 28th, chaired by Zhang Qun. They continued to discuss the unresolved issues from the previous meeting regarding the tightening of lending policies. The government's revised foreign exchange control measures and import-export trade regulations have been announced and implemented, and all original lending policies should be reviewed and adjusted in light of the economic environment to ensure alignment. Five principles were approved as follows:

1.  Re-define the scope of lending and determine the target beneficiaries in accordance with priority: (1) Industries producing and selling daily necessities (including rice, wheat, coal, cotton yarn, cooking oil, sugar, salt, etc.) whose output is unstable or supply is disrupted and urgently need to increase production or accelerate transportation; (2) Basic industrial and mining enterprises whose products are daily necessities and can replace imported goods; (3) Public transportation and utility enterprises lacking working capital; (4) Export trade enterprises whose goods can generate foreign exchange. The above priority principles may be revised at any time based on actual needs.

2.  Strengthen pre-loan investigations and post-loan assessments, and strictly comply with the following regulations: (1) Personnel in charge of handling loans at banks and treasuries must be responsible for conducting pre-loan investigations. If any intentional oversight or concealment is found, they will be subject to disciplinary action depending on the severity of the circumstances; (2) The approved use of loans must be strictly adhered to and cannot be changed midway without approval; (3) Promote regular inspections to assess the effectiveness of loans. If it is discovered that loans have been diverted to uses other than those originally intended or that production performance is poor, the loans will be recalled in advance, and the matter will be referred to the competent authorities for disciplinary action.

3.  The original "Implementation Guidelines for Assisting Production" should be strictly implemented to ensure close coordination with relevant agencies.

4.  For industries producing daily necessities, order-based lending should be used as much as possible to recover goods and assist the government in controlling materials.

5.  All non-essential loans should be suspended, and all maturing loans should be recovered immediately without extension.

(3) Loan applications made directly by local banks and treasuries should be submitted to the headquarters for approval before processing.

### Hong Kong Labor Strike Remains at a Stalemate; Public Utilities Employees to Hold Joint Meeting Today; Will Also Demand Improved Treatment

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th] The Hong Kong labor strike remains at a stalemate. The further conditions proposed by the Chinese Workers' Strike Committee are still considered unacceptable by the employers. The workers' new proposal is to increase wages by 120% (the initial demand was an increase of 150%), with half as basic wages and half as cost-of-living allowances, while retaining the provision for an annual increase of one cent per hour. However, the employers insist on their original proposal, which is to increase basic wages by 20% and establish a system of annual increases in basic wages of one cent per hour up to a maximum of fifty cents. Hong Kong labor authorities are continuing to mediate. In addition, representatives of employees from the five major public utilities in Hong Kong, including tramways, electricity, telephone, gas, and Kowloon electricity, are scheduled to hold a joint meeting on the evening of the 29th to jointly demand improved treatment from employers. The issue of wage increases for technicians in the various public utilities will be raised by representatives of the Chinese Workers' Strike Committee to the employers.

### Hong Kong Governor Grantham Makes Remarks in Guangzhou

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th] The newly appointed Governor of Hong Kong, Grantham, recently hosted reporters here and made the following remarks: (1) The Hong Kong strike was purely caused by workers demanding wage increases. He is actively mediating and believes it will not become serious. (2) Regarding the contents of the economic agreement between China and Hong Kong, such as financial cooperation and anti-smuggling measures, technical issues still need to be studied, so it has not yet been announced. (3) After Hong Kong adopts the new system in the future, the number of council members will be 30 for both Britons and Chinese, and their powers will be equal. (4) Trade between Guangdong and Hong Kong is as close as lips and teeth, with close relations, shared interests, and shared harms. Therefore, he is very willing to work together to eliminate all trade barriers. He also stated: In the past, China and Britain fought side by side, sharing joys and sorrows. In the future, they should strengthen unity and continue to cooperate. Grantham did not respond to questions regarding the current economic situation in Britain and the devaluation of the pound. Regarding the issue of the Soviet Union purchasing tungsten ore in Hong Kong, he replied that he had not heard of it.

### China and Central Airlines Fare Increase Not Yet Approved by Ministry of Transportation; Company Officials Say Tickets Will Still Be Sold at Original Prices Today

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] There are rumors that China and Central Airlines will increase passenger and freight fares on all routes by 100% starting from the 29th due to the sharp increase in gasoline prices. However, according to officials at the two companies' Nanjing stations, this price increase has not been approved, and the stations have not received any notification from the headquarters. They guarantee that tickets for all routes will still be sold at the original prices on the 29th. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Transportation, the two companies have applied to adjust prices because the cost of aviation has increased sharply and cannot be sustained, but the ministry has not yet approved it.

[Central News Agency, Our City News] According to officials from China and Central Airlines, after the exchange rate with the US dollar changed, all airline equipment was purchased from the United States, resulting in a sharp increase in costs. Therefore, they recently applied to the Ministry of Transportation for permission to adjust prices and, as usual, prepared a list of various prices to be adjusted before sending it to major cities so that it could be implemented immediately upon arrival of the order. The Ministry of Transportation is still reviewing the matter.

### Liu Guangpei, Director of CRRRA Northeast Branch, Dismissed; Embezzlement Cases Handed Over to the Court

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th] Zai Fusheng, Director of the Distribution Department of CRRRA, arrived in Shenyang on the 27th and stated that the embezzlement accusations against Liu Guangpei, Director of the Northeast Branch, have been handed over to the court. Liu has been dismissed, and Deputy Director Nan Bingfang has been promoted to Director.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Zheng Daoshu, Deputy Director of CRRRA, who recently returned to Nanjing from Shanghai, responded to reporters' inquiries by stating that the Executive Yuan is establishing a Post-War Rehabilitation Committee after the closure of CRRRA. The organizational regulations are still under review and have not yet been submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion. The headquarters and branches of CRRRA are gradually closing down. Generally, the business of each branch can be concluded by the end of this year. The three branches in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Henan provinces will be delayed in closing due to the need to handle post-flood relief and rehabilitation.

### Southwestern Railway Trunk Line Actively Surveyed and Constructed

Guangzhou Bay to Liuzhou Section Surveyed

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 28th] The Ministry of Transportation is increasingly active in the construction of the southwestern railway trunk line in the four provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. According to Wu Rongqing, Chief Engineer of the Fourth District Bureau, the entire line from Guangzhou Bay to Liuzhou has been surveyed. The Liuzhou to Yishan section is already open to traffic. The Yishan to Hechi section is being rebuilt. The Hechi, Dushan, Duyun, and Guiyang sections are being actively constructed. To connect the railway from Chengdu to Chongqing, the Ministry of Transportation sent personnel to survey the route entering Sichuan via Zunyi, passing through Chishui, Xuyong, Luzhou, and reaching Chengdu to connect with the Sichuan-Chongqing Railway. The route from Kunming via Yiliang, Shizong, Luoping, Xingyi, Anlong, and Ceheng to connect with the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway is currently considered too long. It is proposed to change the route entering Sichuan via Guiyang. The route will pass through Dading northward to Xuyong, Luzhou, and Chengdu. For Yunnan Province, Zhaotong will be the starting point, passing through Xuanwei, Shuicheng, Dading, Xuyong, Luzhou, and Longchang to connect with the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. This route is shorter, easier to construct, and the Dading area is rich in coal and iron mines, providing many conveniences. Once approved by the Ministry of Transportation, construction can officially begin.

The aircraft fleet under the CRRRA Air Transport Squadron is now named after Chinese cities, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Shantou, Liuzhou, and Taiyuan. The first Nanjing aircraft has been repaired for 100 hours (as shown in the picture). (Photo by CRRRA)

### Re-examining the Smuggling Problem

The anti-smuggling agreement between China and Hong Kong was originally scheduled to be announced on the 23rd of this month. However, due to the impact of the pound's suspension of convertibility to the US dollar, the Hong Kong side needs to consider it further, and its announcement has been postponed. All parties are quite concerned about this. The smuggling problem is most serious between Hong Kong and Guangdong, and without the practical cooperation of the Hong Kong side, it is not easy to achieve further solutions.

Since the foreign exchange system reform, the fundamental causes of smuggling have been largely eliminated, and the severity of the problem seems to have eased compared to before. However, the secret import of Japanese goods has been discovered everywhere. Moreover, in addition to official prices and market prices, the black market for foreign exchange has not disappeared. If the black market exchange rate is too far from the market price, smuggling will still be profitable, and it may easily revive and return to its past rampant state. Furthermore, although the control of foreign exchange has been relaxed, the strict restrictions on import trade remain the same. Who can guarantee that goods that have not been permitted to be imported, and goods that have been permitted to be imported but are still in short supply due to quota restrictions, will not revert to their old ways and still see smuggling as the only solution?

Therefore, the China-Hong Kong agreement, while an important link in preventing smuggling, cannot completely eliminate this problem. In other words, regardless of whether this agreement can be implemented quickly, we should still do our best to make practical and comprehensive improvements as soon as possible.

Judging from the statements of various customs authorities, the current difficulties in anti-smuggling efforts are approximately four points: First, the lack of personnel, especially skilled personnel; second, the lack of equipment and vessels; third, the low level of compensation; and fourth, the strong background of smugglers, even with armed forces supporting them. The geographical relationship between Hong Kong and Guangdong is only one of the main reasons. Therefore, to effectively prevent smuggling, it is clear that we cannot completely rely on the cooperation of others but must develop our own strength and improve and strengthen ourselves in many ways to be effective. The government has already established special regulations for anti-smuggling and punishment methods. The penalties cannot be said to be lenient, and the difficulties of personnel compensation and equipment are not difficult to overcome. What we consider to be the greatest difficulty is not in the above points, nor in whether the China-Hong Kong agreement can be implemented quickly, but in personnel issues, that is, whether the supervisors have the ability to rectify discipline and the great courage of impartiality.

Looking back at past situations, those engaged in smuggling are not limited to unscrupulous merchants. Many smuggled goods may have been leaked from public institutions. Moreover, the forces assisting in anti-smuggling, whether at sea, on land, or in the air, sometimes even help smuggling and cover up smuggling. If this trend cannot be thoroughly changed quickly, what is the use of simply issuing prohibitions, even with anti-smuggling personnel and equipment? Even if the compensation is increased, and the allowances are generous, how can it be enough to offset the profits from corruption?

We are not saying that problems such as personnel, compensation, and equipment do not need to be solved. Rather, we are saying that the core issue lies in discipline. It is necessary to reward good deeds and punish wrongdoing, strictly implement rewards and punishments, and punish all those who violate laws and regulations, regardless of their identity or background, without any leniency, so that everyone knows the awe of national law and the possibility and impossibility of smuggling. Only then will all systems and tools be useful. Mencius said: "Laws cannot enforce themselves." Now, smuggled Japanese goods have been gradually discovered, and there are even reports of large quantities arriving in the north. The smuggling problem has entered a new stage. It is hoped that the responsible authorities will catch up quickly, earnestly prevent and maintain order, and not issue some perfunctory official documents or a single anti-smuggling order as the full extent of their abilities, nor be too lenient on themselves because the China-Hong Kong agreement will eventually be implemented. It should be known that anti-smuggling is just one type of financial administration, just like tax officials embezzling public funds. Wise supervisors should take full responsibility, take the initiative to control it, and make practical rectifications. It is also necessary to overcome all difficulties and fight against corrupt forces. If they allow them to blatantly destroy customs regulations, reduce national taxes, and endanger the entire national industry, and still turn a blind eye, or utter a few perfunctory words such as "we are trying our best to find a way" to perfunctorily answer, this cannot but be said to be a kind of shame in today's politics!

### Sun Yueqi Inspects Fuxin Coal Mine; Reportedly Most Coal Used in Northeast Depends on This Mine; Current Daily Output is 4,000 Tons Due to Insufficient Power Supply

[Our Newspaper, Fuxin, 27th] Sun Yueqi, Vice Chairman of the Resources Committee, arrived at the Fuxin Coal Mine at noon on the 26th to inspect it. Our reporter accompanied him. In the afternoon, accompanied by Guo Xiangyu, General Manager of the mine, he inspected the Power Bureau, the Haizhou Coal Washing Plant, the General Machinery Plant, and the Sunjiawan Open-Pit Coal Mine. Sun was very interested in the sand-turning of iron and steel and gazed at the open-pit mine for a long time. In the evening, after dining with all the staff, he chaired a work review meeting. On the morning of the 27th, he inspected the Xinqiu Mine, which has the highest output. The mine produces 2,300 tons per day, and the area of the open-pit mine is equal to that of Fushun. Sun is scheduled to return to Shenyang on the morning of the 28th and go to Benxi for inspection on the 29th. The Fuxin coalfield is located in the eastern mountainous area of Rehe, extending 180 kilometers in length and 50 kilometers in width. After exploration by the Japanese, the confirmed reserves are 565 million tons, and the undetermined portion is estimated to be 675 million tons. The total reserves should be 1.24 billion tons. After the September 18 Incident, the Japanese actively developed it on a large scale, making it the largest newly emerging coal mine in the Northeast. The mine was taken over on October 1, 1946. After a year of rectification, it has restored the daily output to 5,000 tons (the highest output during the Japanese management period was 15,000 tons). Since August 10, the output has been affected due to the damage of the Beipiao motor and insufficient power supply. The current daily coal output is 4,000 tons. According to our reporter's observation, the mine is a new mine that has not been mined for long, and there is hope for the future. However, the coal quality is poor and cannot be used for coal coking. It can only be used for locomotive boilers and household coal. According to Sun Yueqi, the reporter stated that most of the coal used in the Northeast currently depends on the Fuxin coal mine. Fushun is a large and dilapidated household, only with a false reputation.

According to unofficial estimates, the total value of the 10,410 pounds of banknotes transported is over 4 billion yuan.

### The Ruler of Poland, Continued from Page 1

After the general election in [Month] this year, Bierut was formally elected as the President of Poland. The British and American governments had lodged serious protests against that election, protesting the Communist Party's manipulation of the election and obstruction of the people's freedom to elect, and did not recognize the parliament elected in that election. On the day Bierut was sworn into office, the American Ambassador Bohlen was absent from the diplomatic corps. The Communist Party officials in the Polish government still remember this incident. It is said that several days after Bierut took office, he held a public banquet for the diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in Poland. This time, Bohlen was invited to attend. Afterwards, someone asked the American Ambassador why he did not attend the ceremony but came to the dinner. Bohlen replied cleverly, saying, "We did not recognize him as the formal president, but came to the dinner because of his old status as the interim president"!

I have not inquired whether the United States has now recognized Bierut's "status". Anyway, Bohlen has long since returned to the United States, and the new American Ambassador, Mr. Griffis, a rather optimistic American capitalist, his car is one of the most beautiful decorations in Warsaw. When he sees Chinese friends, he will raise his thumb to praise Chargé d'Affaires Bao Jinpu's "poker" playing as excellent. The Polish people are quite fond of such diplomats, especially today when the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is subtly evolving.

Regardless of today's actual status in the organization, if one always looks at the appearance, the current central government of Poland is a government with "democratic" tendencies. A unicameral legislative system, a responsible cabinet system of administration. On the eve of the general election in January this year, the Polish interim government held a national referendum to solicit the opinions of the people on the constitution. The referendum listed three questions: First, do you agree with the unicameral system of parliament? Second, do you agree with Poland implementing land reform? Third, do you agree with Poland opening up its western border and acquiring the land in the Oder River basin of Germany? The Polish Communist Party launched the so-called "Three Yes" movement during that referendum. "Yes" in Polish is called TAK. Even now, you can see the Communist Party slogans of 3XTAK left on the walls of Warsaw.

Under the protection of strong foreign armed forces, the Communist Party's grass-roots work to win over the masses is naturally always successful. The parliament and cabinet of Poland have been ideally realized. The current Polish cabinet is a "coalition cabinet". The Prime Minister, Mr. Cyrankiewicz, is a 36-year-old "bald-headed youth", a stalwart of the left wing of the Polish Socialist Party. Before I read Cyrankiewicz's biography, I guessed that this young Prime Minister was about fifty years old. His head is "bare and shining", and he is tall and gives people a sincere feeling. On my third day in Warsaw, I happened to encounter Poland's new National Day. The International Propaganda Department of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent me an invitation from Cyrankiewicz. That afternoon, I saw this bald Prime Minister at the "Prime Minister's Residence" at 46 Palac Prezydencki Street. He was wearing a black tuxedo, a white shirt, and the blue-eyed and blond Prime Minister greeted guests at the entrance of the hall.

There were about 500 international and Polish guests, members of parliament, ministers, vice ministers, and even directors, almost all attended that day's "garden party". Chargé d'Affaires Bao Jinpu introduced me to many Polish government figures. Unfortunately, I could not speak Polish. I could only manage a few words in French, and I would "show my true colors" in a deeper conversation. Before the war, English was considered quite "shameful" in Poland. Although the concept has changed now, there are very few people in Warsaw who speak English.

What I admired was the large garden of the Prime Minister's residence, with green lawns, marble fountains, small bridges, and even flowing water. Five or so guests were scattered in all directions of the flower country, and it didn't seem too crowded. It is said that this is the Prime Minister's residence inherited from before the war, Poland's "10 Downing Street". The Prime Minister's residence was not severely damaged during the great fire of Warsaw. After some minor repairs after the war, it has been restored to its former appearance.

Cyrankiewicz joined the Polish Socialist Party during his school days. Like President Bierut, he was the chairman of the student union in his youth. In 1935, Cyrankiewicz was 24 years old and was appointed by the Socialist Party as the secretary of the Krakow branch. Since then, he gradually showed his talents in the Socialist Party. After the Nazis conquered Poland, Cyrankiewicz was the head of underground work. He was arrested in 1941 and detained in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In 1945, he was escorted to Münster in western Germany and later released by the American army.

Four years of concentration camp "iron window" flavor is Cyrankiewicz's political capital today. This not only proves that he is a strong anti-fascist, but also gave him the opportunity to organize many "fellow sufferers" in the concentration camp. He organized the Polish People's Nazi Concentration Camp Fellow Sufferers Association, which has a considerable number of members. He is the president of the association.

In 1945, Cyrankiewicz's "left wing", with the help of other forces, gradually took effect within the Polish Socialist Party. He was elected as the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, and also elected as the Vice-Chairman of the Polish National Assembly in 1945 during the chaotic situation. At the end of November last year, he was appointed by the President as the Prime Minister and formed the current so-called "Polish Coalition Cabinet." (August 2nd in Warsaw)

### British Empire Representatives Unanimously Advocate Complete Disarmament of Japan; Japanese Overseas Rights and Interests Should Be Abolished

[Our Dispatch] London, August 28th Broadcast: The eight units of British Commonwealth countries participating in the British Commonwealth Japan Peace Treaty Conference all advocate the complete disarmament of Japan. According to a communiqué issued by the meeting: The discussion on the disarmament of Japan was completed this morning. All representatives believe that Japan should continue to be completely disarmed, and all arms manufacturing should be completely prohibited. Domestic security should be maintained by non-military police. The representatives also studied in detail various steps to ensure that Japan cannot participate in the research and development of atomic energy. The representatives proposed that Japan should abandon all its rights and interests abroad.

[Reuters Canberra, August 27th] The official announcement: The British Commonwealth's Japan Peace Treaty Conference, after discussing the strategic and economic impact of depriving Japan of its imperial possessions, today began discussing the withdrawal of Japanese armaments and disarmament. Lieutenant General Robertson, Commander-in-Chief of the British Occupation Forces in Japan, Mr. Dening, Assistant Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Mr. Norman, head of the diplomatic corps in Japan, and Mr. Plimsoll, Australian representative to the Far Eastern Commission, all expressed their views on the economic, social, military, and political development of Japan under Allied occupation, as well as the prospects after the end of the occupation. Among them, Lieutenant General Robertson specifically warned that although the Japanese are cooperating obediently with the Allied forces, the sincerity of their peaceful intentions should not be overestimated. Other representatives also expressed the same feeling about Mr. Robertson's suspicion of Japan's sincerity. The official document continued to say that the discussion of the land clauses of the peace treaty was simplified a lot due to the existence of the Cairo, Yalta, and Potsdam Declarations. The Allied countries have agreed on the fundamental principles of the basic policies of the Far Eastern Commission and other decisions. The original territory of Japan was all islands, so there is no difficulty in determining Japan's borders in the peace treaty. The Potsdam Agreement stipulated that Japanese sovereignty should be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, the four islands, and some other small islands, so the conference only needs to decide which small islands should continue to be placed under Japanese sovereignty. During the discussion, special mention was made of the fact that changes in these lands could deprive Japan of control of naval, land, and air bases and some important raw materials, thus contributing to the prevention of Japanese re-aggression.

### US Submits Another Note to Soviet Union Suggesting Four-Power Consultation on Korean Issue; Soviet Union Agrees Not to Consult Orally with Korean Organizations

[United Press International Washington, August 27th] According to reliable sources, United Press International reported on the 27th that the United States suggested in a note to the Soviet Union that the four Pacific nations of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union should jointly resolve the Korean issue, which has become a stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union. It said that the US proposal was not an attempt to return the issue to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference that formed the Moscow Agreement and established the US-Soviet Joint Commission, but to convene representatives of the four countries to consider the situation facing Korea today.

The US note was delivered to US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith on the night of the 26th. Undersecretary of State Lovett revealed that the note has been sent out, but he is unwilling to explain its content so far. According to another official source, the United States believed that it would also be wise to hand the matter over to the United Nations before taking this step, but it was finally rejected, believing that it was not yet the time.

[New Asia News Agency Seoul, August 28th] Soviet Chief Representative Shtikov issued a statement today at Deoksugung Palace, expressing his agreement to Major General Brown's opposition on August 12 to conducting oral consultations with various Korean political parties and organizations. He also said that the Soviet representative decided to propose that the Second Subcommittee of the US-Soviet Joint Commission formulate the charter, political program, nature, and name of the Korean Provisional Government in preparation for convening a People's Assembly. The representatives of the People's Assembly will be nominated proportionally by groups with more than 10,000 members, and will be decided by the Joint Commission.

[Associated Press Seoul, August 28th] The Soviet Union has rejected a previous suggestion by Major General Brown, the US Chief Representative of the US-Soviet Joint Commission, to hold general elections in Korea under international supervision so that the people can decide on their own form of government.

### Japanese Zaibatsu Break Up Into Smaller Units

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, August 28th] Since the Japanese government banned the concentration of economic power, the companies of the major zaibatsu have been busy reorganizing into smaller units. For example, Kanebo Spinning Company has been divided into 12 cotton mills, 15 silk fabric mills, 8 woolen fabric mills, and 3 chemical plants. Aircraft, explosives, and other manufacturing plants are independent units with each factory as one unit, and the mining industry is also divided into several units by region.

### Japan Attaches Importance to Northern Construction and Plans to Build Undersea Tunnel

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, August 28th] Because the domestic and world situation will tend to focus on the north in the future, the Japanese government is quite active in the development of Hokkaido. Recently, the National Railway Engineering Authority announced that it has begun planning to build an undersea tunnel through the Tsugaru Strait between Honshu and Hokkaido. The design work has been completed. The tunnel is about 34 kilometers long and 235 meters below sea level. The Japanese boasted that this is the largest undersea tunnel in the world.

### British Representative to Allied Control Council to be Succeeded by Shaw

[United Press International Canberra, August 28th] Authoritative sources: Mr. Shaw, a capable diplomat who was formerly the British representative to Tokyo and Nanjing, will succeed Mr. Gascoigne as the British Chief Representative to the Allied Control Council for Japan.

### Egypt's Complaint Against Britain: Soviet Union Opposes Brazilian Proposal

[Reuters Lake Success, August 28th] In today's decisive debate in the Security Council on Egypt's complaint against Britain, there may be two surprising moves: one is the Soviet Union's use of the veto, and the other is Colombia's abstention, which will cause Brazil's proposal to fail to obtain the statutory majority and be rejected.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, August 28th Broadcast: The Security Council discussed the Egyptian issue today. Brazil advocated that Britain and Egypt resume negotiations, and six countries expressed their approval, while the Soviet Union firmly opposed it.

### Britain Announces Emergency Plan to Balance Foreign Exchange and Stabilize Domestic Economy; Recent British Trade Deficit Reaches 600 Million Pounds Annually

[Reuters London, August 27th] The Labor government today announced a reduction in food imports and restrictions on foreign travel to reduce foreign exchange expenditures by 228 million pounds as the first step to balance the 600 million pound foreign exchange deficit. The dollar expenditure saved by reducing food imports is expected to reach 144 million pounds. After the reduction of food imports, it will be supplemented by increased domestic production.

From October 1st, travel abroad for tourism will be completely prohibited, thus saving 23 million pounds in foreign exchange annually. From the same day, the basic gasoline ration for private cars will be completely abolished, and the strict restrictions during the war will be restored, that is, cars will not be allowed to be used unless it is proven that there is a professional need. The foreign exchange consumption of gasoline saved as a result can reach 10 million pounds per year. Commercial travelers going abroad will be subject to strict control, and the foreign exchange approved per day for travelers to Europe will be reduced from the original 10 pounds to 8 pounds. Domestic food rations will be reduced. For example, the weekly meat ration for each adult will be reduced from the original 14 ounces to 12 ounces, which is the lowest ration during the 1941 war, and the additional ration for heavy workers will also be reduced proportionally. Supplementary foods such as canned meat and fish, dried fruits, biscuits, etc. will also be reduced, and some luxury foods will be completely prohibited from import. It is estimated that in the year ending June 30, 1948, the British trade deficit will be between 350 million and 400 million pounds. However, before the announcement of the austerity measures, the British trade deficit with the dollar area had reached 600 million pounds. The proposed savings of 228 million pounds are still far from the shortfall.

### Ministry of Finance Continues to Send Key Personnel to Shanghai to Summon Six Wooden Furniture Merchants for Investigation; City Council Receives Another Letter Accusing Tax Officials of Malfeasance; Speaker Expresses Views on Bribery and Acceptance as Equally Culpable

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance yesterday dispatched another special commissioner, Shao Weizu, to Shanghai to join Director of Inspection Yao Zeng to thoroughly investigate the case of corruption and extortion by the tax auditors of the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau. After arriving in Shanghai, Commissioner Shao and Director Yao went to the Daguan Garden on Ma Huo Road, West Nanjing Road, at 4:30 p.m. to investigate the six victimized Chinese-style wooden furniture businesses one by one. The businesses that arrived were Zhang Wanli, Zhang Wantai, Wufu, Yang Longxing, Zhang Senmao, and Zhu Genji. During the inquiry, minutes were taken and the responsible persons of each business were asked to sign and pledge. To be cautious, the wooden furniture businesses made their own copies. Due to the complicated procedures, two businesses had not completed the process by the evening, so it was agreed to complete the signing procedure this morning.

Inspector Zuo Lianzhong of the Direct Tax Administration came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to assist in the thorough investigation of corruption in the Direct Tax Bureau. Yesterday, Inspector Zuo met with Bureau Chief Lou, and then came to this newspaper office in person to explain the news reported in yesterday's newspaper.

In addition, the City Council has received letters of complaint about malfeasance by the investigators of the Direct Tax Bureau for several days. Yesterday, another letter was received, listing the malfeasance of a certain investigator. The council has forwarded the case to the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau and the police recently dispatched by the Ministry of Finance for thorough investigation.

Those Forced to Bribe Should Be Allowed to Report Within a Time Limit to Avoid Punishment

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of malfeasance by the auditors of the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, Speaker Pan expressed the following views to reporters yesterday: When I was in Beijing, I reported the facts reported by Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese-style Wooden Furniture Industry Association, to Minister Yu Hongjun. The matter originally belonged to a local affair, and I was very satisfied that Minister Yu immediately agreed to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter according to law. Moreover, I have always believed in Minister Yu's impartiality, and I believe that he will have the determination to punish corruption this time. Therefore, the case should be handled according to law by the responsible officials, and I really have no need to add anything more. However, in my opinion, corruption and malfeasance are unavoidable in all countries. As long as they are discovered, they should be strictly dealt with, so as to achieve purification and change the atmosphere. In the future, if we want to eradicate extortion and bribery, it may be possible to amend the legal provisions on bribery and acceptance as equally culpable. Those who are forced to pay should be allowed to report the facts to the competent official within three days after the event or after being physically free (within a certain time limit), so as to be exempt from the crime of bribery; otherwise, the punishment should be increased. If this is the case, it will be helpful to curb the corrupt atmosphere of extortion and bribery.

The two are being prosecuted by the prosecutor on suspicion of attempted murder. According to the facts stated in the indictment, Zhang Shi had never been married. In 1934, she adopted Zhang Hexiang as her adopted son. Later, because Zhang Hexiang was already of age, she married Gui Zhen, the daughter of Xu Changgen, in November of the year before last. The shameless mother and son disregarded etiquette and had an affair. After Gui Zhen discovered it, she could not help but complain, which caused resentment. The defendant had long harbored the intention to harm Gui Zhen and abused her, forcing her back to her parents' home several times.

### Disastrous Situation: Waiting for Aid Urgently; Jiangsu Provincial Emergency Relief Committee Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Wang Maogong Elected Chairman

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Jiangsu Provincial Flood Emergency Relief Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Pudong Building yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Chairman Wang Maogong reported on the causes of the flood in northern Jiangsu and the urgency of the disaster victims waiting for rescue. He also made an urgent request to all sectors of Shanghai to quickly provide disaster relief, saying that rescuing the northern Jiangsu refugees is to stabilize southern Jiangsu.

Subsequently, Minister Gu Zhenggang delivered a speech, saying that last year's disaster in northern Jiangsu was a political disaster, which was man-made. This year's disaster is a natural disaster that is beyond human control. I express my sympathy for this and will do my best to provide relief with the enthusiasm of last year. The central government attaches great importance to this matter, so the disaster relief funds allocated are the largest among all provinces.

Decision on Disaster Relief Principles

The Executive Yuan has decided on several principles for disaster relief in Jiangsu: (1) Areas that have been flooded should be drained as soon as possible; areas that have not been flooded should be prevented as much as possible; (2) Disaster victims should remain in the disaster area to prevent them from dispersing to various places, so as to carry out work relief; (3) Cultivation should be restored as soon as possible; (4) Disease prevention work should be carried out in the disaster area. However, the disaster situation is very serious, and the central government's emergency relief of 28 billion yuan is equivalent to "sending goose feathers from a thousand miles away," so it is necessary to mobilize social forces to provide disaster relief, which is more reliant on the great sympathy of Shanghai. Subsequently, Huo Baoshu, Xu Jiqu, and Zai Baoxuan delivered speeches one after another, all believing that the disaster situation was serious and that the area of the disaster area was as large as the total area of ​​the three countries of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The number of disaster victims is equal to the total number of Shanghai citizens. The treatment of symptoms requires everyone's efforts, and the treatment of root causes is the responsibility of the government.

Four Committees Established

### Estimated to Collect More Than 30 Billion in Home Assistance Subsidies for Volunteers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the registration of volunteers in the city began on the 25th, the Civil Affairs Office has not yet received the exact number of registered volunteers as of yesterday. According to those responsible, it is certain that the city will be able to recruit 3,000 volunteers as scheduled. However, the Civil Affairs Office believes that the recent incidents of selling recruits have had a great impact on registration and is now ordering strict investigation. Regarding the collection of home assistance subsidies for volunteers, in addition to collecting preferential fees of 30,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 150,000 yuan from those who are exempt from military service, a preferential donation will be generally collected from households that do not have recruits to supplement the funds. The preferential donation rate for co-living households (i.e., ordinary households) will be levied in three categories: 20,000 yuan, 30,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan, depending on the household's economic situation. Co-business households (such as shops, companies, factories, and other group organizations) will be levied a uniform 100,000 yuan per household. It is stipulated that co-living households can be exempted from the collection if they have recruits going on expeditions, or have been approved for exemption from military service and paid preferential fees, or are poor and have a certificate issued by the Baojia chief. There are currently more than 800,000 households in the city. Together with the preferential fees paid by recruits who are exempt from military service, a total of more than 30 billion yuan can be collected. The Civil Affairs Office has drafted a plan and submitted it to Mayor Wu for approval at the military service meeting in the coming days, and will then announce its implementation.

### The Artery of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: The Jinhua River Bridge: Six Months Spent, 50,000 Workers Mobilized, Successful Trial Run

[News from the Jinhua River Construction Site on the 22nd] The Jinhua River Bridge, which had delayed the track laying work of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for five months due to its massive bridge project, was finally completed at the end of last month thanks to the accelerated repairs by the bridge construction office of the railway. It successfully underwent its initial trial run on July 29th. The reporter took advantage of a visit to the Jin-Qu section track laying project to stay at the site for a day. I was led on a tour of the entire bridge by Mr. Zhang Congpei, the chief engineer of the bridge, and engineers Zhang Xianqing and others, and obtained the following preliminary impressions:

The Jinhua River Bridge was built in 1932 as the predecessor of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway

Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway

Vehicles passed through, with a total length of 282.94 meters. It was constructed according to the "PG" (Plate Girder) design, with a load-bearing capacity designed according to the E40 class. It was one of the largest bridge projects on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road at the time (the Qiantang River Bridge had not yet been built at that time). In June 1941, in order to cooperate with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line retreat plan, our side automatically detonated and destroyed the bridge, turning one bridge seat and five bridge piers into ruins. Since then, all sections of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line west of Jinhua have been completely interrupted. After victory, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was ordered to rush repairs, and the Jinhua River Bridge was one of the largest bridge projects. It was necessary to prepare early. Therefore, the bridge started construction on the day the Hangzhou-Zhu section was repaired and the Zhu-Jin section began laying tracks.

Zhang Congpei, a senior engineer graduated from Tangshan, was in charge of the project, and Wang Jiliang, Zhang Xianqing, Zhao Chang and other engineers assisted him. In February of this year, surveying began according to the drawings drawn by Zhou Kaifeng, and work was immediately started to rush the repair of each bridge pier. The project was divided into four items in order: enclosure, drainage, clearing, and grouting. The time was from February 10th to the end of April, working day and night. The number of workers mobilized daily was more than 500, and the total number of workdays was more than 30,000. According to the accounting at the time, the cost to the bridge construction office reached 550 million yuan. Afterwards, the bridge seat was completed and the second step of work began, namely the bridge erection project. The steps were also divided into four types: initial production, then lifting the frames, third, erecting steel beams on the frames, and finally repairing the bridge deck. The working time for this item was from the end of April to July 20th. The number of workers mobilized daily was between 200 and 400, and the total number of workdays also reached more than 10,000. The cost to the bridge construction office also reached more than 500 million yuan. By the end of July, the bridge pier and deck work had been fully completed, and after several trial runs, there were no abnormal signs, and the project was completed. The only remaining projects were the two protective rails in the middle of the bridge deck and the oil painting and painting work between the bridge frames. When the reporter visited the bridge project, there were still more than 100 workers working hard to complete the work.

It is estimated that this protection work can also be completed within a week.

The bridge is located in the lower reaches of the Jinhua River, about 40 li away from Lanxi and about 4 kilometers away from Jinhua Station. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road from Hangzhou to here is exactly 175.984 kilometers. The width of the riverbed is about the same as the length of the bridge. There are thousands of acres of flat fields on both sides and thousands of cypress trees. Then there are white sails and wooden rafts, and the scenery is very beautiful. There is a bridgehead bunker on the east side of the bridge seat, standing on the river bank with an imposing appearance. Walking along the bridge, you can only see the river flowing, shocking people's ears and eyes. There are eight safety stations on the bridge deck for vehicles to avoid each other when passing. The four P1P2P3P4 are all made of upper-bearing steel plate beams, and P4P11 is made of Canadian pine

giant wooden beams

This is one of the special features of the bridge.

Currently, several trains of material cars pass through here every day, going directly to Longyou. Soon it will be able to reach Quzhou directly and connect with the Qu-Rao section. From then on, the more than 400 kilometers of the Hangzhou-Rao section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line can be reached in one day.

The completed panorama of the Jinhua River Bridge (Huang Cen Post)

Today, if we think that the Qiantang River Bridge is the soul of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, we must also admit that the Jinhua River Bridge is the main artery of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, because thanks to it, the transportation line that has been withered for nearly five years has been revived from now on. (Huang Cen)

### Two Communist Bandits Kill Village Head in Broad Daylight in Changzhou

[Our Newspaper Wujin 26th Dispatch] Yangqiao Township in the Eighth District of our county is separated from Yixing County by only a river. The south of the river belongs to Yixing, and the north belongs to Wujin. The affairs of the people are closely related. Village Head Wang Yi-jian of the aforementioned Yixing jurisdiction has served as village head since the victory and has actively implemented government orders in coordination with military force. He has always been known for his diligence, and therefore he was resented by the communist underground organization "Wuyi Garrison Command" leaders Zhang Zhi-yi and Wu Qi-chang. Because their actions and collection of communist grain could not proceed smoothly, their resentment deepened day by day. On the morning of the 26th, during the bustling market hours, Village Head Wang was in the back room of the Jia Genquan teahouse auditing the conscription resettlement expenses when suddenly two communist bandits, wearing short coats of light gray cooked silk, sneaked into the teahouse. Upon seeing Wang, they pulled out their automatic pistols and shot him directly. Wang was caught off guard and died on the spot. The shop owner, Jia Genquan, was also hit in the waist by a stray bullet. Seeing Wang lying in a pool of blood, the bandits achieved their goal and fled from the teahouse without a trace. The self-defense teams of neighboring villages in our county, such as Yuncun, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, but the bandits had already escaped far away. At that time, the entire town was in chaos, and people were panic-stricken. The whole village was shocked. The family members of the assassinated Village Head Wang collected his body for burial. Jia Genquan was sent to Wujin Hospital in Changzhou for treatment and is undergoing surgery. His life may or may not be saved. The bandits in the village have repeatedly committed killings. Recently, they openly murdered the village head in broad daylight in a crowded market. Their rampant and dangerous behavior is far beyond a minor annoyance. It is heard that the county government and the garrison troops in the Eighth District are launching a full-scale suppression.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 28th Dispatch] The inaugural meeting of the China Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was inaugurated at 9:00 AM this morning (28th) at the Mingzhi Building of the Examination Yuan in Nanjing. The attendees included President Dai of the Examination Yuan, Zhao Nai-chuan, the representative of the Legislative Yuan, Zheng Ruogu, the representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Commissioners Li Jinxi, Cheng Shi-kui, Chen Lifu, Zhu Kezhen, Cheng Qi-bao, Sun Benyou, Liao Shicheng, Luo Tingguang, Hu Shi, Mei Yiqi, Tian Peilin, Qian Duansheng, Pan Guangdan, Zhu Jingnong, Dang Daozhi, Weng Wenhao, Wu Youxun, Li Shuhua, Sa Bendong, Bai Chongxi, Hang Liwu, Mao Yisheng, Hao Gengsheng, Chen Yuguang, Sun Mingjing, Zhang Daofan, Gu Yuxiu, Chen Daqi, Zi Bin, Xiao Xiao, Ren Hongjun, Wu Nanxuan, Zheng Yanfen, Qu Junong, Chen Lijiang, Zhu Jia驊, Qing Tang, Wu Yifang, Chen Heqin, Liu Ruiheng, and Jiang Fucong, totaling more than 70 people.

Minister Zhu Delivers a Speech

Minister Zhu delivered the opening speech first, stating that the UNESCO conference was held in London in November 1945, passing the charter of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The following year, in November, the General Assembly was held in Paris, and our country sent representatives to participate. In the following year, UNESCO began its work, and each member state should form a domestic committee to establish contact with UNESCO. Therefore, our country prepared the China Committee. The preparations began between March and April, and the Ministry of Education hired well-known figures from education, science, and culture, such as Zhang Daofan and more than ten others, as members of the preparatory committee to actively prepare. On the 25th of this month, the preparatory committee decided that the first committee would have 120 members, of which 100 would be nominated by academic organizations. The term of office for this session is one year. After the second session, in addition to those selected by the Ministry, the remaining members will be re-elected by the first session's committee, with a term of office of three years. The committee has three tasks: (1) To handle liaison matters between domestic educational, scientific, and cultural organizations and UNESCO; (2) To propose to the government the implementation of work plans related to UNESCO; (3) To handle matters entrusted by the government and UNESCO.

President Dai Delivers a Speech

President Dai of the Examination Yuan then delivered a speech, stating that the meeting was held in the Mingzhi Building, and elaborated on the couplet "Pursue ambition with indifference, achieve distance with tranquility, evolve the human community, and achieve world harmony." He said that Chinese culture has a history of more than 4,000 years. The three dynasties and earlier are far beyond reach. Unfortunately, it was destroyed in the fires of Qin, but Confucius, the sage, revived the extinct. He cited Confucius's three great virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, as well as the six arts, and discussed extensively the past and present, and concluded that Confucius's aim of world harmony and the aim of the Three Principles of the People of the National Father were to seek world harmony through educational, scientific, and cultural cooperation, which coincided unexpectedly. He also elaborated on Chinese education itself and hoped that colleagues in education, science, and culture would work hard. Zhao Nai-chuan, the representative of the Legislative Yuan, elaborated on the great responsibility of the China Committee itself.

Commissioner Hu Delivers a Speech

Commissioner Hu Shi delivered a speech, first explaining in detail Article 7 of the UNESCO Charter, "Each member state shall, in accordance with its own circumstances, take measures to ensure that the most important educational, scientific and cultural organizations in its country are linked to the work of the Organization..." He then stated that he had attended UNESCO and proposed that UNESCO hold a meeting in China in 1949 to commemorate Confucius's 2,500th birthday. At that time, he discussed it with the Acting Secretary-General of UNESCO. Fortunately, it was not made a resolution, because the Gregorian calendar year 1949 is not Confucius's actual birthday. The actual birthday is in 1950. Therefore, he deliberately advocated that our government should designate the Academia Sinica and the China Committee of UNESCO to jointly organize the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius, with the participation of people from all aspects of education, science, and culture across the country, as an unprecedented academic and cultural undertaking, without other political implications, and asked UNESCO to come to China for a meeting in 1950. He also believed that the location did not have to be in Nanjing, but could be in Beiping. Commissioners Weng Wenhao, Li Shuhua, Wu Yifang, and Qu Junong then spoke, reporting and expressing their hopes for UNESCO and the organization of this committee.

Chairman of the Conference

### Allocation of Goods Worth Over 600 Billion - Price Fluctuations Unlikely to Last - Gu Committee Guarantees Stable Market Prices for Flour and Grains

[Our Report] In response to recent fluctuations in the market conditions of rice, flour, cooking oil, and other essential commodities in the city, the Advisory Committee on Allocated Goods convened a full-day meeting yesterday with various relevant agencies. Representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Four Districts Flour Association, China Vegetable Oil Factory, China Food Oil Company, Dayouyu Oil Factory, and others attended. After discussion, it was generally agreed that the arrival of rice, flour, wheat, and other grains has been abundant recently, even more so than in the past. Therefore, the main cause of the recent price fluctuations is public anxiety. There are sufficient reserves of various essential foods, so there is no need for a sell-off. A responsible member of the committee stated that the government currently holds over 600 billion yuan worth of allocated goods in the city. Even if speculative hoarding groups attempt to mobilize floating capital in the market to launch an offensive, they cannot compete with such a large quantity of allocated goods. He also guaranteed that from today onwards, the market prices of flour, grains, and other items will definitely fall.

### Rising Market Trends in the Interior - Both Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Rebound - Flour Mills Jointly Release 40,000 Bags of Flour

New japonica rice followed suit, rising by 10,000 yuan.

Flour opened strong in the morning. Battleship and Old Car brands once reached 134,000 yuan. At noon, the price slightly decreased due to the joint release of flour by mills, with a total of 40,000 bags released citywide at a price of 130,000 yuan. Half of the release was mixed-brand flour. As a result, standard flour increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, while mixed-brand flour increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Foreign flour remained stable. There are rumors that foreign firms will absorb a large quantity of bran, which continued to rise, soaring by another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

Soybean cake continued to move in Taiwan, increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybeans were firm, actively traded, and continued to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

### Curbing the Rising Tide of Cooking Oil Prices - China Vegetable Oil Company Implements Rationing

Recently, the rising tide of oil prices has resurfaced in the city. Ren Xianqun, Deputy Director of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, discussed with the China Vegetable Oil Factory under the Ministry of Economic Affairs the continuation of the selling plan, and an agreement has been reached. Yesterday morning, before the soybean oil factory opened, demand was strong, and prices showed a slight increase. The China Vegetable Oil Factory then stipulated that each cooking oil retailer could apply for the allocation of 20 dan of refined peanut oil at a price of 990,000 yuan per dan, distributing a total of 3,000 dan. This batch of refined peanut oil was transported from Qingdao to Shanghai by the China Food Oil Company and sold to the China Vegetable Oil Factory. Each basket weighs two city dan. The first batch of 6,000 baskets has been unloaded by the factory. This selling plan will be maintained until the end of this month, pending new measures from the authorities.

### Hangzhou Tea Prices Rise

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 28th] After the implementation of the new foreign exchange policy, tea prices have generally risen. Although the tea market here has been rising continuously, transactions have not been active. The existing stock in the market is already scarce due to the low production this year. After foreign firms have been buying in large quantities for the past ten days, it has become even more depleted, and those with stock are unwilling to sell, resulting in a situation where there are prices but no market.

In addition, the sales of tea for domestic consumption in the city's shops and tea houses have been slow, but low-end varieties, such as aged Qimen and aged Zhenmei, have been selling relatively well, with each dan increasing by about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and the base is stable. The foreign firm tea market is extremely quiet.

### Sugar Prices Reach Another Peak

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise, reaching another peak. The Guild's price fixing showed that spot market prices for No. 20 medium white sugar were 695,000 to 700,000 yuan, an increase of about 30,000 yuan. Spot market prices for four-and-a-half white sugar were 855,000 yuan, an increase of 31,500 yuan. Shantou green sugar was 570,000 to 575,000 yuan, an increase of over 10,000 yuan, with about a hundred bags traded. Gao Xinghua white sugar in bag shops was 730,000 to 740,000 yuan, an increase of 20,000 yuan. Xingchi red sugar was 625,000 to 620,000 yuan, an increase of about 30,000 yuan, with about 400 pieces traded. Diao Qing sugar was priced by traders at 530,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan. High-quality Hainan red sugar opened with 60 bags at 670,000 yuan, an increase of 40,000 yuan. Fifty bags of Shunde green sugar were at 525,000 yuan.

### Flour Exports Banned from September 1st

[Our Report] According to reliable sources, in order to prevent excessive fluctuations in flour market prices, the authorities have decided to reinstate the ban on flour exports from September 1st.

### Multiple Parties Entering and Covering Positions - Hua Shares Close at High Prices

Hua shares continued to be active yesterday. Although No. 224 and other shares, as well as Guangdong shares, came out to sell at high prices, causing a slight dip in the middle, the high opening of off-market interest rates at 2 jiao 2.5 fen and 2 jiao 7 fen caused multiple parties to temporarily release their positions. However, a sudden telegraph report from Hong Kong reported a contraction, causing multiple parties to re-enter and cover their positions. The market rebounded by the afternoon closing, eventually closing at high prices.

The market opened high. Dieyong Yarn opened high at 258 yuan. After the opening, No. 235 and other shares were sold, dropping slightly to 155 yuan. No. 4 and other shares entered, rising to 265 yuan. No. 56 and other shares sold at high prices, retreating to 255 yuan. At this time, because Xinya was listed from No. 149, rising to the daily limit, No. 153 took advantage of the low price to buy and slightly consolidate. In the end, the bulls from No. 104 frequently came out to sell, and No. 186 and others sold, forcing Dieyong Yarn down to 254 yuan. Meiya also saw a large sell-off from No. 224 and also retreated slightly.

After 11:00 AM, No. 171 and others had entered up to 261 yuan, but shortly after, it was sold again by No. 173 and others, dropping again to around 1254 yuan. Later, after the Hong Kong telegram reported a contraction to 11 yuan 7 jiao, yarn prices rebounded, sentiment improved, and No. 171 and others jointly absorbed. Dieyong Yarn closed at 256 yuan and 264 yuan.

After the close, bids were slightly higher, and other shares also rebounded. As a result, compared to Tuesday's closing, on a traded-share basis, Dieyong Yarn, Xinyi, Yonggong, Jingfu, and Qinxing each rose by half a percent, Zhongfa rose slightly less than one percent, Xinhua slightly declined, Xinhua Feng Meiya slightly rose, Lian was flat, Xinya rebounded after reaching the daily limit, rising slightly less than one percent, underwear fell by half a percent, Zhongs, Tongyi, and Datong fell slightly less than half a percent, and the rest all rose slightly. On a deferred-delivery basis, Dieyong Yarn, Xinyi, Huafeng, and Jingfu rose by half a percent, and Meiya Xinguang Yonggong slightly rose. Off-market old shares were stable, with most slightly rising.

Foreign exchange unchanged

[Our Report] Yesterday, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee approved the foreign exchange market price, which remained at the original level. Therefore, the buying and selling prices of US and British currencies by designated banks remain unchanged.

In addition, Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by ship this afternoon.

### National Bonds Hover, Foreign Shares Mediocre

Yesterday, miscellaneous public bonds saw a decline, while Unified C bonds were easy to rebound after falling, showing a hovering trend. Initially active and then falling, the market was uncertain. Unified C opened at 16,800 yuan, retreated from 17,200 yuan to 15,000 yuan, and then struggled around 16,500 yuan. Dachengxing and Room 538 sold, while Room 50111, Room 55, and Room 550 entered, with about 8 million traded. Compared to before the closing, A and B bonds fell by 600 yuan, Unified C rose by 200 yuan, Unified D fell by 900 yuan, and Unified E slightly decreased by 200 yuan.

Yesterday's foreign shares were peaceful, with a mediocre process. Yi Yarn opened at 92,000 yuan, falling from 92,300 yuan to 90,000 yuan at the closing. Foreign merchants, Guangdong merchants, and Shengda bought, while gold shops, bank groups, and securities groups sold. As a result, compared to Tuesday's closing, the British Union, Jardine Matheson, Yi Beer, and Airlines were all flat, Shipping fell by half a percent, and the rest saw slight increases or decreases.

### Price Evaluation Council Sets Prices for Kerosene and Gasoline

### China Trust Bureau's Rayon Sales Changed to Early Each Week

The China Trust Bureau's 36th allocation of rayon to the silk weaving industry this week totaled 14,398 packages, or 715 boxes. The 21st allocation of rayon to the ribbon weaving industry totaled 846 packages, or 42 boxes. In total, 775 boxes of rayon were allocated this week. The original schedule of allocating rayon on the 1st and 4th of each week has been changed to allocating rayon on the 1st and 2nd of each week. Payment and pickup are on the 4th, so no rayon was allocated yesterday.

Prices Rise

The market price of rayon yesterday increased by 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous increase, with the final asking price being 7.9 million yuan.

Although yesterday's factory silk transactions were not active, sentiment was firm, and market prices continued to rise. Five packages of zero-grade silk were traded at 32.5 million yuan, an increase of 1.5 million yuan compared to Tuesday. Asking prices for all grades also increased accordingly. The asking price for medium-grade rayon was 30.4 million yuan per load. Due to the rise in factory silk, the asking price for dry-spun silk also rose, reaching 20 million yuan per load, but there were no transactions.

Due to the soaring silk market, silk fabrics had already risen sharply on Wednesday and continued to rise yesterday. The highest immediate price for Huachang Zhensi quilts was 2.8 million yuan, an increase of 1 million yuan in two days. Dachang goods were only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan higher than Huachang goods. Plaid crepe was offered at around 42,000 yuan, but there were no transactions.

### London Announces Sino-British Trade Figures for This Year - Double Last Year's Figures

[British Information Services, London, 28th] In the period from January to July this year, goods shipped from the Far East and Pacific Islands to the United Kingdom totaled 545,021 tons. During the same period, goods shipped from British ports to the Far East amounted to 600,851 tons, of which more than 80% were British goods. Although these figures are only one-third of the total for the same period in 1938, they have doubled compared to last year and are evidence of the active recovery of trade between Europe and Asia after the war. The total value of Sino-British trade currently exceeds pre-war figures. This is clearly evident from the latest statistics from the British Department of Trade, as shown in the following table, with figures in thousands of pounds.

Country 1938 1947 1938 1947
Monthly Average June Jan-June Jan-June Jan-June
From China to UK 594 1920 3569 3666
From UK to China 362 594 2179 5490

Trade statistics between the UK and Hong Kong are not included.

The following table compares the main items and figures for Chinese exports to the UK in July this year, January to July 1938, and January to July this year:

Category 1947 1936 1947
July Jan-July Jan-July
Beverages 4239 156
Oilseeds 793 483 790
Miscellaneous Raw Materials 49 368 1030
Silk and Rayon Yarns 4 81 33

In July this year, tea was the main item of Chinese exports to the UK, totaling 446,020 pounds. The main items of British exports to China are fewer than before the war. The following table compares the main items of British exports to China and their figures:

Category 1947 1938 1947
July Jan-July Jan-July
Machinery 240 591 1367
Iron and Steel Products 443 245 1353
Wool and Wool Products 195 111 1086
Chemicals and Dyes 124 89 843
Electrical Products 109 29 843
Miscellaneous Goods 117 752 610

The figures for machinery and woolen textiles in July were twice the average for the previous months, and other steel, chemical, and electrical products also saw considerable increases.

### Cracking Down on Speculation and Stabilizing Prices - Fabric Warehouse Receipts Must Be Sold Within a Time Limit - National and Private Factories Decide to Temporarily Increase Allocation of Cotton Yarn

[Our Report] The ninth regular meeting of the Textile Adjustment Committee was held in the committee's meeting room yesterday afternoon. All committee members attended, chaired by Acting Director Liu Siying. The meeting adjourned after discussions lasting until around 7:00 PM. The important resolutions are summarized as follows:

(1) Wang Qiyu, Rong Erren, Tang Xinghai, Shi Fengxiang, and others proposed a "Plan to promote the export of fabrics to earn foreign exchange and exchange for foreign cotton." It was decided to task Rong Erren, Tang Xinghai, and one representative each from the Central Bank, the Textile Adjustment Committee, and the Textile Construction Company to jointly review the plan and submit it to the next meeting for discussion.

(2) Recent fabric market conditions have fluctuated again. In order to crack down on speculative hoarding, effective immediately, fabric warehouse receipts must be sold within seven days. Warehouse receipts exceeding the seven-day limit will not be allowed to circulate in the market and will be dealt with by the Municipal Government's enforcement department. The Textile Adjustment Committee has also sent letters to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Six Districts Cotton Spinning Association, the Yarn Merchant Association, and the Cotton Cloth Merchant Association to ensure compliance.

(3) Recently, the supply of electricity has been insufficient. It was decided that the Textile Adjustment Committee will periodically convene representatives from the city's electricity companies, national and private yarn factories, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, and others to jointly discuss a reasonable solution.

Furthermore, in order to stabilize cotton yarn market prices and increase the supply of cotton yarn, the Textile Adjustment Committee will, in addition to entrusting the China Textile Construction Company to jointly allocate yarn today, also provide some additional temporary cotton yarn for sale by national and private yarn factories. The required cotton yarn for the yarn numbering industry will also be supplied in the same way.

Negotiated Price Adjustment

The negotiated price of cotton yarn has been adjusted since the 25th. The adjusted prices for each count of yarn are as follows: 10-count yarn: 7.1 million yuan, 16-count yarn: 8.97 million yuan, 20-count yarn: 10.2 million yuan, 32-count yarn: 13.5 million yuan, 40-count yarn: 15 million yuan.

Cotton Yarn Rises Steadily

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was active in the morning, with buyers and sellers unwilling to sell, and the market atmosphere was weak. At noon, news of a contraction in the Hong Kong telegram caused prices to rebound. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn once tested the 20 million yuan mark, with the final price being 19.9 million yuan, continuing to rise by 1 million yuan compared to Tuesday. The prices of other yarn counts also rose steadily.

Cloth Prices Fall

Yesterday, the cloth market was stable to soft at the opening. First-grade fine cloth rose to 510,000 yuan. However, due to weak actual demand and the listing of first-grade fine cloth and Sijunzi yuan barge by the Textile Construction Company, sentiment turned flat, and prices fell. The final price of first-grade fine cloth was 499,000 yuan, an increase of 15,000 yuan compared to Tuesday. However, after the close, due to the soaring yarn market, off-market bids rose to 522,000 yuan.

In addition, the Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual, with first-grade fine cloth listed at 475,000 yuan (limited to dyeing factories), 20-count extra-fine cloth priced at 388,000 yuan (allocated to licensed households), and Sijunzi yuan barge at 513,500 yuan.

Raw Cotton Remains Active

Yesterday, the raw cotton market remained active, with prices rising all the way and transactions brisk. Because cotton yarn rose steadily, customers were in high spirits and had a strong desire to buy. The cargo continued to be popular, resulting in a market price increase of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. About 3,000 packages were traded today. The opening factory price for each grade was 2.1 million yuan for Shashi cotton, 2.1 million yuan for Han fine cotton, and 2.15 million yuan for bundled Duohua cotton.

### Eleven Associations Meet to Demand Official Exchange Rate Settlement

[Our Report] Eleven industrial associations in the city, including rubber, paper, and cement, held a meeting at the Maorong Textile Industry Association yesterday afternoon. Hong Nianzu, Jin Runxiang, Zhang Shanzhang, Chen Yuanqin, Cai Xintao, Yang Liren, Xi Zhengxiu, Le Jiarong, and others attended. After discussing the current fluctuations in the black market exchange rate, it was decided that the foreign exchange quotas obtained by various industries in the first and second quarters should be settled at the official rate as soon as possible. Jin Runxiang was appointed to arrange a meeting date with Secretary Lin Jikang of the National Bank and representatives from the eleven industry associations. It is reported that the unsettled foreign exchange quotas for the first and second quarters of the eleven industry associations total about US$8 million.

In addition, Xi Zhengxiu, representative of the National Cement Association, recently met with Liu Guanyu, Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, in Beijing. During the meeting, he raised the Shanghai industrial community's hope that the foreign exchange quotas obtained in the first and second quarters would be settled at the official rate. Mr. Gu expressed his sympathy and promised to provide his opinion to President Zhang of the National Bank during his meeting with him.

### National Bank's Deficit Reaches 46.3 Billion - Tightening of Silver in the Market

[Our Report] It is reported that yesterday's clearing of bills by national bank branches showed a deficit of 46.3 billion, and the silver market is tightening, greatly easing inflationary pressure. A spokesperson for the National Bank continued to state that the tightening of silver is very obvious. It is generally speculated that the silver market will continue to tighten in the short term. This is because it is estimated that direct taxes and commodity taxes will generate another 200 billion yuan in revenue, which can be paid within three to five days. The National Bank has completely stopped lending and is accelerating the collection of overdue payments. At the same time, it has been agreed with commercial banks that daily surplus funds will be concentrated in the National Bank, which will provide preferential interest rates. Furthermore, the foreign exchange market is currently stable. There is still an oversupply of foreign exchange at designated banks. The foreign exchange market price is unlikely to change in the short term. Regarding economic inspections, starting yesterday, the economic police of the city's police bureau have been fully deployed to closely monitor speculative markets. Speculators who continue to act will not escape the law. It is expected that prices will stabilize within a few days.

[Further Report] Yesterday, the Central Bank had a deficit of 26.7 billion yuan, the Bank of China had a deficit of 9.8 billion yuan, the China Trust Bureau had a deficit of 23.31 billion yuan, and foreign banks had a deficit of 13.3 billion yuan. Direct clearing banks had a total deficit of 13.9 billion yuan, and agent clearing banks had a total deficit of 45.7 billion yuan. It is reported that the large deficit of national bank branches is due to the China Trust Bureau's allocation of rayon, the Textile Construction Company's sale of cloth, the China Silk Company's sale of silk fabrics, and the settlement of profit taxes. There is still a large amount of clearing funds to be paid today for the Textile Construction Company's allocation of yarn and the settlement of payments. Therefore, it is generally predicted that the silver market will not ease before the end of the month. Yesterday, the underground interest rate was 1 jiao 5 fen.

### Registration of Imported Goods Deadline Extended to the End of This Month

[Our Report] The Import and Export Control Committee previously announced that all imported goods shipped before August 16th that have not obtained import licenses must be registered with the committee's registration department (Room 102, No. 15 Bund) and must be registered by the end of August. As August 31st is a Sunday, the committee will still be open as usual. To date, a total of 600 to 700 cases have been registered.

### Cai Lianfa Arrives in Shanghai for Inspection to Promote National Goods Exports to the Philippines

Cai Lianfa, Chairman of the Manila Chinese National Goods Importers Association, flew to Shanghai recently to inspect and discuss with national goods exporters and major manufacturers in the city to promote the export of national goods to the Philippines. It is reported that Mr. Cai plans to hold a national goods exhibition in the Philippines after returning to promote them. During his stay in Shanghai, his contact address is Pacific Trading Company, No. 17 Jinling East Road.

Cigarettes Decline

Yesterday, the cigarette market weakened as the recent surge in prices was too large, buyers were hesitant, and the market had ample supply. The final price of 10-pack British cigarettes fell by 900,000 yuan compared to the 26th, to 14.6 million yuan. Old Knife cigarettes also fell by 650,000 yuan, to 11.85 million yuan. Other Chinese cigarettes and American boxed cigarettes also declined slightly.

### Group Savings Business Opens in Guangzhou, Hankou, and Chongqing on September 1st

### In Memory of Dr. Qian Mingxi!

— Liang Junqing

Having previously read a piece in the "Current Affairs News" evening edition and a circulating message among the eight medical associations in this city, I learned that Dr. Qian Mingxi, a surgeon at Nanjing Municipal Hospital, passed away after administering spinal anesthesia to a patient, Diao Rongtai, who suffered from acute appendicitis before surgery. The court deemed it manslaughter and sentenced him to one year and six months of imprisonment. Alas, this Dr. Qian Mingxi! Heaven and earth are ruthless, treating all things as straw dogs. Living in this chaotic world, everyone is in danger. Is this not just Dr. Qian's concern alone? I write this to mourn him.

We do not wish to inquire whether the Nanjing court's judgment was fair or not. We also do not wish to inquire whether Dr. Qian was negligent in this instance. What we want to ask is whether the acute appendicitis that Diao Rongtai suffered from required surgery! If this kind of acute appendicitis were left untreated surgically, allowing it to change naturally, would it not have led to death? If this kind of acute appendicitis would have inevitably led to death without surgery, then Dr. Qian's actions were indeed justified. As for the type of anesthesia he chose to use before the surgery, that was his absolute personal freedom. Not only is the judge unable to determine whether it was appropriate, but even those like us who have not personally witnessed the situation cannot rashly criticize it. We serve the public, and we encounter all kinds of strange and unpredictable diseases every day. At this moment, we can only rely on our knowledge and experience to take emergency measures, without considering the consequences. If we knew that we might be held liable for imprisonment afterward, then no one would want to risk the law. Such a wise and self-preserving approach may not harm the doctor, but it would be detrimental to the patient. After all, there are countless acute patients in the world who need our emergency care. If doctors are unwilling to risk the law and sit idly by, then countless patients will be left to die. Is this the original intention of the country's laws to protect the lives of the people? Nowadays, incompetent doctors abound, killing people unknowingly in countless instances. The authorities not only fail to take measures to crack down on them but instead indulge them, turning a blind eye. Is this justice?

Alas! The sage is not benevolent, treating the people as straw dogs. Dr. Qian Mingxi is gone. Should we doctors change our profession to those who measure pulses with three fingers and talk medicine on paper?

### A Brief Discussion on "Polydipsia and Polyuria" in Children

— Wang Juerong

In the past three years, every summer, pediatric departments of various hospitals and private clinics have seen an increase in a type of childhood epidemic, with four prominent symptoms: First, persistent high fever. Second, thirst. Third, polyuria. Fourth, an increase in lymphocytes in the blood. Patients are mostly young children. Although the prognosis is good, treatment is quite difficult. The findings of our research on this disease over the past three years are recorded below:

Causes: Completely unknown. It mainly occurs in children under the age of five, especially infants and those under two years old.

Transmission is mostly through direct contact with patients. Patients have no immunity, and many suffer from it again, with some even experiencing it for three consecutive years.

It is mostly prevalent during the hot summer months and decreases as the weather cools down in the autumn.

Susceptible individuals: Children with lymphatic constitution, enlarged tonsils, or physical weakness and malnutrition are most susceptible to this disease. It is also easy to contract if a cold is not fully recovered from.

This disease is mostly contracted through direct contact with patients. There have been cases where several children in one family or neighborhood contracted it one after another. It is still questionable whether the pathogen exists in the secretions of the mouth and nose.

The route of entry for the pathogen is generally through the tonsils or the sinus area of the nose.

Symptoms:

Incubation period: The average is (three to seven days). Prodromal period: Initially, there is mild diarrhea. Urine is reduced and yellow in color, and the temperature increases sharply in the last two days (39℃ to 39.5℃). This period lasts about three to five days before transitioning to the next stage.

Increased urination period: The child's temperature fluctuates between 39℃ and 40℃. Thirst suddenly increases, and they are not afraid of even extremely hot water. As a result, a few may experience burns to the mouth and tongue. From this point on, the amount and frequency of urination both increase sharply, occurring three to four times to seven to eight times per hour. The urine is clear, and the quantity is large.

The average daily water intake is 1600cc to 3000cc, and the daily urine output exceeds the water intake by more than 20% (i.e., the daily urine output is 1800cc to 3600cc). Because the urine output exceeds the water intake, the child exhibits mild dehydration after a few days. During this period, aside from persistent high fever and a significant increase in water intake and urination, there are no other symptoms. The child often remains in good spirits and may play as usual.

Blood tests: White blood cells are mostly increased (12000-15000), but they may also be decreased (400-5500). In the white blood cell differential, lymphocytes are significantly increased (40%-55%).

Urine tests: Protein, negative (or trace).

Sugar, absolutely negative.

Urine culture: Also shows no results. The author is currently planning to conduct inoculation experiments using the patient's urine and blood. Without proper treatment, this period may last for more than a month, averaging 49 days, before entering the recovery period.

Recovery period: Starting from the 48th day on average, urination gradually decreases, and water intake also decreases. After a few days, the fever gradually subsides, leading to recovery.

Children may also recover early due to a sudden drop in temperature, but if the weather suddenly turns hot again after the autumn coolness, this disease may reappear. (According to the author's statistics, the temperature of the weather is often directly proportional to the various symptoms of the patients, but there are also cases where this disease occurs in early winter.)

Mild cases: There are also cases where urination increases, and the fever rises for a week to ten days, and then they recover on their own.

Severe cases: Some children suddenly develop a high fever, convulsions, rapid pulse, cyanosis of the lips, and die, or they develop symptoms of encephalopathy due to dehydration caused by improper treatment and die.

Complications: Due to the lack of proper treatment for this disease, nutritional imbalances may occur, and secondary tuberculosis has been seen in several cases after treatment.

Prognosis: Most children who receive proper treatment recover in the autumn coolness, so the prognosis of this disease is generally good.

Treatment: 1. Vitamin B: Injecting Vitamine B and taking Yeast orally can increase appetite, but it has no significant effect on this disease.

2, Vitamin B2: Ineffective.

3. Vit.pp.: Ineffective.

4. Vit.c.: Injecting large amounts of Vit.c can lower the fever, but the urine output does not decrease. When the injection is stopped, the fever returns.

5. Sulfagroup: Can prevent complications but has no significant effect on this disease.

6. Penicillin: The temperature may decrease in the first three days of injection, but the urine output does not decrease. Afterward, the temperature rises again, so Penicillin also has no significant effect.

7. Streptomycin: The author has not tried it, but Dr. Gao Jinglang tried it, and the results also showed that it was ineffective.

8. Cold water bath: Three times a day, each time for one to three minutes, can significantly lower the temperature.

9. Silkworm cocoon tea: Oral administration, brewing seven to ten silkworm cocoons into tea daily to replace beverages, can reduce urination after taking it for seven days, but the temperature does not decrease.

10. Pituitary extract injection: Each injection is 0.3cc, which is three units, injected once every four hours. It can reduce urination after every three injections, but after stopping the injection, it returns to normal in six to ten hours. Multiple injections can cause toxic symptoms.

11. Environmental therapy: The best. The day after the patient arrives in the deep mountains, the fever gradually decreases, and urination gradually returns to normal, making it the most suitable therapy.

12. Air-conditioned ward: The author is researching with Dr. Gao Jinglang. If an "air-conditioned ward" can be set up to keep the indoor air at around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, patients can stay in the hospital and return home when the weather cools down, which will definitely be effective. Unfortunately, due to material conditions, it has not been tested.

Conclusion: The pathogen of this disease is still unknown, and there are four theories about the cause of the disease:

(1) Sunlight relationship: Due to sudden hot weather, young children develop this disease after being exposed to high-heat sunlight.

(2) The adrenal glands react due to heat.

(3) Inflammation of the periphery of the pituitary gland.

(4) There is a pathogen, probably a Virus-filtrant that becomes active when the temperature reaches 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

Note 1: Dr. Gao Jinglang and the author are continuing to study the theory of this disease separately. If colleagues or patients in various places have symptoms that differ from this article or have special treatments, please advise. Correspondence address: Transfer to the Shanghai Medical Association.

Note 2: This article is based on the author's medical records for the past three years, but according to Dr. Gao Jinglang, the Lsmghocyter in the patient's white blood cells has increased to more than 70%, and atypical lymphocytes have also been found in the blood. Therefore, Dr. Gao Jinglang calls it a type of "glandular fever." It is recorded together for research and expresses admiration for Dr. Gao Jinglang's spirit of research after his diagnosis.

Jun Qing's note: Dr. Wang's article is very valuable for introduction because there are many people in Shanghai suffering from this disease. If their parents can read this article, it will be beneficial. I have encountered several cases, and their lymphocyte count has also reached 70%. I have repeatedly treated them without success and was at a loss. Later, I changed to using rest and improved nutrition methods before gradually recovering. Dr. Gao Jinglang believes it is glandular fever, and I also have the same feeling, but I don't know if my colleagues agree?

### Japanese Schistosomiasis, Prevalent in Southern Jiangsu

— Shen Luo

Japanese schistosomiasis (Schistosoma Japonica) is prevalent in various parts of Southern Jiangsu. Along with black fever and yaws in Northern Jiangsu, it is a local endemic disease in Jiangsu Province. Active prevention and treatment of Japanese schistosomiasis (hereinafter referred to as "blood disease") has only begun in recent years. In May of the 35th year of the Republic, the Jiangsu Provincial Health Department, concerned about the increasingly serious spread of the disease, established the Southern Jiangsu Local Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute, specializing in dealing with local endemic diseases such as schistosomiasis and hookworm, as well as other intestinal parasites. The institute is now located in the town of Mudu in Wu County, where schistosomiasis is more prevalent. However, the outside world still lacks a deep understanding of the prevalence and transmission of schistosomiasis. The author, regardless of literary skill, has written this article to inform the public and draw attention to the prevention and treatment of the disease. It would be an honor if it could spark further discussion and receive guidance from more experienced individuals.

A. Japanese schistosomiasis is not transmitted from Japan. Japanese schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease of the internal organs caused by the invasion of the Japanese schistosome into the human body. It was first discovered in 1904 by three Japanese scholars, Katsurada, Tsuchiya, and Fujinami. For ease of reference, the disease was named "Japanese Schistosomiasis" in medicine to distinguish it from Egyptian schistosomiasis (S. Haematobium) in Africa and Manson's schistosomiasis (S. Mansoni) in the Americas and the West Indies.

Japanese schistosomiasis has also been discovered in China. Cases were reported as early as 1905. However, in medical practice, newly discovered disease names, treatments, and drugs are often named after the discoverer's surname or place name. Therefore, Japanese schistosomiasis also follows this convention, adding the earliest discovered place name – Japan – to the scientific name of schistosomiasis. (To be continued)

### Chatting After Diagnosis (Continued to the End)

— Wu Jihua

Optarson is a mixture of organic arsenic and strychnine (a nerve stimulant). Its advantage is only that it has low toxicity and few side effects, but it does not have exceptional restorative power. Recently, I used Glyderophosphate compound Lilly (1,000 yuan per injection) to achieve the same effect. Domestic drugs such as Tonicol are also available, so it is really not worth buying.

Tonophosphan is an organic phosphorus preparation with both strong and weak packaging. It functions to stimulate metabolism, nourish nerves, and promote bone development. However, its effect is slow, and it is not easy to see significant results even after injecting ten or twenty shots. I remember when I was studying, I was very weak in nerves because I studied too hard. I tried thirty or forty shots of concentrated Tonophosphan, but I didn't get significant results. Later, I recovered by resting. A substitute for this drug is Pliosfen from Guangming Pharmaceutical Factory. The ingredients are said to be the same as the German product, and the price is very cheap, only 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per box (10 pieces). Although I dare not guarantee that Pliosfen is exactly the same as Tonophosphan, phosphorus preparations are always phosphorus preparations. Perhaps the difference between domestic and European and American drugs can be compared to enamel washbasins. European and American products are more solid, the iron blanks are thicker, and the appearance is smoother, while domestic products are thinner, the iron blanks are inferior, and the appearance is inevitably imperfect. But a washbasin is always a washbasin, and it is not impossible to use it for household use.

The reason why Schering's Spermin is so expensive is probably because it is the only foreign product. Speaking of Spermin, it has really declined and should be eliminated. However, because the level of education in society is too low, medical knowledge can be said to be almost non-existent, so the waste that has long been shelved abroad still has a thriving business in the Chinese market. You can see all kinds of wonderful names and all kinds of novel advertisements on the newspaper. Those who are good at advertising can make a fortune by relying on Spermin, and there are indeed several pharmaceutical factories that started with Spermin and rely on Spermin to stand firm. I remember six or seven years ago, the German manager of Schering Foreign Bank had dinner with me one night. When the wine was very high, he took out a letter from his arms and taught me to read it. This letter was written to him by the scientific department of Schering Pharmaceutical Factory in Berlin. It said: "In our Germany, Spermin has long been unused, because after the rapid progress in the research of testicular hormones, Spermin's position has been replaced by Gaisweixiong. The part of our factory that manufactures organ extracts has long been closed, but there are still many wastes left. If you can promote Spermin in China, we will be very excited to accept the opportunity to use waste. You must know that the testicles are the organs that produce male hormones, but they are immediately input into the blood after being produced. They are not storage warehouses, so the male hormones extracted from the testicles are actually very small, and it is difficult to obtain clinical effects. If the patient feels excited after using it, it is probably a psychological effect." I was very ashamed after reading it, so I had to laugh and say that you Germans used to be fooled by Spermin. From this, we can know that buying Schering's Spermin is no different from paying a high price to buy fake antiques.

Random Notes from Shanghai

### Extortion and Ghosts

— Shilang

Inspector Cha Yan of the Direct Taxation Bureau extorted tens of millions from the woodworking industry and then threatened them to fabricate statements saying, "There was no bribery." The terribleness of officialdom's abuse of power is such!

If it weren't for the Council's exposure, who knows when the people's grievances from being bullied, oppressed, and extorted by officialdom would be redressed!

It is said that there are 2,800 registered dancers, but in reality, it is said that there are 10,000 unregistered dancers in all the aforementioned bars.

If the dance halls were closed, the future of these 10,000 people would be unimaginable.

It is not easy to study even if you have money. For example, private school tuition is expensive, and to apply for "municipal" or "public" schools, you have to "go through the back door" and ask people to write "eight-line letters" for you.

I didn't expect that there was such a thing to apply for college. "Studying" also has to "plead," is this the "sadness" of "students" or the "tragedy" of the education world?

The ones who violate traffic rules the most on Shanghai roads are—pedicabs! When they are empty, they wander around in the center of the road; when they are carrying passengers, they don't keep to the side or move in single file; often two or three pedicabs travel side by side in the center of the road.

How can Shanghai's traffic not be congested under such circumstances? How can it not be chaotic?

I personally admire Director Yu Shuping's theory on interrogating criminals. It seems that China needs to strengthen its knowledge of criminal psychology and the use of scientific methods to collect evidence.

The case of Kelley and Malley's murder has been dragging on until now as an example.

These two days, not only are there "ghosts" haunting the Huangpu River in Shanghai, but there is also some kind of "eye-gouging gang" appearing. Actually, there is nothing. The city is making even a normal, healthy person turn into a "neurotic."

### Americans Look at the British Economic Crisis

— Translated by Zhengming

Since the end of the Great War, the United States has been facing another British economic crisis for the second time. A few people in Washington are discussing these facts:

Until the outbreak of World War II, Britain had always been the largest exporting country in the world, but due to unfavorable trade balances for nine consecutive years, foreign exchange reserves have been gradually depleted, especially US dollars.

The industrial recovery in Britain and the repair of factories destroyed in the war have fallen far behind schedule; if there is another winter like last year, it will be difficult to support.

The $3.75 billion loan borrowed from the United States will be used up by the end of this year; Downing Street's US dollars are being used very rapidly. In July alone, $700 million was used.

When Prime Minister Attlee stood up in the House of Commons and announced an unprecedented new austerity program in peacetime, Washington still didn't ask. What Washington is concerned about is the effectiveness of Attlee's plan, is it just a prelude to asking for another loan?

Preparations are now underway to ease the conditions of this existing loan because Britain has once again requested to reopen negotiations on the terms, so the United States will also investigate Britain's use of this US dollar loan.

The situation in Britain is extremely critical, although not as bad as in many other European countries. Washington's view is that Britain, seeing that their credit range in the United States and Canada is shrinking, and that their export target announced in February is at least 20% short, launched this crisis to obtain further US assistance, possibly to borrow an additional loan.

Britain, aware that the current bad situation may reach its worst peak this winter, has now decided to show their cards on the table for various excellent political reasons. The UK’s problem is clearer than it was a few months ago when the issue of aid to the whole of Europe under the Marshall Plan was occupying the center stage of the world stage.

There is evidence that Britain has enough resources to support itself, pending the effective implementation of the Marshall Plan. In a sense, the British had foreseen that they would have a crisis, prepared for a rainy day, and made preparations in advance. (Translated from Newsweek)

### The Absurd Eye-Gouging Gang

— Zhou Yuande

Recently, a terrible message has been spreading through the streets and alleys: It is said that women, the elderly, and children are hiding sharp weapons and using inquiries or requests for a seat as an excuse to gouge out people's eyes. They also vividly describe the stories, "The grandmother of someone at some place was gouged out of her eyes because someone asked to rest for a while and was invited into the house. The person also escaped. Also, the child of someone at some place had his heart and lungs gouged out. Someone at some place was about to gouge out eyes but was seen by others, who beat the person up and sent them to the × bureau, who knew that the × bureau opened the back door and let the eye-gouging person run away. Someone else caught a person at some place, and confiscated sharp tools for gouging out eyes, such as bamboo tubes, curved knives, and... and even a certificate from the ×× bureau calling him to gouge out eyes. There was also a person caught at some place, and an eye-gouging certificate was found..." The more absurd it is, the more terrifying it is. In the hearts of the ignorant people, a dead knot was formed. The propagandists repeatedly added fuel to the fire, saying that it was more certain than what they had seen with their own eyes....

So... in Yangsi Township, Gaochang Temple, and even Dapu Bridge, news of mistaken beatings occurred one after another (one dead and one injured). The dead and injured were people with families and regular jobs. In Caojiadu, another mistaken beating occurred, again with two dead and injured. After the murderers were arrested and interrogated, it turned out like this:

"I only heard people talk about the appearance of the eye-gouging gang, and I haven't seen it myself; at that time, I heard people shout and beat, and I participated in the beating in a moment of impulse, thus causing a murder..."

The ignorant people actually regarded the ×× bureau and the ××× government as slaughterhouses specializing in collecting "human hearts" and "human eyes". At the same time, some people also said that the eyes were collected in preparation for making "air-conditioned atomic bombs" to fight the communists...

It's another funny story that broke my guts.

"In fact, these things are completely unwarranted, and I don't know where the rumors came from..."

Shanghai is really absurd sometimes.

### A Momentary Thrill

— Zhu Mei

The French word Sensation, directly translated, means "feeling." But I think it is more appropriate to translate it as "a momentary thrill." Because we are living in this world, everyone is living for "a momentary thrill." For example, a penniless person, his only hope is to have money. People with money are even more eager to have money. He works hard, or steals, or, in the most fashionable term, "embezzles," his purpose is to have money. When the penniless person really gets money, when he really has money, he only feels a little pleasure at that moment of getting the money, and after that moment, it becomes ordinary. Therefore, some people want to have 200,000 when they have 100,000, and they want to have 1 million when they have 200,000, and they want to have 10 million when they have 1 million, and they want to go on forever without end. Why? To feel a momentary thrill for that number. In my opinion, there is really no difference between eating cornbread with pickles and eating shark fin with bear's paw. Shark fin with bear's paw is nothing more than giving the mouth a momentary thrill. After eating it, the feces it becomes is not better than eating cornbread and pickles. But people are always looking for excitement, a momentary thrill. I remember one year (1935) when the World Exposition was held in Brussels, there was a game called high-altitude railway. I saw many people getting off the car with sad faces. Out of curiosity, I bought a ticket and followed other people onto the car. After the car started, it was slow at first and then fast, and the highest speed was used both up and down. The heart of everyone sitting in the car was almost jumping out of the chest. Some people were so scared that they kept shouting. After getting off the car, I asked a companion, what's the point of this? He said: Sensation, (for a momentary thrill) He said it too right, because nothing in the world is not like this. (August 12, 36 in Qingdao)

### Miscellaneous News from America

American Detective News

Detective novels and magazines can be said to be America's unique publications. No other country has such rich material and dramatic descriptions. Americans' curiosity and fondness for novelty have created many talented detective writers. A large proportion of these novelists are police officers, so their writing is so intimate and flavorful, with both text and illustrations. According to my reading, there are more than twenty kinds of famous American detective magazines. "True Detective Stories" and "Police Gazette" can be bought at any newsstand. The detective novels written by Americans are based on facts, not fabricated out of thin air, and they include actual photos. Such material is readily available in local newspapers. It only needs to be organized and supplemented to become a good article. American newspapers attach great importance to local news. Because, except for a few newspapers like the New York Times, which have a global reach, the rest are local newspapers. And local newspapers also have a detailed obligation to report local news. If a murder occurs in the local area, this is a major event. Regarding the safety of all citizens, everyone feels a personal impact. How can the local newspaper not record the news of the assassination because of its suggestive, lewd, or thieving content? Even officials, in order to show their own virtuous governance and prevent their superiors from knowing, forbid local newspapers from publishing it. How foolish is that! Shanghai is a place where social news is produced, but the first-class material occupies the last-class position in the newspapers. This is a great pity. For example, the Shen Junru case is first-class news material, but after searching all the newspapers in Shanghai, none of them have a systematic record. Regarding her photos, her past decades of scandalous history, her daily life, and the course of her physiological perversion, the newspaper should send a specialist to inquire about her past landlords, investigate old files of crimes in the police station, interview doctors who were close to her, interview all her relatives and friends, and cooperate with police officers to examine all her private belongings and correspondence to obtain valuable information. What is the style of American newspapers? They often send news reporters with cameras to wait for information at street corners and alleys. To give a concrete example, when a reporter strolled past a large hotel, a guest suddenly jumped from the forty-second floor to commit suicide. Before the suicide victim landed, the reporter raised his camera and took a picture. Then, he rushed back to deliver the negative to the newspaper's photography department for developing and plate-making. He then rushed back to the hotel and police station to find out the identity of the guest, the cause of the suicide, his usual life, his friends, the autopsy, and the police handling. A detailed long article was already in the evening paper that day. That kind of valuable photo—a suicide victim falling in mid-air—was distributed to newspapers all over the world within twenty-four hours by airmail and telecommunication, increasing sales by no less than tens of millions of copies, which together is still extremely cheap. Newspapers are fundamentally about reporting news, of course, with novelty as the main thing. People who do not like novelty will never read newspapers and will instead read the "Imperial Qing Classics Explained." Detective news is the representative of novelty material. The recent murder-for-money cases in Shanghai have neither photos nor detailed records. The shooting of war criminals, one wolf and one tiger, caused a stir in the newspapers for a while, but it was only superficial records. There were no reports about the war criminals' backgrounds and families, their criminal records, or the living conditions of the victims' relatives. It can only be regarded as watching a drama without plot or system. What a pity! (46)
