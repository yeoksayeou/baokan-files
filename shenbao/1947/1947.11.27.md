### Secretary of State Marshall Announces Drafting of Long-Term Aid to China Plan; U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes $60 Million Aid to China Bill; Officially Submitted to Congress on the First of Next Month

[United Press International, Washington, 25th] After the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the $60 million aid to China as part of the foreign aid bill, Secretary of State Marshall simultaneously issued a statement saying that he is preparing to draft a long-term aid to China plan.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee today provisionally passed a temporary aid bill of $549 million, which includes $60 million in aid to China. The State Department's $597 million bill was reduced by $48 million by the committee. Aid to France, Austria, and Italy has been reduced, but the $60 million for China has been passed. The committee's action to reduce the State Department's request and include China in the temporary aid plan still requires the committee's final approval before the national bill is formally amended, passed, and submitted to Congress. According to committee members, the bill will be submitted to Congress on December 1st. Although the amended bill requires final approval, there is no doubt that the committee will implement the amendments passed today.

[United Press International, Washington, 25th] Congressman Judd, on the 25th, following Marshall's request for $597 million in aid to the three countries, which was reduced by $108 million by Congress, proposed an amendment. Marshall's request, after being submitted to the clerk of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was immediately revised into a $549 million aid fund for four countries, including China. Judd said that the committee believes that if aid is to be granted, it should be implemented under the most favorable conditions and as quickly as possible. He said that Marshall had hinted that his aid to China plan would be completed before January. The committee believes that if the temporary aid plan includes China, the State Department can immediately use the funds when Marshall's plan is completed, without further delay. He said that the items for China's purchase of goods are not specifically stipulated, but he learned that China's greatest need is for oil, cotton, and similar products, rather than food. Judd said that he has not yet discussed his amendment on the China issue with other Senate officials, but he pointed out that Senate Leader Vandenberg had said on the 24th that he advocated aid to China. Observers recall that Senator Morse delivered a speech in the Senate on the 24th, advocating that China be aided on the same basis as Western Europe. Judd said that there is not only hope but also full confidence that his amendment will be passed by both houses of Congress. The bill stipulates that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will immediately advance $100 million after the measure is passed. The spokesman for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Voorhis, said that the reduction in expenses for France, Italy, and Austria was based on the amount of available funds outside the country. At the same time, support for the bill in the Senate is increasing daily. Senate Leader Vandenberg predicts that it will be passed by an overwhelming majority on the night of the 26th. Voorhis said that the House bill does not specifically stipulate the amount of aid to each country, but he said that based on the speeches and reports released by the committee, it has been clarified how Congress will allocate the funds.

[Another dispatch] Congressman Judd said that it is a mistake for the U.S. to concentrate all its anti-communist forces in Europe while neglecting China. He said that, in fact, with less funding, more can be accomplished in China than in Europe. He continued, "In the movement to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating the world, there are two fronts, namely, the European and Asian fronts." Judd said, "We are now making a mistake, that is, allocating $20 billion on one front, while not giving a single penny to the people who are fighting the same war on another front."

### Authoritative American Sources in the Capital Discuss the Goals of Economic Aid to China; Military Assistance is Also Only a Matter of Time

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] An authoritative American source here told reporters that the U.S. government is conducting aid to China in response to public opinion. After Marshall announced the guarantee of aid to China and the approximate amount on the 10th, there were no objections from either the government or the public. Important figures in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have been urging it, and powerful figures in the Republican Party are planning to attack the Democratic Party for its weak aid to China. Therefore, the action of aid to China has reached fruition and is expected to be specifically implemented after obtaining a legislative basis in the short term. However, Secretary of State Marshall's focus seems to remain on the economic and social stability of the Chinese government's controlled areas. Marshall believes that a stable rear area is an absolute requirement for achieving victory on the front lines, and rear area stability can only be ensured by an abundance of supplies and currency stability. The source said: Marshall still believes that the National Army's excellent equipment will not be surpassed by the Communist Army, and he considers stabilizing the rear area to be the main objective of aid to China. The announced $300 million loan, agreed upon by both parties for the purpose of stabilizing the currency, and the first phase of $60 million in urgent allocation, are obviously part of the tools to cope with price fluctuations at the end of the year. The first goal of Marshall's economic aid to China plan is to prevent the value of the legal tender from continuing to depreciate, so that China's financial difficulties can be resolved. The second goal is to prevent the economy from being burdened by finance, and to use the supply of foreign materials to stabilize the people's lives and psychology. If so, the morale of the front lines will be greatly boosted, political power can ensure military victory, the Communist Army will inevitably be at the end of its rope, and peace can be restored. The source said: He is unaware of any large-scale military aid to China, but he is unable to predict what will happen in the future, as this is also a matter of objective need, only a matter of time.

### Currency Reform Requires $400 Million

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Economic expert and member of the National Economic Council, Huang Yuanbin, commented on the temporary foreign aid bill passed by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying: The content of the bill is not fully known due to unclear telegraphic communication. However, based on the trend of U.S. aid to Europe, this $60 million aid to China loan is far from our imagination and does not help solve China's current economic crisis. The current economic situation in China must be reformed by reforming the currency system in order to achieve stability. The reform of the currency system requires, in addition to the government's existing foreign exchange reserves, a line of credit of $400 million to be completed.

### Lou Tongsun Discusses the Aid to China Issue

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Economic authority Lou Tongsun said: We hope that the passage of the $60 million aid to China bill by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee is the beginning of Marshall's comprehensive aid to China plan. We welcome this kind of aid, but if American friends really want to help China solve economic problems, we hope that they will continue to provide assistance. Therefore, $60 million or even $300 million is helpful, but it is still far from truly solving our economic problems. At the same time, Lou believes that Marshall's aid to China plan is relatively piecemeal, and he is particularly afraid that this $60 million will not be paid in one lump sum. Subsequently, when reporters asked for his opinion on the issue of currency reform, Lou said: It seems that it is still too early to talk about currency reform unless $300 million can be paid in one lump sum. Lou also said: If China does not rely on foreign aid, the Chinese economy will never collapse, because our country is an agricultural economy.

### Committee for Handling Relief Supplies Established Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Miao Jiaming, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies, and Gu Yuzhen, member and Chief Secretary of the committee, had their first meeting with American representatives Kirkpatrick and Moore on the 26th.

The committee will be formally established on the 26th. Whether the U.S. will establish a special small group in the embassy to handle this matter is still awaiting Washington's decision. Miao said that on the Chinese government's side, he will be responsible for handling business and maximizing the effectiveness of the supplies.

### The United States, Britain, and France Agree with Our Position; The Peace Conference with Germany Must Be Convened by Five Countries

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a press release at noon on the 26th as follows:

"Regarding the convening of the peace conference with Germany, the Chinese government notified the four countries of England, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union of its position on November 5th of this year.

Therefore, it should be jointly decided by the entire Council of Foreign Ministers. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have all responded to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, agreeing with our country's position and advocating that the peace conference with Germany must be convened by the five countries of the entire Council of Foreign Ministers, and that China should be the country presiding over the convening of this conference."

### More Than 30 Million Refugees Nationwide; The Government Is Actively Providing Relief; Dong Xianguang Reports on the Progress of the Work

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Director Dong Xianguang said at a press conference on the 26th: Our country has been disrupted by the Communist Party, and the disaster areas cover Jin, Ji, Yu, Lu, Re, Cha, Tie, Su, Wan, E, Shan, Gan, and the Northeast. Wherever the Communist army goes, they carry out struggles and cleansing, burning, killing, looting, and imposing harsh levies and conscription, destroying transportation, and breaching dikes. All kinds of atrocities are used to the extreme, causing producers to lose their tools, farmers to lose their fields, and others who have lost their livelihood due to war. The young and strong are robbed and forced to become soldiers, and the old and weak are turned into orphans and widows. Therefore, refugees are everywhere and starvation is common. As of yesterday, the Ministry of Social Affairs, based on reports from provincial and municipal governments, councils, and other relevant agencies and groups, and after statistical analysis, has determined that the number of refugees who have escaped from various bandit areas and urgently need relief has reached 33,089,922. This accounts for 7% of the total population of the country. Recently, the Communist army's roaming area has expanded, and the number of refugees that various provinces and cities have not yet reported is not included in the calculation. In order to save the displaced people and stabilize society, the government is supervising various places to earnestly handle relief work, either setting up shelters for the refugees according to their nature, or issuing funds and supplies, or providing loans, or implementing work relief, or introducing employment, or taking in the elderly, weak, disabled, and teaching them skills in orphanages. The central government has allocated relief funds and supplies based on the actual situation in various places. From January of this year to the present, a total of 105,451,820,000 yuan has been allocated for relief funds, 50 billion yuan for loans, more than 70,000 tons of grain, and food and clothing. The central government has made its best efforts to allocate the above amounts, but due to the large number of refugees, not all have been able to receive relief. With the severe winter approaching, the refugees' situation of being frozen and hungry is dire. Relief efforts should be strengthened. A large-scale winter relief campaign has been launched. In addition to mobilizing social movements and general donations in various provinces and cities, the wealthier cities have also been designated to expand their efforts. It is estimated that at least 100 billion yuan or more can be raised, and the competent authorities have requested the Executive Yuan to allocate 50 billion yuan in order to cooperate with the original refugee relief work in various places and step up the work. However, in addition to the 33 million-plus victims of Communist bandit disasters, there are also more than 15 million people who have suffered from floods and droughts, as well as local poor people, who are all in dire need of relief. Further financial and material assistance from all parties is needed to help those in distress and stabilize society.

[Another dispatch] In order to strengthen relief work, the government has decided to set up relief zones in various places in Jiangsu and Anhui to distribute funds and supplies on the spot.

Editorial

### Revival of Japanese Terrorist Forces

Recently, foreign news agencies have been constantly broadcasting news of the underground activities of Japanese terrorist forces. According to a report from the Phnom Penh office of the New Asia News Agency on the 9th of this month, right-wing elements who had disappeared after the surrender have recently shown signs of resurgence. Among them, the "Revolutionary Chrysanthemum Nurturing Comrades Association", the "New Sharp Masses Party", and the "Japanese Innovation Party" are the most famous. Using "upholding the emperor, opposing communism, and advocating democracy" as slogans, they are gathering former soldiers, local landlords, and thugs, attempting to create terror. Just as this news was announced, the General Headquarters of the Allied Powers in Tokyo learned that a terrorist organization existed underground in Japan, more dangerous and more widespread than the former Black Dragon Society. The occupying authorities have called it a "secret government" and believe that if this "government" is not eradicated after the peace treaty is signed and the occupying forces withdraw, it will rise up and seize power. It is reported that this nationwide underground organization has a leader and a committee of ten to twelve people, including former warlords, financial magnates, and giants. All those who sympathize with extreme nationalism, such as shopkeepers, vendors, shoeshiners, as well as local strongmen, thugs, and labor agitators, are members of this organization. They have funds and weapons. All participants must go through a blood oath, fully demonstrating the spirit of Bushido. The Allied Headquarters is paying considerable attention to this situation, but it is unknown how the Allied Headquarters plans to deal with it.

The Allied Headquarters has controlled Japan for more than two years, and political and economic performances are extremely unstable. Reactionary and conservative forces are growing, while the relatively progressive Katayama government is faltering. Undoubtedly, this is the mistake of the Allied Headquarters in condoning the old forces and failing to implement the Potsdam Declaration and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, and preventing and destroying Japanese militarism. According to the Potsdam Declaration, the aggression of Japan must be thoroughly "punished", and the financial groups that "manufactured war" and the socio-economic system that "can enable it to rearm for war" must be dissolved; the "authority and power that desire to conquer the world" and "militarism", namely military institutions and fascist forces, must be eradicated; the "war criminals" who launched and presided over aggression must also be punished. The Far Eastern Commission, in order to supervise the implementation of the Japanese surrender terms and to clear the foundation for the revival of Japanese imperialism, has repeatedly resolved and instructed MacArthur to implement them. In reality, these measures have never been thoroughly implemented; on the contrary, a terrorist organization more dangerous than the Black Dragon Society has emerged today under the control of the occupying forces. This is a threat to the Allied countries, and a terror to the peaceful and democratic future of Japan.

According to a Reuters report, the terrorist organizations currently lurking underground in Japan have old warlords and financial groups as their backbone. Before the surrender, the old warlords of Japan, centered on fascists, penetrated deep into the army and rural areas. After the surrender, they disappeared for a time. Due to the neglect of the Allied Headquarters in punishing aggression in recent years, the fascist organizations were not thoroughly dissolved, and war criminals and financial groups all appreciated the "benevolence" of the Allied Headquarters. Therefore, the previous extreme nationalism has revived in a new guise. As far as we know, in addition to organizations such as the "Revolutionary Chrysanthemum Nurturing Comrades Association," which promotes the idea of ​​respecting the emperor with the chrysanthemum water precepts of Nancho loyal minister Kusunoki Masashige, there are also illegal organizations such as the Shimpentai (Divine Soldiers) and the Daito Juku (Greater East School). They are trying their best to clarify that Japan fought for "divine will" and that their failure in the "Greater East Asia War" brought "humiliation" to the emperor. Therefore, they want to organize actions to prepare for the next revenge. This kind of propaganda activity exists not only in rural areas and on the streets, but also has a particularly open development in Hokkaido. They have not only not awakened to the mistakes of the defeat, but are grinding their swords underground, preparing to step back into the historical wrong path after the peace treaty is signed. This is indeed a hidden worry for the future of Japan. In order to establish a peaceful and democratic future for Japan, we hope that the Allied Headquarters will rectify the illegal organizations of the Japanese people and thoroughly eradicate all terrorist forces.

The "Basic Policy for Japan" formulated by the representatives of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission in June of this year stated that the international security and stability depend on the following: First, completely destroying the military institutions of Japan, as this institution has been the main means of implementing aggression for decades; Second, setting up political and economic conditions so that Japanese militarism cannot be revived; Third, enabling the Japanese people to thoroughly understand their war intentions, expedition plans, and methods of achieving such plans, which have brought them to the brink of destruction. Therefore, the representatives resolved: to completely disarm, reorganize the economy to deprive Japan of the power to fight, eliminate the power of militarism, severely try war criminals, and stipulate a strict period of control. Undoubtedly, the joint decision of the Far Eastern Commission is a correct and reasonable control policy, but the Allied Headquarters has not fully accomplished its task. The United States is now advocating that the countries of the Far Eastern Commission hold a preparatory meeting for a peace treaty with Japan. In fact, there is a distance between the control policy and the decisions of the representatives. The Allied Headquarters has not made Japan comply with the obligations of the surrender terms and abandon militarist ideas and actions. How can we discuss the content of the peace treaty? Therefore, we ask the Allied Headquarters to be sure to implement the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and implement the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission in order to lay a smooth foundation for the peace conference with Japan. The terrorist organizations that exist underground in Japan today are a threat to the future peace treaty with Japan; only by eliminating the power of militarism, severely trying war criminals, and disarming Japan economically and ideologically can the peace conference with Japan be successful. The current opportunity is very urgent, and we hope that the Allied Headquarters will make a choice!

[Associated Press, Baguio, 26th] The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific voted on the question of whether to allow the Republic of China to join the commission on the 26th, resulting in a stalemate with four votes for and four votes against.

### Reasons for Decreased Textile Exports

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The director replied to reporters' questions as follows:

Regarding the market situation in Malaya, I have not yet received an official report. However, according to official sources familiar with the Chinese textile industry, from the perspective of supply and demand, due to the arrival of winter, domestic demand has greatly increased. Textiles have a huge market in the country, and the increase in domestic demand will naturally reduce the number of exports. The temporary reduction in the amount of cotton fabrics exported from China to Malaya is one of the reasons mentioned above.

The National Assembly representative election was completed last Sunday. This move is a major step forward in the constitutional history of our country. The Chinese people's implementation of universal suffrage is an unprecedented event in history. Through this general election, democratic politics has officially begun, which is gratifying. I am convinced that we will continue to improve along this great step in the future. The ballots are currently being counted and will be released soon.

### Important Documents Seized by National Army in Shandong Province; A Letter from a Communist Bandit Cadre Frankly States that Military Morale Has Collapsed

[Our Newspaper, Jinan Air Dispatch] This is the most valuable item among the large number of documents seized by Qiu Qingquan's troops, one of the five main forces of the National Army, while fighting the Communist bandits near Yuncheng in southwestern Shandong. It is a letter from Wang Danian, political instructor of the Third Column of the Communist bandits, to Chen Yi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch of the Communist Party of China, frankly stating the current situation of the Communist bandits. After reading this letter, readers will not find it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding and deep understanding of the Communist bandits' "failure complex," "self-preservation ideology," "escape teams," "die running if you can't die fighting, starve if you can't die running," and "counter-attack, counter-attack, lose the mountains and freeze." The following are the main points of the letter: Minister Chen:

...For more than two months, I have not seen newspapers or received telegrams. The team is also moving every day, and at most I can only receive a little bit of fragmented information, as if I am in a drum. Occasionally, a telegram is sent by that column, which is like getting a treasure. I still can't receive newspapers, and telegrams can still be received, but there is a severe shortage of printing ink and paper, and I can't buy them anywhere. Comrade Lai Shaoqi wrote to Director Tang asking for some printing ink. The store director said: I can't do it anymore, don't ask me to conjure it up. As a result, Lai himself went to the Political Department and divided half of the printing ink, making it very difficult for us to print our own things.

There is also a big problem here, which is the difficulty of food. We often only eat two meals, but we can't get enough to eat. It's good to be able to eat sorghum and millet. (Reporter's note: Most of the New Fourth Army cadres are from the south.) Fortunately, everyone is now used to eating sorghum and millet, but the cadres and soldiers in the army inevitably have some "strange talk."

In daily life, there is a lot of marching, and there is water everywhere. If you are not careful, you will fall into it, especially in the northeast of Shan County. One trip is seven or eight li, at least two or three li, and no one does not get their feet wet. I also get my feet wet while riding a horse. They swell up and I can't find a path. The National Army is following closely behind, and it's even worse if I don't walk. Now it's a little shallower, and the weather is clear. Maybe it will be better in half a month or so. Daily necessities such as paper cigarettes and soap are not available at all, but pears and persimmons are enough to eat.

...A large number of enemy propaganda materials have been collected, but unfortunately they were wetted and damaged when crossing the river, and only a few are left now. The content of this propaganda is indeed absurd, but they have indeed grasped many of our weaknesses, which deserves our vigilance. The form is very good and worth learning from to break the old pattern.

I've rambled on a lot! Now, I will briefly report to you the situation of the troops that I understand:

Number of troop reductions: The Third Column started from central Shandong and suffered a total reduction of 6,000 people after the Jining battle. The Jining battle resulted in 5,344 casualties. Non-combatant reductions in the entire column totaled 700 people, for a total of 6,044 people. The Fourth Column suffered a total reduction of 6,183 people from the north to the Shandong-Henan-Hubei Military Region (statistics as of August 19) (missing the column's direct subordinates and the 10th Division). The Tenth Column had 2,000 deserters after leaving central Shandong and arriving in Shandong-Henan-Hubei, so we didn't attack Wen Shang much? After that, we really couldn't stop the main force of the Fifth Army of the National Army from crossing the Grand Canal. It is said that the situation of troop reductions in the First Column is even more serious. The troops are currently continuing to do so. The 79th Regiments of the Third Column have been reorganized into two regiments, and the Fourth Column has reduced nine companies and some platoons. Only the Eighth Column has maintained its vitality, but they don't care about fighting and only focus on making a fortune everywhere.

Ideological situation: After the Jining battle, the Third Column generally produced a sense of failure, because five companies went in and didn't come out, and almost nine companies were completely casualties. There are four specific reactions after the war;

First, complaints: complaints are common from top to bottom and left to right. The highest level complains about Commander Chen, who committed subjectivism. Regimental-level cadres said: "This was a good battle to eliminate the enemy, but unfortunately the higher-ups didn't manage the food supply well, so it's no wonder the cadres below the regimental level. The complaints from below are generally about the lack of grenade launchers, poor command, the loss of the wounded numbers (referring to the wounded), and the corpses, and the lack of initiative and cooperation from others; the Eighth and Ninth Divisions complain to each other, complaining about the propaganda workers who bragged, because they said during the mobilization that as long as they were surrounded, they would definitely break through, and there were only remnants of the 72nd Division of the National Army in the city, at most two regiments, with only three cannons, one of which couldn't be fired, and they were all babbling remnants; but the complaints also revealed a lot of accurate opinions, which are worthy of reference by leaders. (To be continued)

### Four Foreign Ministers Agree on Agenda; Order of Discussion Still Needs Further Negotiation

[News Report] London, 26th Broadcast. The second meeting of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was held today at 3:30 p.m. Greenwich time. Differences between Eastern and Western countries on the Austrian issue may quickly lead to a compromise. The duration of this meeting is scheduled to be limited to three hours.

[United Press, London, 26th Dispatch] Evening newspapers learned that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will propose a "bargaining" suggestion on the Austrian peace treaty at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to the newspaper's diplomatic correspondent, it is believed that Molotov may agree to make the Austrian issue the first item on the agenda if the Foreign Ministers' Conference can immediately pass it and then discuss the drafting of the German peace treaty procedure. At noon today, Marshall went to Churchill's private residence to have lunch with Churchill.

[Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch] The four foreign ministers met for three hours today and agreed on six agenda items, but the order of discussion has not yet been determined. The six agenda items are as follows: Report of the Austrian Peace Treaty Committee; Form and scope of the German interim political organization; Principles of German economic unity; German borders and procedures for drafting a peace treaty; Forty-year anti-German convention, the so-called Berners Treaty; Implementation of the Moscow Conference's disarmament proposal. The inclusion of the fifth item on the agenda is a victory for the United States, and the inclusion of the sixth item is a victory for the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, London, 25th Dispatch] The four foreign ministers agreed on six agenda items at today's opening meeting, but remained split three to one on whether to discuss the Austrian or German issue first. The United States, Britain, and France requested Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to discuss the Austrian issue first in order to quickly reach an agreement and comfort the anxious world. US Secretary of State Marshall said, "It is extremely important for us to make a quick decision to comfort the people of the world." However, Molotov still insisted that the German issue was more important and should be discussed first. French Foreign Minister Bidault proposed a compromise, suggesting that the agenda stipulate that the Austrian issue should be discussed first, but in practice, after a brief discussion, it should be handed over to the foreign ministers' representatives, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference itself should then discuss the German issue, which Molotov still opposed. Bevin then asked, "If we cannot reach an agreement on the German issue, will we no longer conclude a treaty on Austria? We must state our motives." Molotov agreed to discuss the US proposal for the four countries to conclude a treaty to jointly monitor Germany's disarmament for forty years, but at the same time, he must discuss the failure of Western countries' policies to disarm Germany.

### US House Foreign Affairs Committee Reduces Amount of Emergency Aid to Europe; Requests Immediate Allocation of $100 Million for Emergency Relief

The bill has been largely finalized and will be submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion next week after the details are finalized.

The Senate is approaching the final vote on the $597 million emergency relief bill for France, Italy, and Austria today. The Senate has verbally passed an additional clause stipulating that the procurement of goods under foreign aid should try to avoid stimulating domestic price increases.

[US Information Service, Washington, 25th Dispatch] The House Foreign Affairs Committee has provisionally reached an agreement that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will immediately allocate $100 million before the appropriation is approved and actually paid, so that the temporary assistance plan can begin as soon as it is approved, which is the same as the provisions included in the Greece-Turkey aid plan.

[US Information Service, Washington, 25th Dispatch] Senator Connally, a senior Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged Congress today to approve emergency relief for France, Italy, and Austria. He said in a speech to the Senate: Approving emergency relief is a necessary prelude to any long-term plan, the purpose of which is to help European free countries to help themselves and maintain their legacy of freedom. Connally gave a speech in support of the $597 million emergency relief bill. Another supporter, Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave a speech on Monday strongly supporting the bill. It is expected that after discussions and votes on various amendments on Wednesday, the entire Senate will vote on the bill. At the same time, the House Foreign Affairs Committee is also working on a draft of its emergency relief bill in preparation for submitting it to the House of Representatives for consideration.

US Treasury Authority Supports Anti-Inflation Proposal

[US Information Service, Washington, 25th Dispatch] Treasury Secretary Snyder and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Eccles testified today in Congress in support of President Truman's anti-inflation proposals, advocating reducing government securities held by banks and opposing a sharp reduction in taxes before foreign aid costs and public debt regulations are determined. Snyder assured the House Banking and Currency Committee that "protecting the US economy from 'further' inflationary pressures is as important as providing early aid to Western Europe." Although he claimed to focus only on financial matters, he also strongly supported credit controls like Eccles. Smith supported most of the controls planned by Truman before, but he only talked about credit control and public debt sales plans.

### Mad Train Headed Straight for Shanghai, Disrupting Train Schedules, All Express Trains on the Beijing-Shanghai Line Delayed, Disabled Veterans Forcing Suzhou Station Master to Let Them Pass, Fortunately No Accidents Occurred

[Report from this newspaper] The 505th military train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway departed from Nanjing yesterday morning, carrying a batch of disabled veterans from the Xuzhou Military Hospital to Shanghai, to transfer to the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to Xiaoshan. At 11 AM, when the 505th train was passing the Qiantang train at Changzhou Station, the disabled veterans in the 505th train suddenly climbed onto the Qiantang train, wanting to take it to Hangzhou. As the Qiantang train was a reserved-seat train, it was difficult to accommodate soldiers without tickets, and the station military police and station master rushed forward to dissuade them. These people started shouting and smashed three windows and two doors of car 613 of the train. Later, a large number of police officers from the Joint Military Police Office arrived to suppress them, and the Qiantang train was able to escape and depart. As a result, it was delayed by eight minutes upon arrival in Shanghai, and passengers were also frightened. At 2:33 PM, when the 505th train carrying the disabled veterans arrived at Suzhou Station, it was supposed to wait for the 5th Beijing-Shanghai down express train. The disabled veterans were unwilling to stop and wait, and got off the train to surround the Suzhou Station master, forcing him to let the train depart immediately. The station master had no choice but to let the 505th train go first, and notified the train dispatcher to pay attention at all times to avoid a train crash. The "mad train" should have waited for the Jinling train at Guanzhuangli Station, but it was finally allowed to go straight to Shanghai due to the coercion of the soldiers on the train. The train schedules on the Beijing-Shanghai Line were completely disrupted, and the Qiantang train, the Jinling train, the 5th express train, and the 77th Shanghai-Wuxi commuter train were all delayed.

### Retired Major General - With a Wife Already - Overseas Chinese Daughter Uncovers Secret, Endures Abuse, and Files Lawsuit

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yu Lude, a young woman of American citizenship born in Honolulu, Hawaii, in the Pacific Ocean, lost her father early in life. Over a decade ago, her mother, Madam Yu Xiao, brought her back to China and settled in Shanghai. She studied at the Central Girls' High School and worked as a female secretary for many years after graduation. On New Year's Eve in December of the year of the Republic (likely 1935 given context), Yu met Wang Xiu, who claimed to be the Major General Wang, Director of the Liaison Office of the Third War Area Command stationed in Shanghai, at the New Celestial Forest Ballroom through the introduction of a friend. The woman was beautiful, and the man was young and handsome. Love blossomed between them, and they wished to spend their lives together. Soon, they became intimate, and Yu became pregnant. To preserve appearances, they began living together in February of this year, and in mid-March, she gave birth to a son, named Beibei. Due to the financial difficulties of the family, Yu rented Room E, Number 8, on the fourth floor of the Lincoln Apartments, opposite the Cody Milk Bar on the central section of the Linsen Road, for them to live in.

A Violent Nature Leads to Abuse

Little did she know that Major General Wang was already married to a woman named Dai Momei. In April of this year, Dai suddenly visited Wang at the Lincoln Apartments and encountered Yu Lude. Wang introduced Yu as his sister-in-law, and Yu welcomed her, suspecting nothing. However, the next morning, she discovered the "Major General" sleeping with his "sister-in-law," and after investigating, she learned that Dai Momei was the "Major General's" "fallen wife." Only then did she realize that she had been deceived. Because Wang's affair was exposed by Yu, he held a grudge and often abused her over trivial matters.

Firearms and Ammunition Found in the Room

On the evening of September 8th, he again used a pretext to beat Yu severely, from 7:00 PM to 12:00 AM, lasting five hours. Yu, unable to endure it any longer, attempted to commit suicide by jumping from the building, but failed. She then hired lawyer Ge Jilu to report to the police station. After examining Yu's injuries, they went to the Lincoln Apartments and arrested Wang. At the same time, they found a Mauser pistol, six bullets, two handguns, eleven bullets, and a Mauser pistol in the room. When questioned, Wang Xiu declared, "I am a soldier, you police cannot arrest me." The police then telegraphed the Garrison Headquarters, and after confirming that he was not an active-duty soldier, they arrested him and sent him to the bureau for interrogation, then transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office to be prosecuted for assault and endangering public safety (possessing military weapons).

Skin and Bones, Half Her Original Weight

Yesterday, at 10:00 AM, the Second Criminal Court of the District Court began the trial. The victim, Yu Lude, wore a purple silk cheongsam, a short gray overcoat, and a coffee-light yellow two-tone scarf. She was as thin as a rake, barely able to stand, and looked very pitiful. She testified in court, stating that Wang did not work and that she paid for all the food and expenses. Wang not only did not express gratitude but instead abused her, causing the victim's weight to drop from 120 pounds to 60 pounds, as evidenced by a doctor's certificate.

Mauser Pistol Received

When questioned, the defendant testified, "I was the Deputy Director of the Major General's office, but that office was abolished in November of the 34th year of the Republic (Likely 1945). I am now unemployed. The Mauser pistol belonged to a guard named Xu Chengwei, the handguns were entrusted to me by Peng Yaguang, the Deputy Chief Officer of the Army Reorganization Division, for repair, and the Mauser pistol was received. I did not abuse Yu. I was even concerned about her health and accompanied her for physical examinations, caring for her to the best of my ability. How could I have beaten her?" The plaintiff's lawyer presented a letter from Wang Xiu's sister to Wang Xiu, dated July 6th of this year, stating that Yu was virtuous and urging Wang not to abuse Yu but to change his past attitude and treat her gently. The court adjourned the case to continue the trial on the 3rd of next month.

### Abducting the Dancer's Young Child - Female Servant's Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing - Claimed She Couldn't Bear to Leave the Little Brother, So She Took Him Along

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yu Sheng, the three-year-old son of Lu Yanru (also known as Miss Eight), a popular dancer at the Paramount Ballroom, and Lu Shaoqing, was abducted on the evening of the 13th of last month by the female servant Yao Lijindi (also known as Chen Zhaodi), who also stole clothing and fled. After wandering in the capital for four days, she was arrested upon returning to Shanghai. After being questioned by the police station, she was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office to be prosecuted for theft. At the same time, Yao's legal husband, Yao Jinfu, accused her of cohabitating with Wang Zhengfa, a barber at the Xiangfen Lane registered barbershop, and Jin Di was also prosecuted after investigation.

Adultery Charges

Yesterday morning, presiding judge Wu Xiangzu heard the case in the First Court of the District Court. Jin Di testified: "I am from Suzhou. I was introduced to the Lu family as a nanny by my little sister Qian Aimei in August of this year. Yao Fu is my formal husband. I don't know who Wang Zhengfa is. On October 13th, after 6:00 PM, while Miss Lu (referring to Lu Yanru) went out to dance, I took a few pieces of clothing and ran away, holding my little brother (Yu Sheng) in my right hand and carrying a bundle in my left hand. First, I pawned two coats, then I pawned a cheongsam. I stayed in a hostel for one night, and the next morning I took the train to Nanjing, intending to find a friend, but I couldn't find them, so I came back." When asked why she stole things and also took the child, she replied, "I really like the little brother. I couldn't bear to leave him, so I took him." When asked again if she had stolen 2.75 million legal tender in collusion with Wang Zhengfa, she replied, "I didn't steal any banknotes, and I didn't collude with anyone." The second defendant, Wang Zhengfa, also denied adultery and colluding to abduct the child.

Categorically Denies

### Chen Chunpu Seeks Death to Avoid Death Sentence - High Court Concludes Retrial Yesterday - Denies Participating in Signing "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty"

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Chunpu, who served as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Executive Yuan and the Puppet Governor of Guangdong Province, was previously sentenced to death by the High Court. After Chen petitioned for a retrial, the Supreme Court remanded the case for a new trial. The retrial concluded yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the morning of December 3rd. The two secret debates yesterday focused on four points: 1. Whether he participated in the signing of the so-called "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty" and the military secret alliance between the puppet government and the Japanese invaders. 2. Whether the defendant's secret departure from Chongqing to Hong Kong in June of the 27th year of the Republic (likely 1938) was intended to join the puppet organization. 3. Whether the defendant, during his tenure as the puppet governor of Guangdong Province, did indeed ban opium and drugs and engage in actions beneficial to the people. 4. Whether the defendant went to Tokyo, Japan, in August of the 33rd year of the Republic (likely 1944) to participate in the enemy's memorial day ceremony to pray for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Chen responded to the above four points yesterday, stating: 1. When Wang Jingwei signed the "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty" with Japan in Shanghai, the defendant was still in Hong Kong and did not participate in it. Those who participated were Zhou Fohai, Mei Siping, Gao Zongwu, etc. 2. In the 27th year of the Republic, I went from Chongqing to Hong Kong to escort one son and one daughter of Wang Jingwei. Because his daughter was already seventeen years old at the time, it was not reassuring to send others. I had a kinship relationship with Wang and was also older, so I took on this responsibility. Going to Hong Kong had no political purpose. 3. The facts of banning opium and drugs are all available in the archives of the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government. 4. In August of the 33rd year of the Republic, I went to Japan to visit my wife's illness, because my wife was suffering from a uterine inflammation and was recuperating in Japan. It was not to participate in the "Greater East Asia War Victory Memorial Day" prayer.

### During the Enemy and Puppet Period - Lingling Massacre Case - As Dawn Breaks, Bandit Leader Tang Chuwang is Caught

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hengyang, 21st] In February of the 33rd year of the Republic (likely 1944), the enemy launched the Xiang-Gui Campaign in an attempt to open up mainland communications. In June, the Defense of Hengyang began. After Wei Yang was captured on August 8th, they followed and advanced south. The cities and towns along the Xiang-Gui Railway fell one after another. Linglu, an important town in southern Hunan, also fell into enemy hands in early September. At this time, the people were both escaping the enemy's bayonets and suffering from bandit attacks and murders. The Lingling massacre case unfolded during this dark period.

Wealthy in Remote Villages, Bandits Covet

The victim of the massacre, Jiang Xucun, was an honest businessman in Linglu with sons Jiang Wei, Jiang Chun, Jiang Qing, Jiang Min, and son-in-law Zhou Shilin. They had jointly invested in opening the Cultural and Great China paper and stationery stores and the Xiangyong Stone Printing Bureau on the main street of Linglu County for many years. The business was thriving and had considerable savings. In the 32nd year of the Republic, Jiang Wei served as a material officer at the Houching Bank. He was cautious in his work and deeply trusted by the bank, which made him even more famous. At the beginning of the Japanese offensive, Jiang Lu預 located a prefabricated shed factory in Taojia, Beichong in Daxiao Township, Ling County, for the purpose of dispersing goods and bank materials. When Changsha and Hengyang fell one after another, all the goods from the Cultural, Great China, and Xiangyong stores, as well as the materials from the Houching Bank, the family members of the staff, and their luggage, were dispersed to the shed factory and the nearby goose egg residence, and buried in kilns. When Lingling fell to the enemy on September 6th, the Jiang and Zhou families all fled to the Beichong shed factory. This place was relatively remote, and no enemy traces were found, so they thought it was extremely safe. Little did they know that wealth in remote villages would be subjected to the poison of gangsters.

Bandit Tang Poisons and Burns the Shed Factory

The Jiang family's massive wealth inevitably aroused the covetousness of others. There was Hu Shaohou, the head of Daxiao Township, Tang Chuwang, the military instructor of the county government, Wang Yao, the leader of the 8th Bao patrol team, Jiang Shi, the township brigade attachment, Tang Xianshen, the township cadre, Zhang Xiaonan, etc., relying on their special powers. Having both political power as cover and armed forces as backing, they jointly decided to dispatch Tang Chuwang and Wang Yao with dozens of people and guns, as well as a machine gun, in two groups to surround the shed factory in Beichong at dawn on September 20th. They captured Jiang Xucun and his three sons Jiang Qing, bound them with ropes, and looted all the luggage, gold jewelry, legal tender, etc. in the shed. Those that could not be stolen were set on fire together with the shed factory.

Meeting on a Narrow Road, Fighting to the Death

At that time, Jiang Wei, Jiang Chun, Jiang Min, and Zhou Shilin were all away on business. When they returned in the afternoon, they arrived at the Banling Temple area, and they met Tang Chuwang and others who were looting and going down the mountain. In a fit of anger, Jiang Wei and others fought with the Tang bandits. Due to the disparity in numbers, Jiang Wei and Zhou Shilin were shot dead on the spot, and Jiang Chun and Jiang Min were injured and captured. The next day, Tang sent someone to shoot Jiang Chun to death. Afterwards, they successively robbed all the goods buried in goose egg. Jiang Xucun and his son Jiang Qing were captured and taken to the Huangjiangyuan Temple gate area, where they were imprisoned in a dark room, with feet in shackles and hands in handcuffs, and threatened with shooting every day. As a result, they extorted 80,000 silver dollars and also extorted 40,000 national currency for the funeral expenses of the bandit soldier Liu Jianming who was killed in the conflict, as well as tens of thousands of yuan for straw sandals, in addition to extorting pork, wine, chicken, duck, etc., as gifts for release, before they were released from the tiger's mouth. In total, Tang and others looted more than 10 billion yuan based on the currency value at the time, truly an unprecedented massacre.

Sinking Like a Stone, Unjust Grievance Unredressed

The organization of the Tang bandits was initially the Daxiao Township Office, then changed to the Self-Defense Force, then changed to the Joint Township Brigade, and finally claimed to be the Lingling Command, with Tang calling himself the commander, Wang Yao as the deputy, Hu Shaohou as the director of the Joint Township Office, Tang Xianshen as the military supply director, Zhang Xiaonan as the military judge, and Jiang Shi as the brigade commander. After Jiang Xucun was released, he rented a house in the deep mountains, because at that time the occupied area had not been recovered, and the entire township was the world of the Tang bandits. Not only was it impossible to appeal, but his life was also in danger at any time. Therefore, this lawless massacre case has been like a stone sinking into the sea, and there is no way to redress the injustice.

Requesting Justice After Recovery

In August of the 34th year of the Republic (Likely 1945), the country was recovered, and the political situation gradually returned to normal. The Tang bandit organization disintegrated, and Jiang Xucun began to return to the city and file petitions with the Seventh District Commissioner's Office, the Lingling County Government, and the Lingling District Court, requesting redress. However, the Tang bandits were all "underground workers" at the time and had fled far away. Tang Chuwang entered the Capital Central Training Corps Officers Team, Wang Yao entered the Southern Prison Officers Fourth Platoon, using military status as protection, and Zhang Xiaonan even openly entered the Lingling County Government to work as a financial section clerk. After Jiang Xucun repeatedly sued, only Hu Shaohou was arrested and brought to justice, sentenced to thirteen years of fixed-term imprisonment.

Quietly Returning, the Evil Demon is Captured

Jiang Xucun was unwilling to see the Tang bandits still at large, and after repeatedly suing, the Tang bandits were finally dismissed and investigated in Beijing. In fact, this was nothing more than a dismissal, so Tang was still a free man. Since Tang had no official position, he quietly returned last month. After the victim learned of Tang's whereabouts, he filed a report with the District Court, which arrested Tang on the 8th of this month. This murderous demon king, the bandit leader who had done all kinds of evil, after being fortunate enough to escape the law for three years, was finally caught. It is heard that the other major criminal, Wang Yao, retired from the officer team and is now working at the Hankou Municipal Hospital, while Tang Xianshen and Jiang 倓 are unknown and are being searched for.

### Unprecedented Tragedy at Chongqing University

Physical Education Students Show Off Strength, Beating up Engineering Student Tang Peide, Whose Life is in Danger

[Report from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] An unprecedented tragedy has occurred at Chongqing University. Physical education students beat up four engineering students including Xiang Quanze, especially Tang Peide, whose injuries are the most serious, with continuous bleeding in his urine, and his life may be in danger. The reason is that the physical education department of Chongqing University, in order to celebrate the inauguration of the new council of the student union, scheduled a performance on the afternoon of the 24th. Xiang Quanze was careless in his conversation, jokingly calling the physical education department a circus troupe, and said he was going to Songlinpo to watch the circus. It happened to be heard by a physical education student passing by the roadside, and a conflict arose due to disagreements, causing a great disturbance. It is confirmed that Chongqing University students are currently partially striking. If the school authorities do not handle it properly, the situation will likely escalate.

Moreover, recently, train carriages have been arsoned from time to time, which is worthy of attention. In addition to ordering its subordinates to strengthen prevention and dispatch patrol cars to step up inspections to prevent the activities of traitors, it has recently ordered all stations that when trains stop at stations along the line or add water and coal, there are often many children picking up coal slag on the left and right sides of the train, for fear that they will be mixed with communists and secretly sabotage, specially ordered all stations to strictly prohibit children from picking up coal.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 19th] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Protection Command has issued an order to its subordinates that winter prevention will begin on November 16th.

Fireworks are prohibited in the villages within five kilometers on both sides of the railway. Each protection team should also maintain close contact with the townships, towns, Baojia, and local teams along the line to monitor the activities of bandits to ensure safety.

It has specially initiated the organization of a winter relief committee to raise funds for relief. The fundraising methods are divided into three types: donations, charity sales, and entertainment galas. The target is set at 500 million yuan. The fundraising work was actively launched on the 19th, with the first targets being the candidates running for the National Congress representatives.

### Wuxi Qingqi Township: "Dull Head" Murdered on His Way Home

"This newspaper Wuxi 25th dispatch" Zhu Renkang, a resident of Zhutongbian in Qingqi Township, the third district of the county, is over fifty years old. He co-owns the Xielong Department Store with others at the Xiaosifang Lane entrance in Beitang and operates the Rongkang Paper Shop independently in Dongxinqiao, Shanghai. Zhu has one wife and one concubine. The first wife, Yan, has a son named Ruiliang, who is now twenty-six years old. He has been foolish since childhood, and the neighbors all call him "Dull Head". Five years ago, he married Jin Yun, the daughter of Wu Hesheng, a peddler from Xiaoxiankou. They already have a three-year-old daughter named Xingfu (Happiness). Although Wu comes from a humble background, she is beautiful. Feeling that her husband is not handsome and does not understand romance, she feels like a phoenix following a crow. Therefore, she often lives at her brother-in-law Zhao Xijin's house in Beizhakou, occasionally returning to her home. "Dull Head" often makes a fool of himself, often causing laughter, which is a popular topic in the village. Ruiliang, as a young boss, wanted to work in the Xielong store. On the 22nd of this month, Ruiliang went to Suzhou alone. On the 23rd, he returned to Wuxi. After resting in the store for a while, he took a small suitcase and a silk quilt, saying he was returning home. However, on the morning of the 24th, Ruiliang was found dead in the mulberry field behind Chonggu Lane (about four li from his home). Beside him was a pig-killing knife with two knife wounds on his neck, the wounds being very deep. Zheng Shigui, the patrol officer of the Qingqi Police Substation, received the news. Considering it a major homicide case, he immediately led the police to investigate. They thoroughly searched the area around the body and the mulberry field but found no traces of blood. The wool-lined robe, flannel trousers, and rubber shoes worn by the corpse were also free of blood stains, raising many suspicions. It was suspected that the deceased was killed elsewhere and the body moved to this location. At 8 a.m. on the 25th, Zhu Yan, the mother of the deceased, together with Wu Axing, the Gangzheng (neighborhood head) of the 251st Tu (neighborhood), came to the city to report to the District Procuratorate of the court, requesting an autopsy. Prosecutor Shen opened a court to question them and then went to the countryside with officials to conduct the autopsy. The autopsy revealed that Zhu Ruiliang had a stab wound on the back of his neck and another on the right side of his neck, confirming that he was stabbed to death while alive. After the autopsy, the family was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial, pending investigation and arrest of the murderer. The reporter went to the countryside to conduct an on-site investigation. According to the neighbors, the couple was often at odds. "Dull Head" was often rejected when he tried to share a room with his wife. However, his wife, Jin Yun, is currently several months pregnant. The deceased's mother, Yan, considering her son to be "Dull Head", did not want to delve too deeply, saying that he might have encountered robbers on the way. Therefore, the cause of death is strange and worthy of investigation.

### Destroying the Tianhu Embankment: Central Government and Two Provinces Send Personnel for On-Site Inspection

"Central News Agency Changsha 26th dispatch" The issue of the destruction of the Tianhu Embankment has been delayed for many years due to various reasons. The central government is deeply concerned about this.

"This newspaper Hainan Island 21st dispatch" After Liang Yongnian, the former pseudo-Qiongshan County Magistrate, was arrested and imprisoned, his life in prison was quite comfortable due to his wealthy family.

### Self-Funded Overseas Students Can First Settle Foreign Exchange at Market Prices

Applications for Foreign Exchange Settlement Have Reached More Than 2,400

[Central News Agency dispatch] The Non-Imported Goods Foreign Exchange Application Review Committee of the National Bank announced on the 26th that the review of self-funded overseas student foreign exchange applications was originally carried out in accordance with the review methods approved by the Executive Yuan on June 23. Except for the students who passed the Ministry of Education's Second Self-Funded Overseas Study Examination who are waiting to go abroad, who were approved by the Executive Yuan to be reviewed and processed by the committee, the remaining students who are already abroad must be sent to the Executive Yuan for review. Later, because the Executive Yuan announced the "Revised Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange" on August 17, all applications sent for review were returned and changed to no longer require review. However, except for self-funded students who passed the examination and have examination certificates and study certificates, who were approved by the Executive Yuan on September 11 to settle foreign exchange at the official rate, the exchange rate for the remaining self-funded students has not been determined. In order to avoid delaying time and causing applicants to suffer from the increasingly high foreign exchange losses, the designated banks are notified that those who are willing to purchase foreign exchange at market prices first are allowed to do so. After the Executive Yuan announces the exchange rate, if they are entitled to the official rate, they will be adjusted. These measures have been reported to the Executive Yuan by the Central Bank for the record and will be followed after receiving the "Rules for Foreign Exchange Settlement for Public and Self-Funded Overseas Students" issued by the Executive Yuan. According to the committee's statistics, since its establishment on June 23 of this year, until the date of the announcement of the rules by the Executive Yuan on October 24, a total of 2,148 self-funded overseas student foreign exchange applications have been received, and 1,876 have been processed. As of the 24th of this month, a total of 2,403 applications have been received, and 2,238 have been processed. The remaining 165 applications have been received recently and are being processed. The committee immediately sends all processed applications back to the original designated banks and instructs them to notify the applicants. If any applicants have not yet received them, they should contact the designated banks as soon as possible.

### Dr. Liu Zhan'en's Tenth Memorial Anniversary: Shanghai University Prepares for Commemoration

[This newspaper dispatch] Dr. Liu Zhan'en, former President of Shanghai University, devoted his life to education and also participated in national salvation work. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident and the fall of Shanghai, Dr. Liu still ran around and called out in a harsh environment. He was finally assassinated and killed on April 8, 1938. At that time, the bad news spread and shocked the country! It is now known that Shanghai University intends to hold the tenth anniversary of the death of former President Liu for commemorative purposes. A preparatory committee has been formed and recommends that the school administration committee hold the following events.

### Talking About "Strikes" from the Perspective of a Professor (Continued) (Conclusion)

— Binbin

Let me talk more about the "strike" scene I have experienced: Every strike is decided by the student union, and then "orders are carried out without exception." Meetings are sometimes held late at night, sometimes in the morning, and sometimes in the afternoon. If the decision is made late at night, when the professors arrive at the school the next morning, the classrooms are empty and silent, and they return in vain. If the meeting is held in the morning, the meeting place is full, the classrooms are empty, and the professors wait in the lounge. Some smart professors, knowing that the decision will inevitably be a strike, are sure that there will be no classes in the afternoon, and they take the opportunity to leave first. Some "foolish teachers" are still waiting for "orders." If the meeting is held in the afternoon, without waiting for a decision, the day's work will of course not be able to be carried out, and the classrooms will already be empty.

The school can't control it, and the students don't notify, the professors are at a loss!

The dates of the strike are decided, or one day, three days, seven days, ten days, as much as is indefinite. When it is time to resume classes, no one notifies the professors. The professors at home can only call the school at any time to inquire. Those who do not have a telephone at home have to go to the school a few times in vain. Because the school administrators believe that this is beyond their duties, they don't care at all, and the students' strike and resumption of classes only take care of their own side, and there is no formal procedure to notify the professors.

Every time after a strike is decided, sometimes a "short note" or a "memo" is sent to the teachers' room. Although they call them "teachers" or "sir", the content is like an order (sometimes there is no such short message, only a few words are passed on to the workers), and when classes are resumed, only slogans are posted, without any other procedures. The professors are all at their homes (because of the strike, they don't go to school). The student union doesn't send anyone to inform the professors' private residences, and the professors can't bother to run to the school to inquire. Only when the news is published in the newspaper do they know that classes have resumed. It is a strange thing that the affairs of teachers and students in a big school have to rely on the education news section in the newspaper to exchange information!

The staff of the school's academic affairs office and dean of students office are unable to interfere with the strike, so naturally they don't care about it, and even less can they take on the obligation of notifying the professors. The servants follow the orders of the school and cannot follow the orders of the students. So even though the students are on strike and the classrooms are empty, the workers who ring the bell still ring the bell (up) and shake the bell (down) according to the time of the class schedule, "I go my own way". So even though the school is silent, the neighbors outside the wall hear the sound of the bell and think that the school is attending classes on time. It is like a wild temple in a desolate suburb, with the cold and clear Sanskrit chanting, reporting the time, which is also a strange scene.

I once had a private conversation with a student, saying that we teachers usually rely on the curriculum and notices from the academic affairs office to attend classes or take vacations, but now there is an extra "student union". However, when the academic affairs office suspends classes or takes vacations, it must first send messengers to the professors' homes two days in advance to send letters, so as not to run in vain. This is a definite principle, and even if the "student union" is the superior, it should have a pre- and post-method. Even if the professor should obey the students, how can he obey? How can he submit? The student smiled and said: Just let it go, let's look at everything like this!

### 中央銀行行撥款三百億　搶購蘇北墾區棉花　由中國農民銀行負責收購　蘇北棉產約在百萬担以上

The Central Bank has allocated 30 billion yuan to purchase cotton from the reclamation areas of northern Jiangsu, with the Bank of Chinese Farmers responsible for the purchase. Zhao Baoquan, assistant manager of the Agricultural Bank, Chun of the letter department, Wang Tong, director of the land finance department, Ouyang Ping, deputy director of the agricultural products department, and Zhou Jiyao, director of the business department, traveled to Nantong and Sanyu Township on the 23rd of this month for on-site inspections. They returned to Shanghai on the 25th and will go to Beijing. It is reported that the Agricultural Bank has been ordered to start purchasing from the Sanyu Township reclamation area. Due to the disturbance of the Communist bandits in the northern Jiangsu reclamation area, many young men have been conscripted, and no one is harvesting cotton. The cotton is still tightly attached to the cotton branches. The Agricultural Bank has now commissioned Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory and various Suken companies in northern Jiangsu to handle the purchase matters and has formed a flower-picking team to harvest the cotton from the cotton branches and keep it in custody for the farmers. The cotton that has been collected will be counted and taken over by the Agricultural Bank. The cotton production in northern Jiangsu this year is estimated to be over one million dan. The quality is excellent, and there is no adulteration. The local market price is about 4 million yuan per dan. Although the funds allocated by the government this time are limited, they can be used in a circular manner. It is initially estimated that 10,000 dan can be produced.

In addition, the Agricultural Bank also intends to reform land finance in the northern Jiangsu reclamation area. After this inspection, a concrete plan will be formulated, which is said to be aimed at supporting self-employed farmers.

### 華股高峯迭見：臨收賣多疲軟

Hua stocks fluctuated greatly yesterday. The situation was dangerous. Large investors did whatever they wanted. Off-market deals were common, and actions were erratic. The black market outside the circle was soaring. The hot stocks in the middle of the session all saw new highs, but some were cut short and became weak and trance-like near the close.

The market still struggled to rally in the morning. Spot and forward cotton yarn presented an inverted situation. Spot opened at 404 yuan, and forward opened at 400 yuan. After the opening, forward prices dropped from 404 yuan as No. 76 and others sold off, falling to a low of 394 yuan for spot and 395 yuan for forward. No. 148 and others took back to recover to above 400 yuan. At this time, there was not much trading. Off-market interest rates opened higher to 2 jiao 4 and 2 jiao 8 and a half, but it was difficult to see any signs of improvement. Later, as Hong Kong and China Electric repeatedly reported shrinking, the off-market black market jumped again, and foreign stocks soared, the off-market asking price was always 5-6 yuan higher than the on-market price. People's confidence improved. Guangdong Gang No. 202 and the short-selling group No. 148 continued to buy. No. 154 and others competed to take spot and forward. Near noon, the price rose to a new high of 440 yuan for spot and 442 yuan for forward, and then closed at 438 yuan and 441 yuan. Among the familiar stocks, small stocks such as Xinguang Jingfu and Meiya were the most profitable. As a result, according to the pre-closing figures, Yongsha, Xinhuo, Huazong, Qinxing, Zhongfa, Neiyi, Zhongni, and Guohuo rose by half a percent. Huaxin, Wenbei, Yonggong, Xinhua, and Rongxiang rose slightly. Zhongxing, Zhongfang, and Jinglun remained flat. Xinya, Datong, and Tongyi declined slightly. Among the forward stocks, Meiya and Jingfu rose by one percent, Xinguang Qinxing Xinhuo, and Yongsha rose by half a percent, and Huafeng rose slightly.

Only spot trading was done in the after-market. The night report mentioned a US cotton loan of 60 million, which opened lower to 423 yuan. No. 97 and others bought, but it still rose to 434 yuan. No. 160 and others continued to sell, and it fell to 420 yuan. The Bank of China exchange difference occurred, and a rising wind rose again off-market. No. 202 and others entered, and the off-market price rose to above 450 yuan, and the on-market price also reached a new high of 448 yuan. Various hot stocks such as Xinguang Jingfu, Meiya, and Xinhuo also rose sharply as No. 204, No. 202 and No. 224, and No. 224 competed to buy. However, powerful large investors, such as Long, sold heavily after raising the price, dumping more than 400 million shares, and off-market deals were also stifled, causing a returning wind. No. 54 and others sold heavily, and it recovered slightly to around 425 yuan. No. 77 and others took advantage of the low to maintain the price, but No. 152 was actively selling, and the closing price was still at 426 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Meiya, Beihe, Huafeng, and Zhongfa spot stocks fell by half a percent, Yongsha, Huaxin, Zhabei, Rongfeng, Tongyi, Huochai, Xinguang, Yonggong, Jingfu, Qinxing, Xinhua, and Neiyi declined slightly, Jinglun rose slightly, Zhongni rose slightly by half a percent, and Datong Guohuo rose by a little over one percent. The various old stocks off-market, such as bank stocks and cultural stocks, remained stable.

Securities brokers, money changers, and Guangdong brokers were all buying, while foreign firms were selling slightly. Yisha rose from 335,000 yuan to 377,000 yuan, and Wheelock reached 1.02 million and then rebounded. Compared to the previous close, Ken Zhiye and Guangping were weak.

### 金融特種營業稅　洽商特種營業稅

### 委旗購麥磨粉　糧部繼續辦理

The Ministry of Food commissioned the Fuxin, F茂, Xinhua, Huafeng, and Yutong flour mills to purchase wheat and grind flour on its behalf. Since the start in mid-July, the first phase of the contract ended at the end of the month. A total of 120 billion yuan was put into operation, purchasing 2.4 million dan of wheat, and 1.5 million bags of flour have been milled to date. However, there is still a large inventory of purchased wheat, and only one-tenth of it has been used in the past. About 1 million dan remain. Therefore, the mills are still milling this flour on behalf, and it can last for about three months. It is now learned that in order to maintain the food supply for the people in various places, the Ministry of Food has decided to continue the second phase of purchasing wheat and grinding flour on behalf. It will still be undertaken by the five major flour mills. The second phase of wheat funds and various procedures are being discussed with the mills.

### 自備外匯進口羊毛　輸管制定處理辦法

[Import and Export Control Commission Formulates Handling Measures for Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Import of Wool]

[This Newspaper] The Import and Export Control Commission has decided on handling measures for wool arriving at ports and already shipped with self-provided foreign exchange without a permit. The contents are excerpted as follows:

The purchase and distribution of wool raw materials arriving at ports and already shipped with self-provided foreign exchange without a permit, which have been registered with the Secretariat of the Commission in accordance with Announcements No. 2, No. 4, and No. 9 of the Commission, shall be handled in accordance with these measures.

The above-mentioned wool raw materials arriving at ports and already shipped shall be purchased by the Central Trust Bureau in accordance with the measures stipulated in Announcement No. 7 of the Commission.

The Commission shall increase an additional quota outside the import quota for wool raw materials in the fourth and fifth quarters. The additional quota shall be US$1.5 million per quarter, which shall be used to offset the above-mentioned wool raw materials and shall not provide foreign exchange.

The above-mentioned additional quota for the fourth and fifth quarters shall be distributed to the wool-using factories in accordance with the normal quota distribution method.

Each factory with the above-mentioned orders for wool raw materials arriving at ports and already shipped may apply for purchase with the quota obtained under the additional quota item. If such orders exceed its entitled additional quota, it shall be allowed to apply for purchase with its normal quota. The normal quota shall be reduced by 50% of the value of the purchased raw materials and no foreign exchange shall be provided. (That is, each application for purchase of self-provided foreign exchange orders of 1 yuan shall offset 5 jiao of the normal quota).

The goods imported by the importer independently (and not sold to the wool-using factory) may be sold by the Central Trust Bureau to factories that have no orders sold at the port or whose orders are insufficient for their additional quota, in accordance with the ratio after purchase.

If a factory's orders arriving at ports and already shipped exceed the additional quota and it is unwilling to apply for purchase with its normal quota, or if there is still a surplus after offsetting its normal quota, it may transfer the excess to factories that have no orders or whose orders are insufficient for their additional quota. The purchase and sale methods shall be the same as in Article 6.

The surplus quota (quota for the supply of foreign exchange) generated by the deduction of the normal quota due to the fact that a factory's orders exceed the additional quota may be used to subsidize factories that have no orders or whose orders are insufficient and still unable to purchase the additional quota in full in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of these measures. Each yuan of subsidy for the remaining quota shall offset 2 yuan of the foreign exchange quota. However, the total normal quota for the supply of foreign exchange shall still be limited to US$2 million per quarter. The factory orders or the goods independently imported by the importer mentioned above shall be based on the description in the application form when registering with the Secretariat of the Commission.

The price of the wool raw materials arriving at ports sold by the Central Trust Bureau shall be the price at the port of discharge plus 50% (converted into legal tender at the market exchange rate). The customs duties and the leasing, unloading, and transportation costs before and after the sale shall be handled in accordance with Article 14 of Announcement No. 7 of the Commission.

The method for the purchasing factory to pay for the goods shall be handled in accordance with Article 13 of Announcement No. 7 of the Commission.

Importers who are unwilling to fulfill the above conditions may apply for re-export in accordance with Article 6 of Announcement No. 3 of the Commission and Article 16 of Announcement No. 7.

### 預防兒童迷路走失　衣襟宜佩領號布條

[Preventing Children from Getting Lost: It is Advisable to Wear a Numbered Cloth Strip on the Collar]

This is a letter from the 39th Bao Office of the Penglai District: The purpose of this Bao Office is to address that many children are lost and are crying and wailing. Mr. Chen Wenqing, the representative of this Bao area, launched the "Children's Numbering Movement", which was previously submitted to the District Public Office of the four Bao districts and then to the Municipal Government for approval. The so-called "Children's Numbering Movement" is to use a specially made numbered cloth, stating the child's residence, the district, Bao, Jia, and household to which it belongs. It is best to fill it in according to the household registration card. This should be sewn on the center of the collar or the center of the upper part of the placket. If the child gets lost, he/she can return home safely because he/she has a child's number. The procedure is simple, and the effect is great. In order to seek assistance from the public opinion community, we would like to ask your newspaper to publish this letter to seek happiness for the millions of children in this city. It would be a great blessing for the society and the country! (Note: This method is simple and effective. It is published to attract the attention of children's parents. As for the so-called specially made numbered cloth, please contact the 39th Bao Office of the Penglai District at 28 Tangjiawan Road for sales locations.)

### A Brief Discussion on the Theory of Competition

— Yong Cheng

Written by Bing Zhi, Published by Kaiming Bookstore

This small book, with only about 50,000 words and less than 100 pages, can be thoroughly read in half a day of leisure. You will find that it is not only a very interesting popular science book, but also a very good civic textbook or a memorandum for national leaders. Since Yan Fu translated "Evolution and Ethics," dozens of publications introducing the theory of natural selection have been published in China. However, most of them elaborate on facts and introduce theories. In my opinion, this book, "A Brief Discussion on the Theory of Competition," is the first to promote the great principles of natural selection for national strength and racial improvement.

The preface of this book, which clearly states its purpose, says, "This compilation is a warning to the Chinese people." It can be seen that the writing of this small book is not only to introduce science, but also to convey a profound meaning of warning to the Chinese people. If we understand the time when the author wrote it and the environment he was in at that time, we can know what kind of personality and courage the author had.

The author, Dr. Bing Nongshan, is a well-known biological science giant in China. Most of the scholars in the country who study biology come from his school. When the August 13th Shanghai Incident broke out, the national army moved west shortly afterward, and Shanghai became a besieged isolated island. During the period of its occupation, Mr. Bing lived in seclusion in a corner of the city, living a very difficult life. He was not only threatened and enticed by the enemy and puppet regime, but he also stood firm in his position and, under the pseudonym Fu Ji, published his new theory of natural selection in "Xue Lin" and other righteous publications from time to time, earnestly guiding the Chinese people on the path they should take during this extraordinary time. Later, he supplemented and reorganized these articles to form this small book, which was published in the winter of the 29th year. The following year, due to the outbreak of the Pacific War, Shanghai was completely controlled by the enemy, and we could no longer buy this book in Shanghai. After the victory, it was finally reprinted recently.

Now I will briefly introduce the true content of this book below.

Section 1 discusses how competition is unavoidable in the animal kingdom, from simple to complex, from lower animals to higher animals and humans, and how various tragedies are played out in the biological world.

Sections 2, 3, and 4 discuss the resistance of various animals to various adverse environments such as climate, famine, and disease. The ancestors of mankind were even better at using their brains to conquer nature, not to be conquered by climate, not to be oppressed by famine, and not to be destroyed by disease.

Sections 5, 6, and 7 discuss the competition for food, space, mates, etc. in the animal kingdom, and how various tragedies of mutual slaughter are played out. As a result, the superior wins and the inferior loses. However, the author is not a "fatalist" and does not think that the weak have no chance to survive in the world. You see what he says in Sections 2 and 3: "...Nature has no will of its own, and all depends on the evolution of living things. Following the law of natural selection, it eliminates the weak and preserves the strong, cultivating and overthrowing, endlessly, until now. However, can these strong ones exploit other animals to enrich themselves, and harm the same and different species to colonize themselves, and ultimately win and reproduce forever? Will the animals that are bullied be unable to survive and eventually become extinct? The answer should be: it depends on the ability of the victims to cope."

Sections 8, 9, and 10 discuss the strong invading the weak with military force, economy, and culture, especially the ferocity and masks shown by Japan's invasion of China at that time, which are completely exposed. Although it is not explicitly stated in the text that it is Japan, the reader can understand it.

Sections 11, 12, and 13 discuss that the changes in animal species and the advantages and disadvantages of living things are all determined by the genetic potential for development. However, the superior and the strong cannot survive if they do not strive. The so-called "natural selection" or "survival of the fittest" means: "Among animal groups, if most of the members have the instinct of sympathy, their group will surely prosper and their descendants will surely multiply. In a country, if most of the people are loyal, brave, benevolent, loving, selfless, united, and cooperative, they will surely far surpass other races."

Section 14 discusses that the evolution of animals depends on the development of the nervous system to determine the rank of species. The brain is the master of the whole body. The more developed the brain, the more evolved the life phenomena of animals become. When it comes to humans, the brain is particularly developed, and there are very systematic languages and characters, so they are the first among all things, able to overcome all environments and dominate the whole world. They rely entirely on mutual assistance among people to seek survival.

Sections 15, 16, 17, and 18 discuss that the brains of all ethnic groups in the world today are roughly the same. As for the differences in superiority, inferiority, strength, and weakness, the author believes that this may be due to individual and nutritional factors. A weak body can gradually become strong if it is well cultivated; a weak brain can also be cultivated to improve it.

Section 19 discusses that even the weak among animals can exert their self-defense instincts and help each other. The weak of a nation need more patriots to work hard and sacrifice their small selves to fight for the group. They should also use their nation's original advantages to seek survival.

Section 20 discusses the art of self-salvation for small and weak nations, which is "self-education." If the people of a country all have knowledge, skills, noble and pure morality, and the ability to undertake difficult tasks, they can of course strengthen the country and the race.

Looking at the whole book, the argument is based on "national supremacy" and "racial supremacy." Although Japan has now surrendered, the competition in the biological world never ceases; our lives have never been free from the pain of struggle for a moment. We must strive to be promising and do our best to fight in order to survive. Therefore, this small book is really worth reading.

### The Joy of Art for Children

— Wen Zhaotong

Co-authored by J. Todd and CN.N. Gale

Translated by Dong Renjian, Published by World Book Company

In the publishing industry of our country, there are few publications of art theories and translations, and even fewer publications of art education theories and methods. This book, "The Joy and Application of Art for Children," can be said to be a rare treasure in the publishing industry in the past four or five years. It provides many guidelines for researchers and practitioners of art education. This kind of guidance is really worth loving.

Professor William G. Whitford of the Department of Education at the University of Chicago in the United States said in the "Preface" of this book:

"There have been many theories published in writing about art teaching in elementary schools; however, some theories tend to be extreme, and the views they advocate seem difficult for general art teachers to integrate into their teaching.

"The content of this book does not go to extremes, and the narratives in each chapter adhere to modern viewpoints and are consistent with the latest educational trends. It is progressive—progressive without exceeding the modern progressive school itself.

"The authors of this book are all teachers in modern schools, who have research on education and experience with children. They follow the natural impulses of children to plan art courses. They use a critical attitude to observe the special needs of children and the conditions most suitable for individual differences. Finally, they have studied a method of starting art teaching: that is, the joy and application of art should be a logical factor in children's development.

"In addition, the art teaching materials suggested by the author can be easily linked and integrated with the various subjects of the school curriculum. It can not only help those teachers who hope to obtain creative and expressive abilities from children, but also contribute to those teachers who have already obtained children's free expression and want to include some other basic aspects of art.

"As for the breadth of the teaching material range mentioned in this book, the rigor of the discussion methods in each lesson, the richness of the illustrations, and the overall view of children, it is enough to stimulate any teacher to improve in classroom technology and supplement children's daily experience. The classroom problems in art teaching and the suggestions for solving those problems are not only beneficial to art teachers, but also to general children's teachers."

From the compilation of this book, it can be mechanically divided into two parts, namely: the first part, enjoyment; the second part, application. However, if we look closely at its content, the chapters in the first part are really biased towards the guidance of the principles of art teaching, especially chapters such as "Developing Individuality" and "The Teacher's Part." Although the second part is mostly about teaching materials and methods of applied art, the "Conclusion" chapter clearly instructs us with ten key points of children's art teaching: the power of modeling, the need for space, the richness of materials, the value of drawing books and exhibitions, the freedom of topic selection, the emphasis on enjoyment, school lessons must make children feel interested, so that they will want to continue working at home, the value of setting up an art department, the practical benefits of appreciation, and visiting the art room.

After the revision last year, the elementary school art curriculum in our country has paid attention to the completion of the goal of beautifying life and changing the moral behavior of the people to its highest ideal stage. The author once stated its outline in an article "The Current Situation of Art Curriculum" published in the recent "Jingwei Magazine" and specifically put forward the key points of the curriculum content, including "The joy and application of art are the two wings of art mathematics. Enjoyment is obtained from the teaching of appreciation and creation; teaching that starts from life should be applied." If you want to understand why the elementary school art curriculum in our country should be revised in this way? And what steps can be taken to obtain these requirements? I think that in the current publishing industry, this book can at least solve these problems. Moreover, the guidance of this book is not empty theory, but practical methods, and it is accompanied by one hundred and fifty illustrations to explain.

### Educational Thought

— Yang Tongfang

Written by Zhu Jingnong, Published by Commercial Press in the 35th year

Zhu Jingnong wrote the book "Educational Thought" based on his practical experience in educational administration for many years and with reference to the research of old and new theories. At first glance, it seems that this book is again a list of various educational theories and a narrative of various educational trends. In fact, the focus of this book is to discuss the unresolved problems in my country's recent educational thought, with realistic educational problems as the center of discussion. The author hopes to find the correct theoretical path from the complex and divergent educational thoughts in our country, so that the disputed problems can be resolved. The problems discussed here include: freedom and discipline, individual and country, struggle and interaction, school and society, knowledge and morality, art and occupation, science and religion. The author gives fair and peaceful answers to the controversial points of these various educational problems that are generally considered opposite.

First, in the chapter "Freedom and Discipline," from the freedom explained by Sun Yat-sen, it narrates the concept of freedom in the setting sun educational thought, and then elaborates on discipline in freedom and freedom in discipline. The author believes that freedom is something that is fought for, but discipline cannot be lacking if one wants to enjoy full freedom. Freedom and discipline are not opposite, but complementary.

Individualism, nationalism, and democracy each have different views on education. The discussion of individualism puts forward the thoughts of Yang Zhu in the Warring States Period, the Greek philosopher Aristippus, and Rousseau (.JJ.Rausseau). Nationalism is represented by German National Socialism. Democracy compromises between the individual and the group. Democratic education is the only broad road, using the power of education to promote the individual's concern for social welfare; at the same time, it also enables society to protect the individual's freedom and the development of talent.

Regarding the expectation of social evolution, some advocate struggle, while others advocate mutual assistance. From Darwin's theory of natural selection to Marx's theory of class struggle, they all seek social development through war, while Kropotkin advocates "mutual aid," believing that the progress of the living world and the development of human society depend entirely on mutual assistance and cooperation. In the future, China's education must naturally emphasize the premise of maintaining world peace, and should sweep away the roots of war from the hearts of children and young people. However, under the principle of striving for national survival, national defense education cannot be completely ignored. Kanai's chapter on "Struggle and Mutual Assistance" can at least eliminate some incorrect prejudices and strengthen the belief in "cooperation to develop common welfare."

"Knowledge and morality" were originally complementary, but what is manifested in the current youth life and behavior is that the two are disconnected. The chapter discussing this problem first narrates the factors that constitute knowledge, then discusses moral concepts, and concludes with the unity of knowledge and action and the dual cultivation of morality and intelligence. The author feels that the school curriculum must be connected with extracurricular life, so that knowledge can be applied to life and benefit character. The edification of character and the cultivation of good living attitudes should be tempered from participating in collective life. "Education cannot be separated from life, knowledge cannot be separated from behavior, and morality cannot be separated from practical experience." This is something that is worth our pondering.

Most people may know the importance of artistic cultivation, and may also know the need for vocational education, but few people understand the true meaning of the practical application of art and the artistic application of occupations. In the chapter "Art and Occupation," the author of this book tries to correct the erroneous view that the two are opposite. He said: "The scope of vocational education not only includes technical training, but also includes cultural cultivation and civic training, etc." He also said: "Artistic cultivation and vocational training are two indispensable elements of life. Life must be artistic and also practical. Art is not only beautiful and pleasant, but also practical."

Finally, what is discussed is "Science and Religion." The author believes that if China wants to establish material national defense in the future, it has to pay attention to science; but at the same time, in order to establish spiritual national defense, it cannot erase the role of religion in personal spiritual enlightenment and appeal. Improving the material environment and increasing production must promote science, and to create a nation full of enthusiasm for work and a sense of justice, we must also cultivate their integrity and inner spiritual life from religious beliefs. "To establish a heart for the world, to establish a life for the people, to continue the unique learning for the past sages, and to create peace for future generations," it seems that only religious figures can bear this heavy responsibility.

I think that although this book "Educational Thought" is not a large work, its argument is incisive, its main points are not verbose, and its words have a source, and its writing is clear and concise. Even if it is not a person who specializes in education, it can be read to understand the debate situation of modern thought.

### Biography of Pushkin

— Shi Bei

Written by Gilpolding, Translated by Lv Ying

Published by International Cultural Service Society

Pushkin, this poet who only lived to be thirty-seven years old, has been dead for more than a hundred years now, but he is still warmly remembered and admired by the literary circles of various countries in the world. This is a rare thing in history. This proves that although world affairs are full of changes, disputes and disturbances continue, human nature can still love genius and respect wisdom. This makes us who live in today's difficult times still feel infinitely comforted in our hearts!

Now we have confirmed that literary works are by no means written for a few playboys. They should serve the people and educate the people. Pushkin had already worked hard for this a hundred years ago. He laid the foundation for realism in Russian literature. He opened up a broad road for Russian literature with the spirit of new realism, overthrowing the false court literature that blindly served the monarch in the past.

The value of Pushkin's literary heritage was once said by the famous critic Belinsky: "Pushkin's creative realm has no absurd, utopian falsehood, and empty ideal... components; it is thoroughly filled with the spirit of reality. He does not put rouge on the face of life, but simply reproduces nature in its original beauty for people to see. In Pushkin's creation, heaven exists; however, it is often permeated with the earth's atmosphere." The Japanese writer Yoshikawa Masao also said: "In addition to bringing the spirit of new realism into the naive Russian literature and establishing its independent national significance and forming historical value, Pushkin is also a great genius artist and genius thinker with the qualities comparable to Goethe, radiating an eternally bright light." This is the understanding that we should have before we understand Pushkin.

In the translation circle in our country, there are not many translations of Pushkin's works, and because his works are mostly poems written in rhyme, translation is particularly difficult. Therefore, I think the general readers' understanding of Pushkin is still not deep enough. This "Biography of Pushkin" is just a good help for us.

This book is divided into twelve chapters: 1. Pushkin's era; 2. Pushkin's childhood; 3. High school; 4. Pushkin's life in St. Petersburg after graduation; 5. Pushkin's exile to the south; 6. Pushkin's exile in Mikhailovskoye Village; 7. Pushkin and Nicholas I; 8. Autumn of 1830 in Boldino; 9. After marriage; 10. Persecution and loneliness; 11. Duel and death; 12. People's sorrow. After reading the whole chapter, we can easily see that the author Gilpolding is writing the life of the poet with a silent and heavy heart. He is not writing to praise the poet's brilliant talent, but is truthfully and plainly narrating as if writing the history of an ordinary person, concisely and succinctly pointing out the poet's ideological growth and his attitude towards life and writing.

Pushkin was born in 1799, when Tsar Alexander I and Nicholas I were in power, and the autocratic monarchy was reaching its peak. Most of the nobles were reactionary, and they intentionally and stubbornly supported the serf system and the autocratic regime. At that time, literary writing was greatly influenced by false classicism and became the force that dominated everything, advocating imitating old literary models and opposing the true description of contemporary life. Pushkin was born at this time. Although his family was also a very prestigious noble family, from the poet's youth, he was not assimilated into this advanced environment. He has independence, self-esteem, and love of freedom; he despises the upstream society and the humble slavery. He hated the darkness of society at that time so deeply, as can be seen from what he said later, "Giving me soul and talent, but letting me be born in Russia, this is the devil's trick!" His life is like a painful tragedy of genius and ignorance and fighting against abuse.

Looking at the poet's short life, we seem to see a strong swallow, not afraid of the storm's attack, flying through the dense clouds and rain.

His death was the most tragic end to a tragic life. Because his reputation and love were defamed and constantly slandered, he decided to duel with Dantes. Dantes (or translated as Dangtai) was a French fugitive, a shameless adventurer. He recognized the Dutchman Heckeren as his adoptive father and worked as an officer in the Guards in Russia. On January 27, 1837, Pushkin dueled with him. Unfortunately, the poet was fatally wounded and died on the 29th.

His death shocked the entire Russian people. A girl at the time described it this way: "During the three days that his body remained at home, people of all ages and occupations continued to surround his coffin. Women, old people, children, students, common people in sheepskin coats, and some even in rags, all came to bow to the remains of their beloved national poet. Seeing this respect for the common people is moving..." This has explained how much the people loved and admired him, their poet.

We were born in a new era where all countries in the world are eagerly pursuing freedom and democracy. It has new significance to recall Pushkin's life and read his biography at this time. We firmly believe that the freedom and democracy of the world will surely be realized, just as we believe in Pushkin's immortality:

"I will never die—in the harp

My immortal soul will live forever—"
