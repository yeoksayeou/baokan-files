[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] Since the victory, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's Pukou-Jinan section, this major artery connecting the North and South, was successfully restored to traffic for the first time on the 11th. The first special train, which departed from Pukou at 4:00 PM on the 10th, slowly entered Jinan Station at 5:15 PM on the 11th amidst the melodious sounds of military music and the presence of over 300 representatives from all sectors of Jinan. The people of Jinan, filled with joy and excitement, welcomed this epoch-making event with the most fervent emotions. Minister Chen Qitian, Director Sa Fujun, and Chinese and foreign colleagues, who had traveled from afar from Beijing and Shanghai, were greeted with heartfelt welcomes.

Furthermore, the Jinan-Yanzhou section's 77/78 mixed train departed south for the first time at 6:00 AM on the 11th. The third-class ticket price was 112,000 yuan. It arrived on time at 6:50 PM. Today, the number of passengers boarding in Jinan was extremely crowded. Over 300 people were left behind due to the lack of seats.

[Another Dispatch] To commemorate the restoration of traffic on the Pukou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the railway bureau hosted over 300 representatives from all sectors of Jinan and the press at 8:30 AM on the 11th. They departed from Jinan Station on a special train. At 10:30 AM, the train arrived at the 384-kilometer, 300-meter mark between Zhangxia in Tai'an. Everyone disembarked and took photos at the connection point. The special train continued south and arrived at Wande at 12:40 PM. After a ten-minute rest, it returned to Jinan City, arriving safely at 5:00 PM. Reporters in the carriages observed that local militia were intensifying their training and regular troops were being strengthened, ensuring safety everywhere. Furthermore, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration has scheduled a commemorative ceremony for the reopening of traffic at 9:00 AM on the 12th. Representatives from Beijing and Shanghai, as well as Chinese and foreign reporters, will be its honored guests. At their request, the railway bureau has rescheduled their return south on the original train to the 14th, allowing them to fully appreciate the scenic spots and historical sites in the area. The bureau has also decided to add an ordinary express train between Jinan and Xuzhou starting on the 21st and an express train between Jinan and Pukou starting on New Year's Day. It also plans to establish through transport with the Beijing-Shanghai line, which should facilitate smoother North-South transportation from now on.

Note: The Tianjin-Pukou Railway runs vertically across the North and South, connecting four provinces, a major artery stretching 1,009 kilometers. It was disrupted and interrupted by the Communist bandits for as long as 25 months. This spring, the National Army in Shandong Province quickly advanced, and various areas in southern Shandong were successively recovered. Repair work began immediately, and after three periods of danger and difficulty, the Jinan-Pukou section was finally fully repaired and officially opened to traffic. The Jinan-Pukou section is 658 kilometers long, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the entire Tianjin-Pukou line, and the damage was extremely serious.

### Maintaining Normal Traffic Still Requires Continued Effort; Mr. Chen Shungeng Hopes for Military Assistance

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] Chen Shungeng, Director of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau, speaking specifically to our reporter during the Pukou-Jinan traffic restoration ceremony, stated: Although the Pukou-Jinan section has been opened to traffic, due to the rudimentary nature of the current road construction and the inadequate security forces along the route, maintaining normal traffic still requires our continued efforts. He sincerely hopes for the assistance of the military. The railway bureau has planned to rush repairs on the section from Shilipu southeast of Jinan to Zhangdian and the Zhangbo branch line, with a total length of 123 kilometers. The roadbed is currently being filled. The estimated cost of 100 million yuan has also been submitted by the Ministry of Communications to the Executive Yuan for approval. Mr. Chen also said: From Jinan

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] Sa Fujun, Director of the Ministry of Communications, inspected the conditions along the way on the special train for the Pukou-Jinan section's traffic restoration ceremony. He expressed satisfaction with the rush repair work. He spent the entire day sitting in the last passenger car of the train, paying close attention to the tracks, bridges, and the situation on both sides. Mr. Sa expressed great emotion regarding the enormous cost of the rush repair work, stating: The transportation authorities hope that the revenue from railway traffic can maintain expenditures, which is already not easy, let alone the rush repair costs. He stated: Vice Minister Ling Hongxun recently returned from an inspection in Europe. Railway freight rates in Western European countries are not as fast as commodity prices, but they are not far apart. In England, the commodity price index rose by 80%, and freight rates rose by 55%. In Belgium, commodity prices rose by 300%, and freight rates rose by 220%. In Italy, commodity prices rose by 2,000%, and freight rates rose by 900%. In Switzerland, commodity prices rose by 60%, and freight rates rose by 50%. In contrast, freight rates in our country have increased 10,000 times compared to before the war, while commodity prices have increased 100,000 times. The transportation authorities hope that the increase in freight rates will only reach two-thirds of the increase in commodity prices, which can maintain the expenditures of various routes.

### Bank Lending Will Continue to be Strictly Enforced

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Since receiving instructions to suspend loans from national banks and bureaus, large-scale loans have been stopped, and even loans below 200 million yuan and export packing loans have been completely suspended. This can be described as extremely strict. The Joint Administration and other agencies are now taking advantage of this suspension to strengthen the review of past lending policies. At the same time, they are closely monitoring the market's reaction after the suspension in order to serve as a reference for future lending. It is still difficult to say when lending will resume and what the principles will be. However, it is believed that when lending resumes in the future, enforcement will still be extremely strict, with emphasis on loans related to national policy and industries essential to people's livelihoods. The Joint Administration's board of directors and the subcommittee review meeting have been suspended since the suspension of lending. The board of directors is expected to reopen next week, at which time there will be important discussions. Furthermore, regarding this suspension of lending, those who have already decided to lend and have already lent a portion will continue to lend, while those who have decided to lend but have not yet lent will stop lending.

Military officials believe this is merely a "routine matter," as US military generals serving overseas are transferred after a certain period. The spokesman also stated that General Rooks' transfer will not affect the organization of the US Military Advisory Group or the duties of other responsible officials.

Representatives from the National Resources Commission, the Ministry of Education, and other relevant agencies, numbering more than a dozen, attended.

### Liu Mengchun and Others Fly to Dihua; Zhang Zhizhong's Reply to Ahmatjan's Letter Has Been Taken Along; Burhan Believes Xinjiang's Future is Optimistic

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Zhang Zhizhong's reply to the four demands of Ahmatjan of Yining has been handed over to Liu Mengchun, Secretary-General of the Northwest Headquarters, and others to take to Xinjiang.

Burhan refused to disclose the contents of the reply and did not make any further comments, but repeatedly emphasized that his view of Xinjiang has always been optimistic. As for the four conditions of the Yining side, it can almost be said that every condition is what the government hopes to achieve. As for the issue of replacing Masud Sabri, Burhan stated: The General Rules on Provincial and County Autonomy have been approved by a regular meeting of the Executive Yuan, and the National Assembly is about to be convened. Constitutional government is about to begin, and the national general election will also begin. Xinjiang will not be an exception. At the same time, due to factual needs, it can be brought forward, and it may be held as early as next spring. Therefore, the date for the election of a provincial governor is near, and the issue of removing Masud can be said to be no longer a problem. Burhan's remarks clearly revealed the government's attitude towards handling the Xinjiang issue, which also means that although the various demands for the removal of Masud may not be fulfilled, with the election imminent, the leadership of the new province will not be difficult to change immediately. Subsequently, when the reporter asked whether Burhan would return to Xinjiang to serve after the dissolution of the National Government Committee following the implementation of the constitution, Burhan did not give a direct answer, only smiling and saying: "Possibly." But he firmly stated that he would not participate in the election for the new provincial governor. Furthermore, Burhan's son passed away in Dihua on the 5th of this month.

Editorial

Discussion on the Draft General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy

Amidst the government's active preparations for constitutional governance, the Ministry of Interior, upon instruction from the Executive Yuan, drafted the "General Rules for Provincial (City) and County Autonomy." After review and amendment by the Executive Yuan, it was approved at the Executive Yuan's administrative meeting on the 9th of this month and submitted to the National Government for referral to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The draft consists of five chapters and thirty-four articles. This bill serves as the standard for implementing local self-government. After the implementation of the Constitution, the provincial (city) and county people's representative assemblies will formulate provincial (city) and county self-government laws, necessarily based on this parent body. This is a major event in the history of local self-government development in our country. As the draft is made public for national discussion, we would like to offer a comprehensive discussion based on our observations.

The "General Rules for Provincial (City) and County Autonomy" is a law authorized by the Constitution. Article 108, Paragraph 1 of the new Constitution refers to the "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy," which stipulates that the central government will legislate and delegate it to provinces and counties for implementation. Regarding the autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government, Article 118 of the Constitution stipulates that separate laws will be enacted. The autonomy of ordinary municipalities, as stipulated in Article 128 of the Constitution, shall be governed by the provisions applicable to counties. According to the "Concise Table of Administrative Regions of the Republic of China" compiled by the Fangyu Division of the Ministry of Interior, the current administrative regions of our country include thirty-five provinces, twelve municipalities directly under the central government, including two thousand and twenty-one counties, fifty-one provincial-level cities, thirty-eight administrative bureaus, one administrative management bureau, one hundred and thirty-two Mongolian banners, and one Tibetan local area. These provinces, cities, and counties are considered "local self-government units." After the country gradually implements constitutional governance, all regions must, in accordance with certain conditions and timelines, progressively advance and implement autonomy. Therefore, the formulation and promulgation of the "General Rules for Provincial (City) and County Autonomy" is absolutely necessary at present. The Ministry of Interior originally had two drafts, A and B, with different content. According to Hu Ciwei, the convener of the original drafting committee, Draft A was more "practical," while Draft B was "closer to ideal." The Executive Yuan is yet to decide which draft is more suitable, or whether a new draft should be created. Draft A is divided into seven chapters with a total of sixty-seven articles, while Draft B is divided into five chapters with a total of thirty-eight articles. Although the spirit of the two drafts is not entirely the same, they both adopt a listing method for the organization and authority of local systems, similar to the implementation laws of Chapters 10 and 11 of the Constitution. The current draft of the general rules revised by the Executive Yuan is a simplification of the Ministry of Interior's Draft A, but the content and essence are a new draft, not a revision of the original draft. We have no objections to the revision procedure of the general rules draft, but its content is of great importance, and we hope that the executive and legislative authorities can conduct further careful review.

The main points of the autonomy general rules are threefold: First, it should be the common standard for implementing local autonomy and the legislative principle for provinces (cities) and counties to formulate provincial (city) and county autonomy laws. Second, it should, in accordance with Chapters 10 and 11 of the Constitution, make provisions on the implementation procedures for the organization and authority of local governments, the scope and objects of local autonomy. The constitutional design of the local system has many matters that need to be deduced and analogized. The autonomy general rules need to have appropriate enumeration to avoid difficulties in subsequent legislation and judicial interpretation. In particular, if the general rules stipulate local autonomy matters completely, the difficulty of issuing supplementary regulations can be avoided. Third, its regulations should have great flexibility because our country has a vast territory, and the situation in each county is different. The law cannot force the impracticable to be practicable to avoid fettering its implementation in the future, hindering the development of autonomous expertise, and losing the original meaning of legislation. For this reason, the autonomy general rules should have an independent spirit, for the convenience of constitutional implementation, enumerate the standards that local autonomies commonly adhere to, and do not need to re-copy the content of the Constitution or change the spirit of certain clauses of the Constitution. This is what the executive and legislative authorities must be careful about.

The current autonomy general rules draft revised and approved by the Executive Yuan contains a total of thirty-four articles, and there are not many major features that can be commented on. Except for Article 2, which stipulates that "provinces and counties are legal persons," Article 29, which stipulates that local autonomy should be subject to administrative supervision, and Article 30, which stipulates that autonomous supervisory authorities have the right to dissolve unconstitutional public opinion organs, most of the other articles are the same as the provisions of the Constitution, or even completely identical. In particular, Article 21 stipulates that provincial business institutions do not have grades, nor do they determine departments; Article 27 stipulates that county business institutions do not establish sections or bureaus according to the county's grades and needs, which seems impractical. Regarding the organization and election of provincial people's congresses, the Constitution stipulates that "it shall be determined by law." This "law" can be interpreted as the "Autonomy General Rules" or another organization law election law. Chapter 4 of the draft autonomy general rules does not stipulate the organization and election of provincial people's congresses. In this case, provincial people's congresses will fall into a situation where it is impossible to convene, organize, and elect, let alone formulate provincial autonomy laws? The "Autonomy General Rules" is a central legislation authorized by the Constitution, which is used to stipulate the procedural law for provinces and counties to formulate provincial self-government laws, and should enumerate and regulate the organization, convening, and election matters of the provincial people's congress for comparison.

The above discussion is based on objective facts. We hope that the autonomy general rules will become a complete legal code to fulfill the country's constitutional legislation. Local autonomy is not a theory that is out of reach. It can be implemented as long as it is practical. Legislation is a system design, not an unpredictable and profound technology. It can be implemented as long as it is thorough and clear. Local autonomy is the minimum politics of a constitutional country. The law on traveling to local autonomy must at least achieve thorough and clear design. We ask the executive and legislative authorities for reference.

B, Principles: Private textile industries in the rear that supplied military needs during the war or suffered losses; Original factories forcibly occupied, damaged, or forced to sell to the enemy and puppets during the occupation period; Those who sold to the enemy and puppets automatically and voluntarily during or before the war shall not be granted priority purchase; Local governments operating textile industries shall not be granted priority purchase because it is inconsistent with the principle of selling to private enterprises.

### Chen Qitian Arrives in Jinan to Inspect Coal Mines and Discuss Transportation Matters

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian arrived in Jinan on the special train for the inaugural ceremony of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway through traffic on the 11th and is scheduled to return to Nanjing by the same train on the 13th. He also told reporters in the train compartment that the main purpose of this trip was to inspect the four coal mines in Huainan, Yidong, Zhongxing, and Zibo, and listen to reports from the persons in charge of each mine to promote the plan decided in the National Coal Mine Production Increase Conference held in Nanjing before. Regarding coal transportation matters, he also consulted with the Railway Bureau and the Transportation Command and decided to assign a special train exclusively for coal transportation. He said that as long as the Tianjin-Pukou section maintains normal transportation status, there will be no problem with coal for winter use around Nanjing in a month because, according to estimates, at least 150,000 tons of coal can be transported south in a month. He also said that reforming the currency system can solve the current economic difficulties, and reform can stabilize people's lives and financial revenues and expenditures. However, the new currency must be backed by 60% cash reserves to guarantee its credit. As for whether state-owned enterprises can be used as reserves, Chen said that there are many difficulties and it is not easy to believe in people. Chen also expressed his views on the implementation of the cotton yarn control measures, saying that after the implementation of the measures, manufacturers' dissatisfaction and the difficulties encountered by the government in implementation are inevitable facts, but it is an exaggeration to say that it is enough to put manufacturers to death. He cited the fact that the control measures implemented in the rear during the pre-victory period were far stricter than the current ones, but there are still many yarn factories that survive. When reporters from this newspaper asked him for his opinion on the issuance of large banknotes, he said that the time was too late because, compared with pre-war and post-war prices, the current 100,000-yuan banknote is only worth two yuan in pre-war legal tender. He said that the state of turbulence caused by the issuance of large banknotes in the market is an economic psychological illness.

However, when the Ministry of National Defense receives materials, it may, if necessary, consult with the Ministry of Communications to assist with transportation. The transportation, unloading, and storage operations in the second and third stages are the sole responsibility of the receiving agencies.

Supervisory Personnel: This Committee may dispatch supervisory personnel to Japanese ports to be responsible for sorting and guiding work. In important ports in China, the Ministry of Communications may send personnel to each port to handle transportation work. For other ports, the Ministry of Communications may entrust local personnel to serve concurrently. All personnel appointed by the Ministry of Communications to various ports may be additionally appointed by this Committee to concurrently handle the supervisory transportation work at each port.

Information to Be Provided to this Committee by Various Agencies: The important information includes: 1. The names, locations, and responsible persons of the receiving and transportation agencies stationed by each agency in Japan and various ports in China. 2.

Special attention should be paid to the sturdiness of the packaging and the completeness and clarity of the labels when shipping from Japanese ports.

### Marshall Firmly Demands Soviet Union Stop Acquiring German Materials; Urges Molotov to Provide a Clear Answer

[Central News Agency, London, 10th] According to the Daily Telegraph diplomatic correspondent, the US government urgently needs Marshall to return to Washington, and Marshall has suggested to his government that he return home on the 15th. The correspondent predicts that a shocking crisis will occur at the end of this week's Foreign Ministers' Conference.

[Reuters, London, 10th] The Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 10th discussed the issue of extracting reparations in kind and again reached a stalemate. Marshall then issued the strongest statement since the beginning of this Foreign Ministers' Conference, demanding that the Soviet Union immediately provide a concrete answer, pointing out that the current policy of delay and indecision must be stopped. If the four powers cannot reach an agreement on this major issue, it would be an unacceptable waste of time. However, he also solemnly declared that the United States will never agree to extract reparations in kind as the price for unifying the German economy. After Marshall finished stating his position, Molotov suggested adjourning the meeting. The dispute over the issue of extracting reparations in kind arose during the discussion of the main British proposal, which stated: "No German products or stored products should be extracted as reparations until Germany has achieved a balanced economy and has repaid the expenses advanced by the occupying powers." Marshall stated that until the Soviet delegation provides a clear answer on the issue of extracting reparations in kind, all items currently under discussion, such as import and export plans, the distribution of German export earnings, the occupation fee agreement, and the balance of the German economy, cannot be clarified. The US government believes that the reparations issue was finally resolved in Potsdam, and the United States will never agree to a plan to extract reparations in kind. Unexpectedly, the actual development was completely the opposite. The UK and the US import 700 million US dollars worth of food to West Germany to maintain the lives of Germans, while the Soviet Union removes 500 million US dollars worth of German assets from East Germany annually. German enterprises in the East have been successively seized by Soviet trusts, and in addition, a large number of German workers have been forced to go to the Soviet Union. This situation must be corrected immediately and should not be delayed indefinitely, otherwise the German economy will be completely destroyed, and the entire European economy will be in a difficult situation.

Marshall then proposed his resolution, which stated: "From January 1, 1948, no items may be transported out of Germany except for money and goods of appropriate economic value that can be immediately used to maintain the German economy. This resolution shall remain in effect until the Allied Control Council takes other actions or the peace treaty provides otherwise. However, this resolution does not apply to factory machinery etc. already agreed to be used as reparations." The British and French foreign ministers stated that Marshall's resolution required further consideration. Molotov stated that he would provide an answer when discussing the general reparations issue.

Today's meeting discussed the following proposals in the basic document: The repayment of advances by the Allied powers by Germany; Occupation fees; The handling of foreign expropriation of German corporate interests after the end of the European War; The subjection of foreign interests in Germany to German law; The issue of products available at any time; The dissolution of German monopolistic enterprises. With the exception of item 6, which has been agreed upon, no agreement has been reached on the rest.

### The General Confederation of Labour's Demands Were Not Met; The General Strike in Rome Begins; The Government Plans to Use Force if Necessary

[Associated Press, Rome, 11th] Rome experienced its first general strike in 25 years this morning, which is the winter offensive launched by leftists against the Gasperi government.

[United Press, Rome, 11th] A thousand striking workers gathered in downtown Rome. The police arrived and ordered the crowd to disperse. The workers refused to obey the order. The police then drove jeeps at high speed into the crowd, while swinging batons and hitting people on the head. At least two workers were seriously injured and twelve were arrested. The demonstrators dispersed in all directions five minutes later. This is the first riot since the general strike was organized by the Communist Party. The action of the police this time shows that the government plans to use force if necessary. The French government has successfully suppressed labor unrest by this means.

[Reuters, Rome, 10th] The Rome City General Confederation of Labour previously requested the government to issue Christmas bonuses and other benefits to unemployed workers, but the government failed to give a satisfactory answer. The General Confederation of Labour has ordered a general strike starting at midnight on the 10th. The strike will affect the Rome urban area and the rural areas under the jurisdiction of Rome City. The strike will continue indefinitely until the General Confederation of Labour issues a subsequent notice. All public transport, such as trams, buses, theaters, and restaurants, will cease operations from midnight. Newspapers will no longer be published after completing the printing of the Thursday morning edition. Telephone, water, gas, and electricity will only operate partially. The delivery of urban mail and telegrams will be suspended. All shops, except for food stores, which will remain open as usual, will be closed. Banks and stock exchanges will also not be exempt. The demands of the Rome General Confederation of Labour include: A thorough investigation of the shooting incident that caused trouble during the recent unemployed workers' parade; Allocating 10 million lire to build public works to accommodate the unemployed; Providing Christmas relief funds to all unemployed people in the city (estimated to be about 70,000). The government has stated that it is prepared to immediately implement a public works plan that can accommodate 8,000 to 10,000 unemployed workers, but it believes that it is not appropriate to give special treatment to the unemployed in Rome regarding the provision of relief funds, and has refused.

### Economic Merger of British and American Zones in Germany; Britain and the United States Have Reached an Agreement; Occupation Expenses to Be Borne Solely by the United States

[Associated Press, London, 10th] According to reliable sources tonight, the US and UK have reached an agreement, which in effect gives the United States sole authority over the economic and financial policies of the British and American economic zones in Germany. The amended documents of last year's merger agreement have been finalized and delivered to London from Washington.

[Reuters, London, 10th] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated that US Secretary of the Army Royall told the US Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday that as a result of the negotiations between the UK and the US in Washington on German occupation fees, the United States will henceforth have control over economic and financial affairs in the two zones. This only refers to the authority over foreign trade, and other matters were not mentioned at all in the Washington negotiations. The spokesman also denied the claim published in a London newspaper that Royall had said that the United States would also control the political policies of the merged zone. It is understood that the Washington negotiations only involved revising the method of sharing occupation fees and the establishment of a joint import and export agency. The United States may have most of the control in that agency. The agreement is still awaiting formal approval by the two governments.

### British King Formally Approves Independence of Burma and Ceylon

[Reuters, London, 11th] The United Kingdom formally granted independence to Burma and Ceylon, with a population of 21 million, on the 11th. Burma will secede from the British Commonwealth and become an independent sovereign republic on January 4th. Ceylon will become a quasi-autonomous dominion within the British Commonwealth from today. The British King's edict approving the Burmese and Ceylonese Independence Acts was read out today in the House of Lords, according to ancient custom, by a royal commission composed of three nobles, to the members of both the Upper and Lower Houses. The two independent nations of Burma and Ceylon were thus born.

Both Burma and Ceylon have signed treaties with the UK stipulating their relationship with Britain after independence. Burmese Prime Minister Aung San recently came to London to sign the Anglo-Burmese Treaty and stated publicly that the Republic of Burma will continue to maintain the most friendly relations with Britain. The Burmese Constitution has been drafted by the Burmese Constituent Assembly and provides for the establishment of a Burmese Federation with a bicameral Federal Parliament, which will elect a President and appoint a Prime Minister to form a cabinet. Each state in the Federation may elect representatives to participate in the Federal Parliament through the State Parliament. Ceylon, with an area of 25,000 square miles, was originally a direct colony under the rule of the British King. After Lord Soulbury led a committee to investigate the island in 1944, the Soulbury Constitution was established, granting Ceylon full internal autonomy. Foreign affairs and national defense remained the responsibility of Britain. The new government of the island was produced after the general election in September of this year. After independence, it will exchange high commissioners with Britain.

### Beset by Foreign and Domestic Problems, Iranian Cabinet Resigns En Masse; Soviets Stir Up Separatist Movement in Azerbaijan Province

[Reuters, Tehran, November 11th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultanah suddenly announced to the plenary session of the Parliament on the morning of the 11th: "Our country's domestic and foreign affairs are approaching a serious crisis. I feel that I can no longer continue to serve and will present my resignation and that of my cabinet to the King tonight." Sultanah left the Parliament immediately after the announcement.

At the door of the Parliament, he further explained to reporters, "The main reason for my resignation is that I cannot prevent the separatist movement in the semi-autonomous province of Azerbaijan in northern Iran. Furthermore, the entanglement with the Soviet Union over the oil issue cannot be resolved. The development in Azerbaijan is directly due to Soviet pressure. History will judge my merits and demerits." All members of Sultanah's cabinet except three had submitted their resignations to Sultanah last week. Sultanah himself stated that he would not resign unless Parliament passed a vote of no confidence in him. However, as criticism from all sides intensified in the past 24 hours, he had to reconsider his position. The resignation of most of his cabinet members was prompted by the Soviet Union's renewed note to Iran, reiterating its demand for Iran to ratify the 1945 Soviet-Iranian oil agreement. Sultanah's broadcast address was met with dissatisfaction by most cabinet members, and the opposition accused him of being too pro-Soviet. Observers predict that after Sultanah's resignation, the Soviet Union and Iran will enter a diplomatic showdown.

### Eighteen Rice Merchants Arrested in Two Locations, Market Stalls Across North And South Cease Business For A Time. Mayor Wu Reportedly Immediately Orders Release of Arrested Parties. The Requests From The Entire Management Committee Are Met With A Satisfactory Response.

[By Our Reporter] Yesterday, the rice market briefly suspended business at 10:00 AM, due to economic police arresting multiple rice merchants. The markets resumed trading at 10:30 AM. In the afternoon, the entire market management committee petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu and Section Chief Ji met with the committee and gave their response. The arrested rice merchants were released at 3:00 PM yesterday. Today, trading is expected to return to normal.

Following the issuance of the large denomination notes the other day, the Social Affairs Bureau noted a sharp rise in the price of rice, which increased in value from fifty thousand to one hundred thousand dollars per load, especially in the Northern Market. To stabilize the price of rice, Director Lee summoned the market management committee and each group leader to a discussion at the Northern Rice Market yesterday morning. Thirty-five people attended, including Xu Songren, Gu Yisheng, and Cha Baoshan. Section Chief Lee explained several points: The issuance of large denomination notes was to meet demand; the recent price fluctuations are problematic; and today's prices must be lower than yesterday's prices to ease people's minds. All attendees accepted and expressed willingness to do their utmost to cooperate with the government. After the meeting, they entered the market and began trading. All stall prices fell by about twenty thousand dollars. The market management committee also issued a notice of self-discipline to ensure that trading prices are reasonable. Shortly after this, economic police entered the market for inspection. They arrested eleven people in the Southern Market and seven in the Northern Market. As a result, the market became chaotic, and business was suspended from 10:00 AM. Section Chief Ji immediately returned to the bureau to report the situation to Director Wu, who then telephoned Mayor Wu. After receiving the report, Mayor Wu immediately called Police Bureau Director Yu, instructing him that in the future, when economic police carry out tasks in the food market, they should contact the Social Affairs Bureau's on-site personnel to ensure consistent action and avoid causing unrest among merchants and disrupting the market. The Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for managing the North and South rice markets. The Mayor then ordered the police bureau to release the arrested rice merchants. Section Chief Ji of the Social Affairs Bureau's Food Section immediately persuaded the rice merchants to resume business, which they did at 7:30 PM. At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, the entire market management committee from the North and South rice markets, including Yin Fuxiang, Xu Songren, and Cha Baoshan, and more than thirty other members, petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. In addition to requesting the release of those arrested, they submitted a document requesting several points: Economic police must carry out activities legally, and must not treat "price limits" as illegal measures; the legitimate costs of grain merchants should be taken into account, and legitimate grain merchants should not be suppressed with high-handed political means; government-business cooperation should be thoroughly implemented, and grain merchants should not be regarded as enemies. Director Wu and Section Chief Ji met with the committee and gave their response: Do not seek exorbitant profits, and maintain reasonable grain prices. The Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for market management. In the future, when economic police inspect the market or discover illegal grain merchants who need to be arrested, they will coordinate with the Social Affairs Bureau. The eighteen arrested rice merchants were released at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The petitioning market management committee members expressed satisfaction with the replies from Director Wu and Section Chief Ji, and guaranteed that they would not engage in illegal transactions. The disruption came to an end.

### Yong Yarn Prices Soar, Police Intervene, Two Trading Misunderstandings Occur

[By Our Reporter] Yesterday, the securities market in this city, experienced a cessation of trading due to the Garrison Command dispatching personnel to suppress the bidding up of prices, which led to the market collapsing both in the morning and the afternoon. However, after explanations from both sides, the misunderstandings were resolved, and the market is expected to return to normal today.

The Garrison Command personnel, accompanied by securities exchange staff, entered the trading floor at approximately 10:00 AM yesterday to monitor trading. At about 11:45 AM, when the buying and selling price of Yong Yarn was called at $403 and $404, a broker bid five dollars higher. The Garrison Command personnel stationed on-site considered the broker to be engaged in price gouging, intervened, and confiscated the broker's trading documents. After it was explained that the transaction price did not exceed the legally permitted daily increase limit, the misunderstanding was cleared up. The trading documents were immediately returned, and trading continued. Yong Yarn closed at $401. In the afternoon, brokers were unsettled by the morning's interruption of trading. The Red Yarn market finally opened at 2:10 PM, followed by the White Yarn market. Near 3:00 PM, when the buying and selling price of White Yarn was called at eight and ten dollars, broker number 219 bid nine dollars to buy, which was again considered price gouging by the Garrison Command personnel stationed on-site. The broker was temporarily surrounded in the trading counter in the center of the market. The general brokers were rather perturbed and at a loss as to what to do, and the market temporarily suspended. On the floor of the market, Yu Mingshi, representing those stationed there, requested the securities exchange authorities to guarantee that market transactions within the legally permitted range of price fluctuations would be protected. After several meetings and explanations, a satisfactory resolution was reached, but it was already close to closing time. Yong Yarn closed at $409 in the afternoon. According to broker sources, the market should operate as usual today if there are no unexpected interruptions.

Representatives from both national and private yarn factories attended. It was reported that Mr. Wu believes that year-end bonuses should be capped at one month's salary and that adjustments should be made based on the factory's equipment and profit/loss situation. However, officials from various yarn factories stated that business performance this year has been poor and that most of the cotton yarn produced has been handed over to the government. Therefore, they believe that year-end bonuses should be capped at half a month's salary and should be distributed in installments to ease the burden. After exchanging views, it was decided to wait for the labor unions' opinions before making a reasonable decision.

### No Snow This Winter? Public Reasoning vs. Mother-in-Law's Logic in Climate Observations and Astronomical Measurements

[By Our Reporter] Will there be snow this winter? And when will it start snowing? Many people are speculating. Father Long Xiangqi of the Xujiahui Observatory believes that the climate was warm in October this year. Based on his past annual experiences, he deduced that there probably would not be any snow this winter, or the snowfall period would be very late. However, according to Director Zheng Zizheng of the Meteorological Station, the period with the most snowfall in Shanghai in previous years is the solar month of January, with less snowfall in December and February. Although the end of the year has not yet arrived, the continuous overcast skies indicate that the humidity along the coast is very high. Additionally, the high-pressure system from the north is moving, and it is expected to reach Central China next Monday or Tuesday. If the humid air is still over the coastal area at that time, encountering this cold front may immediately cause snowfall. In recent months, the high-pressure system has enveloped various parts of North China, and snowfall has already occurred. There has also been a heavy snowstorm in Japan, which has not stopped yet. Therefore, it is probably not a fact that Shanghai will not have snowfall or that the snowfall period will be delayed. The Shanghai Meteorological Station's weather forecast for today is recorded as follows:

Yellow Sea: Sunny to cloudy, freezing, light haze or fog, moderate west to north winds, moderate waves. Central China: Cloudy, cold to cloudy, moderate north to east winds, fog in the morning and evening. Shanghai: Cloudy, haze, cold to cloudy, moderate north to east winds, fog in the morning and evening. East China Sea: Cloudy to rainy, strong north to northeast winds, strong winds in the Taiwan Strait. Haze and morning fog along the coast, huge waves.

November 11th temperature: Maximum 44 degrees, minimum 38.5 degrees. Who is right and who is wrong? Let's wait for later verification.

### Director of Financial Bureau Hosts Reporters, Actively Cracking Down on Speculation and Protecting Legitimate Manufacturers, No Problems Expected for Finance and Prices This Year

[By Our Reporter] Li Lixia, Director of the Municipal Financial Bureau, and Deputy Director Bi Delin, assumed their posts yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, they hosted the press and issued the following statement: The Financial Bureau is determined to adhere to the principle of equal management for officials and merchants, Chinese and foreigners, actively crack down on speculation, stabilize finance, and increase production. The new measures to freeze gold and banknote speculation have been amended by the Ministry of Finance, submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval, and will be promulgated and implemented soon. Everyone will be subject to these measures. In the future, we will cooperate with local agencies such as the Garrison Command to expand the scope of investigation, not just based on passive reports. We will protect legitimate manufacturers. We are now preparing to concentrate our efforts to strictly review the lending of commercial banks and severely crack down on gold and banknote speculation, making it unprofitable for operators and diverting idle funds back to the right track. Regarding the crackdown on the black market for US dollars between Hong Kong and Shanghai, we have already worked with the Garrison Command to crack down on six or seven secret private radio stations. At the same time, we have received detailed reports on those who engage in Hong Kong exchange transactions. We will take stringent measures against underground banks. Director Li also told reporters that commercial banks may tend to specialize in the future, becoming a department of a certain industrial or commercial enterprise. Ordinary commercial banks may find it difficult to survive.

### Wu Chao, the Main Criminal in the Fuzhou Body Disposal Case, Straightforwardly Admits to Murdering But Not Stealing

Wu wore black Han-style clothing and black shoes, had a Western hairstyle, and was calm.

actions in detail. It is said that: He was first a soldier, graduated from the Fujian Security Cadre Training Institute, and later partnered with Zheng Qingjing to open the Southeast Company. The total capital was NT$150,000, divided into three shares, Zheng with two shares, acting as manager, and he with one share, in charge of accounting. Last year in December, Zheng Qingjing transported a batch of gray cloth back to Xianyou for sale, but Zheng never returned, which caused the store's turnover to be unsustainable. He had issued several telegrams, but Zheng ignored them, so he took NT$400,000 back to Rong. Before long, Zheng came to Rong to "settle accounts" with him and requested to pay

back 50 million legal tender based on the "soybean cake" price in Taiwan. The two sides insisted on not giving in, and Zheng wanted to detain him and send him to the military police. Later, Zhang Liangdong and others mediated. He first went to Taiwan to settle accounts and then discussed it again after returning. On October 1, Deng came to Rong from Taiwan and inquired about his residence at Zhang Liangdong's house. At that time, he happened to be in Zhang Liangdong's next room. After hearing the news, he planned to find a way to escape back to Xianyou. On October 4, Zhang Liangdong's wife Chuan Xiuying lived in Xiahang Street, and Zhang lived in the Nantai Overseas Chinese Reception Center, waiting for him to return to Xianyou together. Unexpectedly, when he returned to the San Ying home to pick up a quilt that day, he happened to meet Zheng Qingjing who came to interrogate him, so he reluctantly went into the

room to discuss. Zheng still insisted on paying him back tens of millions of yuan, otherwise he would demolish his residence in Xianju, so he temporarily stayed at his place. On the same night, his fellow villager Chen Yuanlu bought two catties of wine and one catty of noodles, and the three ate together. Zheng Qingjing fell asleep on the bed after drinking only a few cups. At that time, he suddenly had the intention to kill, so he invited Chen Yuanlu to use an axe to strike Zheng Qingjing's left forehead and face five or six times.

Blood flowed like a torrent, and he died on the spot. At that time, he was still afraid that he was not dead, so he used a brown rope to tighten Zheng's throat. Then he pried open the floor, dug four feet, and buried the body. The next day, he bought 10,000 yuan of coal and scattered it on top, and prepared to return to Xianyou. The helper Chen Yuanlu was immediately rewarded with more than 100,000 yuan in cash and a gold ring, and fled to Jiangxi. He only got 100,000 yuan in cash, a 2.4 million yuan check, a gold ring, and a brown suit. Besides that, there was nothing else. When Zhang Liangdong, Chuan Xiuying, and Wu Yan were interrogated, they all denied participating in the murder. The interrogation lasted for four hours before it was completed. All the prisoners were sent back to prison, and the trial will be held another day.

Museums and Socialization – The Importance of Rebuilding the City Museum - Li Shizeng

Socialization and Globalization

Socialization is a medicine for social ills, as well as a natural law and inevitable destination of social development. Its purpose is to enable everyone in society to do their best and take what they need, so that no one is prevented from doing their best or taking what they need due to the private ownership and control of property and power. The largest scope of socialization is naturally the socialization of the world. The globalization of the world is certainly not something that can be achieved overnight, but as long as we take small steps towards the path of socialization, we will eventually reach the largest scope.

Museums and Socialization

In the past, only emperors, nobles, wealthy merchants, and tycoons were able to collect and appreciate strange artifacts, antiques, rare birds, and exotic animals as private property. When these things came into the hands of scholars, they were appraised, studied, and published as works, allowing the general public to indirectly gain some knowledge from them, thus taking the first step towards socialization. Taking it a step further, when these items are displayed in museums, in addition to scholars, the public and general students also have the opportunity to understand history and appreciate art. Compared to being imprisoned in the hands of a few people, this is more reasonable. Therefore, museums are a good example of cultural socialization.

Museums and Globalization

Libraries and museums are both good institutions for cultural socialization, but books are limited by the differences in languages. Books in language A cannot be fully translated into languages B, C, etc. Therefore, people who use languages B, C, etc. cannot fully read books in language A. Museums are different; there is no linguistic barrier. Therefore, libraries and museums are both necessary for cultural exchange in the world, but the effect of museums is even more significant.

Museums are one of the three-dimensional encyclopedias

We are engaged in the work of a world encyclopedia, not only wanting to construct a collective human brain on paper (as Mr. H.G. Wells, a colleague of the world encyclopedia, said), but also wanting to make it three-dimensional and dynamic, becoming things and institutions that promote civilization. Because museums are one of the three-dimensional encyclopedias, we who are engaged in the work of a world encyclopedia hope that more museums can be established everywhere, especially hoping that they have great architecture and appropriate exhibits.

Urban Museums and Local Museums

On the one hand, cities have a large population, and on the other hand, they are the place where people from all over the world travel. Whether in social education or cultural exchange, they should have great museums. Today, every place has its relationship with other parts of the world. In order to enable residents of various places to gain knowledge and understand their relationship with the world, there should also be museums. (The French scholar Shao Ke Lu once established a local museum and invented an instrument to show the relationship between each place and other parts of the world. I once named it "Cosmic Orientation Instrument.")

The Necessity of Constructing and Expanding the Shanghai City Museum

The Shanghai City Museum was located in the central area of Jiangwan before the war, with quite grand architecture and relatively rich exhibits. After the war, the museum building was dilapidated, and the recovered surviving exhibits are still considerable. It is really necessary to build a great museum in today's city center as soon as possible and expand its exhibits to show the microcosm of a global cultural metropolis.

Society Drives Government Implementation

I often say that in the current government and society, like the two wheels of a car and the two wings of a bird, they complement each other, and no effort will be in vain. Regarding the construction and expansion of the Shanghai City Museum, Director of Education Li Ximou believes that it should be promoted by society and implemented by the government. This view is very admirable. Therefore, the City Council successfully passed a resolution to use 6 billion yuan to build this museum and hand it over to the Municipal Government for overall planning. With such support from the public opinion organs, we hope that the new construction of the Shanghai City Museum can be realized soon!

The Progressive Motor Team Suffers a Crushing Defeat; The Shantou Team Only Has Four Players at the End of the Game with a Score of 57 to 36. [Report from our newspaper] The Motor Sixteen basketball team won the second game last night with a score of 57 to 36, a great victory over the Shantou team. In the first half, Motor Sixteen led by six points with a score of 26 to 20. A few minutes into the second half, Lin Weicong, a key player of the Shantou team, disrespected the referee and was sent off the court. The Shantou team finally disintegrated and fell sharply. By the second half, Chen Qingjiang was sent off again for committing five fouls, and the Shantou team was unable to recover. The Motor performance was quite wonderful, controlling the overall situation from beginning to end. The only tense game ended with a disappointing finish. The players from Motor Sixteen were Zheng Daguang, Liao Diheng, Jia Zhijun, Wang Shixuan, and Yu Ruizhang. The players from Shantou were Chen Qingjiang, Lin Weicong, He Lide, Ma Xiyi, and Cai Yanxiong. The referees were Xuan Hezu and Zhu Mingxing. Liao Diheng, a guest player, scored two consecutive goals, and Jia made a free throw, hanging up five points and making them invincible. He Lide of the Shantou team scored a free throw, breaking the record with a score of 6 to 2. Lin Weicong was sent off, and Ji Nankang substituted. The Shantou team has been sluggish ever since. Two on two, it was a one-sided affair. Both sides committed many fouls. The Shantou team fought hard, with a score of 26 to 20 in the first half. In the second half, Motor led by ten points again. The Shantou team's heart and strength were at odds, with a score of 34 to 24. Chen Qingjiang committed a foul and graduated, and four players fought the battle, becoming more and more unable to support it, and the game ended hastily with a score of 57 to 36.

The Malaysian Chinese Team Loses to the Hong Kong Star Team; The Score is 5 to 0.

Badminton Competition Begins; Group B Women's Three Matches; Group A Postponed to the Beginning of January. The badminton league is scheduled to start tonight, with two Group B matches and one women's match, starting at 6:00 PM in the city gymnasium. Group A, due to the small number of teams, has fewer matches and is postponed to the first Monday in January next year. The remaining Group B women's and mixed groups will be held in the gymnasium every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, as stipulated, starting today. Tonight's schedule is as follows: Kang Le - West Qing Hong (Group B Two) starting at 6:00 PM, Jia Yi Jia - Xiao Guang (Group B One) starting at 7:00 PM, Sheng Lian - You Zhong (Women's) starting at 8:00 PM.

The Amateur Sports Association Will Be Established.

Twenty-odd people attended, including Chairman Yu Liren, New Technology Expert Cha Ruilong, and Secretary-General Wan Yi, and decided to establish the association in the near future.

The Defeat of the Shantou Team

The game between Motor Sixteen and the Petroleum Team disappointed nearly three thousand spectators at the venue. The entire game can be divided into four stages: 1. The Shantou team committed repeated fouls, falling behind by 3 to 14. 2. Cai and Ma worked hard, chasing to end the first half with a score of 20 to 26. 3. The guest team's players could shoot well, and Qingjiang was restricted by Da Guang and Cao Zhi and could not develop. 4. The Shantou team fought with four players and could not resist. Lin Weicong's disrespect for the referee and being sent off the court was not the key to yesterday's victory or defeat. Motor Sixteen has all the advantages over the Shantou team. The shooting percentage that the Shantou team has always maintained, the guest team actually surpassed it. Chen Qingjiang of the Shantou team could not move, and Lin Weicong's aiming mid-range shots had no chance to be taken. He Lide's throws lacked certainty. On the contrary, Ma Zai and Lao Cha, who usually abandoned shooting, scored points. Everyone in Motor Sixteen can shoot. Using their superior physical strength, they adopted a man-to-man tactic, forcing the Shantou team to be unable to break through to the basket, making it even more difficult for the Shantou team to score. As a member of the basketball committee and the leader of the Shantou team, Lin Zuoshi should have considered how to make the players obey the referee. Instead, he repeatedly showed a grumpy temper, which seemed inappropriate. (Reporter)

Tightening of Credit; Slack Trading; Dull Market Conditions for Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Due to continued tight credit yesterday, manufacturers and customers were slow to absorb cotton yarn, and trading among colleagues was also limited. There was a lot of reselling. The lowest price for 42 Blue Phoenix reached 48.2 million, but near the close of the market, customers took advantage of the low price to slightly increase their purchases, recovering to 48.6 million, which was 600,000 less than the previous day. The decline in 40-count yarn was even more severe, falling between 700,000-800,000 to 1.3-1.4 million. Other counts of coarse yarn saw fluctuations ranging from 120,000-450,000.

Cotton cloth and spinning mills opened cloth as usual, but due to the tightening of credit, trading was not prosperous. People in the industry were all watching and waiting, and customers were unable to advance due to difficulties in remittance. Retailers were quite active in buying and selling, seemingly trading high and low. Market fluctuations were still slight. Around 10:30, the Shanxi gang suddenly came to sell off their goods, and the selling trend started again, and the market fell again. Until the end, except for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth, which was stable, the prices of all other grades of fine cloth were uniformly reduced by 5,000-12,000 yuan. Biji cloth also dropped by about 20,000 yuan due to supply. The trend of other cloths was mostly soft.

The current cotton trend is still flat, and yarn mills still intend to buy. There were still many transactions among colleagues, and prices were stable. Cargo owners wanted to increase prices but there were no buyers, and retailers absorbed at low prices. Transactions totaled 670 packages, 400 dan. The factory price of Shashi 5.291 million was made, with 200 packages traded. The transaction price of Lingbao 5.291 million, Han Fine 4.58 million, Shashi 4.96 million, Wujiang 3.148 million to 4.687 million, Jingyang 5.498 million, Tongzhou 4.06 million, and Huoji 3.68 million, with 470 packages, 400 dan traded. Zhoupu cottonseed sold for 950,000.

Rice Slightly Weak; Prices of Miscellaneous Grains and Oils Also Drop More than 11,900 piculs of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets yesterday. The market situation was stable in the morning and fatigued in the afternoon. Japonica and indica rice fell by 10,000-20,000 yuan near closing. Flour initially rose and then fell back, and the trend softened. Bran fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan, and soybean cake showed relaxation in Taiwan. The rise stopped and fell more, falling back by 5,000-6,000 yuan. Soybeans have not escaped the fatigue and are still lacking energy. Mung beans were desold in a plain manner, and prices were flat and fair. Rainbow beans were digested in a sluggish manner and fell another 10,000 yuan. Both delivery and sales of green beans were thin, and market conditions were mediocre. Sales of red sorghum were not strong and were stable. Corn from Beiyang was lively but not refreshing, with high prices followed by reductions. Oil mills were not greedy for sesame oil, and the market was cold and sluggish, raising prices and reducing them several times. Both milk sesame and jute fell by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to move in Guangdong, with little honor or disgrace for the time being. The oil market was mixed, with soybean oil and rapeseed oil showing poor sales and falling by 20,000-30,000 yuan. There were not many shipments of raw oil, and the store was active, rising by 20,000-30,000 yuan. [Report from our newspaper] The flour market is subject to a daily limit of no more than 5% increase or decrease for each commodity, so the transaction situation has been relatively stable recently. However, the stock base of each commodity is weak, and fluctuations will inevitably occur in the future. In order to plan ahead, the Bureau of Social Affairs has specially advised manufacturers to increase supplies to stabilize market prices.

Sugar Prices Show Mixed Ups and Downs;

The sugar market yesterday showed mixed ups and downs, and the trend was flat. The association drew the line at 24 coarse white stack small packages at 1.17 million yuan, spot large packages at 1.19 million yuan, small packages at 34,000 yuan, and 20 medium sand white oil packages at 1.145-1.15 million yuan, 1,000 packages at 1.16 million yuan, rising by 23,000 yuan due to a shortage of goods. United Red was at 1.15 million yuan, with not much up or down. Shantou Qinggao goods were at 900,000 yuan, totaling 150 packages. Xinghua Baigao goods were at 1.18-1.19 million yuan, and Armed goods were at 1.16 million yuan. Xingchi rose by 23,000 yuan, with good goods at 1.12-1.13 million yuan and ordinary goods at 1.1 million yuan, totaling more than 700 pieces. Diaogao was at 834,000 yuan, totaling several hundred packages.

The Allotment Price of Taiwan Sugar for the Next Period Will Change The types, quantities, and prices of sugar allotted by Taiwan Sugar Company for the next period (Period 45) have been decided. Sugar merchants will be allotted 45 cars of white sugar, and sugar factories will be allotted large packages of coarse granulated sugar. The quantities are the same as in Period 43, and the prices remain unchanged.

Tea Market is Sluggish. The domestic tea market was still active yesterday because there were still transactions between local merchants and cargo owners. In terms of prices, they stood firm. As for foreign business transactions, the price bid by sellers were all displayed. The results fell into a state of stagnation. The industry insiders said: At present, British businessmen are even more eager to buy Qimen black tea, but the price they offer is too stingy, and the suppliers are affected by the shortage of inventory and refuse to sell easily. Judging from the current situation, it is difficult to expect a deal to be reached in a short time.

Police Officers Arrive on the Scene to Supervise; The Stock Market Trend is Hazy; Rumors Abounded; The Market Initially Weak and Then Strong; A Powerful Group Outside the Market Pulled Back and Rose Rapidly; Police Officers Arrived on the Scene for the First Time to Supervise; Due to a Lack of Understanding of Technical Issues, the Market Became Hazy and Normal Trading Could Not Be Conducted in the Aftermarket.

The opening performance in the morning was low. Yongsha opened at 393 yuan and 405 yuan, then fell to 366 yuan and 401 yuan, and then rose slightly to 391 yuan and 407 yuan. The premium for deferred delivery was high, and the interest rate outside the market was still at 22.5 and 27, and the credit was extremely tight, forcing a further decline to a low price of 383 yuan for immediate delivery and 401 yuan for deferred delivery. A certain Xu from Nanjing outside the market purchased enthusiastically, once rising to a high price of 408 yuan for immediate delivery and 430 yuan for deferred delivery. Later, due to the arrival of police officers to supervise the market and intervene, market confidence was shaken, and the market closed at 401 yuan and 409 yuan.

Therefore, Xinha and Meiya Qin Xing rose by 50%, and the rest rose slightly. There was an invisible market suspension for more than half an hour in the afternoon. Yu Shiqi, the person in charge of the Brokerage Association, came to the scene to persuade, and the deferred delivery of Yongsha was barely opened by No. 22 and others, but trading was still light. Yongsha initially saw 422 yuan, but it was reported that the national bank had entered a large amount of money, and it fell to 412 yuan. Other shares other than deferred delivery had no trading. Then it recovered to 428 yuan, and spot yarn rose slightly from 407 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 3 o'clock, No. 219 bought in at a price of 409 yuan in the process of immediate delivery of Yongsha from 408 yuan to 410 yuan, and was again intervened by police officers, and the market was suspended again. The market closed at the last traded price of 409 yuan and 425 yuan. There were very few transactions in the remaining shares, and the gains and losses of the current and deferred shares were slight compared to the morning close. The old shares and Xinxin outside the market rose by more than 10% and were still stable. The interest rate on current deferred arbitrage trading rose from low to high yesterday, with those entering at a discount of 14 to 22, and those exiting at a discount of 17 to 25.

It has been decided that oil and rice will be rationed to households starting on the 15th, with a value of about 100 billion yuan for two times. The rationing of rayon and cotton yarn is also worth more than 600 billion yuan. The revenue from commodity tax in recent weeks has been very large. It is heard that the total value of the above has exceeded 10,000 billion yuan. Credit may become tighter in the future, and there is no hope of easing within the week.

### Raising Relief Funds: Quzhou Theater Suggests Charity Performance

[Our Quzhou Bureau, 8th] In order to manage winter relief in this county, it was decided that all theaters would add a relief donation of one thousand yuan to each ticket. After issuing the order to theaters such as Datong and Dongnan, the organizers of these two theaters believed that adding the relief donation to the ticket would affect business and that it would take a long time to obtain a large sum of money. In order to seize the time and avoid affecting business, they suggested to the authorities that they hold regular performances and donate all ticket revenue to relief efforts. Whether or not this will be adopted is still under consideration by the authorities.

### The Xu Transportation Will Be Restored

[Our Kaifeng Bureau, 5th Dispatch] The section from Shangqiu to Xuzhou has been progressing slowly due to the lack of railroad ties. It has recently been learned that the Ministry of Communications has allocated 70,000 Canadian fir railroad ties, which are currently being transported from Shanghai to Xuzhou by land. They will be distributed to the construction site for application. The Bian-Xu transportation will be restored soon. Furthermore, in order to protect the railway and strive for transportation safety, the Kaifeng County Government has ordered all townships to take advantage of the winter slack season and, starting on December 1st, to begin repairing and excavating the protective ditches on both sides of the railway from Kaifeng Xinghuaying Station to Zhengzhou Military Station, and to complete this project by the 15th.

### Tunxi Highway Restored with Civilian Labor

[Our Huizhou Bureau, 6th] The highway from this county to Tunxi was previously requested by the Provincial Government and the Provincial Assembly to the Executive Yuan for allocation of funds for repair. The Executive Yuan then forwarded it to the Ministry of Communications for allocation. The Ministry of Communications replied that the highway funds for this year had already been fully allocated and that, due to limited financial resources, it was impossible to allocate funds. If the Anhui Provincial Government believes that the road needs to be repaired immediately, it may use the agricultural slack season to mobilize civilian labor and raise funds on its own. The Provincial Government also believes that the Tunxi highway, previously surveyed by the Anhui South Affairs Office, has ordered the county government to use civilian labor in the agricultural slack season to repair the road itself as soon as the road line survey is completed.

### From Basin to Plain

[Our Hangzhou Bureau, 9th] The remnants of the Shaonanling Mountains and the Donggong Mountains stretch along the border of Fujian and Zhejiang, while the Wuyi Mountains intertwine on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, creating the mountainous area of Fujian, a prominent zone in the southeastern coastal mountains. Fuzhou is the largest basin in this mountainous area.

I walked (actually, flew) out of this basin, shook off some of the dust of the mountains and fields, crossed the mountainous border of Fujian and Zhejiang, and returned to Shanghai, the flatland of the plain of the Guo River. As soon as I unloaded my luggage, I stepped onto the banks of the Qiantang River, making a short trip to Hangzhou once again.

On one side are overlapping mountains and ridges, on the other, a vast plain.

Fujian is a relatively mountainous province among the coastal provinces of China. The deep mountains and valleys of northwestern Fujian need not be mentioned. Even Fuzhou, as a basin in the mountains, not only has rolling hills all around, but also has the scenic spots of "Three Mountains" (Yu Mountain, Wushi Mountain, and Ping Mountain) in the city. Because of its mountainous terrain, the geographical environment determines the economic conditions and way of life of the people of Fujian.

When I looked down at the Yangtze River Delta from thousands of feet in the air, I saw crisscrossing rivers and canals, lakes and marshes scattered like stars, and a vast expanse of land where no mountains were visible for hundreds of miles. Even if there was an occasional hill or mound, it was small and isolated, becoming an ornament in the plain. The prosperity of Jiangnan is really bestowed by this lush plain. Fujian's poverty is mostly hindered by its mountainous highlands. Terrain has a great decisive effect on culture and economy.

Fuzhou and Hangzhou are both provincial capitals, garden cities, and park cities.

Fuzhou City is known as a garden-style city because of its flowers, plants, forests, springs, and other scenic features. Fuzhou does indeed have many scenic spots and historical sites. The West Lake of Fuzhou is the former palace of the Tang Dynasty's Min King, and has been carefully carved and landscaped. The scenery is beautiful, but unfortunately it has been neglected for many years, and is overgrown with weeds and duckweed, giving it a desolate feel. Compared with the West Lake in Hangzhou, it pales in comparison.

Although I visited the lake again during the bleak winter season, I still felt that the West Lake had a graceful demeanor, just as the saying goes, "To compare West Lake to Xizi, it is always lovely whether lightly or heavily adorned." Surrounded by green mountains and reflected by the shimmering light and misty shadows, it is truly unforgettable, and it is not an exaggeration to call it a national park.

The Min River is like the Qiantang River, Fuzhou crabs and West Lake lotus roots

The main river of Fujian Province, the Min River, flows through the Fuzhou Basin and serves as the major artery of Fuzhou's transportation. The Qiantang River converges with the Fuchun River, and the Pujiang River flows eastward, irrigating the park city after passing Hangzhou and flowing into Hangzhou Bay.

This time I went to Hangzhou, I did not eat the lotus root of West Lake. Speaking of the lotus root of West Lake, I remembered the crabs of Fuzhou West Lake. Fuzhou crabs are rich and oily, and are very popular with tourists. However, it is said that there are many crabs in times of chaos, and eating too many crabs cannot help but make one worry about the current situation.

Ancestral Brocade Rivers and Mountains: May everyone manage them well

Hangzhou is the center of China's silk weaving industry. What about Fuzhou? Lacquerware is its unique craft and also a manufactured product that can earn foreign exchange.

I saw all kinds of things in the plain area with thousands of miles in sight, and I also thought of the various shapes and colors of the mountains and even the basins. They are all different and have their own characteristics, but these are all the beautiful rivers and mountains left by our ancestors. Let us manage and operate them well!

### Wuwu County Assembly Dispute: Speaker Goes to Hefei to Petition

Assembly members have been constantly leaving the county to come to Wuhu in recent days.

### Wuxi Drainage Machine Oil Allocation: Feng Nanhu Embezzles Four Hundred Million Yuan

[Our Wuxi Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The oil used by the drainage machines in this county was previously applied for allocation by the County Assembly to the Shanghai Evacuees Management Committee in order to benefit the farmers. The committee approved the allocation of 265 tons of diesel oil to the Wuxi purchasing agency. However, during the distribution process, it was discovered that Feng Nanhu, the person in charge, had engaged in embezzlement. After being exposed by three general meetings of the assembly, an investigation committee was organized. The assembly has now obtained accurate figures for the original allocation and the actual purchases made by various parties. Feng Nanhu applied for 50 tons in the first application, embezzled 14 tons, embezzled all of the second application, and sold it on the black market in Shanghai. In the third application, he received 150 tons, raised the oil price, and filled his own pockets. The total amount of embezzlement is over 400 million yuan. Feng has now disappeared and the assembly will track down the embezzled funds for verification.

### Quzhou Discovers "Sympathy Society" Leader: Hui Gengshou Has Become a Cobbler

[Our Quzhou Bureau, 6th Dispatch] In the Yangkou and Hushan towns on the border of Quzhou and Suichang, there is an organization calling itself the "Sympathy Society," which specializes in inciting farmers to resist rent and corvée, using "25% rent reduction" and "resistance to conscription" as slogans. Led by Zeng Gengshou (nicknamed Zeng Laoda) from Dawangyun, Naxiang, Quzhou, he led dozens of people and possessed various weapons, emerging on the border of Quzhou and Suichang to engage in incitement work. On the 3rd of this month, Hui Gengshou entered the city for some business and stayed in Room 5 of the Jinling Hotel. The police, upon receiving the report, arrested the bandit Hui at around 11 PM.

### Fang Jiling Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing

Taiwan Provincial Research and Experimentation Institutions

### Simplification and Adjustment Plan Has Been Initially Drafted

[Our Taipei Bureau, 8th Dispatch] The two major production pillars of Taiwan, the Industry and Mining Corporation and the Agriculture and Forestry Corporation, have been proposed by Mr. Yang Xuancheng, consultant of the Provincial Government, to merge and reorganize into enterprise companies. The authorities are seriously considering the adjustment and merger of these two provincial institutions, but there are difficulties in terms of business, personnel, production and sales. However, preliminary agreements have been made on the merger of various research institutions. Currently, the provincial research and experimentation institutions include forestry, agriculture, fisheries, sugar, industry, oceanography, geology, and health. After the restoration, the authorities have maintained the status quo of the various research institutions, but due to limited funding, insufficient technical personnel, and poor management, institutions with a long history or a considerable foundation have not been able to operate smoothly, and have not been able to establish close ties with related production institutions, allowing them to go their own way, focusing on ostentation and neglecting the work that should be done. As a result, a reasonable adjustment has not been achieved, and they have not been able to exert their strength in practice. Currently, the authorities have decided to merge the Sugar Experiment Station into the Sugar Corporation, which is jointly run by the Investment Commission and the Provincial Government, the Fisheries Experiment Station into the Fisheries Corporation, and the Jiawo and Hengchun livestock experiment stations of the Agricultural Experiment Station into the Livestock Corporation. The Pingzhen and Yuchi tea experiment farms will be merged into the Tea Company. Recently, agricultural circles here revealed that the simplification and adjustment of this kind of institution is necessary, but academic and production institutions must have organized cooperation, planned and gradual research, avoid duplication, and jointly seek solutions to practical problems, so as to better exert the research effect, which is even more necessary. Enterprise companies aim to make profits. If they proceed from a commercial mentality and prepare for experimental research based on the prosperity and decline of business, it will be a crisis for academic research and will weaken the intense research atmosphere. This point seems to be worthy of the authorities' careful consideration.

### Watching White Plays, Major Fight, Detaining Bandits, We Will Deal with Them Strictly

[Our Wuxi Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The Changyuan Theater in Zhoushanbang, this county, has recently been performing "The Civet Cat Exchanged for the Prince." On the evening of the 7th of this month, not long after the performance began, a mob of "Thirty-Six Gang" did not purchase tickets and forced their way into the theater. When they were stopped by the ticket collectors, a dispute occurred and led to a major melee involving more than 1,000 people, injuring three audience members. Residents in the area fled in panic. Military police authorities and the entire city's self-defense force went to suppress the situation with guns and ammunition, and finally the situation calmed down.
