### Indefinite Postponement of Peace Conference with Japan: China Hopes to Break the Deadlock Soon - Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks at Press Conference

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, who recently returned from the United States, publicly answered various questions from reporters regarding diplomatic matters at 11:00 AM today. However, he remained tight-lipped about U.S. aid to China, refusing to disclose any information. Today's press conference was the first held by Wang since his return to the country. Prior to the conference, reporters from various newspapers submitted numerous written questions, with a particular focus on U.S. aid to China. Wang provided a comprehensive response, which was largely similar to his reports presented at the Political Affairs Conference and the State Council. Regarding U.S. aid to China, reporters sought to understand the aid methods and the conditions for U.S. "supervision." Wang only stated in response: "Regarding the issue of U.S. aid to China, I do not intend to make any statement. It seems that such questions should be directed to Washington." Subsequently, Wang also answered oral inquiries from the reporters.

Wang expressed his hope that the media would pay special attention to the cooperation between China and India in international conferences. After describing the situation at the United Nations General Assembly, he stated that this assembly was the first time India attended as a fully independent nation. Over the past month, the Indian delegation and the Chinese delegation have been very harmonious on several important issues. Currently, each member state of the United Nations has its own group, but China is isolated. If China and India can reach complete agreement and adopt a consensus on certain major issues in international conferences, then these two major nations, representing 800 million people, even if they are not militarily powerful countries, their joint opinion will definitely have a decisive force on world peace. Therefore, I hope that all parties will value Sino-Indian cooperation and use this cooperation to serve world peace.

Regarding the issue of the peace conference with Japan, Wang stated: "It is currently impossible to predict when the drafting meeting for the peace treaty with Japan can be convened." He explained that the crux of the matter lies in the divergence of opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States advocates for a conference of eleven nations, while the Soviet Union advocates for consultations among China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Our proposal is that the drafting should be done by a conference of eleven nations, but every decision must be unanimously agreed upon by China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Currently, we are awaiting responses from the United States and the Soviet Union to our proposal and are still urging them to accept our position. "If either party does not accept China's proposal, I really do not know what other way there is to break the current deadlock and establish a peace treaty." Someone asked what our attitude would be if the United States and the Soviet Union did not accept our proposal. Wang replied: "I do not wish to make any statement at this time, because I do not want to assume that our proposal will not be accepted." Wang continued: "Currently, the atmosphere among the United Nations is becoming increasingly tense. This situation is unlikely to improve until peace treaties are concluded with Germany and Japan. In terms of these two major peace treaties, the establishment of a peace treaty with Japan is easier than with Germany. If a peace treaty with Japan can be completed soon, establishing peace in the Far East, the overall world situation may begin to improve. Therefore, China does not want to see the issue of the peace conference with Japan remain unresolved for a long time."

### China Proposes to the United Nations General Assembly to Limit the Abuse of Veto Power - Supports Simultaneous Withdrawal of Troops by the United States and the Soviet Union on the Korean Issue

Regarding the situation at the United Nations General Assembly, Wang raised several important issues, explaining China's position: 　The issue of the veto power of the five permanent members: China has been extremely cautious in the use of the veto power and has not used it once in the past two years. Some members of the General Assembly advocate amending the Charter to abolish the veto power, but this is practically difficult and inappropriate, so China does not support it. We have an independent proposal on this matter, advocating for limiting the abuse of the veto power within the scope of the Charter. Several countries have expressed support for this proposal and it may be submitted for discussion at next week's meeting. 　The issue of the Permanent Committee: The Soviet Union strongly opposes this matter. We advocate that the committee can be established, but it cannot replace the General Assembly, nor can it infringe upon the powers of the Security Council. This view seems to be supported by the vast majority, but the Soviet Union may still oppose it. 　The Korean issue: The meeting of the four countries, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, was originally scheduled to be held on September 8 to discuss this issue, but it was suspended due to Soviet opposition. Therefore, the United States raised the issue in the General Assembly. We believe that if the United States and the Soviet Union, or the four countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union who participated in the Moscow Agreement, cannot reach an agreement, then this issue can naturally be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. China supports the simultaneous withdrawal of troops by the United States and the Soviet Union. However, if a government responsible for maintaining national order and representing the Korean people cannot be established before the withdrawal, then the day of the withdrawal will immediately plunge Korea into a state of anarchy or civil strife. Therefore, the timing of the withdrawal and the work before the withdrawal should be decided by the United Nations after consulting the opinions of the four countries.

### MacArthur Has Not Relaxed Control Over Japan

Regarding the situation in Japan, Wang stated: "I was only in Japan for four days and met with various parties and had long talks. In my personal opinion, the Katayama Cabinet is indeed sincere in leading the Japanese people onto the path of peace and democracy. However, the Japanese people do not seem to have a high degree of enthusiasm to cope with democratic politics. If Japanese leaders can cultivate this enthusiasm, Japan's future will be guaranteed. General MacArthur has not relaxed control over Japan, and his fundamental policies have not changed. However, he is very worried about the current and future starvation of the Japanese people. Therefore, he has taken some steps to prevent the economic threats faced by the Japanese people now and in the future."

Wang's report lasted for 35 minutes. Later, someone asked about the issue of Lushun and Dalian. Wang stated: "This matter should be negotiated by the envoys of China and the United States in Moscow and Nanjing." He said that he was not prepared to talk about this issue today, so he would not answer.

### China's Wedding Gift to Elizabeth Entrusted to the British Delegation to China for Delivery

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The Chinese government's wedding gift (three large boxes of famous Jiangxi porcelain) to Princess Elizabeth, the heir to the British throne, was delivered by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British Embassy on the 1st and entrusted to the British delegation to China for transportation to London and delivery to the British Royal Family.

The total value reaches 30 million legal tender.

### First Batch of Reparations Materials: China is Supervising Packaging

### Soldiers Defending Beitashan Awarded Medals by the Northwest Headquarters

[Our Xining Dispatch on the 31st] In addition to defeating the enemy, the officers and soldiers of the Qinghai Cavalry 7th Brigade who defended Beitashan obtained various important enemy documents.

### Foreign Minister Wang Discusses Two Principles on Japan's Reparations to Allied Nations: Military Industrial Equipment Must Be Dismantled and Removed, Economy Must Be Established on a Self-Sufficient Basis

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, in answering questions about the issue of Japanese reparations at a press conference with foreign reporters on the 1st, stated: "During the war, Japan's acts of aggression caused China to suffer heavy losses. The Chinese government should naturally make appropriate reparations claims based on the facts." Wang did not directly answer the reporter's question, clarifying the minimum percentage China is seeking. He stated: "Regarding the amount and methods of reparations, China has no fundamental differences with the United States and other Allied nations. All agree that Japan's military industry and equipment that could be converted into military industry must be dismantled and removed. At the same time, the Japanese economy can be established on a self-sufficient basis." The current issue needing research is how to make these two principles compatible. As for how to coordinate the reparations claims made by China and other related Allied nations and allocate them reasonably, that is a secondary matter. Wang stated: "China demands the restoration of sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands," but refused to answer whether to retain the military facilities of the U.S. military on the islands.

### China Should Account for the Largest Share of Japanese Reparations

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Regarding China's position on the issue of reparations from Japan, according to well-informed sources, the amount is "at least" 40%. Considering the example of France obtaining 52% of the total reparations from Germany after the last world war, some officials and members of the public believe that 40% is unfair. The war destroyed almost half of our country. Therefore, the relevant authorities in our country have not yet made a decisive announcement on this amount. China believes that both production equipment and products should be considered as part of the overall reparations and firmly insists that the fulfillment of reparations obligations must be guaranteed and enforced by the Allied supervisory body in Japan. As for the external claims and property of the Japanese government or people, if their nature is due to directly or indirectly pursuing their aggressive purposes, they should be unconditionally confiscated and have nothing to do with reparations. This is also the unanimous conclusion of experts from all sectors of society in our country.

### Principles for the Committee on Supply of Materials to Sell Materials

[Our Report] The Executive Yuan's Committee on Supply of Materials has decided on the following principles for the sale of materials in the future: 　Materials needed by government agencies will be supplied at low prices. 　The special contract distribution system will continue to be used for general consumer goods for the people's livelihood, and the selling prices will be discussed and agreed upon with reference to market prices at any time. 　In order to enable the industrial sector to benefit and prevent such materials from flowing into the hands of middlemen, the past auction methods need to be improved a lot. Relevant units are under orders to study detailed methods, which will be announced and implemented in the near future.

### First Monthly Meeting of the National Government: President Zhang Reports on the Principles of Governing Taiwan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The National Government held its first monthly meeting on the 1st. President Zhang attended the meeting and reported on his impressions of his inspection of Taiwan. He first described the geography and ethnicity of Taiwan, believing that they are all part of China. He also praised the national spirit of the Taiwan compatriots, believing that it is the result of the historical and cultural influence of China. In the future, if China wants to remain a great power and stand permanently in the world, it will also use the power of this historical culture as its foundation. As for Japan's construction in Taiwan, whether it is political, educational, or economic, it is only half-finished. The upper-level politics are all in the hands of the Japanese. In terms of education, Taiwanese people are not allowed to have profound literary, philosophical, or political thoughts, nor are they allowed to have profound scientific and technological skills, only allowed to study medicine more. In terms of economy, the Japanese are only responsible for guidance. In fact, its foundation is created by our Taiwanese compatriots. Zhang then spoke about the government's future policy on governing Taiwan. In terms of politics, utilize the existing foundation and pay attention to the relationship, and do not easily change it. In terms of education, give Taiwanese youth more opportunities to receive university education. In terms of economy, Taiwan's resources are not sufficient to establish a regional self-sufficient economy. Taiwan's economic plan must be coordinated with the national economic plan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Vice Minister Hua Gongchao recently made a statement on the issue of protecting overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, saying: There are about two million overseas Chinese living in the Dutch East Indies, most of whom are on the islands of Java and Sumatra. Since the conflict between the Dutch and Indonesian sides, the overseas Chinese in these two islands have been repeatedly burned, looted, and harmed by ordinary thugs. The Chinese government is very concerned and has repeatedly lodged serious protests and negotiations through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Indonesian-Dutch dispute is now awaiting mediation by a three-member committee organized by the United Nations Security Council. However, reports of damage to the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have not stopped. The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the Indonesian and Dutch sides will negotiate and agree to organize a mixed security team of Indonesian Chinese and Dutch Chinese in the Dutch-controlled areas, and organize a mixed security team of Indonesian Chinese and Dutch Chinese in the Indonesian-controlled areas, responsible for protecting the overseas Chinese and not taking hostile actions against either the Indonesian or Dutch side. As soon as the local area is stable, it will be revoked. We believe that this method is the best measure to protect overseas Chinese before the Indonesian and Dutch sides reach an agreement and we deeply hope that the Indonesian government and the Dutch government will understand and agree.

### Restrictions on Overseas Chinese Leaving the Country: The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Re-Presents

The main points are extracted as follows: (Continued on the left corner of page two)

### Sunday Forum: My Views on the Question of Academic Independence

— Fan Defen

In this time of war and social upheaval, the issue of academic independence has resurfaced on the crest of the era's waves. Its nature is complex, and its emergence is no accident. Since Mr. Hu Shih took the lead in advocating for it, the academic community has responded enthusiastically, expressing their opinions on the matter. This has not only broken the silence within academic circles, which rarely engage in discussions of concrete issues, but also represents a serious call for survival from the academic community in the face of danger. Although individuals may have differing opinions on the content of Mr. Hu's proposal, it is evident that this issue is indeed of great importance to national construction. It should be carefully considered with a wide range of perspectives gathered.

The author believes that all issues are inseparable from the context of the times and the environment. The discussion of this issue must first seek a clear understanding of the current era and environment in our country. China's eight years of resistance against Japan have left it devastated and exhausted, resulting in a major academic misfortune. This misfortune could have been hoped to be reversed with the victory of the war, first by patching up the leaks and then by turning weakness into strength. However, with the Communist Party's rebellion, the end of the war was followed by even more difficult years, which instead intensified the academic misfortune. The universities, claiming to be the highest institutions of learning, remained in the shape of refugee shelters; academic workers remained impoverished, busy with trivial matters all day long, lacking both sufficient time and a leisurely environment to study and pursue advanced knowledge, and also losing social dignity, almost reaching the end of their ropes. Academic undertakings, like other undertakings, are primarily entrusted to middle-aged individuals. These middle-aged people were devastated during the war, their academic achievements could not be advanced, and after the victory, they were unable to catch up quickly. Who will bear the responsibility for academic work? Therefore, "poverty" is indeed a severe factor in destroying academic pursuits.

Education during the Anti-Japanese War also had a peculiar phenomenon, that is, poverty on the one hand and expansion on the other. The number of universities and middle schools increased, and the number of students in each school also increased. This was indeed due to adapting to the environment of the Anti-Japanese War at that time, given the large number of students who fled from various provinces to the rear and the large number of schools that were displaced. It was necessary to adapt to the times and provide a place for a large number of young students to belong. However, it was inevitably greedy for more and emphasized quantity over quality, and thus flowed into crude and shoddy products, lowering standards, which is precisely the opposite of promoting culture and improving academics. The way to govern an army is to value quality over quantity; how about something as difficult and profound as academics? In the past, the number of scholars in our country was very small, but the emperors respected the worthy and society valued scholarship, so there were always people with profound academic knowledge. With our country's current poverty and weakness, if we only know to embellish progress by increasing the number of universities and middle schools, we will inevitably reduce the function of academics to improve upwards. Of course, when comparing the existing number with the rich and powerful countries in Europe and the United States, it is still far behind. But since everything is inferior to others, we should make fundamental plans, why compete for face in this superficial way for a while? If we want to eliminate illiteracy, then what should be developed and increased is only primary school education, and not necessarily universities. Moreover, social careers are not developed, the traditions of the old society's gentry are still strong, and a large number of university graduates are actually suffering from having no place to accommodate them. If things go wrong, it will only create batches of high-level idlers, who only want to get involved in the political arena, aggravating the situation of social unrest.

If the current situation continues to develop without correction, then the university will exist in name only and will no longer become a university. Mr. Hu Shih's proposal, though carrying the banner of academic independence, seems to be of a positive nature, but in reality, it is a passive way to save the day. His positive article is to specially develop several universities on a regular basis, but if viewed from the opposite side, it is equivalent to wanting to eliminate a number of universities. Because without development, it will only get worse and worse and be unable to survive; without elimination, there is no way to concentrate energy and enable the fittest to survive. It is necessary to rescue the excellent fit, and then stabilize them, and only with stability can there be development, and only with development can we embark on the road to academic independence. As for which universities are "fit" and which universities or departments should be first enriched and developed in China today, that is another question.

Time is still an important factor. It may take a long time to go from reorganizing universities to achieving academic independence. Taking this path is like walking on the road: if you want to walk fast, you have to get rid of the burden on your body. The current burdens on universities are not few. The administrative measures of a university are often controlled by a very small number of people. The vast majority of people are indifferent, and even if they are asked to participate, it is only a perfunctory decoration. Professors cannot feel that they are one with the school, they only feel that their position is unimportant. The president and professors are often thousands of miles apart. And except for a very few universities, professors are hired for one year at a time. The hiring of large-scale universities is mainly controlled by the department heads. The appointment committee becomes a formality, and it is only presented to them when new people are hired, and if there is a dismissal, it is not presented. If the department head is impartial and knows how to treat scholars with courtesy, there is nothing to say; if not, there is plenty of room for manipulation and exclusion. The president cannot help but support the department head, while the students are only bystanders. At this time of advancement and retreat, it is not necessary to take grades and scholarship as the standard, and the word fairness is not easy to talk about. Learning is a lifelong career, and if you cannot settle down like this, and have the heart of a temporary official, how can you expect success? Moreover, the administrative power of the school is also excessively centralized. Because the centralization is too excessive, the work undertaken is too heavy, lacks efficiency, and cannot be thorough, it has evolved into a state of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, neither dead nor alive, fragmented and disorganized. So, why can't the professors participate in the selection of university presidents, but only execute the orders of the education administration? Why are professors' appointment letters only exchanged once a year, instead of changing to a relatively longer period? Why not make appropriate allocation and adjustment of the school's administration and management? These questions must be considered in order to reform university education today.

In addition, there is another major issue, which is: which path should Chinese culture take? Because the so-called academic independence means that on the one hand, it can stand on its own feet in academic research and not rely on foreign support, and on the other hand, it has a central goal of its own, aiming at this goal and using academic efforts to build a new China. What kind of country should China become? Many people seem to have no concrete and clear concept even now. If we really want to become a democratic country, we must earnestly and thoroughly put in a lot of hard work to cleanse the old and inspire new opportunities. We must establish new systems and new evaluation standards in philosophy, morality, literature, art, jurisprudence, and political and social thought in order to lay the foundation for democratic politics. Even the natural sciences should cooperate in this effort. Many people seem to still cling to the doctrine of the mean, wanting to compromise Eastern and Western cultures and combine them into one, developing a new culture. In fact, the old Chinese culture and the democratic culture of Europe and the United States are two completely different systems. If they are forcibly merged, they will inevitably go in opposite directions, both sides will be hurt, and the entire society and people's livelihood will be plunged into a state of chaos and depression. The implementation of democratic politics also has its time factors, and must advance step by step and expand layer by layer. With the deep-rooted traditional forces of our old society, only limited democracy can be implemented at the beginning. Looking at the evolution of democratic politics in Britain and the United States, isn't it the same? If we implement universal politics as soon as we step out, and boast of implementing a "universal suffrage" system without discrimination, it is like taking a leap to jump high and jump far, which is like Mencius's saying of "fighting the people without teaching them," which will breed great hardships and troubles. If you feel that it is not easy to establish new things and it is difficult to remove old things, and you are emotionally attached to the past and cannot bear to part with it, then it is better to simply go back to the old road and restore our inherent authoritarian political state.

As for our desire to stand firm on our own feet in academics and not rely on foreign support, this is correct in theory. But before the ideal is realized and before we have stood firm, we can hardly abandon foreign help. This leads to a discussion of Mr. Hu Shih's proposal to abandon studying abroad. We believe that in terms of the issue itself, studying abroad is not contrary to the ideal of realizing academic independence. As for the problems that arise from studying abroad now, they may be due to the inadequacy and unsoundness of domestic universities, or due to the excessive looseness of the standards for studying abroad, or due to the inability to strictly manage and supervise, all of which are not fundamental problems. If it is said that the cost of studying abroad is too high now and the funding for universities is too low, and that we should transfer funds from one to the other to consolidate the fundamentals, then this is a realistic idea to solve the problem for the time being. Even if our academic independence is truly realized one day, the policy of studying abroad must be retained and maintained to a limited extent. However, research work should be promoted in domestic universities as early as possible, so that it can be coordinated with the situation of Chinese society, so that its results can be useful to Chinese society and have practical uses. Even the well-learned scholars who return from abroad can use it as a basis to continue to grow and increase, and not worry about having no place to use their talents.

### First Batch of Reparations Materials Shipped to China

(Continued from page one) Chinese representatives and qualified officials said; They are working hard to ship the first batch of reparations materials to China by the end of this month. According to their estimates, 9,447 pieces of reparations equipment were valued at 57,839,000 yen in 1939, when the foreign exchange rate of the yen was three to one US dollar. According to this calculation, the portion of the 30% of reparations materials transferred in advance that is allocated to China will be worth more than 19,279,800 US dollars, but the deteriorated parts of the materials and the consumption of many years of use should be excluded. At the same time, the other half of the 30% proposed for transfer (shared by the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and the Netherlands) consists of 3,207 machines and tools, worth a total of 59,542,852 yen. Among the three countries, the value of the portion obtained by the Netherlands ranks second, accounting for one-sixth of the total amount of 30% transferred in advance, including 3,126 machines worth 19,296,844 yen. The value of the portion obtained by the Philippines ranks last among the three countries, with a total of 19,103,471 yen, but the number of machines it obtained ranks first among the three countries, with a total of 3,270 pieces.

### Content of Mr. Chen Guofu's Address

(Continued from page one) This bank has developed very slowly in recent years, but there is a lack of talent and experience. If it expands too quickly, the foundation will be difficult to consolidate. In the future, we should take a steady approach. The work steps are divided into four stages: research, inspection, discussion, and experimentation. After this bank affairs meeting, each unit should correct shortcomings and promote advantages. This bank was established to support cooperative undertakings. All colleagues should adhere to the basic mission and have a long-term vision, and not be envious of ordinary banks for making money. Strengthen the guidance work. If there is no cooperative organization, guidance should be provided to establish one. After it is established, its progress should be promoted. If specialized cooperation can be developed, the deposit problem can be solved. For example, the total value of tobacco leaf production in Xuchang this year reached 220 million. If production, processing, and sales can all be done through cooperatives, not only can the deposit problem be solved, but also the people's livelihood can be improved. In the future, trust business should be mainly cooperative and should not be operated as ordinary trust business. The audit work must be strengthened. Enhance credit investigation work to avoid manipulation by local tyrants and evil gentry. Loans must be issued publicly. The employment of personnel and the expenditure of expenses should all be based on the principle of verifying and economizing to avoid waste.

### Northeast Electric Power Bureau: First Anniversary of Establishment. Still Many Worries and Difficulties Experienced

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang by This Newspaper on the 1st] The Northeast Electric Power Bureau is celebrating its first anniversary today. The same day is also the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Resources Committee. The development of Northeast Electric Power in the past year has been through many worries. Before May, based on the principle of water as the main and fire as the auxiliary, the power generation gradually increased and was able to maintain a considerable level. After May, due to the destruction of the Songfu ultra-high-voltage power line, the northern hydropower could not come south, so it was changed to fire as the main and water as the auxiliary. All thermal power generation equipment in the Northeast was mobilized to increase production. The western and southern borders of Liaoning relied solely on about 70,000 kilowatts of thermal power to maintain it. Currently, the power supply in Northeast China is about 120,000 kilowatts, 45,000 kilowatts of hydropower, and 75,000 kilowatts of thermal power, which is only half of the required amount, which has a significant impact on industrial and mining production. Currently, thermal power generation has reached its highest load. Only by making the Fengman power come south can the difficulty be resolved.

Restrictions on Overseas Chinese Emigration

(Continued from page 1) Overseas Chinese returning from British Malaya in Southeast Asia must possess local documents from 1937 onwards, such as a consulate passport, registration certificate, residency permit, birth certificate, return permit, or immigration bureau-approved entry permit, to be issued a certificate. For new arrivals, attention should be paid to the immigration bureau's population certificate and the consulate's certificate.

Returning Overseas Chinese from Burma, who intend to return to their original place of residence, are limited to those who have been approved by Mr. Yu Kan Mao, the representative of the Burmese government, and have been given a voucher. New arrivals must have a recent population certificate approved by the local government, otherwise, certification will be suspended.

Overseas Chinese at the Vietnamese border of French Indochina must still hold local documents from 1937 onwards, but tax payment receipts are also considered as one of the document. For new arrivals, without the local entry permit and the certification from Peking and Shanghai, certification must be temporarily suspended.

For Overseas Chinese at the Philippine border, visa applications to the Philippine consulate in Xiamen are temporarily limited to those who returned to China after 1941, hold appropriate local documents, and were born in the Philippines. Those who were sent back to China after the liberation of the Philippines will not be allowed to enter. Those who returned to China before 1941 will be dealt with later. As for new arrivals, without the local immigration bureau's entry permit, no certification will be provided.

Returning Overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies, with the approval of the local government, are limited to those that the area can accommodate, allowing 1,450 people from Fujian and Guangdong in China to return, but they must have valid local documents, such as a residence certificate, birth certificate, passport, or registration certificate, and have returned to China after the War of Resistance and have been registered and approved for repatriation by the United Relief Administration. Overseas Chinese merchants with higher status who return to the Dutch East Indies at their own expense can also apply, but whether they can leave the country depends on whether the Dutch consulate is willing to issue a visa. As for new arrivals, due to the ongoing war in the area, departure is temporarily suspended.

Due to food and housing problems in European countries, both new and old arrivals are not welcome, so except for those approved for entry by the local government and holding recently issued credentials, they should not be certified.

During the current Allied control era in Japan, both new and old arrivals are temporarily suspended from entering.

In the United States, apart from quota immigrants with other regulations, which should be submitted to the association for review, only officials, merchants (import and export traders), teachers, pastors, and students can apply to go to the United States, but they must have valid identification documents. Ordinary tourists are temporarily suspended from entering at this time. In addition, old arrivals returning to the United States must have a valid passport or entry permit, birth certificate, or a letter from our consulate general approved by the local immigration bureau.

The Canadian government, recognizing its sparse population, finds it necessary to increase it significantly, and is now amending the immigration law to relax restrictions on the entry of Europeans. Wives and children under the age of eighteen of Chinese nationals who have joined Canadian citizenship can be allowed to enter, but they must have valid documents.

The various countries of Central and South America have very strict restrictions on the entry of Overseas Chinese. Certification should not be given casually unless they hold valid local documents.

From this year onward, Siam originally allowed 10,000 Chinese immigrants to enter, but due to different views on the criteria for new and old arrivals, the local immigration bureau claims that "the quota of 10,000 people this year has been exceeded," resulting in the detention of more than 500 people. Negotiations are currently underway. Before this case is resolved, all new arrivals should be temporarily suspended from leaving the country. Old arrivals must hold local documents that are less than one year old. Only those that are currently valid can be certified. Further notice will be given when the issue of new and old arrivals is resolved.

### U.S. Proposes to the United Nations: Partition of the Holy Land by Next July; UN to Appoint Personnel to Supervise During Transition; British Forces Temporarily Responsible for Maintaining Local Law and Order

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 1st Broadcast: Sources from the British government say that Britain will support the U.S. proposal for the partition of Palestine. The problem lies in whether the U.S. can get both the Jewish and Arab communities to accept it.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 31st Dispatch] The U.S. proposed today the partition of Palestine, to be implemented starting July 1, 1948. After attending a closed meeting of the UN General Assembly's Palestine Committee's partition subcommittee, U.S. Representative Johnson announced at a press conference that he had submitted the previous proposal to the partition subcommittee. He also said that other points of the U.S. proposal are: The UN General Assembly appoints a three-member committee to supervise the transition period from now until July; During the transition period, British forces are responsible for maintaining law and order in the Holy Land; The Jewish and Arab communities should have the opportunity to organize "shadow governments" during the transition period, with the power to recruit and equip their security forces; The U.S. automatically abandons the previously proposed establishment of a voluntary police force; The proposed UN three-member committee is under the jurisdiction of the UN General Assembly. Observers point out that the U.S.'s actions today represent a radical change from its previous attitude. The U.S. previously advocated raising an international volunteer army to prevent the anarchy that might occur before and after the withdrawal of British forces. Now, the U.S. proposes allowing British forces to be responsible for maintaining internal security in Palestine during the transition period.

Johnson also stated at the press conference that this U.S. proposal is intended to give Britain time to withdraw, and to make it unnecessary to implement the two-year trusteeship system transition method recommended in the UN Palestine Investigation Committee report. The three-member committee supervising the transition period will be led by a high commissioner appointed by the UN General Assembly, who will cooperate with the British authorities and Jewish and Arab leaders in an advisory capacity. Since the three-member committee is under the jurisdiction of the UN General Assembly, its members have the powers that the agency should have. However, when situations that disrupt peace or may endanger peace occur, the three-member committee will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Security Council. The U.S. also proposed that after the UN General Assembly passes the partition of Palestine by a two-thirds majority, the Jewish and Arab communities will begin to organize "shadow governments," draft constitutions, prepare detailed rules and methods for establishing a Jewish-Arab economic alliance, train administrative personnel, and recruit security forces.

Chiang then considered the views of the Dutch representative, and immediately made some amendments to the U.S. resolution, and said that the U.S. resolution was quite capable of dealing with the situation in a realistic way.

In addition, the U.S. government may sign separate agreements with each country to ensure that U.S. goods are used for their designated purposes. European countries should also try to reduce tariffs and currency restrictions that hinder free trade.

### A Secret Introduction to the Intrigues of the Four Powers: "Speaking Frankly" by Byrnes

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Correspondent in New York] October 15th, former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes (see picture) dropped an atomic bomb on the diplomats of the Four Powers, revealing insider news about the Four Powers' foreign policies! All the diplomatic secrets from the Yalta to Potsdam Conferences, as well as the First London Conference, the First Moscow Conference, the First Paris Conference, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference last December, are all revealed in his "Speaking Frankly," which was published today. The book has a total of 316 pages, divided into five sections, with four paragraphs in each section. The table of contents is as follows: The Awareness and Responsibility of the Crisis; Yalta—The Climax of Unity of the Three Powers; The Situation Begins to Change; Potsdam—Failure at the Brink of Success; Frustration in London; The Moscow Conference Reaches a Stalemate; One London Conference, Two Paris Conferences; The Paris Peace Conference and the New York Peace Conference; Central Europe—A Severe Test; A Course of Action; Moving Towards Peace in Asia; Establishing a People's Foreign Policy; Control of Atomic Energy; What is the Soviet Union Pursuing? Where Do We Go From Here?

The final section of the third part, "Moving Towards Peace in Asia," discusses China. In the opening sentence, Byrnes wrote in a straightforward manner: "We must not forget that the Second World War broke out in the Pacific." This sentence explains the importance of Asia in the current critical situation. He went on to say: If we believe that Europe may become the tinderbox of a world war, then we must regard Asia as a very large flame.

Regarding China, Byrnes wrote: "China is still far from peace; all that can be said is that China is on the verge of great change, and we should encourage and assist this change within the realm of possibility. China needs our technical assistance, but China should bear the responsibility for implementation in order to achieve success."

Byrnes also said that China's importance is not only understood by the United States, but also by the Soviet Union. In this regard, he revealed the Soviet Union's intentions towards China. He proved that at the Yalta Conference, Stalin stated that the price of the Soviet Union's participation in the war was the joint management of the two major railways in Northeast China, turning Dalian into a free port, and establishing a naval base in Lushun. In addition, at various conferences, Molotov raised the same question: "What exactly are the U.S.'s intentions in China?" Molotov also requested that the U.S. and the Soviet Union withdraw from China at the same time. Byrnes replied that the U.S. military's presence in China was to assist in the evacuation of the Japanese, but this response did not satisfy Molotov.

Byrnes also described his unsuccessful discussions with Molotov, followed by a direct meeting with Stalin. Regarding this, Byrnes said: "I told Stalin that Chairman Chiang's government is the only possible government in China. The Chinese Communist Party is not a true communist party." Stalin acknowledged in his response that the Nationalist government was the legitimate government. The most interesting thing was that Stalin believed that Mao Zedong exaggerated the strength of the Communist army too much. When Byrnes told him that Mao Zedong boasted of having 600,000 troops in the Tianjin area, Stalin couldn't help but laugh a few times.

Byrnes's view on Asia is as follows: "The security of the United States itself and world peace depend on the progress of Asia."

In the preface, the publisher praised Byrnes's efforts for peace. According to him: "In the two years since the victory over Germany, Byrnes has fought for peace with unremitting efforts. He traveled a total of 77,000 miles, and he participated in a total of eight major conferences from January 1945 to October 1946, namely: The Yalta Three-Power Conference from January 22 to February 12, 1945; The Potsdam Conference from July 6 to August 7; The London Foreign Ministers' Conference from September 4 to October 8; The Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference from December 12 to 29; The United Nations General Assembly held in London from January 7 to 25, 1946; The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference from April 23 to May 18 of the same year; The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference from June 13 to July 14 of the same year; The 21-Nation Peace Conference from July 27 to October 17 of the same year."

### The Senate Assembly Concludes Successfully: Recovering Payments for Electricity and Other Services, Refund of Already Paid Amounts Requested, Moderate Reduction of the Price Limit for Frugal Banquets, Relaxation of Restrictions on the Use of Automobiles

[Our Newspaper's Report] The fourth session of the Municipal Senate Council held its tenth and eleventh meetings yesterday morning and afternoon, respectively. By 7:30 PM, discussions on all motions had concluded, and the closing ceremony was held. Speaker Pan delivered a speech, stating that there were two important motions in the assembly. One was the city's general budget for fiscal year 37, which was passed after review and reporting, with the city government increasing revenue and decreasing expenditures. He said that the city government's organizational structure should be submitted to the central government for approval as soon as possible so that the budget has a real basis. If the central government insists on cutting down the city government's institutions and refuses to amend the regulations, the Municipal Senate Council can only ask the city government to act in accordance with the regulations. The other important motion was the draft contract with the Joint Power Company. The enthusiastic emotions during the discussion fully demonstrated the spirit of the local council. The assembly has now decided to organize a special review committee to continue the research, hoping for careful handling to establish a model for how to use foreign investment. Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Shen Zonglian, delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Wu, believing that this assembly has achieved much. He also expressed admiration for the senators' tireless pursuit of details when discussing the above two cases and stated that the city government will definitely implement the resolutions carefully. Tao Baichuan delivered a reply on behalf of all senators, comparing the senators to mirrors that reflect public opinion, saying that they have not distorted anything, but still hope that the press and voters can wipe them clean from time to time. Tao also hoped that the upcoming National Congress representatives, legislators, and supervisors will become telescopes and microscopes, saying that with mutual cooperation, not only can Shanghai become an ideal city, but China can also become a new China. He hoped that voters will vote carefully. After the speech, the fourth assembly ended in enthusiastic applause. At 8:00 PM, the successful closing was announced amidst music.

The Senate Assembly passed many important temporary proposals yesterday. The main ones are: The price increase date for electricity, telephone, and heating services in public utilities should be changed to the date of promulgation (October 21). If citizens have already paid the amounts collected by each company from October 1, the company should deduct them from the next bill. Please ask the Public Works Bureau to complete the Hengfeng Road Bridge project as soon as possible to facilitate traffic. Please ask the Public Utilities Bureau to consider installing more street lights in the Zhabei District. The price limit for frugal banquets is too high and does not meet the original purpose of frugality. Please ask the city government to reduce it appropriately. Please ask the municipal government to recover the Sino-French School, French Primary School, and French Naval Club buildings established by the former French Municipal Council and use them for cultural undertakings in this city. The case will be submitted to the Education and Land Administration Committees for joint review. The case of establishing a health sub-office in Qibao Town, Longhua District, will be submitted to the Health Committee for review. The British-owned Shanghai Gas Company arbitrarily sets limits on industrial gas usage and imposes arbitrary fines. Please ask the Public Utilities Bureau to order the company to re-establish reasonable limits. The joint distribution of cotton yarn does not help stabilize prices and harms the people's livelihood and economy. It is recommended that the central government revise the method. When revising, please allow representatives from the Senate Assembly and relevant groups to attend and state their opinions.

### Letter Requesting the Municipal Government to Temporarily Unseal Daily Necessities

The Tian Senate Council immediately sent a letter to the Municipal Government, stating that the crackdown on hoarding of daily necessities should strictly follow the steps prescribed in the regulations promulgated by the National Government. Before following the steps prescribed in the promulgated regulations, all revoked account books should be returned, sealed goods should be temporarily unsealed, and economic inspections of the industry should be temporarily suspended. Those who handle the case will be dealt with according to the law. For informants who make false accusations out of spite, they should be punished according to Article 20 of the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding.

Civilian houses in Wusong District were occupied by troops and military dependents. The Municipal Government was requested to forward the information to the Garrison Headquarters to order the relocation. It is suggested that the central government should supplement and relax Article 3 of the Measures for Restricting the Use of Automobiles by Private Individuals. Lawyers, accountants, architects, technicians, and public officials such as senators who are legally registered should be allowed to use automobiles for business and official needs. Private hospitals, schools, and legal entities such as various public associations, trade unions, and charitable organizations that are legally registered should be allowed to use automobiles with relaxed restrictions. All private automobiles should be allowed to be transferred to any private individual or private legal entity.

### The Budget for Fiscal Year 37: Total Revenue Increased to One Trillion, Expenditures Should Be Reduced as Much as Possible, and No New Taxes Should Be Added

[Our Newspaper's Report] The general budget for revenue and expenditure in Shanghai for fiscal year 37 has been resolved by the eleventh meeting of the fourth session of the Municipal Senate Council yesterday afternoon. The total revenue has increased to 1,092,046,924,574 yuan. According to the city's population, the average burden per person is about 278,000 yuan. Expenditures should be reduced as much as possible to meet the purpose of living within one's means and seeking a balance between revenue and expenditure. The Assembly resolved the following three measures for the budget proposal: The budget should be approved in principle according to the review opinions of the Budget Committee and sent to the Municipal Government to recompile it based on the points indicated. The Municipal Government's competent bureaus should reduce various expenses, which should be coordinated by the Municipal Government. The organizational regulations of the Municipal Government should be submitted to the central government for approval as soon as possible (because the number of employees has not been approved, there is no basis for expenses).

Open Up New Sources of Revenue and Reduce Expenditures, While Considering Both

In order to review the budget proposal submitted by the Municipal Government, the Municipal Senate Council specially extended the meeting for one month on September 30. During the extension period, the Budget Committee successively invited the heads of various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government, the accounting personnel in charge, and representatives of the small committees of the Senate Council to jointly review each item of revenue and expenditure in detail. The original budget for revenue and expenditure was 985,517,924,574 yuan, but due to the adjustment of salaries for public teachers and staff in October of this year, which increased by 125%, an additional 30 billion yuan is required each month, and 360 billion yuan per year. The budget is already short of 140 billion yuan, and there will be several more adjustments throughout the entire year of 37, so revenue is not sufficient to cover expenditures. Under the principle of legality and rationality, we will slightly open up new sources of revenue and reduce expenditures to seek to increase treasury revenue and tighten expenditures. In terms of opening up new sources of revenue, we will effectively rectify the city's public undertakings so that public operations are enterprise-oriented. In terms of reducing expenditures, we should still cut down redundant institutions and save unnecessary expenses. After negotiation, the revenue department has increased by a total of 106,529,000,000 yuan, of which the most increased are the surpluses of public transportation companies, land value tax, business tax, and slaughter tax. The expenditure department should be reduced as much as possible, and redundant institutions should be cut down to save expenses.

Eliminate Embezzlement, Sell Public Land

When the expenditure on constructive undertakings and the salaries of staff and workers for fiscal year 37 need to be increased due to the increase in prices and the adjustment of salaries, the Senate Council believes that citizens have already shouldered more than one trillion in expenses and that no new taxes should be added for the resulting difference between revenue and expenditure. In addition to rectifying public undertakings to increase surpluses, the following two measures should also be taken: The Finance Bureau and other bureaus should effectively supervise the tax collection personnel and those who collect various fees to eliminate embezzlement and prevent tax evasion. When necessary, sell municipal land with smaller usable value.

### A Monthly Meeting Held Before the General Assembly

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning, before the tenth session of the fourth assembly of the Military Service Association of the Municipal Senate Council, a joint monthly meeting was held with the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Senate Council, presided over by Speaker Pan. After the meeting, the tenth meeting of the Municipal Senate Council immediately began.

### The Joint Power Contract Approved in Principle, Some Clauses Still Need to Be Revised, and a Special Review Committee Will Study It

[Our Newspaper's Report] The draft contract for the operating rights of the Joint Power Company was reviewed and revised by the joint meeting of the Public Utilities and Legal Affairs Groups. It was discussed in detail at the General Assembly yesterday. Because this case is the beginning of Sino-foreign joint ventures, the senators attached great importance to it and expressed their opinions. Feng Youzhen gave an impassioned speech, emphasizing his ten reasons for opposition: Clause 3 of the draft states that within this area, except for participating companies, the government will not undertake it itself, nor will it allow other public or private institutions to obtain, enjoy, or operate the undertakings or similar undertakings of the Joint Power Company as stipulated in this contract. This is actually an act of trust. No one in the country will agree to a trust organization. Clause 6 of the draft states that the government hereby agrees that the Joint Power Company only needs to pay land and building taxes that are currently in effect in this area. Regardless of now or in the future, no other types of taxes will be levied or collected on any other type of property of the company. This is an excessive privilege and should not be tax-exempt. Furthermore, Clause 7 states that the company has the right to determine the electricity rates it deems appropriate at its own discretion. This is fundamentally absurd. Electricity rates are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood and should be restricted. The percentage of net profit stated in Clause 7 of the draft is too high. If it is discovered that the foreign company does not fulfill the contract, what will be done? Clause 9 of the draft states that after the Joint Power Company requests it, the government should requisition the land it needs for the purposes of this contract. If this is implemented, can the company arbitrarily requisition the land it needs? Clause 10 states that this contract may be assigned to the Joint Power Company without the government's approval, which is actually contempt for our government. I dare not agree with the opinion stated in Clause 10 of the draft that if the Joint Power Company issues corporate bonds and mortgages its property, including this contract, as collateral, all holders of corporate bonds will not be subject to nationality restrictions. Clause 13 states that if there is a disagreement between the two parties, the president of the International Court of Justice should be asked to appoint an arbitrator. Although the review has changed it to authorize the president of the British (third country) Electrical Engineers Association to appoint an arbitrator who is not of Chinese or American nationality, a Chinese company should abide by Chinese law and cannot request arbitration, and should be fully protected and bound by the Chinese court. The 30-year term stipulated in the contract is too long. China has no reason to provide the company with the foreign exchange it needs for the purposes of this contract.

### Precious Opportunity, Pity to Miss

Senators Huang Shusheng and others then spoke enthusiastically. Senator Fei even suggested that this case be reserved for the next assembly. Director Zhao Zengjue immediately took the stage to report that if the contract is established, the company can borrow money from the United States. The United States is currently very interested in this loan, which would be a pity to miss. Senator Tao Baichuan continued, saying that the city urgently needs to increase electricity. The establishment of the Joint Power Company can also give the city the opportunity to obtain priority compensation for electrical machinery. Therefore, he suggested that the assembly establish a special review committee to review the case. If an agreement cannot be reached, the chairman can convene a temporary assembly to discuss it.

### Four Measures Finally Passed

Finally, the Assembly voted to pass four measures: The draft contract for the operating rights of the Joint Power Company was generally approved according to the amendments already proposed by the review meeting. The clauses in this contract that still need to be considered will be discussed and revised by a special review committee in conjunction with the Municipal Government within half a month and sent back to the Municipal Government to be submitted to the National Government for approval. If the special review committee cannot reach a resolution, the speaker may convene a temporary assembly to decide. When the special committee reviews the case, other senators may also voluntarily participate in the discussion, and those who participate in the discussion will also have the right to vote. The Assembly appointed 37 members to the special committee, including Chuan Ruilin, Tao Baichuan, and Tang Shichang, to be convened by Fu Ruilin, Tao Baichuan, and Feng Youzhen.

### Fire on Military Industry Road: China Agricultural Machinery Company, Oil Pipeline Explosion, Four Dead and Injured

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 2:30 PM yesterday, the oil pipeline of the diesel pool in the blacksmith's workshop of the China Agricultural Machinery Company on Jiangwan Military Industry Road suddenly exploded due to excessive heat from burning. In addition to some factory buildings and more than a dozen barrels of diesel being burned, two workers, Zhang Shengquan and Wang Fuxing, were buried in the fire, and three other workers, He Xinwei, Shen Longsheng, and Zhang Yongxin, were burned and sent to Jimin Hospital for treatment. The iron-smelting section was also burned. Fortunately, the company had its own fire-fighting equipment, and the fire was extinguished after an hour and a half of firefighting. It is said that the losses were severe.

### Building a Peace God Memorial Tower on the Bund Requires More Than 2 Billion Yuan

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Peace God Statue of the European War Memorial on the Bund in this city was demolished by the Japanese invaders during the fall of Chongqing. After the victory, the Municipal Senate Council resolved to rebuild the memorial tower for the Zhaohe Battleship Uprising at the original site. David Tweedie, the president of the British Joint Services Association, sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting the reconstruction of the European War Memorial. The Municipal Government drafted a win-win solution and sent it to the Senate Council. The speaker submitted it to the General Assembly yesterday morning for discussion and approval. The solution stipulates that the European War Memorial will be rebuilt at the original site according to the proposal of the British Joint Services Association. The entire project is estimated to cost about 1.4 billion yuan according to the market price in June. The Municipal Government will advocate the organization of a committee to unite overseas Chinese of various countries in Shanghai to work together to raise funds, and the Municipal Government will bear a portion to show its advocacy. In addition, the Zhaohe Battleship Uprising Memorial Tower will be built in front of Huangpu Park at the intersection of the Bund and Beijing East Road to echo the Peace God Statue at the intersection of Zhongzheng Road. The design of the memorial tower has been determined to be a circular base with a triangular concave shape built on the steps. The tower column will be 11 meters from the ground to the top of the tower. The memorial tablet characters will be engraved on three sides of the tower column, and the memorial text will be engraved on three sides of the tower house. A wreath of anchors will be set on each of the three sides of the base to represent the symbol of the Zhaohe Battleship. It is estimated to cost about 700 million yuan, which will be borne by the municipal treasury in principle.

### A Temporary Motion to Handle the General Election Carefully Was Passed

[Our Newspaper's Report] The temporary motion of Senators Ma Junshuo and Zhou Lianze, "Regarding the handling of the general election, the government should be particularly careful to establish a democratic atmosphere and thoroughly prevent illegal contracting and coercion and inducement, so as to emphasize the basic rights of the people and lay the foundation for constitutional government," included three measures: Various elections should focus on talent. All candidates should compete fairly according to the law and thoroughly prevent illegal contracting, threats, inducements, and other behaviors that hinder elections or order. The total amount of various election ballots printed and the number of units distributed should be truthfully announced in the newspaper by the election office to show great credibility. The freedom of voters to vote freely in the election should be guaranteed. In the polling place, in addition to the police officers assigned to duty, military police and other personnel are prohibited from staying. After the Assembly decided, it was unanimously passed.

### Unjust Imprisonment Compensation Will Be Discussed, Release of Traitors Will Be Handled Seriously, Justice Minister Xie Guansheng Says

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, a reporter consulted Xie Guansheng, the Minister of Justice of the Judicial Administration Department, who came to Shanghai on legal issues. He said: The Ministry is also paying close attention to the suggestion on unjust imprisonment compensation recently passed by the Shanghai Municipal Senate Council. Specific measures have been drafted and will be submitted for discussion at the National Judicial Administration Conference to be opened on the 5th. There are two points that must be resolved in this matter: 1. Formulate a compensation law, 2. Determine the compensation budget, because any discussion of compensation involves economic issues. The issue of releasing traitors on parole will be handled in accordance with Article 77 of the Ordinary Criminal Law, but it must be more serious and meticulous. The appeal of the families of traitors for amnesty when the constitution is implemented is an order from the Central Government and is beyond the power of the Ministry. The Shanghai District Court and District Procuratorate will find an office building. There is already progress, and it will be realized soon. The District Court and District Procuratorate will work together.

### Various Motions Ratified and Passed

In addition, during the adjournment of the Third Assembly of the Senate Council, important motions resolved by various committees, except for the resolutions of the Budget Committee, which were of a special nature and were submitted to the General Assembly for ratification in a separate case, 124 other important resolutions of various committees were submitted to the General Assembly for ratification yesterday afternoon and were resolved and passed.

### Discussion on Winter Relief Funds, Passage of Charitable Horse Race, Plus Soccer Tournament and Fundraising

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Winter Relief Committee proposed the following three measures to raise winter relief funds: Issue refugee relief lottery tickets, add 20% entertainment tax, and hold a charitable horse race, and submitted them to the Senate Council for discussion. Speaker Pan handed it over to the tenth meeting of the Fourth Assembly for public decision. After an hour and a half of heated discussion, it was resolved that: The first item of the original measure should be deleted, the second item of the original measure is feasible in principle, and entertainment businesses should collect donations by proxy, with the amount equivalent to 20% of the original price, and limited to the four months of the winter relief period. Regarding the third item of the original measure, according to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, it should be submitted to the central government for approval by the municipal government before it can be held, and the name is set as "Winter Relief Charitable Horse Race" and designated for winter relief expenses. Add the fourth item of the measure as "Hold a winter relief charitable soccer tournament." Add the fifth item of the measure as "Launch fundraising from all walks of life," and so on.

### 200,000 Refugees in Danger

Before the case was discussed, Wu Kaixian, Deputy Director of the Winter Relief Committee and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, first reported the reasons for the proposal, saying that this year, the city has ten times more refugees than last year, reaching 200,000. With the approaching cold winter, they lack food and clothing and their lives are in danger. The Winter Relief Committee has decided to start receiving and providing relief from November 16, holding work relief, setting up shelters, and providing porridge and clothing. It is planned to raise 60 billion yuan as expenses. Because the business community has already donated several hundred billion yuan in recent years, they may not be able to bear the burden, so it is planned to adopt three methods such as horse racing. However, when Director Zhang Jinjing went to Nanjing to discuss the issuance of relief lottery tickets, he stated that someone had proposed issuing national charitable lottery tickets for the relief of floods in various parts of Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, and northern Sichuan, but it was not approved by the Political Affairs Conference, and he was instructed to think of other methods. Therefore, the method of issuing lottery tickets is withdrawn today, and other items are requested for discussion by the senators.

After Director Wu's report, the senators spoke enthusiastically. Zhang Zhongyuan, Wang Xianqing, and others supported the charitable horse race. Fei Shusheng opposed it, believing that the First Assembly resolved to oppose horse racing, and now it is difficult to justify opening it up.

### Read Out the Clauses on Illegal Issues

Ma Junshuo believes that although horse racing is crowned with the word "charitable," it is still illegal. If the Senate Council supports horse racing, it will help the government violate the law, and the people can sue the government for gambling. In order to provide a basis for discussion, Speaker Pan read out the Judicial Yuan's interpretation of whether horse racing is illegal, believing that issuing lottery tickets is not necessarily a crime. According to Article 269 of the Criminal Law, issuing lottery tickets without the government's permission constitutes a gambling crime. The lottery draw for this horse race was proposed by the government and will be submitted to the central government for approval after being passed by the Senate Council, so it does not conflict with the Criminal Law. Zhu Wende supplemented Speaker Pan's interpretation of Article 269 of the Criminal Law, saying that issuing lottery tickets for profit is illegal. Relief is not for profit, so it is not illegal. Zhu Fuqiu suggested that the additional entertainment tax be increased from 20% to 50% and that a charitable soccer tournament be held. There were many other senators who wanted to speak, but because there was not enough time, it was submitted for a vote. Before the vote, Speaker Pan read out the Judicial Yuan's interpretation of whether horse racing is gambling again to show seriousness. Finally, the method of raising winter relief funds was passed by a show of hands as before.

### Workers in the Machinery Industry Send Representatives to Petition

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Industrial Union of the Machinery Manufacturing Industry in the Fourth District, because the capital of Shenchang Yangxing dismissed three workers' representatives and workers for reasons, and also planned to dismiss 79 workers, sent five representatives to the Senate Council to petition yesterday. Senator Zhou Xuexiang and Senator Yan Esheng were appointed by the Assembly to receive them and decided to request the Assembly to send a letter to the Municipal Government to stop Shenchang Yangxing from arbitrarily dismissing 79 workers during the general mobilization. As for the dismissal of three workers, Shao Renquan, etc., and the issue of severance pay, they will be handled in accordance with the legal procedures.

### Public Land on Shandong South Road Investigated for Property Rights and Allocated for School Construction

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Assembly amended and passed the review opinion on the mayor's policy report yesterday and discussed the cases submitted by Speaker Pan: Passed the Shanghai Municipal Government's measures for issuing national identity cards and raised the standard for collecting the cost of materials from 100 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Send a letter to the Shanghai Safety Promotion Association to find a way to subsidize the police as soon as possible so that they can serve with peace of mind. The Huangpu District People's Congress requested that the public land behind the Huangpu Police Sub-bureau on Shandong South Road be allocated for the construction of a school to celebrate birthdays and the site of the district office. It was resolved to investigate the property rights. If there is no problem, please ask the Municipal Government to designate and approve the allocation. The Municipal Government's bureaus and branches are included in the district office, which is difficult to implement. The South House submitted a request for reconsideration, and it was resolved to submit it to the Regulations and Autonomy Committees for joint review and then to the Assembly for discussion.

### A New Branch Arises in the Case of Carrying Coffins to Dispute Housing

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tang Yurang, the owner of the May 30th Socks Factory at No. 190 Wuzhou Road, accused the landlord Sun Huayin, his wife Sun Fang, and his son Sun Shuihe of forcing him to move out unsuccessfully. He carried 11 coffins and a toilet to block the May 30th store and obstruct business. The District Court sentenced Sun Huayin to four months in prison, Sun Fang and Sun Shuihe to two months in prison, and all three were given a two-year suspended sentence. The case had originally subsided. However, yesterday, the Enemy Property Clearance Office of the China Trust Bureau suddenly sent a letter to the District Court stating that the house at this number belonged to the property of the Japanese Shanghai Real Estate Co., Ltd. It has been taken over by the office and stipulated that before it is sold, the original residents may be temporarily allowed to keep and use it and pay usage fees on a monthly basis. All residents had been informed of this on record. Now Sun Huayin has sublet the roof of the house to Tang without authorization, which violates the regulations and should be recovered. In addition to sending letters to Sun and Tang, each limited to returning the house within ten days of the arrival of the letter, the District Court was also requested to check and deal with the matter.

### Xu Youzu Approved to Resign, Police Bureau Increases Business Section

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Youzu, the chief of the Economic Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, has made great achievements since he was responsible for economic inspection work. Recently, due to overwork and weakness, he repeatedly requested to resign. Director Yu approved it and transferred him to be a specialist. At the same time, the Municipal Police Bureau believed that the business under the jurisdiction of the Economic Section was extremely busy. In order to strengthen administrative efficiency, the economy and business were separated, and a business section was added to the original Economic Section. Cao Maoliang, who had served as a professor at the Business School, was appointed as the chief of the Economic Section, with five control units under his command: finance, cotton yarn, fuel, food, and daily necessities.

### Yang Anren and Zhan Liansheng's Request for Retrial Rejected

[Report from our Newspaper] Yang Anren, the main culprit in the Jin Chao case and former Deputy Director of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, and Zhan Liansheng, Chairman of the Gold Industry Association, were sentenced to seven and four years in prison respectively by the High Court for corruption. Both Yang and Zhan were not satisfied and requested a retrial from the High Court. The High Court ruled to return the case to the District Court for retrial. Judge Cao Zuwei of the District Court ruled: "The request for retrial is rejected." The main reason is that after a case is judged according to the Special Criminal Procedure Law, if important evidence that could affect the judgment is not considered, and it is considered to have a major error, it is justifiable to request a retrial, regardless of the defendant's benefit. However, after careful investigation of the points raised by the retrial applicants as not being considered, most are inappropriate, and it is difficult to consider them reasonable, so the request is rejected.

### Fisheries Management Office and Private Fishing Industry Negotiate Sales in Fishing Market to Agree on Methods

Since the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Relief Fishing Vessels have been operated by the Free Fisheries Management Office, their scope has gradually expanded. By October of this year, the amount of fresh fish sold in Shanghai accounted for almost 60% of the total revenue of private fishing vessels, causing a backlash from various private fishing companies, which believed that it hindered the development of the national fishing industry. They jointly requested the fish market to refuse to unload the office's fish cargo in an attempt to resist it. They have been in a stalemate for many days, resulting in the fish market's failure to open the auction of the fishing vessels' cargo as usual yesterday, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. It is now learned that the fish market authorities, seeing that the situation was deadlocked and both sides were suffering losses, convened a consultation. Starting today, all the fishing vessels of the Fisheries Management Office that have arrived in port, except for one with better quality goods, which will be refrigerated by the office itself, the other vessels with long-arrived and lower quality goods, due to the inability to refrigerate, will continue to unload with the cargo of fishing vessels of various private companies as usual and be auctioned as usual.

### Journey to Northern Jiangsu - Victory Heard in Dongtai

[Report from our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, October 31st] This year, autumn arrived with high skies and refreshing air, and the weather was normal. The vast cotton fields of Northern Jiangsu all reported good harvests. However, Dongtai, which is known for producing the best cotton in Northern Jiangsu, still has most of its cotton fields in the hands of bandits. The Da Zhong Group Township in the Ninth District of Dongtai is a cotton-producing area known for fine-staple cotton, while the Chouhu in the Fifth District and the Jitong Townships in the Seventh District are vast coarse-staple cotton producing areas. These areas have now become the bases for the bandit army in Dongtai. The Zishi County government of the bandit army and the command post of the Dongtai Border Region are located within the Chouhu jurisdiction. Furthermore, in the Zhoujia Duo (approximately 40 li southeast of the county seat), which has been occupied by the bandit army for nearly ten years, there are also small-scale arsenals, clothing factories, spinning mills, various military industrial facilities, and warehouses storing cotton, food, and various materials looted from the southeastern and southwestern townships of Dongtai County. The townships under the jurisdiction of Chouhu District are no more than 70 li away from the city, yet the bandit army has established such a stronghold in the small Zhoujia Duo. According to reports from various sources in Dongtai, the armed forces relied on by this bandit stronghold include two regiments and some militia, namely the so-called Zishi Independent Regiment and the Zishi New Regiment. The former has been described with terms such as "ferocious" and "elite" in official documents of the First Pacification Zone Command and the former Taidong Rusan counties.

### The End of the Bandit's Old Nest

October 25th was two days before the first anniversary of the recapture of Dongtai County. The reporter happened to arrive in the area via the Zhenjiang-Yangtai Highway. On the day after the reporter arrived in the county seat (October 26th), Major General Zhang Qiaoliu, Deputy Brigade Commander of the "6615" Unit stationed in Dongtai, personally led his elite and brave Iron Light troops to suppress the ferocious bandits entrenched in the Chouhu of the Fifth District of the county, the so-called Zishi Independent Regiment. After 36 hours of pursuit and combat, they captured their old nest, Zhoujia Duo, in one fell swoop. On the same day, they searched and suppressed village by village, and successively recovered more than ten important strongholds, including Chouhu, Shijiaxi, Shenjiaduo Hougang, Baidian, and Guanzhuang. In this campaign, Dongtai County Magistrate Li Xiafu, County Council Secretary Zhang Bishui, and the heads of districts, townships, and villages who had been exiled also joined the army and entered this newly recovered area to comfort the refugees and manage the aftermath. On the 29th, the news of the victory spread, and everyone was overjoyed. Every family hung flags. The heavy hearts of the people of Dongtai, who had survived nearly a hundred disasters, seemed to lighten by half. A childhood classmate who was accustomed to preaching sent me a copy of the Iron Light Society's victory report and wrote the eight characters "The calamity of the years has ended in Dongtai" on the back. In fact, in the eyes of General Xue Zhongshu, the commander of the unit who had more than ten years of experience in suppressing bandits and was prudent and pragmatic, this was only a small victory. The facts are provided below to illustrate this point.

### Counting the Spoils of War in Front of Thatched Sheds

It has been two years since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and the recapture of Dongtai County has just reached its first anniversary. However, in this not-too-long and not-too-short year, only the people in the county seat and a few townships have been slowly chewing on the bitter fruit of victory, not knowing when the bitterness will end and the sweetness will come. As for more than two-thirds of the land and people in the county, they do not know whether the fruit of victory is sweet or sour. No wonder that on the day after the reporter stepped into this desolate city where the ancestral tombs were located, after meeting with County Council Speaker Zhu Shijun, County Party Secretary General Zhan Baohuang, County Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Zhuping, Youth Corps Director Zhai Zheng, and County Councilors Ni Shouchi, Xu Xiangzhou, Jiang Junji, and other gentlemen, when talking about the pain inflicted on the people by the bandit scourge, everyone could not help but sob. Although everyone knows that the military is very capable, the county magistrate is considered a good person, and most of the common people are honest and kind, however, if grassroots politics cannot be improved quickly, the self-defense forces cannot be organized, trained, and commanded in a way that adapts to the actual needs, and everyone does not increase their awareness of the need to be prepared for danger in times of peace, these 1.5 million fellow villagers may have an unrelenting hatred, and perhaps there will be a short-term problem. Perhaps the delicious white soup silver thread noodles, fragrant and crispy long fish, and crab meat balls will be so expensive that people from Jiangnan will not dare to eat them. This is truly a tragedy.

The contradictions and strange phenomena in the Pacification Zone are truly countless and endless. On the afternoon of October 30, when the reporter met with General Xue Zhongshu, commander of the "6615" unit, and Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang Qiaoliu for the second time, we made a general review of the battle results of capturing the Zhoujia Duo bandit den in front of the thatched house beside Tongyu Road. The two of them believed that the strength of the bandit army in Dongtai County was weak, but it would still take a considerable period of time to completely annihilate the remnants of the bandits and eliminate their malignant influence. They frankly said that this time, only more than 20 bandits were captured, dozens were killed, more than ten rifles were captured, more than 200 old shells, five war horses, a radio, ten spinning and sewing machines, and hundreds of shi of food and cotton were seized, and some refugees were rescued. The Zishi Independent Regiment of the bandit army has fled to Lujia Yao upon hearing the news (this place is close to Hai'an in Taizhou), and the New Regiment of the bandit army has disintegrated into smaller groups and fled into the depths of the reeds. The National Army is joining forces with local teams to step up the pursuit. However, in order to prevent this group of remaining bandits from being resurrected, it is necessary for everyone to work together and add a boost.

### Tianjin Suicidal Lovers, Suicide Note Found, Suicide Due to Economic Pressure

[Aviation Report from Our Newspaper in Tianjin, October 30th] The case of the double suicide of Su Qingneng (aka Yi Chang) and Dong Jifeng in the Jinbei Yang Hotel was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The reason for their suicide has now been explained in the letter they sent to Dong Jifeng's parents. The original text of the letter is as follows:

"To our parents: We didn't think that we'd be leaving so quickly, but we can't provide for ourselves, nor can we help you. We are ashamed. It's better to take this path, so you won't worry. We are incompetent, but we can be satisfied in death if we can't live together. We hope you won't miss your unfilial daughter. We will be happy in the afterlife. We hope you won't be sad! Farewell! To our dear parents, forever health. Your unfilial daughter Xiao Feng, Son-in-law Yi Chang. October 27th. Enclosed are two pawn tickets. The coat that we pawned for 160,000 is Jichang's, and the one for 150,000 is Jidai's."

### Serving Sesame Cakes and Expressing Sincere Gratitude to the Army

Stepping into the Pacification Zone, seeing all the progress in the military, truly strengthened our confidence that "Suppressing the rebellion and building the nation will surely succeed." The excellent military discipline of the "6615" unit stationed in Dongtai has already been widely praised, but General Xue Zhongshu still humbly inquires about the difficulties of his subordinates in Dongtai whenever he meets with reporters. The special qualities of the officers and soldiers are their ability to endure hardship and their lack of arrogance. The secret to Generals Xue and Zhang's management of the army is their mobility, agility, and ability to share the hardships of the soldiers, which is why they are able to fight and willing to fight. They deeply understand that in order to suppress the bandits in Northern Jiangsu, it is necessary to always strive for the initiative and be aware of the opportunities. When the reporter met with General Zhang Qiaoliu in Anli, he and some officers and soldiers had only slept for eight hours in three days and three nights, and they were still advancing towards their goal without rest or sleep while traversing the marshland and crossing the highway. There was no sign of fatigue on them. The two of them entertained the reporter on a bench in front of a thatched shed, eating sesame cakes. After eating, they respectfully inscribed words for the Shen Bao, which the people of Northern Jiangsu love to read. Their innocent and responsible spirit deeply moved me. After being treated to two sesame cakes, the reporter respectfully offered a sincere wish, hoping that they would succeed immediately. (Special Correspondent Fang Canglang)

### Yu Zisan, a Student at Zhejiang University, Committed Suicide with a Piece of Glass after Being Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou, October 31] Yu Zisan, Chairman of the Student Self-Government Association of Zhejiang University, and students E Bojin, Chen Jianxin and Huang Shimin, alumni of the same, were arrested by the local security agency in Room 52 of the Datong Hotel on the shore of West Lake on the evening of the 25th of this month. One of them, Yu Zisan, has died in prison. Details are as follows:

### The Arrest

According to a statement issued by the security authorities, "On the 23rd of this month, we received information from Beijing and Shanghai that two important Communist Party members, Chen Jianxin and Huang Shimin, were scheduled to come to Hangzhou on the 25th to instigate party members in Hangzhou to plot unrest and respond to the Communist military rebellion. We immediately assigned officers to investigate separately. As a result, when the Qiantang United Transport bus arrived at the station on the same day, we discovered two people whose actions were suspicious. Several young people who were waiting at the station accompanied them to a noodle restaurant for dinner, and then took a three-wheeled vehicle to the Qintai Second Hotel. After about an hour, they transferred to Room 52 of the Datong Hotel, which had been pre-booked. After investigation by investigators, it was considered that their whereabouts were suspicious. The security authorities dispatched police officers to check the room at approximately 2:00 AM that night. It was confirmed that the two people who came to Hangzhou from Shanghai were Chen Jianxin (currently a teacher at Shanghai Daozhong Girls' High School) and Huang Shimin (an employee of the Shanghai China Farmers' Bank). The young people who went to the station to meet them were Yu Zisan, Chairman of the Student Self-Government Association of Zhejiang University, and E Bojin, a student of the Department of Agricultural Economics. Important letters to and from Communist Party members, three Communist Party publications, and 495,000 yuan in cash were found on Chen Jianxin on the spot. An expenditure account for activities was found on Huang Shimin, stating that the amount was approximately 20 million yuan, with 1,309,500 yuan in cash, and various Communist Party documents and books. A secret notification, two lists of party members, and a secret letter from a party member were found on Yu Zisan. Three secret letters between party members, an outline of discussions for a Communist Party group meeting, and other important evidence were found on E Bojin, and they were arrested. Huang Shimin and E Bojin were detained in the police station, and Yu Zisan and Chen Jianxin were detained in the Security Command. After the interrogation, Yu and others admitted that they were responsible for the liaison between the All-China Student Federation and the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association, and that they were the main members of the New Tide Society and the All-China Student Federation, two reactionary organizations, and that they accepted the leadership of the Communist Party and the Democratic League. At 6:20 PM on the 29th, Yu Zisan suddenly committed suicide with a piece of broken glass. Chen, Huang, and E were transferred to the Yunyuan Court on the night of the 29th for investigation in accordance with the law."

### Japanese Weapons Hidden in Yunding Rock, Xiamen, People Encouraged to Excavate

[Aviation Report from Our Newspaper in Xiamen, October 27] When the Japanese army withdrew from Xiamen, they secretly hid a large number of weapons in Yunding Rock. The military authorities have encouraged the people to excavate them. Yunding Rock is located approximately 25 li from the city, rising more than 1,000 feet above sea level, and is the highest peak in Xiamen. Also, Chen Gongbei, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fourth District, recently arrived in Xiamen from Quanzhou. According to him, public security is not good in various counties in southern Fujian, and scattered bandits appear and disappear unpredictably, causing great trouble. Quanzhou is a hometown of overseas Chinese in southern Fujian, and many returning overseas Chinese privately bring American-style weapons. It is estimated that the number of weapons is considerable, enough to form a division's worth of armed forces. Due to poor management, they often fall into the hands of traitors, causing local chaos. Also, it is reported that 14 villages in Heshan District of Xiamen City have been demolished by the authorities and converted into an airport. As a result, villagers have been displaced, homeless, and without a means of livelihood. The Municipal Council has specially appealed to the Municipal Government to investigate the value of the buildings demolished at that time and demand compensation. The Municipal Government has stated that it will consider this matter after receiving the letter.

### Examination of the Deceased

After Yu Zisan's death, the forensic office of the Hangzhou District Court completed the examination and prepared a report stating: "This office has accepted the case of the suicide death of criminal suspect Yu Zisan from the Zhejiang Security Command for examination. Two pieces of glass used for suicide were found next to the body. They resembled the glass from the south wall of the prison room. In order to determine the matter, a piece of glass was taken from the window for comparison, and it was confirmed that they were the same. However, it is impossible to determine whether they were taken from the window or originally left on the ground. Furthermore, the throat wound of the corpse was very deep, and there was blood in the mouth, which proves that the throat was cut before death. There were no scars on the body, and there was no sign of resistance. There was blood on both hands, which was very bright red and came from the wound. There was a slight scratch on the tiger's mouth of the right hand, so it was determined that the death was caused by suicide before death. For the sake of caution, the court will re-dispatch forensic doctor Jiang Dayi from the Jiaxing District Court to Hangzhou for re-examination.

### Traffic Disrupted, Pedestrians Blocking the Road: Cars Gather on the Yangxu Line, Demanding the Right to Operate

[Our Yangzhou Dispatch, 28th] The Yangxu Highway, between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, is a major transportation artery connecting the north and south of the Yangtze River. It has long been exclusively operated by the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Motor Company. After the victory, new motor companies emerged like mushrooms, including Taiyang, Shengli, Hezhong, Xinsu, Lisu, Yangqing, Jiangbei, Jianhua, Zhongxing, and others. Besides the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Company still operating the Yangxu line, Yangqing also signed a special agreement with the Jiangsu Highway Bureau to operate the Yangzhou-Huaiyin line. Last month, due to business competition, the Yangqing Company's Liuhe station was once destroyed by "leeches." Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Company, with its special rights to operate due to purchasing land and building roads, and Yangqing, having a special operating agreement, presented their case to the Jiangsu Construction Department and the Highway Bureau, ordering the other companies to cease operations. However, as this concerned the livelihoods of over a thousand employees, they appealed to the departments. As a result, Zhenjiang-Yangzhou agreed to compromise, opening up the exclusive operation, allowing each company to operate one large truck and one small passenger car per day, temporarily resolving the issue. Not long ago, Zhenjiang-Yangzhou suddenly discovered that the Yangxu line road bureau had been scattered with iron nails, attempting to damage tires. They reported this to the police station, which apprehended a suspect named Xiao Ge. The police station, considering the importance of highway transportation during the period of mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, decided to organize a vehicle patrol team before the end of October to maintain highway safety. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 26th, various companies gathered dozens of cars, large and small, blocking the intersection of the Yangxu line, obstructing passing military personnel, causing a very serious situation. Commissioner Lin of the Fifth District of Jiangsu and County Magistrate Wang of Jiangdu, upon hearing the news, went to mediate. Employees of various companies immediately demanded the opening of the Yangxu line for operation and a relaxation of the restrictions. Commissioner Lin and County Magistrate Wang agreed to reconsider, but emphasized that traffic must not be obstructed, causing resentment. They scheduled a meeting for the 28th, gathering responsible parties from Zhenjiang-Yangzhou, Yangqing, and other companies to discuss a proper solution and resolve the dispute.

Zhejiang University Strike: After learning of the arrest of Yu, Li, Huang, and Chen, students of Zhejiang University immediately requested the school authorities to rescue them. President Zhu Kezhen and Dean Gu of Zhejiang University went to the provincial government and security organs, demanding that they be transferred to the court within 24 hours. The police局 refused because the interrogation was not yet complete. The students then initiated a signature campaign, advocating a strike as a protest. At 9 p.m. on the 29th, upon hearing the news of Yu Zisan's suicide, the students were furious. President Zhu and Dean Gu immediately led school doctors and student representatives to the scene, finding Yu dead. On the 30th, the students went on strike and held a demonstration. At 3 p.m., over a thousand students, wearing plain paper strips and led by a wreath and Yu Zisan's portrait, marched to the local court and the Security Command. They distributed leaflets and posted slogans along the way, maintaining good order. After arriving at the court, they sent representatives to petition the court. Wang Bingyi, the chief prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, received them, stating that the case would be handled impartially according to the law and allowed representatives to meet specially with Fu Bojin and the other two. At about 5 p.m., the procession arrived at the Security Command to view Yu Zisan's body. The command moved the body to an open space in Caoxieling, where students, in groups of twenty, took turns viewing the remains until 7 p.m., when they returned to school.

### Vietnam Stops Using Large Bills: 500,000 Overseas Chinese Suffer Huge Losses, Hope Authorities Negotiate for Compensation Through Diplomatic Channels

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, October 26th] According to a Hanoi dispatch: More than 500,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam are currently suffering a huge loss. During the Japanese occupation of Vietnam, the Banque de l'Indochine issued a 100-yuan bill. Recently, the bank suddenly announced that the bill was invalid. The bank did not fulfill its issuing credit and allow holders to exchange for new bills. Although there are no reliable statistics on the amount of bills issued, the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce estimates that 70% are held by overseas Chinese. This measure by the bank is tantamount to plundering the wealth of overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese sincerely hope that the government will pay attention to this matter and negotiate for compensation through diplomatic channels.

Provincial Government Statement: In view of the Zhejiang University students' strike and demonstration, the provincial government authorities issued a statement, providing a detailed account of the Yu case. It also stated that the Communist bandits are currently relying on foreign forces to betray the country. At this time when the government is suppressing the rebellion and seeking peace, it is also the time for young people to strive for progress and serve the country. It is sincerely hoped that the students of Zhejiang University will use a calm head, rational judgment, and put the interests of the country first and their own studies first, and be cautious in their actions, not failing the expectations of society.

Hangzhou Martial Law: The Zhejiang Provincial Security Command announced martial law in Hangzhou on the 30th. The announcement stated: "During this period of mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, the security of the rear is extremely important. Recently, due to the capture of conspirators inciting unrest in the city, a small number of students have been incited by unscrupulous elements, resulting in various illegal acts. In addition to suppressing them according to law, in order to maintain治安, temporary martial law shall be implemented from today. According to Article 7 of the Implementation Outline for Mobilization for Suppressing the Rebellion, various gatherings and their speech and actions that obstruct local peace and order shall be punished according to law, and all necessary measures in accordance with Article 12 and related articles of the Martial Law shall be implemented. Those who violate the prohibitions and plot wrongdoing will be severely punished without leniency. During the martial law period, traffic is prohibited from 11 p.m. each day until dawn the next day." (Luo Ding from Hangzhou)

### Deserters after Entering Barracks: Township Chiefs and Wardens Should Assist in the Arrest

### Wuxi's County Budget for the Next Year Successfully Resolved. Merchants Donate 800 Million, County Government Organizes Winter Relief and Loans

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, October 30th] The third congress of the County Assembly will officially open on November 3rd. However, balancing the county預算案 for the 36th year is an urgent task. Therefore, it was submitted to the Financial Committee meeting on the 29th for heated review. The focus was on the surcharge on the land tax. It was originally decided that the surcharge would be 6.5升 per yuan of tax, so the land tax this year would reach 3斗05合, an increase of 8升9合4 compared to last year, which is too heavy a burden for farmers, and the warehouse capacity is insufficient. All parties unanimously agreed that it should be reduced appropriately. When Chairman Wang of the province came to Wuxi this time, he also gave instructions on the surcharge issue, stating that it should be coordinated with the budget and eliminate攤派 as the principle. Therefore, it was unanimously advocated to reduce 6.5升 by 1.5升, that is, add 5升 per yuan of tax. The reduced surcharge amounted to approximately 3 billion national currency. The source of 2 billion of which was made up from the processing surplus of the tax shell. There were still 1 billion yuan, of which 800 million yuan was donated by merchants in proportion to the business tax amount, and 200 million yuan was collected by the tax collection office under the item of autonomous donation tax. At this point, the balance plan for the county budget for the 36th year was successfully resolved.

### Purchasing Dutiable Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange; Regulations and Control Committee Drafting Implementation Details; All Eighteen Articles Passed and Announced at Yesterday's General Meeting; Adopting Reasonableness, Empathy for Commercial Difficulties, and Comprehensive Consideration

[Our Correspondent] Regarding the implementation details for the handling of dutiable goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange without permits, the Regulations and Control Committee drafted the proposal and it was passed for implementation at yesterday's general meeting. Our reporter specifically visited the spokesperson of the committee to inquire about the process. According to the spokesperson: "This committee is in the position of an executive body, and all measures should be based on the handling methods promulgated by the government. When the government drafted the handling methods for dutiable goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange without permits, it already considered the interests and positions of all parties. However, since the announcement, importers have suggested appropriate modifications to the handling details due to differences in their respective commercial situations. This committee generally sympathizes with the difficulties presented, so when drafting the details, we carefully considered all adoptable suggestions without violating the principles of the government's promulgated handling methods. In particular, the commercial sector faces undeniable difficulties regarding capital turnover, so limited flexibility was provided for foreign currency deposit certificates. Furthermore, considering the time required for customs clearance and delivery of purchased goods, phased payments were permitted to ensure comprehensive consideration of both legal regulations and commercial realities. We hope that all original petitioners will understand this purpose, cooperate together, and uniformly comply, so that the outstanding issues that have remained unresolved for months can be smoothly concluded."

### Implementation Details

I. General Provisions 　Article 1: All dutiable goods that have arrived or are being shipped with self-provided foreign exchange without permits, and that should be purchased by the government according to the handling methods amended and approved by the Executive Yuan, should be handled by the Central Trust Bureau in accordance with these details regarding purchasing and distribution matters. Article 2: Production equipment directly ordered by users, falling under categories 1 and 3 (A) of the appendix, will not be purchased by the government in accordance with the handling methods. For items falling under category 2 of the appendix, case-by-case applications can be submitted to a subcommittee separately formed by the Import and Export Management Committee for handling.

II. Purchase 　Article 3: The cost-insurance-freight (CIF) price of the purchased goods will be investigated and determined by the Central Trust Bureau, which will issue a special foreign currency deposit certificate to the original importer as the consideration for the goods. At the same time, the importer will endorse the bill of lading and submit it to the Central Trust Bureau, so that the Central Trust Bureau or its designated person (the purchaser of the goods) can declare and take delivery of the goods. Article 4: The term of the aforementioned special foreign currency deposit certificate is three years, and the amount can be divided into different whole numbers. It will be issued in a registered manner, and with the approval of the Import and Export Management Committee, it can be transferred by the original importer to a registered qualified importer, or paid to the original customer, and transferred to a registered qualified importer. Article 5: Starting from November of this year, registered qualified importers may use the aforementioned deposit certificates to borrow one-sixth of the face value of foreign exchange from the Central Bank on a quarterly basis to pay for the imported goods within their quotas. The borrowing interest rate is 5% per annum, calculated in foreign currency, and paid in legal tender at the market exchange rate on the day of the loan. However, unmatured deposit certificates cannot be used to borrow legal tender.

III. Distribution 　Article 6: The goods purchased by the Central Trust Bureau will be distributed to factories or direct users as a principle. Article 7: If the original customer of the original importer is a factory user, and they have submitted a sales contract and provided proof that the foreign exchange for the payment has been paid in full, the goods may be preferentially purchased by the original customer factory user within a reasonable quantity range. Article 8: If the original customer of the original importer is not a factory user, and they have submitted a contract and provided proof that the foreign exchange for the payment has been paid in full, the original customer may provide proof of reasonable quantities for distribution to direct users or direct consumers, and they will be given preferential purchase. Article 9: The distribution method for goods imported by the original importer themselves may be negotiated and determined by the Central Trust Bureau in consultation with representatives of relevant factory users or trade associations. Article 10: When the Central Trust Bureau entrusts commercial institutions to sell the purchased goods, the original importer may be given priority for entrustment. Article 11: The prices to be stipulated for the sale of various types of purchased goods, and the markup percentages to be added to the CIF price for raw materials sold to factories, shall be determined by the Central Trust Bureau in consultation with representatives of relevant trade associations and factory user associations, taking into account the market price of the goods or the market price of the finished products processed from the raw materials. The selling prices of purchased goods do not include customs duties. Article 12: The raw materials and goods obtained by each factory shall be deducted quarterly within the quota that should be obtained. Article 13: The purchaser of the aforementioned goods will need time for customs clearance and other procedures, and the purchaser may pay the purchase price in installments as follows: (1) 25% of the total price shall be paid in cash; (2) The remaining 25% may be paid with a 30-day check; (3) And the remaining 50% may be paid with a 45-day check, which must be secured by a special foreign currency deposit certificate or a bank guarantee. Article 14: The purchaser shall handle the customs clearance and other procedures themselves. The purchaser shall also bear the storage rent, unloading and transportation costs, and customs duties. Before the above sale, the storage rent and transport costs will be deducted from the government's installment portion of the sale price. Article 15: The price at which the factory purchases the goods is based on the CIF price plus a certain percentage, and customs duties are added separately.

IV. Supplementary Provisions 　Article 16: If the importer wishes to re-export the goods, the 60-day period shall be calculated from the date of promulgation of these details. Article 17: Matters not covered in these details, or special matters, may be stipulated separately at any time. Article 18: These details shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Six District Guilds Request National Bank to Purchase Foreign Cotton Without Permits That Have Not Yet Arrived

Previously, the Textile Adjustment Committee, in order to understand the quantity of foreign cotton ordered by various yarn factories from abroad without permits, which had already been loaded onto ships or had not yet been loaded but had not yet arrived in port, notified the six district textile guilds to investigate and report. The six district guilds have now completed the investigation and compiled statistical forms, totaling 19 units and 36 batches of yarn factories that placed orders, with a total of 91,649 bales of foreign cotton. The types include five kinds such as Brazilian, Indian, East African, American, and Egyptian cotton. The handling firms are nine foreign firms and companies including Meian, Fujia, Wang Fulong, Duxi, Shenfeng, Jiang Laixuan, Bailun, Laili, Lianxing, and American Coke. The above-mentioned foreign cotton has been submitted by the six district guilds to the Textile Adjustment Committee for verification and handling, and a request has been made to the Central Bank to adopt the handling methods for foreign cotton that has arrived in port, and to purchase it. Representatives Rong Yixin have also been appointed to negotiate with relevant authorities regarding the purchase and other matters.

### Limited Trading in Chinese Stocks, Process Does Not Escape Consolidation

Chinese stocks yesterday did not escape consolidation, trading was limited, and it was still just insiders trading among themselves. The process was mediocre, and the ups and downs were also narrow.

Early Morning

Xianyong Yarn opened high at 292 yuan, and Yinghui also rose sharply to 7,000 yuan. It seemed like there was strong demand when the market opened, but because the compensation materials reported in the newspapers were insignificant, there was some selling after the opening, and off-market prices were reported lower first, so it retreated to 287 yuan and 293 yuan. Subsequently, as there were many who were delivering Xianyong Yarn and buying Xianyong Yarn for immediate delivery, especially Guangbang buyers who were most eager, prices gradually rose to a high of 295 yuan for immediate delivery and 301 yuan for deferred delivery. The off-market interest rate opened slightly higher at 1 jiao 6 fen and a half and 2 jiao 1. Large investors took advantage of the situation to sell, but were still forced to drop to 2 yuan 6 and 293 yuan. Near noon, immediate delivery was seen again at 285 yuan, and deferred delivery at a low of 292 yuan and a half. The hot stocks were still stable, and miscellaneous stocks saw mutual rises and falls. Only Match, China Silk, and Jinglun still stood high, and the result was that compared with the previous close, stocks for immediate delivery, including Meiya, Tongyi, Liann, Xinyi, and Hengju, were still flat. Xianyong, Xinhuo, Huafeng, Jingfu, Qinxing, China-France, Xinhua, and Huaxin Datong rose slightly. Match, Jinglun, and China Silk rose by half a percent. Xinguang, Zhabei, Rongfeng, and underwear fell slightly. Stocks for deferred delivery, including Xinguang, Huafeng, and Qinxing, were still flat. Xianyong, Xinhuo, and Jingfu rose slightly, and Meiya fell slightly. The off-market old stocks, including Dasheng, fell slightly. Cultural stocks, bank stocks, and Wuzhou became popular again.

### Yarn and Cloth Both Rise Upstream

42-count Blue Phoenix Rises by 1.5 Million Yuan Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was in a situation where private manufacturers, limited by costs, were unwilling to sell easily. Buyer groups had a strong appetite for searching and absorbing. Dyeing and weaving factories in this street supplemented raw materials due to rising cloth prices. With both factors combined, the supply of chips was insufficient, and the market rose. Until the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn continued to rise wildly by 1.5 million compared to the previous day, to 15 million yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose uniformly. The cotton cloth market saw Fangjian raise yarn and cloth prices, and the cost of living increased, causing unusually high emotions among people from all sides. Guangdong and Hankou buyers were active, and insiders also absorbed goods. It was also heard that yarn prices were soaring, and buying interest was even stronger. Therefore, as a result, various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, uniformly increased by 230,000 yuan. Serge and Zhigong custom-made cloth were very popular and also rose by about 20,000. Shilin cloth was in high demand and strong, and the markets for other cloths were also consolidating.

### Number of Bounced Checks Increases Daily, National Bank Sends Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate

[Our Newspaper Report] Recently, the trend of bounced checks has been rampant, and the financial authorities attach great importance to it. The Audit Department of the National Bank, together with personnel from the Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance, went to the check clearing house yesterday to inspect the clearing situation. All bounced checks have been copied with the account names and dates, and stamped with "Bounced Check" to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the bounced checks. According to the person in charge of the Audit Department of the National Bank, the number of bounced checks recently is alarming. On just one day last week, there were 9,819 bounced checks, totaling 140 billion yuan. On average, more than 5,000 checks are bounced every day, and the credit of checks is almost completely destroyed. If it is not curbed, not only will the financial market be disturbed, but prices will also inevitably be affected. The person in charge also speculated that there are three reasons for the bounced checks: 1. The drawer issued blank checks indiscriminately. 2. The bank intentionally used excuses to bounce checks due to insufficient funds. 3. The bad habit of using checks on the same day they are deposited has not been eradicated, resulting in bounced checks. In view of the above three situations, if it is the first reason, it should be sent to the court for investigation in accordance with the Negotiable Instruments Law. If the bounced check is caused by the bank making up for missing orders, the bank should be responsible, and the Ministry of Finance often has punitive measures. If it is the third reason, a detailed study should be conducted on the system to thoroughly reform it, and strive to completely eradicate the trend of bounced checks in the shortest possible time.

### Spot Cotton Turns Firm

Yesterday, the spot cotton market turned firm, and transactions began. Buyers were all yarn factories, and there were not many transactions among fellow traders. Factories took the opportunity to absorb goods because yarn prices rose and cotton prices were still flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,480 bales, and the foothold was very firm. Prices still stood at the original levels. The prices for each grade for delivery to factories were: L.S.S. 3.596 million, Fine Han 3.53 million to 3.604 million, Coarse Han 3.059 million, Shashi 3.60 million to 3.65 million, Anqing 2.81 million, Yanji 2.81 million, and Zhoupu Seed Cotton 600,000.

### British Exchange Rate Rises Slightly

Yesterday, the US exchange rate did not move. The benchmark price for the British exchange rate was adjusted to 172,000 yuan, an increase of 4.2% compared to the previous price. The designated bank selling price was 174,000 yuan, the Hong Kong exchange rate was 10,705.21 yuan, the selling price was 11,005.21 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 12,877.01 yuan, and the selling price was 13,177.01 yuan.

### Social Services Psychological Illness Still Requires Psychological Treatment Optimism Is the Key to Health Preservation (Reader's Mailbox)

Dear Reader Zhongjun: We felt that you were a neurotic person when you visited our office the other day to inquire. Today, after receiving your letter and reading it carefully, we were not surprised. Your so-called ailments are entirely caused by a psychological condition. At the same time, we can be sure that you are a kind-hearted young man, so you are willing to swallow your anger and endure being in an environment that you do not like in order to take care of your parents' wishes. You said: "In fact, everything is unhappy when things happen." This is the root cause of your illness. Didn't you say, "Sometimes when I'm more open-minded, I can catch my breath a little, and I can feel the joy of being disease-free"? Even if it's only for a moment, wouldn't it be enough to prove that when the "mind" is "open," your so-called "disease" immediately leaves? It's also because you are constantly tense psychologically, thinking this way and that way, so you can only enjoy a moment of relaxation and joy, and you can't have as much happiness and less worry as ordinary people. If you can listen to our sincere advice and start today with a happy mood to welcome your living environment, I believe your so-called "disease" will definitely be driven out of the country by you. As for your suspicion of having heart disease or lung disease, etc., you only need to ask a doctor for an examination, or have an X-ray of your heart and lungs once. If the doctor says that any part of your body is sick, then it is a real disease! We are very sorry that we cannot send your letter to our medical consultant, because you are suffering from a psychological illness! I wish you happiness! (Editor)

Spring and Autumn

### Notes on Reading in Taipei

— Tuilu

By chance, I went to Taipei and happened to attend the "Taiwan Provincial Art Exhibition" held to commemorate the second anniversary of Taiwan's restoration, divided into three categories: Chinese painting, Western painting, and sculpture. After seeing it, I felt that the Taiwanese people were very interested in Western painting, and they worked very hard on watercolors and oil paintings. However, the Chinese painting section really had an Eastern painting style, and it was a bit inappropriate to list it as Chinese painting. For example, Wang Qingsan's "Dajia Creek in Mid-Autumn Festival" has bright colors and smooth brushstrokes. Huang Yonglu's "Silk Shade", Cai Boxue's "Qingjiao Dog", Jin Dehuang's "Collection of Flowers and Birds", Tang Yunsheng's "Quiet Pond", Lin Yushan's "Brocade迎風", Wu Jinghui's "Music Score", Lin Zhizhu's "Quiet Suburbs", Guo Xuehu's "New Moon", etc., all have a strong Japanese painting flavor. Wu Shiming's "Heroic Wind", the stone painting is also quite skillful, and the stone spectrum in Kaihua's painting collection can be referenced. Cai Jintian's "National Hero", Xu Shenchuan's "Interior", Chen Huikun's "Taiwanese Custom Room", etc., are all similar to advertising paintings. Wu Lixiong's "Golden Flower", Wang Qingsan's "Dew", Yang Jiangbo's "Lichun", Zeng Yulan's "Hibiscus", etc. are somewhat like pattern paintings, and these cannot be regarded as Chinese paintings. You Ben'e's "Mother and Son Apes", the trunks are all painted with fine strokes without distinguishing between turns and setbacks. In terms of Chinese painting, there is no "brush". Xu Shenchuan's "Autumn Xing", Ye Yong's "Sound of Waves", Li Qiuhe's "Residual Works", Wen Changshun's "Pineapple", etc. have soft colors and good power. Wu Jinsheng's "Garden Feng", the fine money strips are very vivid, Zheng Qingpu's "Landscape" is still immature, and he does not know how to use burnt ink well. Guo Xuehu's "Yinqiu Tu", the banana leaves also do not see "brush", the melon leaves are poorly inked, and there is still a lack of charm. The focus of Chinese painting lies in having brush and ink, and then there is charm. Lin Yushan's "Xiaofeng Canlu", the willow leaves are fragmented and chaotic, Wu Jianzhou's "Swimming Fish", the ink color is flat, and the disease also lacks charm. Jiang Qingzhou's "Rural Fun", the sparrows are very beautiful. Zhu Futing's "Thousand Springs on the Tree Tops", the lining method is a bit chaotic. Chen Kuiwu's "Returning Crows in the Cold Forest", the color is slightly vulgar. Lü Qingtao's "Heroic Independence", the pine needles also have a soft and weak feeling. The above points are inevitable even in domestic masterpieces.

However, the painting in Taiwan Province has been too deeply influenced by the Japanese, and efforts should be made to change it, otherwise it will be a waste of many geniuses and precious time. Some people can directly specialize in advertising paintings and pattern paintings, because the painting principles of Chinese painting are too profound, and one must read more poetry and books and trace the source. Moreover, good paper, ink, brushes, and pigments cannot be bought in Taiwan. The price of domestic brushes is especially expensive (one brush costs 500,000 to more than one million national currency). It is best for the provincial government authorities to invite famous domestic painters to Taiwan to give lectures and paint, which will be of great benefit to everyone in the province.

Editor's Note: The comments in this article are not without being too strict. Even in domestic masterpieces, brush and ink flaws are occasionally inevitable. Taiwan Province has not been restored for long, so we cannot be too demanding; however, it is indeed something that we should pay attention to. Therefore, we specially introduce and publish this manuscript, hoping that the painters in Taiwan Province will carefully adopt it and establish more contacts with the art circles in the motherland.

### From the Shanghai Art Movement to the Value of Huang Junbi's Painting Exhibition

— Shi Chongpeng

The Shanghai art movement after the restoration has gradually developed due to the attention of the education authorities and the promotion of society. Especially in the past few weeks, since the "Centennial Painting Exhibition," there have been solo exhibitions by Fang Junfeng, Chen Shuren, Zhu Yingpeng, and Fu Baoshi, as well as the members' painting exhibition of the Chinese Painting Association, which are not ordinary, mediocre, superficial, and low-level works. These works entirely represent the artistic achievements of modern people, which are really incomparable to the declining and outdated atmosphere of the past century.

Moreover, the interest of all sectors of society in art has been strengthening and increasing day by day. Shanghai is not only the center of national culture, but is also gradually becoming the center of fine arts. Just as Mr. Gu Yiqiao said at the reception of the Chinese Painting Association, after a long period of in-depth research and hard work, artists from all over the world will bring a large number of masterpieces to Shanghai for exhibitions. Shanghai has become the center for national artists to "establish fame and set prices" and "weigh art," equivalent to Rome in Italy and Paris in France. This is comforting to our art workers, especially those engaged in art work in Shanghai, who feel more happy and excited.

Professor Huang Junbi of Central University recently held a solo exhibition at the China Painting Garden, displaying more than 100 pieces of landscapes and figures. From the four landscapes he imitated from the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, we can see that he has a profound understanding of Zi Jiu, Shan Qiao, Yunlin, and Zhong Gui, and only then can such lifelike works be produced. This point shows that Junbi's basic skills are admirable and cannot be compared with general writers who are innovative and trendy. From his "Manmen", "Three Gorges", "Huangshan" and other landscape paintings, we can see Junbi's creative genius, stable and sophisticated. It is definitely not a work that adheres to ancient methods and remains unchanged; it is even less a work that is groundless, boasting of transformation, and falsely accusing the ancient principles of "traditional painting methods". This kind of view, rather than being the personal opinion of the author, is better said to be everyone's common feeling, and it is not my personal flattery.

In the text I wrote about Fu Baoshi's painting exhibition, I once said that after his painting exhibition, the Shanghai art scene should have a new transformation. Now Junbi and Baoshi have the same excellent skills. Therefore, I also feel that the path of Chinese painting is broad, flat, and bright, and it can allow all art workers to develop and build on. The main condition is that the author needs to have a deep and sincere artistic cultivation, and then he can learn the new by reviewing the old, and win by surprise, and reach a high ideal realm. Therefore, the value of Junbi's painting exhibition also lies in this.

### Autumn Comes

— Fu Gong

Outside the door, the mournful wind sweeps dust on the streets, Autumn comes, and the livelihood is shamefully meager. Old sleeves stained with pine soot, The lamp fire is cool at night, growing closer; Drunk, forgetting form, lamenting the thoroughness of politics, Dreaming of a broken commandment, cherishing the Dharma wheel. Morning after morning, ten thousand tiles are covered with frost, The mountains and rivers turn yellow, petty people are insignificant.

### A Record of Ding Longsuo's Copies of Buddhist Images from Dunhuang

— Yu Jianhua

The Buddhist images in the murals of the Dunhuang grottoes are the only surviving remnants of the world's oldest murals, shocking the world and renowned throughout the universe. In recent years, many painters have gone to Dunhuang to study and copy them. I live in the southeast and am thousands of miles away from Dunhuang, so I have no chance to visit this land and pay my respects to this artistic treasure. I have always regretted this. Before, I saw the Dunhuang Buddhist images painted by my friend, Layman Zhang Daqian, which were solemn and beautiful, which greatly comforted my thirst. However, what I saw was too little, and I only tasted a morsel, which did not satisfy my old hunger.

Li Ziding Long and his wife have been wandering in the northwest for ten years, delving into the local customs and writing about them. They personally went to the Yellow River breach to write about the flooding and impact of the Yellow River. Their paintings are as long as dozens of feet, and their courage and strength are amazing. They also lived in Dunhuang for nine months, extracting the essence of the Dunhuang murals and creating a Pure Land picture with an area of ​​400 square feet. They also copied four large Buddhist images, not only the size and dimensions are based on the original, but the color and brushwork are also not a bit deviated. Their purpose is to show people the truth of the Dunhuang murals, without adding any personal opinions to them, so that viewers feel as if they are in the Dunhuang cave, facing the images of more than a thousand years ago, which is not a great pleasure! The various patterns since the Sui and Tang Dynasties copied by his wife are also exquisite and worth seeing. Now, Li Zi will exhibit his works at the Chinese Painting Garden. Those who want to see the true face of Dunhuang murals should not miss the opportunity to feast their eyes.

To paint freehand, the intention is in the high mountains, then there are high mountains; the intention is in the flowing water, then there is flowing water; the intention is in the wind, rain, obscurity, and flying and diving creatures, then there is also wind, rain, obscurity, and flying and diving creatures. The so-called intention reaching the brush is the mark of a good painter. However, the realm of "intention" is extremely broad; the realization of intention is extremely profound; the key lies in conforming to "reason". If the reason conforms, the "spirit" is complete; all "momentum," "energy," and "charm" are born from this. "Reason" is the truth of heaven and earth and nature; "intention" is the beautiful awareness of man-made learning and cultivation. The structure and existence of all forms in the natural world must have their reason. We deeply observe the beauty we have cultivated through learning and cultivation, carefully examine and identify what is truly worthy of being transferred and reproduced, and then use the power of the brush to present it as a painting, releasing energy and vitality, forgetting the nature of myself, the nature of nature, and the harmony of nature and myself. Therefore, what is presented on the paper under the wrist must be full of vigor and charm. One cannot discuss this without reading ten thousand books, traveling ten thousand miles, and facing the wall for nine years. Mr. Fu Baoshi's current calligraphy exhibition features a total of 180 works. Landscapes and figures compete for beauty, ranging from large to square feet. His paintings are either as unrestrained as a tiger leaping and fighting, or as quiet as autumn chrysanthemums and spring waves, or as strong as refined gold and iron, or as profound as accumulated jade, or as elegant as spider silk in the wind. His landscapes have transformed and used the techniques of Wang Qia and Yunlin and other masters; his figures have selected and imitated the techniques of Gu Kaizhi and Zhou Fang and other masters; his selection of scenes and composition are purely based on the gains of my intention, following the principles of nature, and traveling with the creator. Imagine that when he splashes ink and puts down the brush, it is like a sudden storm, turbulent waves, and the fun of riding a raft to explore the moon and entering the mountain with disheveled hair. Therefore, his works are all full of energy and soul, and have a unique charm. They cannot be measured by ordinary methods. All great masters in the past, who established unique styles and became masters of a generation, all possessed this courage and this divine understanding. I hope Mr. Baoshi will strive for it. Those who stick to established methods and stubbornly aspire to be like the ancients will close their eyes and ears and run away after reading Baoshi's paintings and my texts, thinking that they are too crazy and that they are too pretentious. However, if these people are humble and calm and carefully consider the meaning of painting as painting, they will suddenly nod their heads in agreement with my ideas and be inspired.

### Introduction to the Painting Exhibition of Professor Zhou Fangbai and His Wife

— Pan Boying

The success of artistic endeavors is based on natural talent by one-third, and on hard work and circumstances also by one-third each. Since the Japanese rebellion, the clothing of the upper class has suffered the hardships of drifting, separation, life, and death; however, it is also a rare state of affairs for literati and scholars that has never been seen in history. Their talent depends on nature, their learning depends on themselves, and the circumstances that are greater than talent and learning depend on how well people deal with them. Therefore, during these ten years of chaos, until the day when the Japanese slaves surrendered, who has achieved success? How is their success? Those who evaluate their merits know it themselves. What I cannot help but linger and sigh for is that in the bustling arena of Shanghai today, I still often meet friends from Yongshu who escaped the disaster, and I cannot help but feel happy. Mr. Zhou Fangbai did not abandon me in the past when I was humble. When I was in Chongqing, he asked me to write about the bamboo and rocks he painted. I already knew his character and appreciated his style. He and his wife, Ms. Lu Chuanwen, are both skilled in painting and calligraphy, as well as sculpture. They have been famous for their artistic skills for a long time. Now, he is displaying his works at Jiuhuatang to ask those who know the arts of Shanghai. He was once again kind enough to visit me, and he was happy to see me as an old friend. Although I am lazy, how can I not be happy! Mr. Zhou has learned a lot in painting, and his talent is very high. He has traveled through mountains and rivers and studied characters, and his achievements are even higher than before! Therefore, I am happy to introduce him to the gentlemen in Shanghai. Carefully recorded by Zhanzhi Zhai in the ninth autumn of Dinghai.

### Preface to the Ancient Music and Elegant Songs Performance

— Wang Rulin

Ancient music refers to the music of the 鼓 (drum) and Buddhist sounds. The so-called Buddhist sounds are not actually Buddhist sounds, but ancient melodies performed with silk and bamboo instruments, mixed with the sounds of metal and leather, hence sometimes called “coarse and fine ten pieces”. "Coarse" refers to metal and leather instruments, while "fine" refers to silk and bamboo instruments. In ancient China, musical instruments were originally classified into eight categories: metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, and wood. Later, silk and bamboo instruments gradually became more prominent, and music as music became increasingly monotonous. However,锣鼓 (gongs and drums) Buddhist sounds, among all kinds of musical instruments, can encompass all and produce wonderful sounds. As for metal, there are five or six kinds of large and small gongs, as well as zinc bells and cloud gongs. As for silk, there are the sanxian, pipa, tiqin (high-pitched stringed instrument), and erhu. For bamboo, there are the xiao and flute. For gourd, the sheng is used. For leather, there are the large drum, middle drum, and small drum. For wood, there are clappers and wooden fish. With rising and falling tones, fast and slow tempos, played in a mixed and harmonious way, it can emphasize all the instruments and have a unique style. It truly represents the characteristics of Chinese music. However, it gradually faded into obscurity and was no longer valued. The reason for this is that it requires a wide range of instruments and performance, and without carefully selecting skilled players one by one, it cannot be coordinated. Moreover, it takes a lot of practice to achieve success. Therefore, today, those who know this锣鼓 (gongs and drums) Buddhist sounds are extremely rare. However, Mr. Xiyuan, the abbot of Hongdou Temple, has studied this deeply and has many famous scores such as "Joyful Encounter," "Scented Pouch," "Marquis of Shou Ting," "Ten Thousand Flower Lanterns," and "Eighteen Laments." Recently, at his private residence, he invited Nian Shaogang, Shen Hengyi, Wu Lingru, Jin Daqian, Zhu Yaowen, Wang Zongda, and myself to teach ten ancient tunes. The more we studied them, the more we felt their structure was exquisite and rigorous, and we wanted to promote them. I learned that more than ten years ago, an American violin expert, Mr. Aixihan, came to China for investigation. Through the introduction of Professor Zhao Zijing of Peking University's Music Department, he went to Wuxi and heard this ancient music, praising it highly. Among them, the tune "Marquis of Shou Ting" was even transcribed in shorthand. Later, he repeatedly published articles in the English-language Continental Daily, praising it to the utmost. He also wrote to the Wuxi musician Yang Yinliu, instructing him to pay attention to the research. Mr. Yang then wrote three large volumes on 锣鼓 (gongs and drums) Buddhist sounds. Now, some of the famous players in that area have passed away due to old age, but there are still many who can perform. Now, with the advocacy of Mr. Pu Xiyuan, and the cooperation of Wang Zhongjun, Xu Jinhe, Li Jingnian, Cheng Junmou, Shen Jiuru of the Yangchun Society, Yunlou, Yang Yin, and Zhang Sheng, Shen Hengyi, Yang Hui of the Tianyun Society, we have invited these famous players to come to Shanghai. On the evenings of November 3rd, 4th, and 5th, they will perform three shows in the hall of the Hushe Building on Guizhou Road. In addition, Mr. Pu Xiyuan, Shen Hengyi, Chen Huamei, Kong Zhongshan, Shen Jiuru, Chen Baofan, Jiang Min, Peng Zhimin, Zhu Yaowen and other gentlemen will perform Kunqu opera. Ancient music and elegant songs complement each other, which is a rare opportunity.

"Yes, Mr. Yue," Yaoqun understood why I mentioned these words; "The alarm is planning to use the sound of heavy machine guns firing intermittently as a signal; the number is three two... three two... fired continuously... repeated three times. As soon as they hear it, they will launch a night attack. We are preparing to launch our attack at the same time as the night attack begins. You know, there are many innocent farmers and a few vendors in Changping who have been unjustly imprisoned by Japanese secret agents. Several of my comrades who I and Brother Hu brought from outside the pass have also been arrested. We plan to attack the Japanese secret agent headquarters on one side, and send people to attack the small concentration camp inside. After both sides have succeeded, our people will join together and give them a big stir, then disperse and retreat; we plan to retreat to the Beiyuan area near the suburbs of Beiping and regroup. After regrouping, we will go to Wanquan or Xuanhua as quickly as possible. As for how to get there, we will decide after we regroup."

After Yaoqun clearly explained her plan, many thoughts arose in my mind; because I had not even the slightest idea about her plan beforehand. Moreover, I had not investigated at all the extent of the Japanese secret agents in Angping, or the strength of the Japanese regular army stationed in that area. As for the common people in the Changping area, as far as I knew, most of them were of the "content with their land and reluctant to move" mentality, and not many had left. If Yaoqun's plan is realized, although our group can run away, how do we know that the Japanese devils will not take their anger out on these common people? Thinking of this, I looked at Yaoqun:

"I have a few questions...", I had just opened my mouth when Yaoqun stopped me with a gesture.

"I know what you want to ask. But what about the issue of buying Shafu?" Yaoqun said with a smile.

"Yes, but not just that issue..." I was about to continue, but Yaoqun interrupted me again.

"Regarding buying Shafu," Yaoqun said coldly:

"I am now a little more confident that I can command her within this area. In other words, in the past in Tianjin, she had a hold on me; now, the situation is reversed, and I have a hold on her; because she seems to have lost her claws and teeth in that area, and cannot move easily. According to my ideal, her problem can be put off until the end. Now she has to listen to my commands, so please don't worry about that."

"Even if your plan is carried out, have you considered the impact on the local people?" I raised this point to Yaoqun.

"I've thought about that a long time ago." Yaoqun seemed confident: "Mr. Yue, you have to understand this point; in my opinion, whether we launch a night attack tonight or not, the Japanese devils will treat the common people the same way. Apart from trying their best to ravage them, taking what they can take, killing whom they want to kill, and burning what they want to burn, I don't see any other new tricks. Whether we carry out a night attack or not, it seems like there shouldn't be any special impact on the common people. Moreover, with just the few of us, we can't fulfill much responsibility to protect them, nor can we protect them to the end.

"Do you think we have enough manpower on our side to make a stir?" This was my second question.
