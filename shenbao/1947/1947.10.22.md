### U.S. Revises Aid to China Steps, Wei Envoy's Report Not Released, Foreign Minister Wang Leaves US and Arrives in Tokyo Tonight

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Regarding the U.S. State Department's statement that the confidential report on the investigation of China and Korea by Wei Demai would not be published, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. Furthermore, the meaning and nature of the U.S. statement's ending phrase, "If the report were to be published at this time, it would be inappropriate and detrimental to the interests of all countries concerned," was also not discussed. According to authoritative sources, the U.S. government's motivation for not publishing Wei's report has been revealed in this annotation. The U.S. must have seriously considered its Far East policy while intensifying the implementation of the Marshall Plan for European aid. Regarding the Korean part, the signs can already be seen in the firm stance and strengthened actions recently expressed by the U.S. in the UN General Assembly. Therefore, the U.S. policy towards China will not remain undecided for much longer. From the breakdown of the government and communist negotiations at the end of October last year to Marshal's departure from China this spring, the U.S. has learned from several non-trivial events and situations the rather serious consequences of its ambiguous policy. It is believed that as a result of the frequent and earnest talks between the three foreign ministers in the U.S. with President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Undersecretary of State Lovett, they must have broadly exchanged opinions on the current general economic, political, and military situation in China. The time for the announcement of the U.S. revision of its China policy and the adoption of aid to China steps should not be far off.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The U.S. State Department announced on the 20th that General Wei Demai's report on China and Korea would not be published at this time. The full text of the State Department's statement is as follows: The outside world is currently urging the publication of the report made by General Wei Demai after he returned to the United States from the Far East in mid-September. President Truman dispatched General Wei Demai to China and Korea in July as his personal representative to investigate the situation in the two countries. After Wei completed his mission and returned to the country in September, he submitted his confidential investigation report to the President and the State Department. Much of the information was obtained from private individuals in China and Korea, American representatives in the two countries, and senior officials of the Chinese government. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to publish the report at this time and would be detrimental to the interests of all countries concerned (including the United States).

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] According to unofficial sources: Wei Demai's report stated that the Soviet Union was in danger of taking over all nine provinces of Northeast China within six months and suggested that the U.S. support the government led by Chairman Chiang of China, advocating the adoption of a large-scale aid program similar to the aid to Greece and Turkey plan. Some points in Wei's report conflicted with the suggestions made by Marshall after his mission to China.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] President Truman stated last week that Secretary of State Marshall would issue a statement on Wei Demai's report within a few days. The State Department's statement on the 20th was clearly fulfilling the President's promise. This is enough to indicate that Marshall's statement on the future U.S. policy towards China may be delayed for some time.

[United Press, New York, 20th] Chinese Foreign Minister and Head of the Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Dr. Wang Shijie, left the United States on the 20th and is expected to arrive in Tokyo at 7:01 p.m. on the 22nd (Tokyo time).

### Draft Sino-Siamese Air Transport Agreement Approved by Legislative Yuan; Deliberation on Salt Tax Rate Adjustment Postponed

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Legislative Yuan held its 336th regular meeting on the morning of the 21st, discussing more than 20 tax and election-related proposals, making it one of the busiest days since the resumption of the session. The meeting was chaired by President Sun Ke and passed important proposals including: the draft Sino-Siamese Air Transport Agreement, the organization regulations of the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee, the amended House Tax Regulations, the amended Slaughter Tax Law, the amended Vehicle License Tax Law, the amended Business Tax Law, the amended regulations on raising standards for fines and monetary penalties and the Administrative Execution Law, the amended regulations on the organization law of the Ministry of Interior, the case of changing the number of National Assembly representatives with special living habits in the mainland to 17, and the case of increasing the number of National Assembly representatives from Xinjiang. (The content of the Sino-Siamese Air Transport Agreement and the organizational regulations of the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee can be found in Column 4 of Section 2)

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] When the Legislative Yuan discussed the method of adjusting the salt tax rate and the case of raising various local tax rates on the morning of the 21st, most legislators expressed dissatisfaction with the government's increase in the burden on the people, which did not meet the principle of fairness, resulting in an excessive burden on the poor. Moreover, if the adjustment of the tax rate was not completed through legislative procedures in advance, it would be inconsistent with the law in many ways. As a result, the deliberation of the method of adjusting the salt tax rate was postponed, and the amended law on banquets and entertainment tax was returned for review.

### Legislative Yuan Decides to Ask Government to Pay Attention to Election Fraud

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The case of whether to separately stipulate special laws and regulations to prevent election fraud was brought up again at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the morning of the 21st, and aroused another heated debate. The main reason for those who opposed the separate establishment of new laws was that the criminal law and relevant election laws and regulations already had provisions regarding the punishment of election fraud, and it seemed unnecessary to separately stipulate them. Wang Yuxiang and Chen Zifeng pointed out that the current elections in our country are "extremely tightly controlled" and are elections from top to bottom. The Legislative Yuan does not need to do anything extra. Lin Bin put forward a compromise view, explaining that the time for formulating separate laws has already passed. In addition to requesting the National Government to order all competent authorities to earnestly implement the law when election fraud occurs, the Legislative Yuan should also ask the judicial police, court prosecutors, supervisory committee members, and supervisors to actively pay attention to the occurrence of fraud and should encourage society to expose it, so as to establish a model for constitutional government. In the end, it was passed according to Lin Bin's opinion.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Shanghai Municipal Council, etc., previously stated that the status of municipalities directly under the central government is important and cannot be regarded as the same area as counties and cities, and telegraphed the central government, requesting that each district of the municipalities directly under the central government should return one National Assembly representative. This case was brought up at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 21st. Most legislators believed that the constitution takes counties and cities as the unit for the election of National Assembly representatives, and there is no distinction between municipalities directly under the central government and provincial-level cities. As for the districts of municipalities directly under the central government, which are the same area as counties and cities, their nature is also different. There is no legal basis for the request, and it was not passed.

### Executive Yuan Resolution: Appoint Presidents of Beiyang and Northeast Universities

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Executive Yuan held its 26th meeting on the morning of the 21st, chaired by President Zhang. It was passed to appoint Liu Xianzhou as the president of National Beiyang University, Liu Shuxun as the president of Northeast University, Li Shizhen as the president of the Central Police Academy, and Sun Guijing as the mayor of Changchun. The resolutions of each case are selected and recorded as follows: (Continued on Section 2, Column 2)

### China's Status Becoming Stronger, British "Economist" Comments

[British News Agency, London, 21st] The influential British weekly "The Economist" has a lengthy main commentary this week discussing China's policy and its basic position in world affairs. The article stated: "Today there is indeed a central government in China whose power is much greater than the Beijing government in 1919 or 1921, but after the long war of resistance against Japan, followed by civil war and economic chaos, China's status has been weakened, making it only a great power in name, but not in reality, in the international arena. However, even at this time, it would be a great mistake to underestimate the pivotal factor of China's role in international affairs. China is like a giant, still half-awake and half-asleep, but it does not change the fact that it is a giant. If compared with the situation at the Washington Conference 25 years ago, there has been great progress, and Chinese diplomats also have great confidence in the future, and years of war have given China a legal status, which is still a powerful asset."

### Jilin City Suburbs Engage in Fierce Fighting All Day, Airdropped Troops Arrive Successively from Shenyang to Changchun, Dehui Isolated Troops Bitterly Defend Fuxin Recovered

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] Airdropped troops will arrive successively from Shenyang to Changchun starting today to strengthen the strength of the National Army in Jilin and Changchun.

The area around Changchun shows silence. Dehui was in fierce battle all day yesterday, and it was particularly tragic at night.

### Editorial: A Review of General Central Relations

After touring in the North, the British Parliamentary Delegation to China

flew to this city yesterday morning from Hangzhou, one of my

country's famous scenic spots. After arriving in Shanghai,

in addition to visiting the mayor, they first hosted Chinese and foreign reporters, and at the invitation of the Municipal

Council, participated in a luncheon where they exchanged views. We

feel extremely gratified by the esteemed guests' tour of inspection and by listening to the speeches they have made in various places. Although this newspaper has already commented on the issue of inland river navigation rights yesterday, we hope to further offer our views on the general relationship between China and Britain before the esteemed guests return to their country.

First, we feel that China and Britain have many points in common,

and the difficulties they encounter are also similar. We sincerely admire our British

friends. They are truly hardworking, energetic, planned, courageous,

and methodical in dealing with one difficult situation after another. These actions of our British friends provide us with many

things to emulate. Our government and the public,

are willing to emulate and encourage ourselves with the methods of our British friends at all times. Because there are many points in common between China and Britain, only British friends can

truly understand and appreciate China's difficulties and the crux of the problem. We do not need to repeat all the words that the distinguished guests have disclosed in the newspapers in recent days, we only

feel a kind of closeness and resonance.

Second, what we want to point out is that although Britain is currently

experiencing unprecedented economic hardship, its national strength has been greatly diminished, and its vitality cannot be easily restored for a time: Britain still occupies an extremely important

position in world, especially European, politics. The situation in Europe is truly riddled with holes and about to collapse

. The Communist International is taking advantage of the situation, engulfing half of the country, and placing it all within the "Iron Curtain" in one fell swoop. Although the United States is advocating aid to Europe with unparalleled strength,

and acting as a pillar of strength in spirit, trying to turn the tide,

the only country that echoes and seeks help from the United States is Britain. Britain's situation in

Europe is the same as China's in Asia. Today, China

is experiencing an unprecedentedly bad time, but as long as China's independence and sovereignty

are not lost, the red flames of poison will never be able to rage in Asia, and the tranquility of the Far East will never be shaken. Today, the situation of China and Britain is truly what is called "a dark and stormy night, but the cock crows incessantly," and the heaviness of their hearts

cannot be understood by outsiders.

Third, we believe that the insight and vision of the British are worthy of admiration. During the eight years of the War of Resistance and up to now, the overall situation in the Far East has undergone

tremendous changes, and China's situation is dangerous and shocking. There has been much international

criticism and praise! Only Britain, for many years, has not given us excessive praise, nor has it criticized us for perfection. They have always made calm observations and calmly stated fair opinions, which is worthy of our gratitude.

In short, we have unlimited hopes for the arrival of the British delegation to China. We believe that in the future, the tranquility of the Far East and

the understanding and cooperation between China and Britain are as important as the cooperation and mutual assistance between China and the United States. We especially believe that the British government's recent changes in colonial policy

are extremely wise. Perhaps some people will lament the decline

of the British Empire because of this, but they do not know that this action of Britain has added some goodwill and sympathy to Great Britain. How can those who are obsessed with the wreckage estimate this psychological gain?

The current British government figures are far-sighted and have penetrating vision. How can they only focus on narrow calculations in front of them?

In addition, there is one more point that this newspaper's editorial yesterday already mentioned, and

today we would like to reiterate, which is the issue of China's inland river navigation rights. According to the British friends' view, it seems that it is permissible to open

China's inland river navigation to Britain, because Britain's inland river navigation is also open to other countries, and they say that Chinese

ships can go to New York, Boston, and the Danube, so why can't British ships go to inland ports in China? As far as we know, among all the countries in the world, only Britain

opens its inland rivers. But in fact, for the past 150 years, the world's maritime rights have been completely in the hands of Britain, so

although British inland rivers are open, no country's ships have taken advantage of them. Other countries protect their inland river navigation rights. Even the United States, which shares the same culture and is also a major maritime power as Britain,

protects its inland river navigation rights. Not only does it protect inland river navigation rights, but also, in terms of the railway bureau, it has formulated

inspection laws to promote the use of American ships for the export of goods, in order to prevent the outflow of interests. This is one point. Secondly, if

Chinese ships can go to New York and Boston as an example, then foreign ships can now

go to Shanghai and Guangzhou. Shanghai is fifteen miles away from the Wusongkou, and is not

a seaport, but there is no doubt that it cannot be compared to the opening of inland river navigation rights. This is the second point. As for using the Danube River as an example, we all know that

the Danube River is an international waterway, and cannot be compared to any inland river. This is the third point

. Based on these three points, we have always believed that the protection of inland river navigation rights

cannot be changed. Of course, doing so is a heavy burden on our country's economy. Because important foreign

materials can be transported to inland ports such as Nanjing and Hankou, the cost of loading, unloading, and transshipment in Shanghai can be avoided. And this cost, given the high fluctuations in Shanghai's prices, is often more expensive than the entire freight from Britain. However, we must state that this is a matter of national

policy, and cannot be considered solely from the perspective of whether it is economically worthwhile for the country. Our position can be understood by all countries that have made arduous struggles in national economy and foreign trade. Britain is undoubtedly advanced in this regard. We believe that our position will eventually

gain their resonance.

This is the second time in the last ten years that a British delegation to China has come to China. The first time was during the war. We reporters met with British guests in the Jialing New Village in Chongqing. Since then, a Chinese delegation to Britain has been formed. Time flies quickly, and several years have passed in an instant. Today's situation is different from that time. And as the Shanghai Municipal Council said at the welcome banquet yesterday afternoon, there are still many difficulties lying in front of us that require the joint struggle of China and Britain. We would like to suggest that while the esteemed guests are taking a break and returning home, we should study and encourage each other together.

### Sir Almond Answers Reporters' Questions

"This newspaper reports" The British delegation of parliamentarians held a press conference at the municipal government auditorium at 11:00 a.m. yesterday.

Many Chinese and foreign reporters from this city attended.

Mr. MacFarlane, Director of the British Information Office, was also present.

Sir Almond, the head of the delegation, gave brief and general answers to the written questions raised by the reporters.

The details are as follows: The negotiations on the Sino-British Trade Agreement

are not within the scope of the delegation's duties, so it is inconvenient to answer. As for the issue of Britain sending experts to China, if China agrees, Britain is very willing to send them. The delegation will do its best to promote this. Britain has previously sent experts to India to

assist in agricultural improvements. As for the difficulty of British commercial firms in China in rotation, it is being negotiated by the relevant authorities of China and Britain. Regarding the pension issue for the former employees dismissed by the Public Works Bureau, it is being handled by the Chinese authorities, and it is believed that it will be fair and reasonable. Regarding the issue of China opening inland river navigation, the delegation is inconvenient to answer, because this delegation is purely a group to promote friendship and has not participated in this negotiation. However, it is willing to make any suggestions to enhance the friendship between your countries. Regarding the issue of Hong Kong's return to China, the delegation is inconvenient to answer. Regarding Britain's wartime losses and the recovery plan, during the war, Britain's civil industries turned into military industries by as much as

47 percent. Overseas investment losses are more than

half, and foreign debt has increased sharply. In addition to strengthening production and exports, the recovery plan will strictly limit the import of non-essential goods. If you pay attention to the British Parliament's essays, you will definitely understand everything. Regarding the situation of the British newspaper industry after the war, freedom of speech has increased considerably. The issue of Britain limiting its own industrial standards is not within the scope of this delegation's answers. The historical city of Beijing and the commercial center of Tianjin have made excellent impressions, especially the warm friendship of the people in North China, which will be deeply remembered.

### Guangdong Province Intensifies Bandit Suppression

[Continued from the previous page] Director Zhang Fa-kui of the Guangzhou Headquarters and Chairman Song Zi-wen negotiated with General Li Fu-lin, a senior general in Guangdong and a member of the Central Committee, to take on an important position in a certain pacification area. It is reported that Li has agreed to this and expressed that he will do his best to assist the government in mobilizing his old troops to organize self-defense forces to suppress bandits and quell the chaos. Li recently summoned his old troops to discuss the matter, and the result was that if they wanted to pacify the banditry in the province, it was estimated that they would have to form an armed force equivalent to ten regiments of the National Army before they could succeed. Director Zhang and Chairman Song have agreed to this in principle, and it is reported that Song said that the required armed equipment can be planned and decided by the end of the month.

[Another dispatch] It is reported that Chairman Song is organizing a political secret investigation team to secretly expose corrupt officials at any time in order to rectify the officialdom in Guangdong Province. It is said that this organization will be responsible for by veteran revolutionaries who have remained in Guangzhou.

### Mr. Rooks' Report to Reporters

(Continued from the previous page) The task of the committee is to continue the unfinished work of UNRRA and CNRRA, and to sell materials, such as a large amount of cotton that urgently needs to be sold off. The foreign exchange for the sale of these materials can be provided by the UNRRA Central Committee. The Central Committee may provide US$5 million to pay the salaries of foreign workers remaining in China who have not completed the training of technicians in Bubu A. In addition, the council can budget for the expenses of various necessary tasks, has the right to inspect various tasks, introduce the use of materials, and select management personnel.

Regarding the matter of supplying materials to the communist areas, Mr. Rooks stated that UNRRA's basic policy is to provide relief and supplies to all those in need, and is not limited to ethnicity, religion, or any political faction. He specifically raised this point when he met with Chairman Chiang this time. He said: I hope there may be a solution, but I am also deeply aware of the difficulties of the current situation.

Mr. Rooks specifically pointed out fishery measures in post-war reconstruction. He said: UNRRA plans to sell some of the fishing boats to Chinese private fishermen, but some of them must also be equipped with new equipment to create a complete enterprise to develop China's fishing industry. In addition, agricultural machinery and the Yellow River Flood Area Restoration Engineering Vision are all long-term tasks.

Mr. Rooks stated that the UNRRA organization in China will be closed at the end of this year, but a small number of personnel must be retained to handle internal closing matters, so the final closing will be around the end of March or April next year.

At yesterday's reception, Mr. Rooks repeatedly expressed his gratitude to our government, and expressed his deep gratitude to Mr. Cleveland, Director of the UNRRA China Office, Mr. Hubbell, Director of the CNRRA, and their staff, believing that the work of UNRRA and CNRRA was quite satisfactory.

### Business Targets Determined for Post-War Rehabilitation Commission; Organizational Regulations Passed by the Legislative Yuan

[Special dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st of this month] The Executive Yuan

has decided to establish a Post-War Rehabilitation Commission in order to coordinate with international relief supplies and continue to handle the post-war

rehabilitation and relief work that has not been completed after the closure of UNRRA and CNRRA. The organizational regulations of the commission were submitted to and passed by the Legislative Yuan meeting today. In the future, the commission's responsibilities will be: restoration work in the Yellow River Flood Area, fishing vessels and machine vessels, mechanized farming and the manufacture of agricultural implements, demonstration work in rural industries, and other unfinished post-war projects approved and assigned by the Executive Yuan. The commission will have a chairman and twelve members. The unfinished post-war projects of CNRRA will be transferred to the commission for takeover, and a Yellow River Flood Area Restoration Bureau will be established separately. The long-term post-war supplies donated by UNRRA will be handed over to a custody committee for management. The members of the committee will be hired from domestic people with social expectations and representatives from relevant UN agencies. The period from the establishment to the closure of the commission is set for a total of two years.

### Content of the Draft Agreement on Sino-Siamese Air Transportation

[Special dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st of this month] The draft agreement on Sino-Siamese air transportation was passed at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 21st. The agreement stipulates that both contracting countries agree that the agreement will be valid for four years and that the number of flights will be limited to once per week for the time being. Regarding the issue of shipping operations between Hong Kong and Shanghai, due to the special status of Hong Kong, other countries are not allowed to operate passenger and cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Our opinion is clearly stated in the footnote of the draft agreement. Regarding the early start of air transport operations, our side advocated that the Sino-Thai route should be opened before the formal signing of the agreement, and the Thai side has agreed. As for the route and commercial aviation station issues, during the negotiations between the two sides, the original draft of the Thai side proposed three routes, two of which were from Bangkok to Shanghai, and then to Japan and the United States. The other route was from Bangkok to Guangzhou and back to Bangkok. Our side only allowed the opening of one route and the opening of one place in Shanghai or Guangzhou as a commercial aviation station. Now both sides agree to one Bangkok-Shanghai route and the opening of Shanghai as a commercial aviation station.

### Overseas Chinese Carrying Foreign Currency Back to China; Review of Quota Provisions

[Special dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st of this month] The Legislative Yuan

held a regular meeting on the morning of the 21st. When discussing and amending Article 7 of the Regulations on Penalties for Buying and Selling Gold and Foreign Currency, Wang Quan and others appealed on behalf of the overseas Chinese returning to the country. According to the regulations: "Anyone who enters the country and carries foreign currency in their possession, except for US$100 or its equivalent in other currencies, must register with the customs for the amount exceeding the quota and exchange it for national currency at the local Central Bank or its entrusted exchange office on the day of entry. Those who conceal and fail to report after being questioned by the customs shall have it confiscated." This is very inconvenient for overseas Chinese who return to their original place after returning to the country. President Sun also believes that the convenience of returning overseas Chinese should be taken into consideration. For example, if an overseas Chinese carries US$10,000 back to the country, only US$100 is allowed to be imported, and the remaining US$9,900 must be exchanged for national currency. When they leave the country, they must exchange the national currency for US dollars again, which will result in a considerable loss. If it is stipulated that US$100 can be imported and the excess is allowed to be deposited in the bank and withdrawn when they leave the country, it would be more fair. It was decided to return this case for review.

### National YWCA Convention; Listening to Work Reports from Various Groups

The morning prayer on the 21st was originally scheduled to be led by a Japanese representative, but it was changed to a reading of the prayer by Secretary-General Wu Simo due to the representative's absence.

Afterwards, a general meeting was held, and Ms. Owen, the British representative, reported on the results of the small group discussions, which were hotly discussed. In the afternoon, two groups went on tours, one to the Jianqiao Air Force School and the other to the Beishan District, and visited Zhijiang University. The Korean representative was invited to sing. At noon on the 22nd,

Mayor Zhou will hold a banquet for all the representatives in the Provincial Government Auditorium.

one has recognized it yet.

### Trade Between China and Hong Kong; Both Imports and Exports Increase; More than 10 Million Hong Kong Dollars in Exports Last Month

imports to Hong Kong in September were worth a total of 32,943,056

Hong Kong dollars, while Hong Kong's imports to China

totaled 21,483,922 Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, China's exports to Hong Kong this month

total imports in September have increased to more than 133 million Hong Kong dollars,

while Hong Kong's exports for the month totaled

118 million Hong Kong dollars. Imports increased by 11 percent compared to August, and exports increased by 64 percent compared to August.

### Qiongdong Railway; Repaired and Open to Traffic

hurricanes, floods, and bandits over the years, resulting in a state of paralysis. After the Railway Bureau made efforts to repair it in the spring, it was fully repaired and opened to traffic on the 18th of this month.

counties in the Pacification Zone and launch county administration work.

### Shanghai Cotton Industry Appeals; Joint Office Promises to Consider

[Special dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st of this month] Ten representatives from the Shanghai Municipal

Cotton Business Association, including Liu Pingsun,

went to the Joint Office on the morning of the 20th to

request the cancellation of the method of requiring cotton deposits based on yarn mill orders. Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan received them.

He said that the opinions expressed by the representatives

were very reasonable and promised to reconsider them. In the afternoon, they went

to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Chen Qitian said that the decision-making power on this matter was in the Central Bank, and he would conduct close research with Zhang Jia'ao and Xu Baiyuan. Chen also hoped that the Cotton Association

would quickly change the old scale to the market scale in the Shanghai area

in order to achieve uniformity. The representatives of the association have agreed to implement it from November

1st.

### National Cotton Harvest; A Total of 11 Million Piculs; A New Record in the Past 11 Years

[Special dispatch from Beiping on the 21st of this month] This

year's national cotton

harvest is a new

record in the past 11

years. The national

total output reaches

11 million dan,

an increase of 4

million dan compared

to last year. Feng Zefang, Deputy Director of the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, told reporters: 1936 was the year with the highest output since China planted cotton. The national output reached 17 million dan. In that year, the national cotton demand was sufficient for self-sufficiency. Although this year's output is still lower than that of 1936, it is fortunate to have this output after the war. This year, 21 cotton ginning factories will be established nationwide to concentrate cotton ginning in order to purchase fine seeds and benefit the promotion in the coming year. In terms of purchasing, they will cooperate as much as possible with yarn mills such as China Textile and Shenxin, because there is a lack of foreign exchange this year, and the yarn mills can no longer purchase American cotton, so it is urgent to solve the raw material problem domestically. Recently, various yarn mills will send personnel with funds to the designated cotton ginning factories to purchase cotton. In addition, the China Agricultural Corporation has allocated 300 billion to establish the China Agricultural Transportation Company, which also takes the purchase of cotton as its main business. Feng said: This year, the summer rain in the Yangtze River area was abundant, the temperature was high enough, and there was no autumn rain, which was most suitable for cotton growth, and the production was particularly abundant. Hubei Province alone produced 2.4 million dan (ranking first in the country), and Jiangsu produced 1.7 million dan (ranking second). Unfortunately, more than 1 million dan of Shaanxi cotton could not be transported out due to the obstruction of the Longhai Railway, resulting in heavy losses to the country and the local area.

### Bandit Extortion and Sabotage; Hong Kong-Guangdong Transportation Suspended

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, Evening 11] Bandits in Guangdong Province

recently extorted protection donations from Chinese commercial transport companies. One company refused to pay, and the bandits destroyed a ship with a time bomb. Due to fear of bandit retaliation, two Hong Kong-Guangdong passenger ships

have withdrawn from the route, leaving only one selling third-class tickets, resulting in extreme crowding for passengers.

### Yellow River Autumn Flood Season Coming to an End; Residents Along the River Will Celebrate Peace

annual peace celebration festival. The dangerous works from Huayuankou in Zheng County to Liuhekou in Bian County have all been completed. The embankment works in the Yangzhuang area below Lanxia Tongganxiang will also be repaired and blocked in the near future. In addition to preparing for ice prevention works, the Henan Repair and Prevention Office has decided to launch a mass tree planting and afforestation campaign along the river in the near future to strengthen the embankment.

### French Delegation Drafts a Ten-Year Plan for Sichuan; Sending Experts and Lending Funds to Assist

### Full Text of Speaker Pan's Welcome Speech at the Reception for the British Parliamentary Delegation to China

(Continued from page one) Speaker Pan delivered a welcome speech at the reception for the British Parliamentary Delegation to China. The full text is as follows:

Distinguished members of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, Mayor Wu, honored guests: Today, I have the opportunity to represent the Shanghai Municipal Council in welcoming the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, and I feel deeply honored and delighted. I believe that all my colleagues on the council share my particular pleasure, because as members of a local council, we often regard the British legislative system as the "Mother of Parliaments." I dare to imagine that you gentlemen, upon arriving in Shanghai, will feel a special sense of intimacy, as if you have come home, because for more than a hundred years, Shanghai has been the most prominent place for cooperation between Chinese and foreign individuals, especially between Chinese and British individuals. Over the past century, the cooperation between Chinese and British individuals in Shanghai has led to significant progress in economic, commercial, and cultural terms, benefiting both Chinese and foreign individuals. Today, in my capacity as the Speaker of the Municipal Council, I would like to express the sentiments of all the councilors here, that although the environment in Shanghai has changed, the spirit of cooperation between the Chinese and British people, and even between Chinese and foreign individuals, will be further promoted and enhanced due to the abolition of unequal treaties. Shanghai is an international city, and as the elected representatives of Shanghai, we certainly do not want to seek to implement a "closed-door" policy. We hope that international cooperation will create a greater, more prosperous, and more beautiful Shanghai. All Shanghai residents, regardless of nationality or belief, should work together to make Shanghai a city they can be proud of.

In many ways, the current situation in Shanghai is related to the overall situation in China. In addition to suffering greatly from inflation and a shortage of supplies, the citizens are also being subjected to deceitful words and harmful rhetoric aimed at destabilizing Shanghai by those with ulterior motives. The fundamental difficulties facing Shanghai today, such as the obstruction of material supplies and trade, can only be resolved when the Chinese Communists abandon their method of using force as a tool for political struggle.

I believe that during your travels, you gentlemen will see many other cities in other countries that have suffered even more damage than Shanghai. From a purely material point of view, Shanghai seems extremely fortunate, but as an organic city, it has suffered great pain. After eight years of war and four years of occupation, the municipal organization and public welfare undertakings created by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the French Concession over many years have fallen into a state of disintegration. During this period, Shanghai's roads were in disrepair, parks were overgrown, and the underground sewer system was damaged due to lack of maintenance. When our administration took over Shanghai after the victory, Shanghai was no longer the vibrant and orderly city it once was, but a city with disintegrated public and private organizations, leaving only an empty shell. Rebuilding Shanghai is a difficult task, virtually starting from scratch, patching up the potholes in the roads, sweeping away the garbage, starting to rebuild the underground sewer system, and the surge in population has made the city's housing and transportation problems extremely serious. During the concession era, of course, no preparations were made to supply the needs of nearly five million residents. The planning of streets, buildings, and public utilities did not take into account the need to meet the demands of nearly five million residents. Therefore, it is obvious that all expansion and reconstruction work cannot be done to ideal satisfaction in a short period. The enemy puppets took eight years to directly and indirectly destroy Shanghai, and the time required for our reconstruction work may take at least that long. Over the past two years, we have been determined to do what we can with limited funds, and under the capable leadership of Mayor Wu, we have made a good start. We sincerely hope that friends from other countries can understand the difficulties and complexities of our problems, and in turn, assist us in completing the arduous task of modernizing and rebuilding Shanghai.

I believe that because you and the people of your country are facing your own crisis with unwavering courage and determination, you will be able to understand the difficult problems of China and Shanghai. Because China fought alone for four years, other countries had time to organize their forces and prepare. The deaths of our soldiers and civilians, the destruction of cities, and the desolation of fields have allowed other countries to prepare calmly. You gentlemen, during your travels throughout China, must have witnessed the tragic results of eight years of destruction. Railways have been destroyed, and reconstruction will take several years. The people all have tired and sorrowful expressions. All of this is the result of the heavy blow of war. But at that time, we bravely endured the pain without complaint, because we firmly believed that after the end of the war, the Allied countries that were more fortunate and not directly destroyed by the war would be grateful for our sacrifice and assist us in our reconstruction. On this point, we still have deep faith. We do not consider it shameful to ask for foreign aid to restore China's pre-war economic stability, because we deserve the assistance of friendly nations. China and the Chinese people have already paid the price with their lives, broken homes, and vast disaster areas during eight years of bitter fighting. If the situation were reversed, China would certainly have provided assistance to the Allied countries that suffered harm at the time, without hesitation and without making commercial calculations. Under our traditional Confucian thought, we consider it a responsibility, a way of interacting.

Because you are friends of China, you are certainly saddened by China's current internal strife and political instability. But because you are experienced politicians with a clear understanding of the international situation, you undoubtedly know that our country's political problems are not a purely internal matter.

I do not want to deliberately alarm you, but in China, you are witnessing the opening of an even greater struggle. However, many people in our country believe that, as in the case of the "July 7th Incident," our country will again stand on the front line of a major struggle, in which all people are bound to be threatened. In the past week, the organization of the Comintern Information Bureau in Belgrade has attracted the attention of people all over the world, but for the Chinese people, this is not news. Long before this organization, there was already a similar institution in China, under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, including all communist organizations in Asia. If the European Comintern is a threat and a challenge, then China has been threatened for a long time. You gentlemen all know that the Chinese people are a peaceful nation. We are willing to live in peace in order to carry out reconstruction. After the Yalta Secret Agreement (an agreement we did not participate in), we paid the price stipulated in the agreement without complaint. This is the most profound expression of our desire for peace. At that time, we believed that our sacrifices were the price paid for the benefit of all Allied countries. Today, we feel that since China has suffered sacrifices for the common interests of the Allied countries, it should not bear all the evil consequences of this matter alone.

I said just now that you, the members of the delegation to China, and the people of your country, because you yourselves are overcoming the crisis with courage and determination, will certainly be able to understand our problems and tragedies. Our two great nations are in a common difficult situation, and at the same time, we are facing a common threat. I deeply feel that our success depends on our joint efforts. On this day of sincerely welcoming you, allow me to propose a toast to the health of the King of England, and to the success of our common struggle.

### Sir Ammon's Response

Speaker Pan concluded his speech. Sir Ammon stood up and responded, welcoming Speaker Pan's statement: "We certainly do not want to seek to implement a closed-door policy, and hope that international cooperation will create a greater, more prosperous, and more beautiful Shanghai." Sir Ammon praised the rapid reconstruction of Shanghai, and said that although the United Kingdom could not provide China with material assistance in the past month, it had deep sympathy for China's reconstruction. Sir Ammon emphasized that the cooperation between China and the United Kingdom would enhance the interest of peace-loving countries in working for peace.

### U.S. State Department Responds to Molotov, Rejects Withdrawal of Occupation Forces from Korea, Entire Plan Awaits UN Handling, Vyshinsky Sharply Criticizes U.S. Policy

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] The United States has effectively rejected the Soviet proposal for the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from Korea in early 1948, stating that the entire issue of Korean independence must now await a decision by the United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. State Department today released a note from Acting Secretary of State Lovett to Foreign Minister Molotov, pointing out that the United States has placed the issue of establishing an independent Korean government on the agenda of the General Assembly. The U.S. government believes that the withdrawal of occupation forces from Korea should be seen as an integral part of the solution to the entire issue. According to Secretary of State Marshall's letter to UN Secretary-General Lie on Friday of last week, it was recommended that the United Nations establish a committee to hold elections in Korea in early February next year, followed by preparations for the withdrawal of troops.

[New Asia News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st] The Soviet delegation to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, led by Mr. Shetekov, departed from Seoul at 1:00 PM today and arrived at Pyongyang Airport at 1:55 PM, following government orders. Before his departure, Mr. Shetekov made a brief statement condemning the U.S. delegation for deliberately making it impossible to implement the Moscow Agreement in Korea.

[Central News Agency, Flushing, 20th] Soviet representative Vyshinsky today criticized the U.S. proposal for UN supervision of elections to establish a democratic government in Korea, and the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from the entire Korean peninsula. In a speech to the General Assembly on the Greek issue, Mr. Vyshinsky accused the U.S. proposal of making the elections in Korea similar to the previous elections in Greece. He believed that such elections were neither free nor democratic. He said that the letter from U.S. representative Austin to UN Secretary-General Lie on the Korean issue indicated that the U.S. government proposed to hold elections in Korea and withdraw its troops after the establishment of a Korean national government. In other words, the U.S. government was determined to hold elections in Korea in the manner of Greece, under the cover of its armed forces, and it was expected that real abuses would be discovered in the elections.

### U.S. Indicates Willingness to Use Force to Prevent Aggression Against Greece, Soviets Oppose Establishment of Balkan Observer Group

[United Press, Flushing, 21st] U.S. representative Johnson delivered a broadcast speech today, dismissing Soviet attacks on U.S. plans for Greece and Korea and warning that the United States may use force to protect Greece. Johnson said, "If the Balkan cohorts of the Soviet Union persist in aggression against Greece, the United States will be prepared to cooperate with other countries of the United Nations to implement any measures recommended by the General Assembly to defend Greece." Johnson did not explicitly discuss the use of military force, but another U.S. spokesperson said that Johnson meant to clarify this point when he made this statement. However, it was generally emphasized that if the United States uses military force, it must first cooperate with other countries and must first have the recommendation of the General Assembly, the passage of which requires a two-thirds majority.

Johnson also said that if an observer committee cannot be established, Greece will suffer more aggression as a result, and other countries will also suffer new aggression. Prior to Johnson's speech, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky flatly rejected the proposal to establish a Balkan "observer" committee at the General Assembly.

[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 20th] To prevent the establishment of the United Nations Balkan Observer Committee, Soviet representative Vyshinsky today urged the General Assembly to reject the results of the discussions of the General Assembly's Political Committee, pointing out that there was no sufficient evidence to prove that Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia had assisted the Greek anti-government forces. The establishment of the United Nations Balkan Observer Committee is contrary to the United Nations Charter and the sovereignty of the Balkan countries. The only way to restore peace in the Balkans is to force British and American military missions to withdraw from Greece immediately and establish a special committee to supervise American aid to Greece. Polish representative Lange then submitted the following resolution, stating, "The General Assembly, after reviewing the issue of threats to Greek political independence and territorial integrity, and the opinions expressed by the various delegations, recommends that all foreign troops withdraw from Greece immediately, and that all foreign military instructors and military experts be recalled from Greece immediately. The General Assembly also requests that the governments concerned report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations no later than January 1, 1948 on the progress of the implementation of this recommendation." U.S. representative Johnson stated that if it is necessary to convene a special session of the General Assembly to review the threat to Greek political independence and territorial integrity, the U.S. government is prepared to cooperate with other member states of the United Nations to implement any measures recommended by the General Assembly to protect Greece. The purpose of the United States' policy toward Greece is only this, and there are no other motives, nor is it seeking material rewards. The specific issue at hand is to find a way to prevent aggression, and it is most appropriate to seek solutions to such issues with common strength. This is a challenge for the United Nations organization, and also an opportunity. The U.S. government will join other governments in meeting this challenge and improving this opportunity.

### Most Silk Weaving Factories Go on Strike, Evaluation Committee Strictly Orders Resumption, Resolution of Disputes Should Be Complied With

[Report from this newspaper] In Shanghai East, Shanghai West, and the 43rd District of this city, more than 400 silk weaving factories have largely gone on strike since yesterday. More than 200 factory representatives

went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition around 3:30 PM, sending representatives Yao Xintao, Qian Xubao, Liu Qingyi, and others to meet with Director Wu. Because yesterday was the 14th regular meeting of the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee, Secretary-General Yan Esheng of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce attended the meeting on behalf of Xu Guangji from the Social Affairs Bureau. Yan asked the representatives of the petitioners to explain the situation. The emotions of the factory owners were very激昂. In May of this year, due to the poor business conditions of the silk weaving industry and the inability to bear high

labor costs, they requested a reduction in wages. After the 13th meeting of the Evaluation Committee ruled to reduce wages, labor disputes such as strikes and slow work occurred, and the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation was ineffective. Subsequently,

the electricity and tramway strikes occurred in this city. To stabilize production and cope with the emergency situation, the Evaluation Committee drew up another

eight-item solution and ordered both parties to comply. Therefore, the employers believe that the emergency situation of the labor strike no longer exists, and the business difficulties of the silk weaving industry remain the same. They have no ability to implement the eight-item solution in the second instruction of the Evaluation Committee and demand remedies. Chang Jing Bao Esheng promised to put this opinion to the evaluation committee,

and the representatives of the factories withdrew to listen to the results of the meeting.

### Evaluation Committee Holds 14th Meeting

[Report from this newspaper] The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee of this city held

its 14th meeting yesterday, chaired by Director Wu Kaixian, to discuss the following important cases:

The wage dispute in the silk weaving industry was previously adjudicated by this committee. Subsequently, disputes arose between labor and management. To deal with the situation, this committee considered and determined

eight solutions and issued instructions for compliance, requesting ratification. Resolution: A. Labor and management may not apply for disagreement with the evaluation methods, as clearly stipulated by the Labor-Management Evaluation. This time, the labor and management of the industry

expressed objections to the evaluation methods of the 13th meeting of this committee, which is inappropriate. Since the Director of this committee has taken emergency measures to consider the emotions of both parties, this committee should ratify it. However, this method is provisionally allowed to be implemented for four months. The factories that went on strike yesterday should strictly order the labor to resume production immediately. B. If some factories cannot bear the above methods, both parties may formulate their own methods.

Case of employer in the leather shoe industry requesting wage reduction

, after discussion, considering that the industry's situation has improved, it is temporarily not allowed.

Method for factories to dismiss workers with indefinite contracts and pay severance pay, Resolution: A. If the factory is operating at a loss or is indeed unable to maintain operations, as verified by the competent authority, the severance pay may be reduced by this committee. B. Seasonal factories that cannot operate year-round, their shutdown should not be regarded as dismissal. C. Violations of factory regulations that have been submitted to the competent authority for approval, with confirmed evidence, are allowed to be dismissed without severance pay.

### Evaluation of Workers' Holidays for Two Public Utility Companies

which are not easy to change, follow

the original methods. If there is no

(7 days for service of 1 to 5 years, 10 days for 5 to 10 years, 14 days for more than 10 years) for negotiation. C. Marriage leave should be deducted from annual leave. D. Bereavement leave shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of this committee.

### Labor Union Calls for General Meeting, Question of Continued Wages

Labor

union calls

member

meeting, case of employer still paying wages. Resolution

: A. All factories, companies, and firms that have holidays stipulated by the Factory

Law or agreed upon, the labor union should hold member or representative meetings on statutory holidays. B. All factories, companies, and firms without fixed holidays should be allowed to take leave and pay wages when the labor union holds member or representative meetings, but the meeting period should be limited to what is stipulated in the labor union's constitution

and approved by the competent authority. If elected as a representative to the city labor union, city general labor union, national general labor union, or the national federation of the industry, the vacation period should be approved by the employer based on the actual situation. C. Factories, companies, and firms with fixed holidays that normally work on general holidays and add overtime wages, labor

should be allowed to take leave but not pay overtime wages when holding member or representative meetings. D. Labor union

memberships under 300 people may apply in advance to the competent authority to hold member meetings.

Those with more than 300 people should hold representative

meetings to avoid affecting production. E. The labor union

should send the list of attending representatives to the employer three days in advance when holding a representative meeting. F. If a member or representative of the labor union

has been granted leave by the employer to attend the member general meeting or representative

meeting, and is absent without reason during the meeting, the labor union should send

the list to the employer to deduct wages.

### Water Company Requests Price Increase, Public Utilities Bureau Temporarily Does Not Consider

[Report from this newspaper] The prices of public utilities such as electricity, telephone,

gas, tramway, bus, ferry,

and small train in this city have been adjusted since yesterday. Only the water price was not adjusted this time,

because it had been adjusted once in September, so it will temporarily maintain the original price. Now, the various water companies have negotiated with the Public Utilities Bureau when adjusting in September that if

the price increases by 10%, they should still be allowed to increase prices.

Now, the price increase has long exceeded 10%, and the various companies have reported losses. Therefore, they requested the

Public Utilities Bureau to approve another adjustment to more than 4,000 yuan per cubic meter. (The current price for British and French companies is 2,500 yuan per cubic meter.

The price for Zhabei, Inland, and Pudong companies is 2,900 yuan per cubic meter). According to Director Zhao, regarding the water company's request for a price increase,

it will not be considered this month and will be discussed again next month.

### Strengthen Economic Police, Economic Section Plans to Become Independent

"Report from this newspaper"

police work by making the current economic section independent.

will have five units: finance, food, yarn, fuel, and

military daily necessities, and plans to place the original

economic police brigade under the jurisdiction of the section. However,

it will still maintain contact with the various groups under the Economic Inspection Association during work.

### Frugal Banquets Cause Restaurant Cries, Chinese and Western Restaurants Experience Sharp Business Decline, Private Kitchens Emerge

[Report from this newspaper] Since the implementation of banquet frugality on the 20th, Chinese and Western

restaurants have mostly been able to comply. Small restaurants are less affected by frugality,

but larger Chinese and Western restaurants have experienced a sharp decline in business, and are all complaining. For example,

Fengzelou's business has declined by almost half. Therefore, some restaurants feel that future business will be difficult due to reduced income. According to Zhou Dunxiang, executive director of the Restaurant Industry Association,

the restaurant industry generally agrees with and is willing to adhere to the principle of frugality, but the implementation of banquet frugality has indeed led to a sharp decline in the business of various restaurants. This is undeniable.

Because the restaurant's business has decreased, the income of waiters and tea

servers has also decreased. Larger

restaurants are particularly affected and almost feel unable to maintain operations.

At the same time, due to price restrictions and the prohibition of selling valuable seafood in restaurants,

some private kitchens have emerged, still selling various expensive

dishes at greatly increased prices. For example, a portion of shark fin, which originally sold for 60,000 yuan in restaurants, now costs as much as

120,000 yuan. Now the regulation of six dishes and one soup

is priced at a maximum of 1.2 million yuan. In fact, the original

1.2 million yuan dishes are definitely more than six dishes and one soup.

Therefore, many people who originally planned banquets have declined. Now, due to the implementation of frugality regulations,

many seafood chefs are no longer needed, which inevitably leads to unemployment. Moreover, wealthy households can still buy expensive seafood

and cook it themselves. They will definitely not be frugal because restaurants do not

sell them. This will only lead to higher seafood prices. The restaurant industry believes that in this extraordinary period,

frugality should be the norm, but hopes that the regulations can be slightly more flexible so that the restaurant industry

can maintain its business.

### Fourth General Assembly of the Senate, Resumption Scheduled for the 31st

"Report from this newspaper"

The Fourth General Assembly of the Shanghai Municipal Senate

will continue

its meeting on the

31st of this month.

The agenda has been

set for the 31st

from 9:00 AM to

meeting to discuss proposals, from 3:00 PM to

7:00 PM, the ninth meeting to discuss proposals. November 1st, from 9:00 AM

to 12:00 PM, the tenth meeting to discuss proposals, from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM, the eleventh

meeting to discuss proposals, and then hold

the closing ceremony.

### Explaining Two Points to Reporters

"Also Reported" The restaurant industry, due to the

price limit

method for banquets, caused the outside world to misunderstand because the maximum amount exceeded

the general market price, especially since the prices are high. Therefore, they specially invited the press yesterday to

explain two points: The price limit is limited upwards but not downwards.

For example, the banquet is set at a maximum of 1.2 million,

a minimum of 600,000; however, small and medium-sized restaurants are willing to sell at low prices

of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, or economic meals are willing to sell for

less than 10,000 yuan, they are still free to do so.

Although the items in the frugal banquets have been reduced, the quantity still maintains

a certain standard, enough to satisfy the appetite of ten people at a table.

### Mrs. Sun and Mrs. Chiang Visit Book Exhibition Together

Other guests ordered as many as seventy or eighty paintings.

### Redeeming Land Illegally Acquired, Gold Price Calculation Breakthrough, Clearing Office Responds to Tao Derong Case

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Senate previously received a petition from citizen Tao Derong stating that his land located in the Yinxiang District

was forcibly acquired by the enemy and puppets during the occupation, requesting prompt return to alleviate the people's difficulties,

which was forwarded to the Central Trust Bureau for investigation. The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office of the Central Trust Bureau replied: The case has been decided by the 10th meeting of the small group committee for handling enemy and puppet requisitioned and acquired land, organized jointly by the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau,

to allow the original price received from the enemy and puppets to be calculated based on the market price of gold,

and ordered the applicant to pay the money and take it back. Once the pricing procedures are completed, Tao Derong will be notified to handle it.

It is still a novel idea to redeem land forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets based on the market price of gold.

### 2 Trillion Yuan of Capital, Frozen Intangibly, Car Ownership Transfer Suspended, Municipal Senators Object

[Report from this newspaper] Municipal

Senators Tao Baichuan, Zhang Yiqu,

Zhang Naizuo, Yang Minghui,

Qu Yue, etc., believe that the Public Utilities

Bureau of this city suspended car

ownership transfers on the 14th of this month, which is detrimental

to the people. They sent a letter to Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu, stating

the reasons why this method should be canceled.

The main purpose

of the central government's restriction on private car use

is to strictly regulate

the qualifications for new

registration applications and to phase out

old cars to complete

the conservation work. The original method does not

expressly stipulate the suspension of car ownership transfers, because car ownership transfers

are transfers of ownership, not an increase in vehicles, which does not conflict with the restriction method,

and has absolutely no effect on the original intention of conservation. Moreover, old cars are one of the citizens'

movable assets, and the government should provide reasonable protection. According to the Municipal Government's policy report,

as of March of this year, there were 22,625 motorized vehicles registered with the Public Utilities Bureau. Assuming that the average price of each vehicle

is 100 million yuan, if car ownership transfers are suspended, then the citizens'

capital will be frozen intangibly at more than 2 trillion yuan. Think about the losses of the citizens.

The essence of conservation is to enrich the people, not to harm them.

The establishment of the Public Utilities Bureau is to benefit the people, not to harm them.

This kind of unilateral regulation has not been reviewed by the Senate. How can it be implemented without authorization before the Municipal Government announces it?

We have prepared a letter to report the situation, and we respectfully ask for your decision. We urge you to immediately consult the Municipal Government

and order the Public Utilities Bureau to promptly cancel the car ownership transfer suspension method

to benefit the citizens."

### Director Zhao Talks About Car Conservation, First Step is to Prevent Wasteful Design Fees

[Report from this newspaper] The car conservation in this city is currently being carefully studied and formulated by the Public Utilities Bureau, inviting relevant agencies.

It is planned to submit it to the municipal government meeting for approval this month and implement it from next month. According to Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao

Huijue, who told reporters yesterday: The principle of the implementation method is that the first

step is to prevent waste. Those who own more than one vehicle will be reduced first.

In order to prevent them from registering under multiple names, the Public Utilities Bureau is checking the registration

forms. If several cars belong to one owner, they will still be reduced. The second step is to eliminate non-essential vehicles in batches by lottery. The implementation method needs to be implemented step by step.

Otherwise, it will be unfair if those who own several vehicles are not eliminated, while those who only own one

are selected. Therefore, the lottery elimination system is not implemented first. As for the standards for those who are qualified to use cars, in addition to

agencies, banks, factories, and businesses related to people's livelihood, etc., the central government only stipulates

doctors. However, the situation in Shanghai is special. Lawyers, technicians, accountants, etc. also need to use cars in their work. Therefore,

the implementation rules being formulated will supplement the standards set by the central government. In short, there are many cars in this city, and it is very troublesome to implement conservation.

In order to prevent loopholes, we do not demand details when formulating the implementation rules

in order to seek perfection.

### Relocated Sichuan-Guizhou Factories United Association Suggests Four Points on Applying for Price-Matched Compensation Materials

[Report from this newspaper] The Relocated Sichuan-Guizhou

Factories United Association held

a temporary meeting of members in Shanghai

yesterday at the Dagon Vocational School on Emei Road.

First, Hu Juewen, the executive director of the association, reported on the association's affairs.

Then, the entire meeting passed

four points of advice to the Executive Yuan on "Applying for Japanese

Compensation Materials at Matched Prices":

The price matching of Japanese compensation materials

should be based on the degree of damage and contribution of each factory during the war, and should not focus on national treasury

revenue. Those businesses that were relocated inland during the war and are still in the rear should have separate laws and regulations to give them preference.

The scope of allocation should be based on the ratio of losses between public and private enterprises, and should not be biased. The internal relocated factories should be given priority in the allocation and given the largest quota, followed by the new

factories during the war, and finally the factories that have not been relocated inland can be allocated. The management methods after allocation can be entrusted to relevant industrial and commercial groups to formulate themselves. Whether it is cooperative management or joint management, many disputes can be avoided. Regarding the point that each factory should assist the authorities in studying the Japanese compensation issue, the association has launched a representative to conduct research together with the representatives of the Hunan-Guizhou factories.

[Report from this Newspaper]

Lawyer Lu Weimin

and his wife Jiang Zhaodi

from Guanlong, Lane 136,

Kunshan Road,

were sued by Soochow University student Yuan Zhengzhi for assault and restricting freedom. The case was heard by Judge Zhu in Criminal Court No. 8 of the District Court yesterday morning. According to the plaintiff's account: At 11:05 PM on September 25,

Yuan and his classmate Qin Minliang, returning from arranging a meal with classmates, found the school gates closed. They

consulted Jiang Beiqing, the landlord of Guanlong, Lane 136, Kunshan Road, requesting that Jiang open the iron gate of the lane

so they could call for classmates from the dormitory next to the fence to open the school gates. Jiang refused, citing that Yuan and others had not interacted with him much before, leaving Yuan and others without options. When a tenant of the lane returned home, Qin Minliang

followed him inside,

and calling out next to the fence,

Jiang's wife Zhaodi suddenly

rushed out and cursed. When they

argued, it led to a fight. While they were wrestling, Lu

Weimin also arrived and asked Yuan, "What are you?" Yuan replied that he was a university student. Lu insulted him, saying, "Bullshit university student," and then began to assault him as well. After mediation by Chen Chenghuan and Wu Guoan, members of the Asia East Problem Research Association, Lu

detained Yuan for over ten minutes. Soochow classmates, upon hearing the news, reported it to the Hongkou Police Bureau, who took Jiang Zhaodi to the bureau. Afterwards, Yuan filed a lawsuit in the District Court against Lu and Jiang for assault and restricting freedom. At the hearing yesterday morning,

Lu Weimin stated: He was the landlord of Lane 136 and had instructed the landlord not to let anyone into the lane at night unless they were residents.

That night, he heard the commotion

and went outside to inquire,

and upon learning they were Soochow students,

he told them that he was good friends with many Soochow professors and that there was no need for the commotion. He did not assault Yuan at the time.

Yuan Zhengzhi claimed: "Lu Weimin grabbed me and assaulted me, tore my clothes, and detained me for over ten minutes."

At this time, Soochow University Professor and lawyer Ma Junshuo happened to be in court to handle another case.

Lu's lawyer Chen Xintian then consulted with Ma, asking him

to mediate in his capacity as a professor. The court then instructed both parties

to try reconciliation outside of the court before further discussion.

### Five People, Including Stamp Tax Official, Indicted in the Star Grand Theater Stamp Forgery Case

Shunhua, chief

of the Stamp Tax

Division of the Direct

Tax Bureau, Ding

Jiachang, Chen Xing and Chen Yixin, employees of the Star Grand Theater, and a person named Xie Aifu,

were indicted by the District Procuratorate yesterday on charges of corruption, stamp forgery, and bribery.

In mid-May of this year, Xie Aifu went to the Jinshan Hotel to visit his cousin He Dianqi, the former county magistrate of Fengxian who had come to Shanghai. At He's residence, he met Chen Delai from Shengxian. The two became acquainted quickly, and during their conversation, Chen suddenly told Xie that the Star Grand Theater, which specialized in Yue Opera, often privately forged stamp tax tickets to evade taxes and should be reported. Xie immediately said that it would be easy, as he had an acquaintance at the Tax Bureau who was a division chief and could be informed.

On May 19, they invited Chen Shunhua and

Ding Jiachang to the Star Grand Theater for inspection, and several forged

tickets were found. Chen Xing and Chen Yixin, employees of the theater,

knowing that the matter had been exposed, requested Chen Shunhua and

Ding Jiachang to "help out," and they went together to the Continental Hotel

to "discuss the details." As a result, the Star Theater paid

Ding and others 40 million yuan. Later,

Ding and others ordered Chen Delai not to make further allegations. Chen said,

"Since I was the one who confidentially reported the matter, shouldn't there be a reward"? The report was made to the Direct Tax Bureau,

and after investigation and verification, the Tax Bureau submitted the case to the District Procuratorate for prosecution, charging

Chen Xing and Chen Yixin with forging stamp tax, Xie Aifu with bribery, and Chen Shunhua and Ding Jiachang with corruption.

### Pan Xulun's Nephew Acquitted - Shao Weirong Unsatisfied, Accuses Him Again of Forging a Seal

"Report from this Newspaper" The case of Pan Jiuru, nephew of Pan Xulun, abandoning his fiancée Shao Weirong, has been dismissed due to the amnesty decree. But Shao Weirong, unsatisfied, filed suit yesterday

accusing Pan Jiuru of forging a seal, stating: "The plaintiff, Shao Weirong,

became engaged to the defendant, Pan Jiuru, on November 8, 1945. The defendant claimed that the wedding would be held soon, luring the plaintiff to have relations with him in Wuxi. Afterwards, the wedding was delayed, and on July 24 of this year,

he married Xian Zhenfu in Shanghai. In mid-September, the plaintiff suddenly received a certificate of termination of the engagement from the defendant,

with the seals of both the man and woman and the certifying lawyer. The plaintiff had never known of any termination agreement with the defendant,

nor did she affix her seal to the termination certificate. The seal was clearly forged by the defendant. Moreover,

the termination of an engagement requires the consent of both parties. Now, Pan has not only married Ms. Gu in private,

but also forged a seal, committing a violation of Article 217, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, requesting that he be punished according to the law."

### Chinese Culture Originates from the Tao River - Geologist Pei Wenzhong Gains Academic Harvest - Large Sums of Money to be Raised Next Year to Go to Gansu to Continue Excavation Work

[Report from this Newspaper, Lanzhou, 18th] Renowned geologist Pei Wenzhong, at the beginning of July this

year, traveled from Pingliang, Shaanxi, to Gansu and immediately went to the Wei River, Tao River, and Da Xia River basins

to engage in archaeological work, lasting over three months. He has returned to Guanzhong (Shaanxi) before. Pei's

work in Gansu this time was limited by funds, so he only accompanied Mi Taiheng, a technician from the Northwest Branch of the Central Geological Survey,

and brought a small number of workers to work in the field. Wang Yongyan, a researcher at the Science Education Center, who

gained fame in China for discovering "Wudu Yuanren" (Wudu Man), also participated in the work in the Wei River basin. In August, Wang went to Wudu specifically

to continue collecting fossilized bones and also collected over three thousand pieces, returning to Lanzhou before. Pei

originally planned to go to Wudu for inspection, but later, considering the importance of work in the Tao River basin, changed

his original plan and did not go to Wudu. Pei collected a total of twelve

boxes of data this time, mostly pottery shards, stone tools, and other valuable

materials related to ancient human culture, from which

the activities of ancient humans in the upper reaches of the Yellow River can be traced.

Andersson Divides into Six Periods

According to Pei

told reporters

: The Swede

Andersson,

(J.G.Anderson), used to come to

Gansu and Qinghai to engage in archaeology. He divided

Chinese culture into six periods based on the painted pottery he discovered: "Qijia"

(this period is approximately 2,000 years before the Western calendar), "Yangshao" (this period is also known as Fengshan Period, which is the end of the Neolithic Age and connects with

the Copper Age), "Machang," "Xindian," "Siwa," "Shajing" (this period is approximately 500 years before the Christian era, during the Han Dynasty of China). After Anderson's thesis was published,

the academic community was skeptical of his "Qijia" period. Pei specifically

went to the Qijiaping area of Lintao for inspection and discovered ancient

human dwellings, proving that Andersson's theory had a basis.

Before the Han Dynasty There Were Lime Walls

However, according to

Pei,

"The Qijia"

period does not

seem to be the earliest, because judging from the utensils in the cliff dwelling, such as the "Li" (three-legged pottery) and the glass beads worn by women's skulls, they were definitely not

prehistoric humans, but there is no doubt that they were before the Han Dynasty.

Pei continued: "According to our historical records,

humans before the Han Dynasty did not live in buildings,

and this building already has lime walls, which is also

something that predecessors had not discovered. This can strengthen

our understanding of ancient cultural research."

Important Discovery in Academia

Regarding the

origin of Chinese

culture,

in the past, the academic

community only hypothesized that it originated from the Tao River and passed through the Wei River

basin, through Guanzhong (Shaanxi), before connecting with the Yellow River

basin to reach the Henan Plain. This was just speculation, and no archaeologist had

conducted an on-site inspection in the Wei River basin. Pei discovered a lot of painted pottery in the Wei

River basin this time, and the area where it was distributed was very wide, confirming that the culture of the Tao River and the Yellow River

basin was indeed connected to the Wei River basin. This is Pei's most important discovery and also

the most academically valuable harvest.

Raising Funds for Large-Scale Excavation

Pei last

night accepted

the invitation of

Xin Shuzhi,

the president of Lanzhou University,

and spoke the above words in the auditorium of the university. Today (the 18th), at the invitation of members of the Lanzhou Branch of the Geological Society of China,

he lectured on geological issues. According to Pei, this

is only the beginning of the work. He will take the twelve

boxes of materials he obtained back to Beiping soon to organize and study these materials. Next year, he will raise a large amount

of funds and invite famous Chinese archaeologists

and geologists to come to Gansu again to continue

the work of large-scale excavation. (Correspondent

### Hong Kong Football News: Kitchee Leads the Pack, Winning Against Chinese and South China; Star Island's Five Tigers Return to Hong Kong to Assist Chen

[Special Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Office] Football matches happen every year, but this year there are especially many, making one weary of watching them day after day. On Saturday the 11th, the First Division's Kitchee faced South China. The situation was one-sided, with Kitchee emerging as a dark horse. South China is not what it used to be, and Kitchee won decisively with a score of 5-1. The old and incapable South China was defeated by the rising Kitchee, which was to be expected. Despite fielding strong players such as Chen Dehui, Liang Rongzhao, and Liu Rongguang, the fighter Zhu Rongguang was too immature, leading to South China's crushing defeat. By halftime, they were already down 3-1, and they conceded two more goals in the second half, ending the game at 5-1.

South China Dominates; Fifteen Teams Participate in This Year's League

Apart from Star Island, which has yet to make an appearance, only Kitchee and Chinese have been consistently victorious. These two winning teams will clash this Thursday (the 16th). Star Island's second batch of players will arrive in Hong Kong around the 16th. This year, foreign players are largely ineffective, and the football scene will be dominated by Chinese players. The current league standings are as follows (as of October 12th):

Another Victory Against Chinese; The Most Exciting Match on Thursday the 16th

The two winning teams of the Chinese squad will clash. Kitchee is making every effort to beat Chinese. With the addition of five players from Star Island, Kitchee's attraction is even greater. Before 5 o'clock, the Naval Ground was already packed. Those who arrived late could only sigh at the gate. As the time arrived, the twenty-two warriors lined up on both sides:

Kitchee Team:

Zhu Zhaoheng

Zheng Ying, Hou Rongsheng

Zhen, Song Lingsheng, Liu Qingcai

Huang Jingzong, Li Zhaorong, Guo Yingqi, Li Dianqi, He Yingfen

Chinese Team:

Yu Qien

Li Guowei, He Jiaqiang

Chen Jinzhao, Kong Qingyu, He Youji

Liang Bingkun, Li Chunfa, Miao Changrong, Guo Zhuochang, Li Dahui

As a result of the great battle, Kitchee overwhelmed Chinese with a score of 5-1, demonstrating a clear difference in skill. Besides being technically inferior, Chinese's defeat was also due to strategic errors and excessive aggression.

Throughout the match, Chinese focused its energy on attacking in the first half. Therefore, although they managed to score and make it 2-1 in the first half, they conceded three goals in the second half. Their strength was inferior, which was not their fault.

In contrast, Kitchee relied entirely on experience and skill to suppress their opponents' reckless movements. Therefore, their victory was not strenuous. Both teams had good defenders, but Chinese's forwards were too scattered.

Of the five players who trained in England, Zhaoheng and Rongsheng did not show significant improvement. Yuanfen, Zhaorong, and Lingsheng had better performances. They pass as soon as they receive the ball and shoot when they see an opportunity, which are their new skills.

Scoring Sequence: In the first half, Zhaorong demonstrated his skills, and Chinese's Chunfa equalized, making it 1-1. Yingqi scored, making it 2-1, with Kitchee taking the lead. In the second half, Yingqi scored one goal and Zhaorong scored two, while Chinese scored none. Kitchee temporarily retains the winning record.

A name that is the same but prefixed with a place name or descriptive word, or not added in accordance with the provisions of this law, is considered similar.

Article 22: Using a name that is the same as or similar to the name already registered by another business is unfair competition, regardless of whether it is in the same city or county.

Using a name that is the same as the name already registered by another business in the same city or county to engage in the same type of business, after being notified by the competent authority of the city or county or an interested party, but still failing to change it, is presumed to be unfair competition. Using a name that is similar to the name already registered by another business to engage in the same type of business, after being notified by the competent authority, but still failing to change it, is the same.

### News Kills

— Liu Meng

No one can deny that newspapers have the mission of promoting social progress. Based on this reason, the exposure of news by newspapers really needs to be discreet. The distribution of news by news agencies should also consider its impact after publication.

Recently, a news-killing incident happened in Hankou. According to the Shanghai News Hankou's 8th dispatch: Asia News Agency released a news about a woman, Zhang Anhua's, immorality, causing Ms. Zhang to commit suicide by jumping into the river.

Originally, a woman's immorality is a private matter, and even if she remarries, it is not a big deal. (It is not my intention to defend the deceased; it is just the fact.) Such personal matter should not occupy the precious space of the newspaper. The personality and responsibility of journalists themselves should be absolutely considered, and should never circle around personal matters, taking the exposure of some personal secrets as a skill, and using these "gimmicks" as a way to attract readers. Journalists, lawyers, and doctors have been regarded as the three biggest scoundrels (?). This is definitely not the honor of journalists. In fact, the pen of a journalist may be regarded as a bad thing; only through noble personality and full sense of justice, journalists are useful and meritorious to the society, can they be respected by all levels of society, the news under his pen is the news that promotes social progress, and the impact after publication will not be "killing".

### Rambling Talk on the Double Ninth Festival

— Shu Xiang

Alone in a foreign land, I am a stranger,
Every festive season doubles my longing for family.
From afar, I know my brothers
Are climbing to the heights today,
With dogwood sprigs for all but one.

As a guest in a foreign land, encountering the Double Ninth Festival again, recalling Wang Wei's famous lines, how can one not feel sorrow!

Among the seasonal festivals, the ones that most stir memories of family and home are the Double Ninth and New Year's Eve. The origin of Double Ninth banquets is unknown, but it seems that this custom began in the Han Dynasty, starting with Fei Changfang telling Huan Jing on the ninth day of the ninth month to have his family sew pouches, fill them with dogwood, tie them to their arms, and climb mountains to drink chrysanthemum wine to ward off misfortune. In terms of preserving national essence, northerners are stronger than southerners. Despite the war, northerners still maintain the elegant tradition of Double Ninth mountain climbing, while southerners merely eat a few Double Ninth cakes from tea shops, and the custom of mountain climbing has largely disappeared.

In the north, on the Double Ninth Festival, in addition to bringing wine sets, tea stoves, and food boxes for mountain climbing picnics, they also make steamed cakes embedded with dates. The parents of daughters who have married must welcome them back home the day before for a joyous reunion. The Double Ninth Festival in the north is also known as the Daughters' Day. Children fly kites for amusement. Southerners are noticeably more indifferent to the Double Ninth.

"A rainless Double Ninth means a sunny winter," this farmer's saying is quite accurate. Many say that if the Double Ninth is clear, then the Winter Solstice, New Year's Day, Lantern Festival, and Qingming Festival will also be clear, but rainy weather will mean rain for all. This is probably not accurate.

Among Double Ninth poems, I love Cen Shen's the most: "I strongly desire to climb high, but no one brings wine to me. The chrysanthemums in my old garden, it seems, are blooming beside the battlefield."

This poem best suits the situation of many people today. How many people would bring wine to the reclusive Tao Pengze? With war raging, the chrysanthemums in one's old garden have probably all bloomed beside the battlefield.

Zhu Fang's: "I wanted to go climbing hand in hand, but once at the door, the desire was gone. How can I take the hair on my head and learn from the young to wear dogwood?" This poem also fits the thoughts of people today. With black hair turning white, what mood is left to insert seasonal dogwood?

Riding horses and shooting arrows were among the eight skills that people in ancient times must learn. Xiao Yu, Duke of Song in the Tang Dynasty, was granted the opportunity to shoot arrows on the ninth day of the ninth month, but none of his arrows hit the target. Ouyang Xun mocked him saying, "Thinking that the wind blows the arrows slowly, weak hands control a strong bow. Wanting to go high, they repeatedly fall down, and should go west to return to the east. Ten times they fall to the ground, both hands hold them up high. Asking who is doing this in leisure, it must be the Duke of Song." The strength of the Tang Dynasty was due to the martial customs. By the Song Dynasty, scholars like Xiao Yu were probably not unusual.

Tang Dynasty people wrote many poems about the Double Ninth Festival, but none mentioned cake. Liu Yuxi wanted to use the word "cake" in his Double Ninth poem, but stopped when he realized that the word was not found in the Six Classics. By the time of Song Zijing, he boldly wrote, "The rustling wind blows against my light robe, I share food and chrysanthemum wine in groups. Liu Lang didn't bother to inscribe the word 'cake,' failing his reputation as a hero in poetry." Tang Dynasty poems emphasized refinement, while Song poems emphasized boldness. Liu Yuxi's not inscribing the word "cake" was his prudence, not a weakness.

Zhao Changqing's "Nan Ge Zi" song on the Double Ninth on the Road says, "What day is this? In a foreign land, I remember my homeland. Passing the Double Ninth in the depths of the mountains, galloping on horseback through the blooming flowers, with no youthful exuberance left"; "The yellow chrysanthemums hold heavy branches, the red sorrel is fragrant with dew. A small boat follows the geese across the Xiangjiang River, imagining my family's courtyard, regretting not sharing the wine."

Last year on this day, heading east from Guiyang, in the depths of the mountains, I drank a cup of turbid wine in a village along the road. Recalling the youthful exuberance of climbing mountains and drinking wine, I couldn't help but feel disheartened!

### Small Chongyang Mountain

— Hu Lu

Double Ninth

Once again, I see the beautiful fragrance of yellow flowers, year after year cherishing vain hopes to avoid disasters! Rice prices are frightening, sugar is terrifying, how many people taste the cake?

Refugees are everywhere, dogwood has fallen, no longer effective! The future is filled with mad scientific warfare, where to escape? The ghosts cry for Fei Changfang!

### Nanjing City -- Just How Big Is It?

— Lin Mei

Every citizen of the Republic of China should have a thorough understanding of their capital. Based on this principle, let's test your knowledge: How big is Nanjing City?

I've posed this question now, and I can guarantee as an insurance company that 99 out of 100 citizens of the Republic of China don't know the answer. These 99 citizens who don't know the answer have no choice but to consult a map. Right now, I'm one of those 99 citizens, and I'll record the results of my map consultation below:

The "New Map of China" published by Zhenbing and Dishe, edited by Shi Zhonghua, third revised edition in October of the 35th year (1946), states that the circumference of Nanjing City is 34 kilometers.

The "New People's China Map" published by the Xinmin Geography Society, edited by Xu Tuizhi, issued in September of the 35th year (1946), states that the circumference of Nanjing City is 47 kilometers.

The "Geography Textbook Map for Middle Schools" published by the Chinese Historical and Geographical Map Compilation Society, published in December of the 35th year (1946), states that the circumference of Nanjing City is 55 kilometers.

I don't have enough money to buy other maps to consult. Which of these three maps should we rely on? Let's think about how much a person can walk in a day. According to these three maps, the smallest differs from the largest by 21 kilometers, which means the smallest is almost one-third less than the largest. How long would it take an ordinary person to walk that one-third less?

Assuming I'm a student, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Education's entrance examination, I can't object and have to take the exam. If the teacher asks a question like the one I've posed, I don't know which map the teacher uses as the standard. Even if I answer with a certain number of kilometers or two different answers, will I pass? It's as uncertain as winning the lottery.

### Talking About Climbing High

— Ding Rongguan

In order to avoid disaster, Fei Changfang listened to the advice of Lord Hu, and on the day of the ninth day of the ninth month, he took his family up the mountain, and as a result, they escaped the catastrophe. Thus, he opened the custom of ascending high on the Double Ninth in later generations.

Coincidentally, a similar record can also be found in the Christian Bible. One is that Jesus foretold the days of the end times, and he instructed, "Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains." (Matthew 24). The second is that the Old Testament records that an angel rescued Lot's family and also exhorted, "Escape for your life! Do not look back, nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be swept away." (Genesis 19). Choosing the mountains to escape disaster also has a factual basis in the modern scientific wars of the twentieth century: This is because the hilly areas are high in terrain, and the damage from poisonous gas, epidemics, artillery fire, and bombs is naturally lighter than in the plains. Being high up is also more advantageous for observation than being on the plains. We can imagine that in the future, with rocket artillery and atomic warfare with particularly strong destructive power, if air-raid shelters completely lose their protection, the only reliable place is the mountains, which are relatively likely to be spared. Recently, the Soviet Union's distribution of industrial centers has been chosen in the Ural Mountains area of ​​the rear of Asia, and its intention is not difficult to understand.

Not only that, even in normal times, even if it is not for choosing to be difficult, mountain climbing can also have a great effect. In the past, Confucius ascended Mount Tai and looked down on the world. Climbing high can increase our horizons. As the saying goes, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and a high tower rises from a foundation of earth." As the poem says, "If you want to see a thousand miles further, climb to a higher floor." As a person, one must have knowledge. Climbing high not only broadens our minds, but also helps our health. In the autumn, the weather is clear and refreshing, which is a good opportunity for outings. At that time, a family can have a meal together on the mountain. Even if it is not for avoiding disaster, it will not lose its pleasure. I think the ancients created festivals and customs, and their intention was also here.

### Eggs in England

— Zhong Li

A country old baronet in London sent an old friend a present of congratulation not long after his first grandson was born—a small wooden box—with "Handle with Care" written on it.

At first everyone thought it was an ancient glass instrument. When they opened it, it turned out to be two eggs sleeping on cotton. This large gift simply astonished all the guests. Even the 72 year old baronet was grateful and his tears flowed. The result was that he exchanged it for three months of food, flour and potatoes etc.

Ordinary people can buy the "egg powder" of two eggs per month on the government’s "ration coupon". There are no fresh eggs.

There are many people in England who "don't know the taste of eggs in March". Even if there are fresh eggs, the hostess doesn't know how to use them.

It is said that a person who feared living in London and who was recently sent to Italy discovered there that fresh eggs were so abundant that he was frightened. He embraced the principle of "eat eggs when hungry." On the eve of his return trip, he ate seventeen eggs in one go and then patted his stomach and said: "Haha, I have accumulated more than eight months of eggs in my stomach."

Recently, the British government has reduced the "egg powder" ration a little. The people have been complaining about it. The most vehement opposition comes from a film company. They put an egg in a box and put a garden on top of it to hold a memorial service and filmed it in the film and shown it everywhere.

Not only is it difficult for the British to get eggs in their own country, but it is also the case for the envoys of various countries stationed in England. Once, an ambassador of a certain country wanted to enjoy a meal of poached eggs, so he wrote an official letter to the British Foreign Office requesting an allotment of egg powder for five eggs. As a result, this letter was forwarded from the Foreign Office to the Home Office and from the Home Office to the Ministry of Food. After circling around for half a month, it was approved by the Ministry of Food, authorizing the purchase of one fresh egg. Two weeks later, the Ministry of Food sent a special messenger to deliver the egg and requested a formal receipt. After receiving the egg, the ambassador loved it more and more and couldn't bear to eat it. So he took a glass fork and put it in it. It was placed on the desk, and the guests all admired it.

It is said that once a certain unit had issued war medals, but because there were more people than medals, it was decided that those who did not receive medals would be given an egg. Everyone scrambled for the eggs, so a lottery was held. Everyone who won an egg was triumphant, while those who did not quietly took the medals and walked away.

### Banyan City Autumn Writings

— Lei

Autumn wind and falling leaves evoke sorrow, countless poets and writers, countless elders and young women with deep concerns, are stirred by this alluring season, moved by the slightest sound, casting off tears of longing for people, remembering distant places, and carrying affection and resentment. At the same time, there are also many wealthy gentlemen who feel that the autumn is clear and refreshing, which is a good time to climb high and look into the distance, travel in the mountains and rivers, and open their hearts. Some merchants and brokers, like awakened insects, realize that the long summer's off-season has passed, and quickly ring the abacus, re-dressing all kinds of lonely and dusty commodities with superb prices, squeezing into the market, revealing their faces.

Fuzhou, this tail-end port of South China, makes a steel bed equipped with springs feel very sensitive. Any small vibration will cause her inertia to work, just like a small ripple, constantly expanding its range, unless it is resisted and completely shattered, she will move forward endlessly. Although Fuzhou's prices rarely have the ability to spontaneously influence the surrounding area, she is indeed very easy to accept external influences. In this new opportunity of seasonal rotation, the Fuzhou market already has unlimited vitality and is preparing to burst forth vigorously.

### High Monk

— Li Renzhong

In today's world where people hate each other with weapons and scheme for money and goods, suddenly a high monk, the Italian Luoganna Da, has come to Shanghai to promote Buddhism. Buddhism is a profound philosophy, so many ignorant men and women who believe in Buddhism often turn it into a Buddhism that is like putting a cow's head on a horse's body. Heresies are involved, turning into superstition.

The high monk has studied science. It is rare to find a monk with a scientific foundation. This scientific monk said that in order to reduce the fear of the atomic bomb, the following precepts must be observed: Do not kill. Do not take what is not rightfully yours. Do not defile another's wife. Do not lie. Do not get drunk.

Although the scientific monk can see through the root of the world's illness, can everyone in the world achieve these five precepts? As for "Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot," needless to say, it is still a "difficult" word!

Luoganna Da also said: If science can cooperate with Buddhist teachings, then science can truly seek happiness for mankind. Otherwise, it will destroy mankind! Every sentence is a warning bell, but this world is already terminally ill and deeply entrenched!

However, in this degenerate world, it is essential to have such a monk appear and try to help.

### Miss America

— Xu Shuyuan

Miss America's Entertainment

American women can be considered the happiest people in the world. They never worry needlessly, their minds are always broad, and their inner joy flows out of their appearance, so they always smile, and it is completely natural. If a Chinese Lin Daiyu, who is full of sorrow and sickness and has her eyebrows locked in sadness, forces herself to show her teeth when taking a photo, pretending to smile bitterly, it will definitely not add a bit of beauty. American women have many ways to entertain themselves. Girls under the age of seventeen are more restricted because they are controlled by their parents, but they can watch movies, participate in all family dance parties, and also have the privilege of participating in blanket parties. What is a Blanket Party? Take a blanket and go camping in the suburbs with your boyfriend for a night. It is a very strange and immoral social event. Nine out of ten girls will lose their virginity that night. They can openly socialize before they are seventeen, and their parents can no longer control them. She can find an object in the bar, in the general association, and in the playground. She can enter and leave hotels, or rent an apartment house separately, like a little bird just out of its cage, soaring all day long. In addition to the intoxicating bars and nightclubs, they also have various legitimate entertainment. They can swim, ride horses, and play tennis. There must be tennis courts in the park, and there are also horses for rent. There are ice rinks in the city, where men and women can meet and find suitable objects.

Literary women can join various literary groups such as writers associations, music societies, and drama associations. These groups hold meetings and dinners twice a week to talk, read works, and exchange opinions. The female members of this national body include unmarried women, chongfu, glamorous widows, famous actresses, singers, and female writers. There is no shortage of beauties to choose from. The dinner fee is extremely cheap, usually a shared cost of one or two US dollars per person. In the southern states of the United States, bullfighting is popular and held every season, which has become a great opportunity for Miss America to show off. They are all dressed as shepherds, riding wild bulls out of the wooden fence, with the audience clapping and cheering. If they can avoid being overthrown by the wild bull, they can steadily win the first prize. There is also the annual "Miss America" election in Atlantic City. Candidates from all over the world come to participate in the election with their families. Women from all walks of life who come to join in the fun also flock from all over the world. At that time, the contestants are dressed up in colorful dresses and sit on floats to parade through the city, their beauty is openly displayed and judged by everyone. The first place is mostly hired by Hollywood film companies for a lot of money. The women who are not selected can also return to their local areas and participate in fashion shows to relieve their boredom. Their photos are published in newspapers, and their popularity is still strong. In summary, they combine sports and art with entertainment, which is more meaningful than the Chinese Misses playing mahjong and pushing Pai Gow.

### Ghost Talk

— Shi Jimei

We are walking in a rainy alley in the deep night. All the lights in the houses on the roadside are turned off, and nothing can be seen. The further we walk, the deeper we go into the darkness...

Wild dogs are barking wildly in the distance, and nearby, the leaves are rustling as they are blown by the wind.

"Aren't you afraid?" he asked.

"Afraid of what?"

"Aren't you afraid of anything?"

"No, I don't have any gold or silver treasures, so who would rob me?"

"Maybe there are," he deliberately whispered, "ghosts."

"Well, now is the scientific age of the 20th century," I laughed, "and besides, can ghosts be more scary than people?"

"Coming without a trace, going without a trace, a gust of cold wind..."

"That's just the lovableness of ghosts, not the fearfulness of ghosts," I said confidently.

"You say it so easily? One day, if I die, my soul will definitely come looking for you," he threatened, "then--"

"Welcome. Back in my childhood, under the lonely lamp late at night, I yearned for 'Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio' and 'Ying Chuang Yi Cao'. I've always longed for the world of ghosts and the life of foxes. I am a ghost lover because ghosts with conscience are much more lovely than the people in 'An Official's Record'. So, if one day you visit in the guise of a ghost, I will treat you with all sincerity. At that time, don't forget to tell me the story of the ghost country—that is, your country."

He shook his head and smiled: "It's really ghost talk."

"But ghost talk may be more real and pertinent than human talk."

He was silent, apparently tacitly agreeing to my "ghost talk." Friend, if that day comes when my spirit comes to find you from another world, what will you do? Welcome? Or reject?

### Three Topics on Hobbies

— Zhang Jilou

Tea

Lighting a red clay

stove, with pine cones

recently cut,

the aroma is steaming, clum-

sy tea sets, faintly flicker

with faint wafts of water.

Do you prefer the

thickness of black tea,

or the clearness of green

tea?

Never mind the praise of the hard worker, that it is a distillation of history,

or the slander that it is a banishment by the world; "Taking a half-day's leisure in a busy life" is

more enjoyable than seven years of mundane dreams.

If wine is compared to a mistress, a brief

rendezvous, only seeking a moment's intoxication, comfort;

then tea is your good friend in your innermost being, one conver-

sation, and it can pour out all the dust, troubles, and

resentments in your heart.

Tasting fragrant tea, one can feel a sense of ancient yearning, and understand the mysteries of the world.

Smoke

In depressed days, I need a cigarette.

A cigarette that burns with a raging passion, and

twirls with a light misty atmosphere of tenderness.

When the light blue smoke floats around my lips,

the pungent taste stimulates my throat; I then

fall into deep thought from reality. A crane-like

mood, as if I have become feathered and am soaring

in the floating clouds.

Staring at the faint smoke

rings exhaled from my mouth, I feel unparalleled peace and tranquility.

With smoke, I will not feel lonely

and isolated.

Wine

Under the squeezing of life, you must feel

tired and numb, find a little bit of stimulation!

Rose red wine, apple green

Zhu Ye Qing, and even aged Huadiao wine, fresh

distilled rice wine; these will all give you excitement.

Lighting a soft hanging lamp, holding a light

green brew, this scene is enough to make you intoxicated.

What remains is a bit of tipsiness,

staring at the drunken face reflected in the mirror.

For the changes and fading of the years, the youth

of light; for the life of the grinding lost,

the ruddy complexion, in the blink of an eye, reappears

on your face.

Friends, wipe away the disappointed tears from your cheeks,

forget the resentment and depression in your heart!

Come, please drink this cup dry.

### Inscribing on Duo Ci's Painting of Geese

— Wang Bijiang

Floating with feathers, combing white snow,

Su Shi's words were inherently created by heaven.

The fine son seems to have the ambition of Ping Huai,

Do not mistake the Taoist priest's affection in Shanyin.

Who can be most lifelike in depicting objects?

Cui Bai of Daliang is also this person.

If you have leisure, do not write late autumn miscellaneous things,

A basket on the mountain road can be sent to one's body.

(Cui Ziqiu Pond Double Goose Round, see Xuanhe's Painting Manual)

### Autumn Water

— Cang Gu

In ancient years, I don't know which

thin poet compared a pool of autumn water to Yiren's

bright eyes. This is an appropriate

metaphor, like an irresistible force, calling

the young generation to sing with poems, and embrace it with their souls. The eternally cold

autumn water, in the poet's immortal imagination, flowed warmly.

I am a young man, and my joy in autumn

water is of course no exception; I also feel equally close to the poet's imagination. I love the shallowness of the autumn water, but I love even more the stories that the autumn water whispers under the small bridge.

Autumn water is a girl who loves to talk,

as long as you have the ability, she will tell you the stories she is familiar with like a lover.

Once, she told a story about a yellow

crucian carp and the love of a washerwoman with white arms. She said that whenever the little girl's delicate and white arms stirred in the water, the yellow

crucian carp would chase frantically, nibbling frantically. Sometimes, the

schooling fish would also be scattered. The little girl would often reach out her palm to catch it.

One day, it was finally pulled out of the water, and

began to feel the panic of suffocation; but for

the sake of love, it endured extreme pain, and

did not want to escape at all. The little girl's

gentle eyes revealed maternal pity

, and threw the infatuated little creature several feet

away from the water. The yellow crucian carp has since

lost its love.

I heard many of these stories in the days of the former village, at that time,

I had not yet learned to enjoy loneliness like middle-aged people. I wanted to forget this loneliness that approached death, so I followed the

river pond full of red radish flowers, to listen to beautiful legends, and to find my own slender shadow. I stared at the shadow on the water, and I found that in this world, I was not so lonely. I smiled, and the shadow in the water also smiled.

Perhaps it is "When the wild geese come, infinite thoughts". I, such a person who is content with ordinariness and indifference, suddenly felt an unprovoked longing. I miss the eternally cold autumn water,

and I also miss Yiren with bright eyes; but what I can never forget is a string of faded stories.

In autumn, I feel a sense of emptiness and disappointment.

### Poetic Aphorisms

— Rong Dong

Poetry gives us simplicity and: ...

Uncolored joy.

I think that transposing emotions is the special

work of poetry--not conveying thoughts, but

arousing an undulation in the senses of the reader

, this undulation corresponds with the undulation

felt by the writer.

Poetry should have magnificent poetic rhyme--a

strong but irrational excitement...

It can attract tears, can enter the heart, and find

something hidden there, something

older than the organization of his character at this moment... (A.E. Housman)

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Yaoqun: "Initially, I planned to leave a signal in front of the Daopo Inn, but then I feared it would be discovered by that fellow from the Meisha Fu company, so I had to abandon it. After having a quick bite, I rushed to the street, wandering around. On one hand, I was waiting for Tiger Brother; on the other hand, I hoped that within that short hour or so, Tiger Brother could receive my note from the inn and rush here to buy the inn. But I also thought it was laughable. How could such a wishful miracle ever happen?"

"After strolling for only a few steps, I suddenly heard a sneering sound behind me. The sneering was accompanied by some words, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. In that tense mood, I was naturally a bit neurotic, but in my subconscious, I did sense something ominous. Because here, people were coming and going, cars were rumbling, and voices were noisy, but this sneering sound was particularly jarring, coming from behind me. By the time I turned around to look, I didn't see anyone behaving strangely, just ordinary pedestrians. I勉强tried to convince myself: 'Once bitten by a snake, you're afraid of a broken rope for three years! ... It's just a case of seeing a snake in your cup'..."

"Unexpectedly, after walking a short distance further, I suddenly saw two shady-looking strong men approaching me head-on, seemingly blocking my path. As soon as they noticed that I was paying attention to them, the two fellows suddenly stopped. Based on my experience, I felt that these two fellows were acting suspiciously, and they were also staring at me with strange eyes. I could only pretend that it wasn't a big deal, and maintained my original attitude, walking forward. When I was less than three to five yards away from the two fellows, I suddenly saw them both spread their arms out, making a gesture to block my way. One of them shouted loudly at me: 'Hey, stop!'"

"At first, I ignored them, pretending that they were talking to someone behind me, without even turning my head, to appear innocent. Who knew that as I walked two more steps, the fellow who had spoken roared at me fiercely: 'Are you going to stop or not?' Then he revealed a malicious smile: 'Wearing your fur coat inside out, what are you pretending to be!'"

"Even if I could remain calm at other times, I couldn't help but turn around and take a look, with only one thought in my mind: hoping that these two fellows' sudden actions were directed at someone behind me. But when I turned around, alas! Three or four burly men, all with weapons in their hands, as if they were holding treasures, with incredible grins on their faces, as if to say: 'You've fallen into our trap! ... Where do you think you're going to run?'..."

"I didn't resist, nor could I resist. I followed them a few steps in a daze, and then followed them onto a car parked by the roadside. I also went to a place that looked like a police station in a daze, and was detained in a daze..."

"Wait, let me guess," I interrupted Yaoqun at this point, and asked: "I think all of this was probably one of Mr. Mai's tricks, right?..."

"Isn't it? But it wasn't until 3:00 p.m. that day, when the Japanese-puppet police officers brought out that fellow Meisha Fu, and confronted me with him..."

Hearing this, I interrupted Yaoqun again: "How did that fellow make his entrance?"

"Just like me, he was also arrested," Yaoqun said with a smile.

"How shallow!" I shook my head. "Isn't that too shallow?"
