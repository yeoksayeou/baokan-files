### Outer Mongolian Cavalry Invades Xinjiang; Soviet Aircraft Continuously Participate in Bombing; Our Diplomatic Authorities Resolve to Protest

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 9th] According to reports received by the military authorities here from Asman, commissioner of the Altai region, and the garrison stationed at Baitashan: At noon on the 5th of this month, a battalion of Outer Mongolian cavalry, along with multiple military vehicles carrying light and heavy weapons, attacked our garrison stationed at Baitashan. At the time, four aircraft with Soviet markings provided aerial cover, dropping bombs and strafing. Our soldiers and civilians suffered casualties. The Outer Mongolian cavalry has now penetrated 600 li into our territory, and our troops are valiantly attempting to halt their advance. Baitashan is located 350 li northeast of Qitai, Xinjiang. Commissioner Asman was originally stationed in Chenghua, but since February of this year, he has been subjected to armed pressure from a certain party, retreating step by step, and finally retreating to Baitashan in mid-April.

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 10th] The battle at Baitashan is still ongoing. Aircraft with Soviet markings continue to bomb our positions in multiple waves.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Semi-official sources stated on the 10th that a large force of Outer Mongolian troops, under the cover of four Soviet military aircraft, began attacking northwestern China on the 5th of this month and have now penetrated 200 miles inland. The military aircraft have been bombing and strafing Chinese towns, causing numerous civilian casualties. Correspondents from various newspapers in the capital are sending telegrams reporting details of the Outer Mongolian invasion. One report stated that Outer Mongolian cavalry, infantry, and artillery have already invaded Xinjiang. The spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense declined to comment on these reports.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is learned that regarding the invasion of our Xinjiang border by Outer Mongolian troops and the participation in the bombing by aircraft bearing Soviet markings, our diplomatic authorities will issue a protest on the 11th. It is said that the protest note may be delivered to Soviet Ambassador Petrov on the afternoon of the 11th for transmission to the government of the Outer Mongolian Republic. Our protest note is being delivered to the Soviet side for transmission to the Outer Mongolian government because, although our country has recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia, the two countries have not yet exchanged diplomatic envoys. According to information received by the authorities here, the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian troops began in mid-April, and the current depth of the Mongolian troops' incursion into our territory has reached 600 li. Most recently, at noon on the 5th, the Mongolian troops launched another attack, with four Soviet aircraft participating. Our defense forces, under the command of Song Xilian, are responsible for defending the territory and have resisted, with fighting ongoing in the Baitashan area. This is the third time Mongolian troops have invaded our territory in Xinjiang.

(Note: London radio also reported on the 10th the news of the Outer Mongolian army invading Xinjiang.)

### Both Old and New Factions of the Democratic Socialist Party Are Actively Engaging in Activities

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The split of the Democratic Socialist Party seems unavoidable. Zhang Junmai has now resolved to reorganize the party affairs and will expel Liang Qiushui and Wan Wu (one of the ten founders of the National Socialist Party) from the party. He has also dispatched a large number of personnel to various locations to engage in activities. The Innovation Committee of the opposition faction has also decided to convene a national congress of the Democratic Socialist Party next month and has dispatched a number of personnel to various regions to win the sympathy of party members. Liang Qiushui has already returned to Beiping from Shanghai by boat and will go to Tianjin within days to maintain contact. Lu Guangsheng will also come to Beiping soon to go to the Northeast with Liang Qiushui. Wu Xianzi is currently undecided and may merge with the Innovation Committee in the future, or may break away from the Democratic Socialist Party and re-establish the banner of the "Constitutional Government Party." Wu originally intended to return to Hong Kong, but a certain prominent figure in the opposition persuaded him to stay in Shanghai to observe the overall situation, so the date of his departure is yet to be determined. After Liang Qiushui returned to Beiping, he met with reporters and spoke frankly about the failure to mediate the internal disputes within the party, and called the Innovation Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party the real "Wang Mazi Scissors," because the National Socialist Party had a total of ten founders. Excluding Xu Qiao, Wang Bosha, and Hu Shijing who have passed away, Chen Bosheng and Zhang Dongshen who have left the party, and Liu Yushu who is detained as a traitor, there are still four founders remaining. Zhang Junmai's side only has himself, while the Innovation Committee still has three, namely himself, Wan Wu, and Tang Xiangming.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 10th] Cai Tingkai recently stated that Zhang Bojun, the person in charge of the Democratic League, made remarks involving his joining the Democratic League on behalf of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. He has now sent a letter to the Overseas Chinese Daily to correct this, stating that neither he personally nor the China Association for Promoting Democracy have joined the Democratic League. He also stated that recently, unscrupulous elements have been spreading rumors and creating trouble, organizing militias in the name of the Association or himself personally, and that the authorities should impose legal sanctions on them.

### The Chief Instigator of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in the Philippines, Sha Tu, Ignores His Ancestry; His Grandfather Was Chinese, Yet He Now Leads Anti-Chinese Activities

[Central News Agency, Manila, 10th] The existence and activities of the Anti-Chinese Alliance in the Philippines have been confirmed. Sha Tu, the chairman of the alliance, frankly admitted to a Central News Agency reporter that this narrow-minded nationalist and xenophobic organization is led by him. When asked by the reporter whether the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty, which has been signed for many days, is contrary to the spirit of friendship and why there is still no sign of the alliance disbanding, Sha Tu replied: The Anti-Chinese Alliance is still continuing to exist and operate "on the surface." The alliance was formed two years ago, and its purpose is purely to protect the rights and interests of the Filipino people, especially to protect the economic interests of Filipinos, and that is why the organization was created. It now has thousands of members, but since we are not excluding China or all Chinese people, but only protecting our own rights and interests, the term Anti-Chinese Alliance may not be very appropriate, and we should consider correcting it. The reporter met with Sha Tu during the Philippine Senate's discussion of the bill related to overseas Chinese. This anti-Chinese ringleader, who is six feet tall and has a pale face like an opium addict, is now over sixty years old. He has only been in office as a "Solon" (Filipinos call congressmen "Solon," meaning wise men) for one year, but he has put forward nearly a hundred bills, hence the title "one-bill-a-day congressman." Sha Tu, on the other hand, is proud of this. Most of the bills he has put forward are xenophobic, and he has gained the unconditional support of a section of voters because of this. When Sha Tu spoke with reporters, he often smirked, and the wrinkles on his forehead were enough to show his dishonorable experiences of fraud, crime, and exile. According to news from the overseas Chinese community, Sha Tu was originally an unemployed rogue. He escaped to Hong Kong after committing rape in his youth. He developed a hatred for the Chinese people because of being bullied by local gangsters. Later, he used bribery to end the rape case and was elected as a congressman based on his xenophobic stance. As for what he did during the occupation of the Philippine Islands, it is no longer possible to verify. According to Sha Tu himself, he will travel around the world when Congress adjourns at the end of this month and will visit the Chinese capital, Nanjing. The Chinese Consulate General in Manila will issue a free visa. He plans to stay in Nanjing for two or three days and may visit Chairman Chiang when possible. When asked by the reporter, "What is the purpose of visiting Chairman Chiang?" Sha Tu replied, "Just to pay my respects. I admire Chairman Chiang." Sha Tu admitted that his grandfather was Chinese and told the reporter that his wife had passed away, but she left behind two sons and one daughter, all of whom are lawyers.

### Relief for Refugees in Henan Province

Providing Emergency Relief and Shelter Separately

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] Although the situation in northern Henan has recently eased, a large number of refugees continue to arrive from Fengqiu, Yanjin, and other counties. Currently, about 5,000 refugees are receiving food at the porridge distribution centers in Zhengzhou, and more than 4,000 others are being sent by the Emergency Refugee Relief Association to nearby counties for foster care or job placement. Dispersed orphans have been taken in by the Emergency Relief Brigade of the Henan Provincial Department of Social Affairs. There are about 10,000 refugees from southern Hebei scattered in Zhengzhou, Bianliang, Xinxiang, and Yancheng. The Department of Social Affairs is consulting with the Pacification Zone Emergency Relief Brigade on relief efforts, and 300 million yuan previously allocated by the Central Government for special projects will be distributed as emergency relief. The Provincial Government has also requested special funds from the Central Government to provide relief to about 400 refugees from southern Shandong who came to Zhengzhou via northern Henan. There is a total of 300,000 people inside An'yang City who need food. The province has already transported half of the 500 tons of food it plans to purchase by air to the city within 20 days. Because of the Communist army's attacks on northern Henan, more than 10,000 students from more than 20 schools have come south to Zhengzhou and Bianliang, and about half of them will be able to resume classes soon. The rest have volunteered to join the Youth Army, but they hope that the authorities can give them priority in the past and allow them to resume their studies in one year. The province has decided to airlift more than 5,000 students from An'yang to the south. As for the students from northern Henan who are studying in Zhengzhou and Bianliang, together with the 2,000 or more students who have recently come to Zhengzhou from northern Henan, they are requesting public funding for relief. The Central Government has approved an allocation of 1.5 billion yuan for the relief of the above-mentioned refugee students. The province has diverted 1.3 billion yuan from the land and food funds and the emergency relief funds for southern Henan. The 1,000 tons of flour approved by Chairman Chiang and the Executive Yuan will be distributed by the Henan branch as soon as it receives the order.

### The People's Political Council's Peace Proposals Are Slandered and Defamed by the Communist Party's Xinhua News Agency

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Since the People's Political Council sent a telegram to the Chinese Communist Party calling for peace and inviting the Communist Party members of the People's Political Council to come to Nanjing immediately to participate in the meeting and resume peace talks, everyone has placed their hopes on it. However, a long time has passed and there has been no response. On the 5th of this month, the Xinhua News Agency broadcast its editorial, titled "The Broken Cart Cannot Be Driven Again," coldly slandering and defaming the People's Political Council's painstaking efforts to seek peace, pointing out that the council is "dominated by reactionary elements and has never been attended by communists. Even a very small number of people who sincerely hope for peace lack experience, so there is no reason to have any illusions about this People's Political Council." The agency also falsely accused that "the true face of the People's Political Council is a fanatical supporter of the civil war, an organ that calls for war, and people must never, and should not, believe its so-called peace calls." It also ridiculed the People's Political Council's sincere expression of "inviting the CCP members of the People's Political Council to come to Beijing to attend the meeting and jointly plan the national affairs," "requesting the CCP to send representatives to Beijing as soon as possible to unconditionally resume peace talks with the government," and "requesting the presidium and resident committee of the council to promote the realization of peace in the shortest possible time in the spirit of the resolutions of this conference" as "two bowls of tofu, that is, two bowls of tofu." The agency commented on the spirit of the People's Political Council's conference, requesting the government to declare a political solution again, that is, requesting the government to "quickly increase its troops to suppress the communist bandits," so its conclusion was that "the People's Political Council's peace proposal is unfortunately simply a rotten hairpin for a beauty."

The National Army is on high alert.

[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th] The National Army, which recovered Ju County in southern Shandong, continued to search and suppress the suburbs on the 10th and successively captured strongholds such as coal kilns and lime kilns.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Information Bureau, today denied reports that the general election, scheduled for August, will be postponed until next year, and that there are revisions to the constitutional implementation plan to convene the next National Assembly on Christmas.

He also pointed out that the Executive Yuan's passage this morning of the plan to renovate the National Assembly Hall to increase the number of seats is sufficient proof that the above-mentioned reports are inaccurate.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It seems that the general election this autumn will be postponed due to practical difficulties. There have been rumors from all sides, even saying that it will be postponed for more than a year. A reporter from this newspaper made a special trip to visit Minister Zhang Lisheng of the Ministry of Interior on the 10th to ask for an explanation.

It is reported that the Communist army is deploying on the periphery of Sipingjie, preparing for a major war, and the National Army is on alert at the outposts on the periphery of Siping. In addition, a part of the Communist army in southern Liaoning took the opportunity to capture Ximu City, 80 miles southeast of Haicheng on the southern section of the Changchun Railway, on the 9th. Because it poses a great threat to Haicheng and Anshan, the National Army is launching a counterattack. In addition, the port of Yingkou was previously avoided by many ships due to rumors, but it has now stabilized. A China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship docked at the port in the afternoon of the 9th, and more ships are coming.

[Central News Agency, Andong, 10th] Andong Province, as the adjacent war zone, was once frightened by the Communist army's intrusion into the south bank of the Songhua River, but the war situation has improved in recent days, and the people here have regained their stability.

Bridges in the lost areas have been mostly destroyed, and the restoration of the Dongliao River Bridge is particularly difficult.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] The Jilin Railway Bureau under the Ministry of Communications has 489 kilometers of railways under its jurisdiction, including Jichang, Changtao, Jidun, and Jihai, which have been repeatedly destroyed by the Communist army in recent years.

The National Army in Wula Street made a strategic retreat on the afternoon of the 10th, and the National Army in Xiyang is still firmly defending its positions on the mountain.

### Discussions on Economic Measures at the Economic Commission Meeting Continue; Grain Rationing to Be Implemented Immediately; Property Tax Collection to Be Studied by a Subcommittee

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 10th] The work of the National Economic Commission has entered a concrete and practical stage. At the meeting this afternoon on the 10th, actual discussions were held on issues such as food and subsidies. Regarding the sale of state-owned enterprises, the meeting conducted in-depth discussions and has reached a decision in principle. However, due to the magnitude of the matter and the fact that lists from various agencies have not yet been submitted, it was decided to request Zhang Jia'ao, Weng Wenhao, and Qian Zisun to conduct further research and organize the text for presentation at the next meeting. Regarding the grain rationing issue, after detailed research, it was determined that the food supply for major cities will be secure for the next four months. Plans are also underway for the grain supply beyond October, and it is believed that there will not be major problems. It was originally planned to implement rationing in the nine major cities first. However, given the dense populations of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin and their higher demand for grain, it was decided to implement it there first. The meeting also conducted a detailed review of issues such as how to ensure that the true common people and public servants benefit from the rationing. Another issue that the meeting emphasized was the subsidy policy. In principle, subsidies will be gradually reduced. A detailed list of current subsidies will be compiled to study which should be discontinued, which should be reduced, and which should have their profits turned over to the national treasury. In addition, regarding cost-cutting, the establishment of some agencies that were budgeted for but not yet established should be stopped, and those with ineffective operations will also be studied to determine which should be abolished and which should be downsized. As for the one-time property tax issue that is of general concern, the collection plan drafted by the Ministry of Finance was also discussed at the meeting. However, because there were still technical aspects that needed to be studied, it was handed over to the fiscal subcommittee for further research. After a decision is made by the meeting, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan to complete the legislative process and then implemented. Other issues such as the opening of new taxes or the reorganization of old taxes all require detailed figures and have also been submitted to the subcommittee for research. In general, the commission is conducting technical and concrete reviews on both revenue enhancement and cost-cutting to understand the overall income and expenditure situation for the second half of the year, in order to plan for future contingencies. The meeting today was held at approximately 3:00 PM, chaired by Zhang Jia'ao. More than 20 people attended, including Weng Wenhao, Gu Zhenglun, and Yu Hongjun. The meeting adjourned at approximately 8:00 PM. The fourth meeting will be held again next Monday, and the subcommittees will also continue to meet within the week.

In addition, the issue of workers' dependents was also discussed in detail at the Economic Commission meeting on the 10th. The meeting noted that the profit and loss situations of various factories differ, and the base salaries of workers also vary. Some workers do not even have a base salary. If a uniform regulation were to be made, it would be difficult to satisfy all parties. Many opinions were expressed at the meeting, hoping that labor and management could coordinate, share the hardships, understand and accommodate each other, and work together to find a solution. If an agreement cannot be reached, it is hoped that they can listen to the arbitration of the local social bureaus.

[Another Dispatch] To cooperate with the emergency economic measures plan, the authorities have decided to sell the part of the China Grain Corporation's capital that was invested by the Ministry of Food to private businesses by issuing stocks. The measures have been drafted by the Ministry of Food and will be implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan.

### The U.S. Opens Trade to Japan; Our Authorities Take It Very Seriously; Shanghai Business Circles Believe Export Trade Will Be Threatened

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 10th] The financial and economic authorities are taking the U.S. opening of foreign trade to Japan very seriously. According to those familiar with the market situation, Japanese goods at factory prices have already been discovered in various places. Some are even products manufactured in Japan under the names of other countries' companies. This matter deserves serious attention.

[Our Dispatch] After the U.S. State Department and the Department of the Army announced that the U.S. would open foreign trade to Japan starting August 15th of this year, import and export trade circles here believe that the opening date is too early, and the result will be that Japan will become a competitor to us in international trade again. It was pointed out that our country's export goods, such as cotton cloth, raw silk, straw hats, buttons, umbrella handles, and fish products, will all suffer severe threats. Currently, our country is facing unrest, and there are many local difficulties. Production has not yet been put on the right track, while Japan, under the control of the Allied forces, is gradually restoring production. The currency system is stable, and wages are even lower, so in terms of production conditions, it poses a serious threat to us. Therefore, it is hoped that when our country's commercial delegation goes to Japan, it should argue on the basis of reason and urge the Allied forces to tighten control.

According to a textile industry magnate, Japan's cotton textile industry has now recovered to about three million spindles. This number is enough to meet the national clothing needs, and there is still a surplus for export. However, the Allied forces consider the textile industry to be the easiest light industry for Japan to restore and easy to obtain foreign exchange, so there is a saying that they will be allowed to increase to six million spindles this year. If this number is reached, our yarn market in Southeast Asia will again suffer severe competition from Japanese goods. What is even more worrying is that the Fengjie Machinery Factory was not damaged during the war, and the recovery of the production of spindle machines is very rapid. If the Allied forces relax control and allow them to develop, the future of Japan's textile industry cannot be ignored. According to the current trend, Japan's textile industry will not pose a major threat to us in the short term, but the seriousness lies in its future development.

### Shanxi Province Welcomes Rain After Prolonged Drought

[Our Taiyuan Correspondent, 10th] Shanxi has suffered from a severe drought this spring. Wheat seedlings can still be seen everywhere in the fields. In the best areas, the harvest will be reduced by half. If it does not rain, the autumn planting will be delayed. In the Taiyuan area, there was a sudden rain on the 8th and 9th, with intermittent drizzle for two days and nights. A steady rain has been falling since the 10th, and it has already reached two inches by noon. The weather is like late autumn, and it seems to be a thorough rain. The people are all very happy and are preparing to cultivate. However, only short-term maturing millet, buckwheat, and corn can be planted, and there is no hope of a full harvest.

### Japan Hopes to Set Exchange Rates First; Finance Minister Still Expresses Dissatisfaction with MacArthur's Measures

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 10th] It is said here that MacArthur's decision to open Japan's private foreign trade relations on the second anniversary of Japan's surrender (August 15th) can be regarded as the most important event for Japan after the end of the war. Although these people are satisfied with this, they are also well aware that there are still various problems to be solved before Japan can truly restore foreign trade relations. Finance Minister Yano recently commented: "First of all, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen must be set, otherwise Japanese merchants will inevitably encounter difficulties when trading with foreign countries." Naka Kaoru, chairman of the Japan Foreign Trade Association, also emphasized the need to solve the exchange rate issue first and proposed two conditions for restoring Japan's international trade: (1) import raw materials, especially cotton, wool, rubber, and iron sheets; (2) solve the compensation issue so that the Japanese industrial community can use the remaining equipment to carry out production plans. People in the Japanese financial community believe that although MacArthur's decision is not without its shortcomings, it is enough to give Japan's future economy a bright future and achieve peace as soon as possible.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani said in a statement on the 10th: "Japan can welcome foreign trade delegations and is very grateful. However, Japan's trade will still be conducted under the control of the Allies, and the foreign exchange rate has not yet been determined, which is not perfect. Therefore, even if trade is restored, it will only be trade between the delegation and the Trade Agency."

Initial Private Transactions Will Be Barter

[United Press, Washington, 10th] According to a joint announcement by the Department of the Army and the State Department: "Private traders who trade with Japanese manufacturers will have the trade goods evaluated by experts from MacArthur's headquarters to determine a fair price." Therefore, the initial transactions between private traders and Japan will mostly be barter, with raw materials exchanged for Japanese handicrafts and silk fabrics. MacArthur's headquarters and Japanese officials expect that private commerce will, in the initial stage, only stimulate the limited export trade that the U.S. and Japanese governments are currently conducting. As for Japan's large-scale manufacturing of export goods, it is still impossible due to the lack of raw materials, the undetermined method of compensation, and the poor domestic economic adjustment. For example, less than 25 percent of the factories in the Osaka industrial area that are currently in operation are operating at full capacity. The main reason is that the business community is hesitant about the compensation method, and there is a lack of coal, lubricating oil, and electricity. According to MacArthur's headquarters officials, allowing private traders (initially limited to 400 people) to go to Japan will slightly increase current exports. It is expected that they will guide the Japanese to manufacture silk fabrics and works of art that suit American tastes, instead of the outdated products that Japanese merchants generally make. They will encourage the Japanese to make more pottery and other items.

Australian Government Requests Increase in Number of Australian Merchants

The private trade representatives who are allowed to go to Japan after August 15 are assigned by various countries. The Australian government reacted very quickly and has announced that it will ask MacArthur's headquarters to increase the number of merchant representatives from Australia, because of Australia's "geographical location" and the large amount of pre-war trade with Japan.

### Flooding in Various Parts of Guangdong Province; The Yingde Bridge on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Was Destroyed; Commerce in Huiyang Is at a Standstill Due to Several Feet of Water

[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 10th] Continuous rain in various parts of Guangdong Province has caused rivers to swell, causing severe disasters that are rare in the past 20 years. Both land and water transportation have been affected. Five piers of the Yingde Bridge on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway were destroyed, so the Guangdong-Hankou train has again stopped heading north. The water level of the Northeast and East Rivers is the highest, with the highest water level in Huizhou reaching 12.0 meters, and the Right River also reaching 11.50 meters. Both sides of the river have become swamps, and the water depth in Huiyang City is three to four feet, and commerce has stopped. The loss of crops is even greater, with tens of thousands of acres of good land being flooded. The Mating Post, which was built not long ago, was eroded due to the new soil not being strong, and the breach was more than a thousand feet. The Cixi Gate was also broken, and more than 2,000 nearby villagers gathered and tried their best to rescue it, but the dangerous situation has not diminished. The local Water Conservancy Bureau has sent a large number of people to various places to supervise the emergency repair of the embankment project. Fortunately, the sky has cleared since the 10th, and the rise of the rivers has slowed down.

### Japanese Cabinet Passes Emergency Economic Measures; Content Subject to Allied Approval

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] The Japanese Cabinet today passed emergency economic measures regarding the restoration of export trade. The meeting also discussed the imbalance in import and export plans under the control of the headquarters over the past two years and the possibility of a crisis in the near future. On the 6th and 7th, the heads of various economic departments who met with Hiroo Wada, Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, to formulate emergency economic plans, emphasized that Japan needs to reform its economy and produce goods that can be exported to pay for necessary imports. The details of the emergency economic measures are still unknown. Last week, Tetsu Katayama said that the emergency economic plan mainly relies on the support of the people. Cabinet officials said tonight that the cabinet's implementation of the measures passed today relies heavily on the support of labor. Minister of Commerce and Industry Changzaburo Mizutani said after the cabinet meeting that the government does not believe that the Communist Party has the power to lead the labor unions to obstruct the labor's support for this measure. The cabinet's economic plan can reflect the Japanese government's efforts to save the current situation, because the Americans have gradually resented buying food for the Japanese and do not want to supply raw materials any longer. The Katayama Cabinet hopes to lay the foundation for the recovery of export industries by collecting enough coal for industrial use, stopping the black market, stabilizing the domestic economy, stopping inflation, and absorbing union figures with connections. Officials admit that solving economic problems is not entirely a domestic matter, and it is necessary to import raw materials from abroad before large quantities of export goods can be produced. The emergency economic measures indirectly emphasize the relationship between Japan's current situation and the issues after the signing of the peace treaty and support MacArthur's argument that Japan is ready to sign the peace treaty, so the economic plan passed today should be signed as soon as possible. Although it generally reflects a socialist background, it is a compromise with the Democratic Party, which strongly opposes the socialization of industry except for state control of basic coal mining. As for the goal of establishing new export industries, it is a natural move for any Japanese government at present, regardless of its political ideals.

### The Burmese Government Eagerly Hopes to Restore Sino-Burmese Trade

### The Dutch Detained Chinese Merchant Ships; Agreed to Compensate 500,000 Currency

However, the amount of compensation requested by the Chinese merchants is 4 million dollars, and the difference is so great that it is not expected to be accepted by the Chinese merchants. The Dutch proposal arrived late yesterday and stated that it would compensate with goods instead of money and promised to establish a trade system between Indonesia and Singapore. The Chinese merchants involved in the case are scheduled to hold a meeting to discuss the Dutch proposal.

Editorial

### How Can We Encourage Japan Again!

Washington, D.C., June 9th, United Press: The U.S. State Department has formally announced the opening of foreign trade with Japan. Starting August 15th, 400 foreign business representatives will be allowed to travel to Japan to resume private trade and will be able to contact Japanese manufacturers directly without restrictions. The transmission of this cable, although within our expectations, still feels premature to open foreign trade with Japan before a peace treaty is convened and before the issue of Japanese reparations is resolved, regardless of the angle from which it is observed.

The U.S. has long desired to open foreign trade with Japan in order to accelerate Japan's economic recovery and reduce the burden on American taxpayers. At the beginning of last month, the Far Eastern Commission expressed its hope to open private foreign trade with Japan in July of this year and consulted the governments of China and the Philippines on this issue. At the same time, trade delegations from both Britain and the United States visited Japan to conduct on-site inspections. Now, finally, despite the opposition of China and the Philippines, it has been decided to resume foreign trade with Japan starting August 15th. Whether for the sake of peace in the Far East or for the benefit of the United States itself, the United States must reconsider this important measure.

The Philippine government has already expressed its strong opposition to the opening of foreign trade with Japan. However, the Philippine government's view is only focused on the issue of reparations. They believe that after opening foreign trade with Japan, Japan will have the opportunity to restore industrial production, and Japan can use this as an excuse to demand the preservation of Japanese industrial equipment, thereby affecting the payment of reparations to the Philippines. As for our country's reasons for opposing the opening of foreign trade with Japan, in addition to the views of the Philippines, we also believe that before the Allied Powers sign a peace treaty with Japan and before the issue of Japanese reparations is resolved, Japan must not be allowed to resume private trade with foreign countries. Because Japan was a highly industrialized country before the war: Japan's import trade was mainly food, cotton, wool, and other items; and its export trade was mainly cotton textiles, raw silk, and tea. It not only monopolized the markets in Southeast Asia but also occupied a very important position in the global commodity market. In particular, Japanese cotton textiles have always been strong rivals to Britain and the United States in the world market. Therefore, opening foreign trade with Japan will not only hinder the growth of our country's textile industry, but Britain and the United States will also encounter a strong rival in the market, and damage the growth of our country's textile industry.

In recent months, the defeated Japan has been stirring again, and it has already become clear. In terms of military preparations, Japan has requested the Allied Powers to grant "a small amount of military force"; in terms of territory, Japan has attempted to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States and hopes to obtain special immigration rights in Taiwan; in terms of economy, the demands put forward by the Japanese are even more numerous. The most important of these is Japan's request to reduce the industrial equipment used for reparations. According to a June 9th report from the New Asia News Agency in Tokyo, the Japanese government appears to be extremely compliant with the issue of reparations on the surface, but in reality, it is using various methods to try to reduce the burden of reparations. The Socialist Party has formed a "Reparations Countermeasures Committee" and has decided on three principles: (1) Among the reparations factories designated by MacArthur's headquarters, investigate and study the machines related to the revitalization of Japanese industry, and even if it is a single machine or a factory, reasons should be given to MacArthur to apply for its return to Japan. (2) Among the reparations factories designated by MacArthur's headquarters, investigate and study the equipment related to maintaining the minimum living standards of the people, and apply to MacArthur for its return to Japan. (3) Explain the actual situation of the first two items to the public as much as possible to arouse the attention of the general public.

From this, we can see Japan's deliberate planning. Japan's every move towards the United States is quite similar to the story of "Goujian serving Fucha" in our country's history. The United States allowing the opening of foreign trade with Japan is no less than giving the Japanese a great encouragement. Therefore, we must loudly appeal to the U.S. authorities: the United States must know that leniency can breed evil, and indiscriminate generosity will inevitably harm oneself and others. The final result will not only threaten the safety of the United States in the Pacific but also cause the entire Far East to have no peace and stability. Prevention is better than cure. The United States must be cautious in dealing with Japan and must not be fooled by the Japanese. The lesson of the Pearl Harbor incident should never be forgotten. Even from an economic point of view, opening foreign trade with Japan can indeed reduce the burden on American taxpayers in supporting Japan, but after promoting Japan's economic recovery, Japan's aggressive ambitions will inevitably be revived. How will the United States deal with it then? Will it not become a serious issue again? Therefore, we ask the U.S. authorities to broaden their horizons, face reality, and not be penny-wise and pound-foolish. We sincerely hope that the U.S. authorities, for the sake of peace in the Far East and for their own benefit, will reconsider the matter of opening foreign trade with Japan! Creating a situation where Japan can no longer be encouraged.

In short, if Japan's foreign trade is truly opened, then in the near future, "cheap and high-quality Oriental goods" will flood the world market again. The defeated countries are smiling, while the victorious countries are frowning. This is truly a terrifying contrast. We must firmly argue our case, demanding that the United States broaden its horizons and reconsider its attitude, postponing the date of opening foreign trade with Japan until after the closing of the peace treaty with Japan. But the most important thing is our own country. We hope that the entire nation will seriously reflect on the current situation, work hard to reform, raise vigilance, and always guard against the rebirth of Japan's aggressive ideology!

[Report from Reuters, Washington, June 9th] President Truman is scheduled to leave here by train for Canada tonight (Tuesday morning, Shanghai time) for a three-day official visit. It is expected that his time in Canada will give new impetus to negotiations between the United States and Canada. The outcome of these negotiations may enable Canada to participate in Secretary of State Marshall's "Continental Plan" to aid Europe. Authoritative sources revealed: U.S. and Canadian officials have already discussed solutions to Canada's increasingly serious dollar problem. The seriousness of this problem is no less than that faced by many European countries. President Truman will hold further discussions on the aforementioned issues when he meets with Canadian Prime Minister King, and the wartime cooperation between the U.S. and Canada to solve raw material and production problems may also be restored. Canada's trade with the U.S. is currently in a similar situation to that of many European countries, with imports exceeding exports. At the same time, after Canada's loans to Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and China are exhausted, Canada may have a large supply of wheat, beef, and other commodities urgently needed by foreign countries, but foreign countries lack the financial resources to purchase them. On the other hand, Canada relies entirely on imports from the United States for coal, oil, and other necessities, but because Canada lacks dollars, it is unable to pay for the import of these necessities. One expert stated: Canada cannot continue to sell goods to Europe on credit while buying from the United States on a cash basis. One solution to Canada's difficult situation is to restore some form of the wartime "Hyde Park Agreement," where Canada would sell its surplus wheat, timber, beef, etc. to the United States at prices lower than domestic market prices for export to countries in Europe in need. This would immediately solve Canada's dollar problem and would also allow it to cooperate with the United States in carrying out a large-scale relief plan for European countries.

[U.S. Information Service Local Report] The U.S. "Voice of America" will broadcast President Truman's speech to the joint session of the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa to China on June 12th from 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM (Shanghai Summer Time). This program will replace the regular English program "The Music We Love" and can be heard on the following stations: frequencies 15250, 15150, 11790, 11730, 9650, 9490.

### Austrian Chancellor Makes Solemn Statement; Determined Not to Be Manipulated by the Communist Party; Secretary Marshall Approves of the European Federation Plan

[Report from United Press, Vienna, June 9th] Austrian Chancellor Figl issued a formal announcement after holding an emergency meeting of the People's Party, denying that he had contacted the Communist Party or intended to resign. He stated, "The Chancellor will only resign when the Austrian people demand his resignation by a large majority, and new elections will only be held when the constitution of the Democratic Republic of Austria requires it, or when the majority of the Austrian people decide to hold a vote." Fischer, the Moscow-trained leader of the Austrian Communist Party, had previously told reporters that the Chancellor had indicated to him during a recent meeting that the Chancellor was willing to expand the government to include more Communist Party members, or else he would resign during the new elections. Figl continued in the announcement: In the past twelve months, Fischer has constantly attempted to hold private talks with the Chancellor. Finally, the Chancellor agreed to hold a meeting on June 5th. However, to the Chancellor's surprise, Fischer went beyond the scope of private talks and raised current national policy issues. Chancellor Figl continued, "Therefore, no negotiations took place, and no decisions were made. Therefore, he did not think there was any reason to inform the Socialist Party members in the government of the contents of the talks." According to U.S. military authorities, the purpose of the Austrian manager's actions is to reveal the weakness of the Austrian Communist Party before the Communist Party can seize Austrian power (as in the Hungarian coup).

[Report from United Press, Washington, June 10th] It was revealed today that Secretary of State Marshall has given conditional support to the principle of a European Federation. According to reliable sources in Congress, Marshall sent a letter to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, regarding Senator Fulbright's proposed bill, which supports a European Federation, the first time it has been seen in the congressional record. In his letter, Marshall stated that although he strongly sympathized with the European Federation proposal, he believed that any bill passed by Congress should include a preamble stating that the United States had no preconceived notions about any form of federation. According to a diplomat's message: The United States has rejected the Communist Party's attempt to forcibly reorganize the Austrian government. He said that the news from Vienna seems to be part of the Communist Party's attempt to expand its power in Central and Eastern Europe, as was implemented in Hungary. However, the situation in Vienna is very different from that in Budapest, because the occupation of the Austrian capital is jointly participated in by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, rather than being undertaken by the Soviet Union alone, as was the case in Hungary. He also pointed out that this situation is not only true for the city of Vienna, but also for the entire country.

### Bullitt Urges U.S., Britain, and France to Organize a European Democratic League and Exposes the Soviet Union's Intentions Towards Europe

[Report from Reuters, Washington, June 9th] Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, William Bullitt, gave a speech at Georgetown University tonight, urging the U.S., Britain, and France to quickly organize a European Democratic League before the Soviet Union occupies the entire European continent, and said that only U.S. military power can prevent the Red Army from occupying all of Europe. Bullitt said that every European knows that if the remaining democratic countries in Europe cannot unite to implement mutual defense, then these countries will be annexed by the Soviet Union one by one. If the U.S. government can persuade the British and French governments to jointly establish a European Democratic League with it, so that all countries with democratic systems and respect for the Bill of Rights, including the states of Germany, can join this league, then the trust and hope of the people of European democratic countries can be restored. Soviet leaders would never dare to launch a war against the United States or its friends, because they know that the current strength of the United States is far greater than that of the Soviet Union and its affiliated countries. However, they will launch an attack when they believe that their own strength is greater than ours. Today, what can prevent Stalin from ordering the Red Army to occupy all of Europe is only the superiority of U.S. military force and the atomic bomb.

### The Austro-Hungarian Border is Not Tense

[Report from Reuters, Austro-Hungarian Border, June 9th] It has recently been rumored that the Hungarian authorities have tightened security measures around Lake Neusiedl on the Austro-Hungarian border. However, after the reporter inspected a 20-mile stretch of the border, no special security measures were found. The political crisis in Budapest seems to have little impact on the Hungarian countryside. According to Austrian border officials, Austrian and Hungarian farmers are still crossing the border as usual every day. When the reporter inspected the border, he did not see any special phenomena such as a large number of refugees pouring in.

### Wallace Comments on the Political Situation in Hungary and Bulgaria

[Report from Agence France-Presse, Newark, New Jersey, June 9th] Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace told reporters today that the recent events in Hungary and Bulgaria are a direct consequence of the Truman Doctrine. Britain and the United States have already gained Greece and Turkey because of the Truman Doctrine, and the Soviet Union should also have Hungary and Bulgaria.

### Secretary Marshall is Making the Final Review of the U.S. Government's Protest to the Soviet Union; Agrees to Establish a Committee to Investigate the Causes of the Hungarian Coup

[News from our office] San Francisco, June 10th Broadcast: Secretary of State Marshall returned after attending the graduation ceremony of the Virginia Military Institute and personally handled the steps the United States should take in response to the Hungarian coup, and finally decided on the wording of the protest note to the Soviet Union. The draft of the note has been circulated among various government agencies and has been agreed to by the British Foreign Office. According to officials, the note does not contain any threatening tone. If the reply is not considered satisfactory, the United States will raise the case with the United Nations.

[Report from Reuters, London, June 9th] Minister of State McNeil stated in Parliament in response to a question from a member of Parliament that the Soviet Union should be judged on the actions of the new government of Hungary. The British government hopes that the change in the Hungarian government will not lead to a departure from the principles of parliamentary democracy. If there is any such development, it will inevitably seriously affect the relationship between Britain and Hungary.

[Report from Agence France-Presse, London, June 9th] Regarding the recent coup in Hungary, the United States intends to send a note to the Soviet representative to the Allied Control Commission for Hungary, Sviridov, to express its protest. A copy of the note has been sent to the British Foreign Office. According to well-informed sources, after receiving the copy, the British Foreign Office immediately sent a reply to the U.S. State Department, stating that Britain agrees to establish a tripartite committee consisting of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to investigate the various events that caused the Hungarian coup. It is rumored that former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy intends to form a government in exile. London has not heard of this. In addition, the British Foreign Office is also closely monitoring the events that have occurred in Bulgaria. After the arrest of Bulgarian opposition leader Petkov, strong protests from the U.S. and Britain were aroused, but Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov condemned the protests as "interference in Bulgaria's internal affairs." British officials believe that the Bulgarian Prime Minister's statement is unreasonable and that Britain and the United States have the right to supervise whether Bulgaria is complying with the basic laws of democracy, because Bulgaria has made a promise to comply with such laws.

[Report from Associated Press, Hungary, June 9th] Sviridov, the acting chairman of the Allied Control Commission for Hungary, sent a brief note to the head of the U.S. military delegation today, rejecting the U.S. request to provide a copy of the testimony of Kovács, the former Secretary-General of the Smallholders Party. The British request for a copy was also rejected by the Soviet side last week.

### The French Government Formally Announces the Revision of the Saar Region Boundary; Britain and the United States are Expected to Support It

[Report from Associated Press, Paris, June 10th] French authorities announced today that France has revised the boundary of the Saar region for economic reasons, temporarily including the city of Saarlouis into French territory pending the signing of a peace treaty with Germany. The French side has sent a formal note to the authorities of the other three countries in the German occupation zone, stating that France has moved the boundary line southeastward from Saarlouis and several villages near Treves, and the old boundary line will cut off the Treves area from its trade area. The German territory affected by the boundary revision is all within the French occupation zone in Germany.

[Report from Agence France-Presse, Paris, June 10th] Regarding the resolution of the Saar region's boundary, France has reduced the area of its industrial zone from 17.9 million miles to 15.76 million square miles and the population from 880,000 to 852,000. The area of the region in 1919 was 1,204 square miles, and the population was 788,000.

(Agence France-Presse, Paris, June 9th) Officials recently announced that "Saar Mark" will henceforth be the new currency system of the Saar region. The currently circulating German Mark will be withdrawn at a ratio of one to one and replaced with "Saar Marks." According to well-informed sources, the purpose of this measure is to prepare the Saar region for economic integration with France, without changing the Saar region's legal status.

[Report from Reuters, London, June 9th] Diplomatic observers here believe that Britain is now prepared to accept the French government's recently proposed new boundary for the Saar and intends to support it in future discussions on German boundaries. It is not yet known what the U.S. government's attitude towards this matter is. It is expected that the British government will not publicly express its agreement with France's new demands before it is certain of the U.S. attitude.

### The United States Values Okinawa; Will Make the Island an Outpost Base

[Report from United Press, Okinawa, June 2nd] (Delayed) Americans on Okinawa believe that the United States should announce its detailed plans for Okinawa in the near future, so that the U.S. plan to rebuild the island into an important base in the Western Pacific can be carried out. Americans here unanimously believe that Okinawa, which the U.S. obtained at the cost of 35,000 deaths and injuries, will remain under U.S. occupation. However, they insist that if the U.S. military position in the Western Pacific is to be maintained, it is necessary to rebuild the military base as soon as possible. If events in the Far East proceed as planned, the U.S. will sign a peace treaty with Japan early next year. The treaty is expected to formally recognize U.S. possession of Okinawa and stipulate that most of the U.S. military and its equipment in Japan, including hundreds of aircraft, be withdrawn immediately. It is believed that MacArthur and his staff will propose that most of the U.S. troops, especially the air force, should be withdrawn to Okinawa. The island, along with Guam, will henceforth be regarded as important U.S. bases in the Far East. In order for Okinawa to be large enough to accommodate 100,000 to 200,000 troops, a large amount of money and a long period of time will be required, and it must be carried out as soon as possible. According to opinions here, there is no doubt that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan will begin in the next twelve months. If these troops are withdrawn to Okinawa, they should be provided with permanent housing. Some troops have been transferred to the island from the Philippines, and more troops may be transferred. Due to the frequent typhoons on the island, the barracks must be sturdily built. Therefore, Americans here believe that the most urgent need now is to immediately decide on the political future of the island and a large-scale development plan for the island. This can enable Okinawa to stand alongside Guam as an outpost of U.S. democracy in the Western Pacific.

### U.S.-Australia Talks

### International Military Issues: I Oppose Soviet Proposal

[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] The Chinese Deputy Representative to the United Nations, Mr. Hsia Chin-lin, today took the lead in firmly opposing the Soviet proposal that major nations provide equal numbers of soldiers, warships, and aircraft to form a world standby force. It is said that China cannot be expected to provide the same number of aircraft carriers, battleships, and long-range bombers as the United States and the United Kingdom. The same goes for France. Moreover, the Soviet Union itself has issues with aircraft carriers. It is expected that during this afternoon's discussion, the British representative will echo China's position, insisting that countries must contribute military strength "comparatively" and that a world standby force should not be established immediately.

### Italian Cabinet in Crisis

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 10th] The Italian political horizon is clouded today. The majority Socialist Party has decided to oppose the new Gasperi cabinet.

The attitudes of the minority Socialist Party and the Christian Democratic Party are unknown. The Republican Party and the Action Party have already expressed their opposition to the new government.

### Butterworth's Vacancy: Armour to Succeed

Armour is Former U.S. Ambassador to Spain

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] President Truman has appointed Mr. Armour as Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, succeeding Butterworth, who has resigned. Mr. Armour served as U.S. Ambassador to Argentina from 1939 to 1944, and as Ambassador to Spain from December 1944, returning to the U.S. after one year in that post. He is highly experienced in Latin American affairs. Since the U.S. government's policy toward its Latin American neighbors entered a new phase of rapid development, the resignation of Assistant Secretary of State Butterworth, who previously advocated arming the entire Western Hemisphere and taking a tough stance against the Perón government of Argentina, as well as the retirement of U.S. Ambassador to Argentina, Messersmith, after completing the rapprochement with the new Argentine regime, and the appointment of Armour as Assistant Secretary of State, are the most recent developments.

### Fifty Crew and Passengers of the Dafeng Wheel Missing, Presumed Dead; More Than 170 Survivors Transported to Shanghai and Nantong; Director of Maritime Affairs Bureau Scheduled to Inspect Scene of Accident Today

[Report from this newspaper] The Dafeng wheel of the Dafeng Shipping Bureau sank due to an accident caused by wind near the Liuhou Estuary late at night on the 9th. The matter has already been noted in yesterday's newspaper. According to the person in charge of the Dafeng wheel Bureau, the wheel had a total of 46 employees, approximately 14 tea servers, 93 passengers with tickets for merchant ships, and 72 passengers who bought tickets after boarding the wheel, for a total of approximately 225 people. The China Oil Wheel Company's number 128 wheel and the Shanshui wheel rescued 132 people. Furthermore, the Xiangli Shipping Company's Xiangli seagoing wheel rescued 29 people (7 of whom were crew members). These 29 people have already been sent to Nantong Ren port by the Xiangli wheel. Also, an unknown number of sand wheels rescued more than 10 people. A total of more than 170 people have been rescued, so as of now, there are still approximately 50 people whose whereabouts are unknown. The complete list of survivors has been copied by the Dafeng wheel Bureau and posted at the entrance of the Bureau. Some of the passengers were transferred to Nantong by the Dafeng Bureau through the Baofeng and Jiangkang wheels last night. All wheel tickets and meals were borne by the Bureau. Yesterday, from dawn to dusk, relatives of the passengers of the Dafeng wheel went to the agency to inquire one after another. Those who saw their names on the list were all overjoyed. The Dafeng Shipping Bureau only has this one wheel, and it was not insured beforehand, so it declared bankruptcy after this accident. Regarding the passengers and crew members who have not yet been rescued and are missing, the company requested the Maritime Affairs Bureau to ask the Executive Yuan Water Transport Brigade to dispatch a tug-barge wheel to wait, but there was still nothing to be gained until last night. Today, it will continue to send the landing craft Shenhua wheel to the scene of the accident to search for survivors.

Yongzhang Wheel Acts Righteously and Does Its Best to Help

According to Dafeng crew members who spoke to reporters, if it hadn't been for the China Oil Wheel Company's Yongzhang wheel, the number of deaths would have reached more than 100. The Yongzhang wheel used various methods to rescue those who fell into the water, and its spirit of righteousness is truly admirable. It is heard that the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau and the Shipping Guild have telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to report the Dafeng wheel's accident and the Yongzhang wheel's spirit of righteousness. As for the list of the deceased, it is still being investigated.

### List of Rescued Passengers

However, the Chief Engineer's whereabouts are still unknown.

[Another Report] Huang Muzong, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, especially accompanied Chen Xuding, Section Chief of the Bureau, to the Dafeng Shipping Bureau yesterday morning to inquire about the accident of the Dafeng Wheel. Xu Wenhua, Manager of Dafeng, and others personally stated everything and submitted a report on the accident. Director Huang originally intended to take a tug-barge wheel to the sinking location of the Dafeng Wheel yesterday afternoon to investigate, but later gave up due to the wind still being strong and unfavorable for navigation. If the wind weakens today, he will still go to the site to investigate.

### Typhoon Passes Into the Sea: Weather Expected to Improve Within Days

[Report from this newspaper] Previously, Shanghai was affected by the eastward advance of the low-pressure system in Hunan and Guizhou, which was obstructed by the high-pressure systems in North Korea and southern Japan, resulting in strong winds and heavy rain. Yesterday, the low-pressure system crossed Shanghai and entered North Korea and Japan. The torrential rain in Shanghai has stopped, but the wind force was still strong in the morning. Because there is a new high-pressure system to the northwest, following the low-pressure system, the Force 8 typhoon from the day before yesterday entered the sea, and a Force 4 wind took advantage of the situation and entered, but by the afternoon the high-pressure system had also crossed Shanghai. The weather is expected to improve within days. The Shanghai Meteorological Observatory's weather forecast is as follows:

Yellow Sea: Clear, , light fog in the morning in the east, gentle northwest wind to northeast wind, moderate waves. Central China: Cloudy, , morning fog, gentle north wind. Shanghai: , cool, strong turning moderate west-northwest wind, light fog in the morning. East China Sea: Cloudy, strong northwest wind to northeast wind with rain in the north, huge waves, strong cyclone showers around southern Korea and Kyushu, cloudy in the south, strong southeast wind to southwest wind, moderate to huge waves, coastal morning fog. Temperature for the 10th: High 70 degrees, low 62.8 degrees.

Suit to Confirm Lease of Property Sold After Being Declared Enemy or Puppet Property Should Be Dismissed: Judicial Yuan Issues Unified Interpretation

[Report from this newspaper] In Shanghai, some houses that were enemy or puppet property were confiscated by the government. However, because a third party had obtained the right to lease before the victory, this third party was affected after the confiscation, resulting in many disputes. Regarding this issue, the City Council had previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to transfer it to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. According to the Judicial Yuan's unified interpretation of the Law Conference, "Enemy or puppet property that has been confiscated and sold by auction by the auction agency, and the person who won the auction thereby obtains ownership, this right is actually originally acquired, and it is not based on the transfer of ownership from the original enemy or puppet property owner. Therefore, Article 423 of the Civil Code does not apply. If the original tenant files a lawsuit in court to confirm the continued validity of the original lease agreement, it should be considered unreasonable and rejected." (Note: Article 423 of the Civil Code states: "The lessor shall deliver the leased object to the lessee in a state suitable for the agreed-upon use and enjoyment, and shall maintain the state suitable for the agreed-upon use and enjoyment during the term of the lease relationship.")

### New Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Shen Zonglian, Officially Takes Office: All Administrative Policies Should Be Handled in Accordance with the Mayor's Instructions

[Report from this newspaper] The new Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Shen Zonglian (pictured in this newspaper ), officially took office at the Municipal Government at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Because the former Secretary-General, He Dekui, had already resigned, no ceremony was held yesterday. The handover was handled by Chief Secretary Wang Zhaoquan.

Mr. Shen held a tea party in the Municipal Government conference room at 5:00 p.m. yesterday to entertain local newspaper reporters. After an introduction by Zhu Xubai, Director of the Information Office, Mr. Shen delivered a speech, briefly stating: "I have always served in the central government, so I have had no opportunity to meet people from Shanghai. Now that I am employed by the Municipal Government, I can receive instruction from time to time. I know that my talent and knowledge are not shallow, and I will do my best in everything. All administrative policies of the Municipal Government should be based on the Mayor's intentions, and as a staff member, I will definitely act in accordance with the Mayor's instructions." The atmosphere at yesterday's reception was very harmonious, and the meeting adjourned at around 6:00 p.m.

### Mysterious Female Painter Li Qingping Tried; Looking Haggard and Frequently Wiping Tears; Requests Reasonable Protection from the Court

[Report from this newspaper] The case of female painter Li Qingping, who was accused of being a traitor, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. Li is twenty-eight years old and from Jiangling, Hubei. When she was brought in for questioning yesterday, she looked haggard, sallow, and thin. She had two short braids tied with yellow hair ties, and wore a dark blue collared top with yellow stitches on the shoulders and corners of the clothes, navy blue slacks, and cream-colored leather shoes. She was playing with a small white handkerchief in her hand, embroidered with red flowers, and wiping tears from time to time. According to her testimony: After graduating from Shanghai Xinhua Art College, she went to Kuala Lumpur in Southeast Asia to work as an art teacher. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, she returned to Shanghai and lived in Shanghai Art College, making a living by _painting. She went to Beiping in November of the same year, because Beiping's scenery is good, and I study landscape painting, so I went to Beiping to find good painting materials. She returned to Shanghai at the end of autumn in the 32nd year, and went to Tianjin, Suzhou, Hangzhou and other places in the 33rd year, all for painting. The indictment in court stated that she _ _ Chu Min_ was her father, and she knew the Japanese naval reporting minister Matsushima and Shiota, and supplied information to the enemy to question her. Answer: "That's not the case. I have always been in the occupied area. How could I know our military intelligence?" At this point, the court presented the Hankou City Police Department's reply to the defendant for review, which stated in part: "According to general rumors, Li has had a lot of interaction with Japanese people, but no concrete evidence can be provided." The defendant said: "Since there is no concrete evidence, how can you say that I am a traitor? I am an educated person who has received art education. Please give me legal protection from this kind of insult without facts."

### Two Japanese War Criminals Tried for Abusing Allied Nationals; Hua Men and Eight Others Appear in Court to Testify; Defendants Deny and Are Ambiguous

[Report from this newspaper] Japanese war criminals Odera Satoshi, former warden of the Allied Prisoner of War Camp on Haifang Road in Shanghai, and Honda Osamu, chief of general affairs, were given a preliminary hearing yesterday by the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. Eight British and American people who had been severely abused in the camp, including Hua Men, the former inspector of the Public Works Bureau, testified in court yesterday. It is said that after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese regarded the Allied nationals in Shanghai as prisoners of war and concentrated them in the Haifang Road camp, which was managed by Odera Satoshi and others. The amount of food for the 300 prisoners in the camp was only equal to the food for 30 guards. The prison had no cold protection equipment, and the winter temperature was often below zero. The hospital where sick prisoners lived was located near the storage of munitions, without regard to danger. During air raids, they were not concerned about the safety of prisoners and were not allowed to take refuge. The clothes and food sent to the prisoners by the International Red Cross were often confiscated and embezzled. Some prisoners were beaten. Various abuses were countless. In July 1945, all the overseas Chinese were transported to Fengtai, Hebei, and Odera Satoshi and others were still responsible for management. Sick and elderly prisoners could not be exempted from the transfer. The vehicles were crowded during the journey, and they stood continuously for more than ninety-six hours. The equipment and food in the Fengtai camp were even more unhygienic, so their health was greatly damaged. When questioned by the court, both defendants denied giving the prisoners less food. Regarding the confiscation of items sent by the Red Cross, they only admitted that they had refused to accept it once because they did not recognize the person sending the items. The others were also ambiguous. The case will be retried at a later date.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Visits the Good Shepherd Convent: A Group of Helpless Girls Receive Spiritual Warmth

[Report from Our Newspaper] It was an early summer afternoon with a touch of autumn, yet it brought the warmth of spring to one hundred and thirty orphaned and helpless girls. Yesterday at 5:00 PM, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by the General Secretary of the Catholic Welfare Committee, Father Mindrebo, and Mr. and Mrs. Ye Qiuyuan, the chief writer of this newspaper, visited the Good Shepherd Convent at the end of Hengshan Road. It is not entirely a girls' school nor an orphanage. It is a place specifically for the reception of unfortunate, orphaned, and helpless girls. There are underage girls, as well as women who have experienced life's hardships and fallen into prostitution. Thanks to the hard work of the nuns at the Good Shepherd Convent, some of these helpless people have received warmth, which has long moved Madame Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, despite coming to Shanghai to treat a dental ailment, she took the time to make a visit.

Yesterday, after leaving the doctor's clinic, Madame Chiang went to the Good Shepherd Convent on Hengshan Road. Needless to say, the nuns were already waiting at the door. The Good Shepherd Convent is an international organization, and its president in Shanghai is an American, currently in the United States. In addition, there are nuns from the United States, Canada, South America, France, and the Philippines. Their national style of life is one of "seeking alms," constantly begging in various places to support these helpless people. They welcomed this distinguished guest with utmost joy. They sang songs; Madame Chiang, with a motherly heart, gave them a brief address, urging them to learn from Jesus, serve the community, and pray more. She also had earnest conversations with them individually. Their innocence touched Madame Chiang. As the nuns accompanied Madame Chiang on a tour of the various departments, they even saw the kitchen. Madame Chiang was particularly interested in the cleanliness of the kitchen, believing it was due to the nuns' excellent teaching.

Therefore, when the nuns entertained Madame Chiang with tea and snacks in the reception room, Madame Chiang generously donated twenty bags of rice to them and promised to send them sweets and meat. This was only in terms of material support; the fact that Madame Chiang was able to visit them during her short stay in Shanghai was what gave them spiritual warmth. Madame Chiang stayed at the Good Shepherd Convent for an hour before leaving; however, that one hour warmed the hearts of a hundred and thirty people.

### Workers' Lives Should Be Improved: The General Labor Union Believes There Is No Reason to Restore Pre-War Salaries and Opposes the Uniform Discount Method for the Index

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Shui Xiangyun, the long-standing chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, spoke to our newspaper reporter yesterday, stating that since the cost of living index was unfrozen, various industrial trade associations and public utility associations have been petitioning everywhere, requesting that the wages of 1936 be restored as the base and that the current month's salary be paid according to the previous month's index, both of which are unreasonable. In 1936, workers earned only twenty or thirty cents a day, and their lives were inhuman. After the victory of the War of Resistance, how can workers not be allowed to improve their lives slightly? Paying salaries according to the previous month's index is even more in violation of the central government's intentions. Moreover, the unfreezing method stipulates that if factories are genuinely losing money, labor and management can negotiate to discount the index further. Workers have not expressed opposition to this, because workers are most aware of the profits and losses of their own factories and absolutely do not want their factories to close down and put themselves out of work. Mr. Shui said: Recently, he met with Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs in Nanjing, and yesterday he met with Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Both ministers stated that the central government would never change its established policies, and factories with difficulties could negotiate individually. Mr. Shui further emphasized that the General Labor Union absolutely opposes the uniform index discount method for various industries. He said that there are many reasons why industry cannot be revitalized at present, and the industrial sector should focus on the big picture and request the government to solve difficulties such as raw material imports, lifting the dumping of foreign goods, industrial and commercial loans, etc., rather than haggling over wages.

### Index Dispute: Workers at a Liangjia Factory Stage Hunger Strike

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the cost of living index was unfrozen, labor-management disputes have been continuous, and the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation work has been very busy. More than twenty factories in the printed silk industry previously had workers on strike, but they have now accepted advice and resumed work yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately summoned them for mediation. The dispute at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory was resolved the night before last. The factory's 15% allowance issued last year will be canceled from May, and May's salary will be paid at 23,500 times the index. The balance will be paid off before June 17th. The factory will resume operations, and the workers will return to work. In the silk weaving industry, Huanqiu, Xinfu, Wanchang, Yuandong, and four other factories are still slowing down work, while the rest have resumed work.

More than one hundred employees of the Jiuchang Silk Weaving Factory on Luban Road in the South City are demanding that their May wages be paid according to the index of 23,500 times, but the factory only agreed to 14,800 times. The workers started a hunger strike the day before yesterday, and the Social Affairs Bureau is sending personnel to mediate. Workers at the Qianghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Fanhuangdu Road demanded that their wages be adjusted to a base salary system based on the cost of living index, but they were unsuccessful. Moreover, the factory has not yet paid their May wages and June meal allowances, so the workers also started a hunger strike the day before yesterday. The Silk Weaving Industry Association of the Third District sent representatives to the General Labor Union yesterday to report the situation.

Unemployed workers at the Printing Department of the Zhonghua Book Company requested reinstatement of their jobs. The mediation was assisted by Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. The two sides did not reach an agreement and decided to talk again on the 12th.

### Commemoration of the 36th Anniversary of the Merchant Corps Comrades Association

Gathering at the Hu She on the 15th

During the Xinhai Revolution, the Shanghai Merchant Corps participated in the encirclement of the Jiangnan Arsenal by the people’s army, capturing it in one fell swoop, thereby liberating Shanghai. Subsequently, a portion of the corps members participated in the attack on Nanjing, and then followed the army on the Northern Expedition, handling rear logistics work between Pukou and Xuzhou. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the corps members returned to their posts and continued their business. Unexpectedly, Yuan Shikai later usurped the country and, fearing the Merchant Corps as revolutionary elements, ordered his henchman Zheng Ruicheng, the Shanghai Garrison Commander, to forcibly disband it, and it disappeared. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the corps members, filled with joy, recalled the past and sought out old comrades. On June 16th of last year, they held a dinner gathering at the Cui Xiu Hall in the City God Temple and discussed organizing the Shanghai Merchant Corps Comrades Association for the Restoration of Shanghai during the Xinhai Revolution.

### Upholding Amateur Sports International Amateur Athletic Association Congress Rejects Changes to Amateur Rules

[Reuters London, 9th] The amateur sports rules for the Olympic Games in London next year will not be changed. The International Amateur Athletic Association held a special meeting here today, attended by representatives from twenty-three countries, to discuss the issue of compensation for athletes' loss of time. As a result, it was decided to submit the case to the next congress held after the Olympic Games next year for reconsideration. The conveners of today's meeting were Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and Iceland. The purpose was to determine that athletes could receive appropriate compensation for the time lost due to participation in competitions. However, after intense debate and opposition from American representative Avery Brundage, president of the American Olympic Association, the motion was submitted to the next congress in 1948 for reconsideration by a vote of twenty-nine to seventeen. Brundage refused to accept the position of vice president of the congress and protested against the convening of this congress. Brundage stated that this meeting was convened to discuss the issue of athlete compensation, which is completely illegal, violates the amateur rules, and will shake the foundation of the association. Congress President Sir Burghley stated that the amateur rules cannot be changed and must continue to be followed. The Dutch representative proposed that athletes participating in world, European, or international championships who are solely responsible for family living expenses may receive compensation not exceeding one pound or its equivalent value. The Swedish representative agreed to revise the rules so that some athletes could not sacrifice time due to economic reasons, so that everyone would have the opportunity to participate in sports competitions, which would be extremely fair. Brundage countered that this motion was completely illegal and stated that because representatives from South America, Central America, Asia, and the Far East did not participate, this issue should be left to the next congress for discussion. It was then put to a vote and passed for discussion at the next congress.

### Soviet Participation Issue

The congress also approved Burma and Lebanon as members, while Iran, Jamaica, and Korea still need to fulfill certain conditions and comply with them. Regarding the Soviet Union issue, President Burghley stated that the membership application has been received, but procedures still need to be completed before approval. Some Soviet youth athletes have participated in professional competitions due to a misunderstanding of the true meaning of amateur rules. They should now be given the opportunity to participate in the Olympic Games. The Soviet Union's membership issue was approved and authorized to the board for decision.

Finally, it closed at 8.6 million, a decrease of 400,000 compared to the previous day. Dongyang and other goods also fell along with it. 75-count Golden Chicken semi-gloss was still bid for 25 million, but no one asked about it.

### Rice Shops Remain Stagnant, Market Weak in the South, Firm in the North

[Our Report] Due to the impact of wind and rain, cargo ships were delayed en route, so yesterday's arrivals were slightly scarce. According to statistics, 4,010 shi arrived in the south market and 1,625 shi in the north market. There were more retail buyers and sellers in the market, but sales were mediocre, and the rice shops remained stagnant. The market was weak in the south and firm in the north.

Early rice was priced at 395,000 yuan in the south market and 400,000 yuan in the north market.

Further reports: The rice market has been sluggish recently due to the approaching plum rain season. Prices in the interior are declining, and consumption is weak, making it difficult for the market to improve. The main reasons are that Sichuan is opening up, grain from Hankou is difficult to transport east, Jiangxi will open soon, and rice from Anhui is flooding into Shanghai, directly causing rice prices to fall. The tight money supply is also a factor.

The oil market has new cases emerging. Cooking oil consumption in the countryside has decreased. Green Bird and Yingkou continue to have sources of supply, gradually declining. Although flour has fallen sharply, manufacturers expect that 100,000 units of new flour must be imported in the future, so wheat flour continues to fall. Moreover, transportation in northern Jiangsu has resumed, and wheat production in northern Jiangsu is also a major component of Jiangsu Province. Future supplies are bound to flood in, so there is no concern about food shortages. Foreign rice is not included in the budget.

### Large Quantities of Foreign Indica Rice Being Shipped to Shanghai

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chen ship has already loaded over 7,000 tons of indica rice purchased by the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) in Rangoon for shipment to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive around the 20th. Furthermore, the company will dispatch the Hai Xuan ship from Shanghai directly to Rangoon at the end of this month to load over 9,000 tons of CNRRA indica rice for shipment to Shanghai.

### Export Packaging Materials May Be Permitted for Import, But Not Allowed to Enter the Market

[Our Report] The 13th regular meeting of the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. Chen Guangfu, Liu Gongyun, Wu Sida, Chen Junren, Lu Zuofu (represented by Tong Shaosheng), and Magr, Bai Yien attended. Chaired by Chen Guangfu, two important cases were discussed and passed, pending approval by the National Economic Council before implementation. The two cases are summarized as follows: (1) Approved the organizational regulations and budget of the Secretariat of the General Assembly. (2) Approved the special import measures for packaging materials required for export goods. It is reported that these packaging materials are not included in the quota allocation of the Export Control Committee. However, it is stipulated that exporters must guarantee that the materials will not enter the market as commodities for sale before applying for permission to import. It is reported that this case was proposed by Magr.

### Export Control Committee to Accommodate the Import of Wool with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange, But Limited to Applicants Before April 17th

[Our Report] It is learned that the head of the Quota Allocation Department of the Export Control Committee has recently been replaced, but internal operations are still proceeding as usual, and there are no other personnel changes. It is reported that the various quotas announced by the department for the first and second quarters are generally felt to be insufficient, especially for wool, paper, raw materials, and rubber. The extent of the shortage is even greater. The department is currently trying to accommodate wool importers who have self-provided foreign exchange and have applied for permission to import wool before April 17th of this year. However, applications after that date cannot be processed due to the regulations of the authorities. Regarding the allocation of rubber quotas, the department convened a rubber manufacturer consultation group meeting yesterday to discuss the issue. As a result, the manufacturers still failed to determine the allocation on their own and requested the department to allocate the quotas based on the first quarter allocation situation. The first quarter rubber quota was US$1.1 million, allocated as follows: raw materials US$700,000, tires US$300,000, waste rubber and other rubber products US$50,000 each. The second quarter quota has been increased to US$2 million.

### Cigarettes Apparently Firm, Actually Soft

Yesterday's cigarette market situation: At the opening, the market continued to be firm and high, and the number of resales in the market decreased. Demand from other merchants was higher, and the prices of various goods were raised across the board. Ten Large British cigarettes once rose to 6.7 million yuan. At the close, the footing was not solid, and sales occurred when the price fell back to 6.55 million yuan. Old Knife was 5.55 million yuan, Five Flowers was 4.45 million yuan, Beauty was 38,500 yuan, and Da Nan Wei was 90,000 yuan, all with supplies available.

The market softened further in the afternoon. In addition, the China Tobacco Company opened a distribution of 20 Quanlu cigarettes at a price of 12,000 yuan, Shuangfu cigarettes at 18,000 yuan per carton, Tianka cigarettes at two cases of Type A and one case of Type B, indicating ample supply. This tightened the financial resources of other merchants, and the market stagnated. As a result, the price of ten Large British cigarettes fell back to 6.58 million yuan, Old Knife was 5.535 million yuan, and Five Flowers was 4.43 million yuan. Compared with the previous day, Large British still rose by 230,000 yuan, Old Knife rose by 185,000 yuan, and Five Flowers rose by 180,000 yuan. The overall trend throughout the day was that only the Quanlu and Shuangfu brands fell more due to the distribution of goods, while most other cigarettes tended to be firm.

### Soap and Matches Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the market for daily necessities such as soap and matches saw an increase in prices due to the diligent replenishment of stocks and demand from local stores. In the end, the price of Gubben soap was 378,000 yuan per case, a continued increase of 8,000 yuan. Huang Xiangmao and Sunlight soap also rose by 15,000 yuan. Matches: Beauty was 2.63 million yuan, an increase of 30,000 yuan. New Phoenix rose by 50,000 yuan, New Brand Da Hua rose by 20,000 yuan, and the remaining brands were stable.

### Photoengraving Industry Association Appeals for Import of Raw Materials

The second quarter import quota has been announced by the Export Control Committee and is currently being allocated in detail. The photoengraving industry in Shanghai, due to a shortage of photographic materials and the Export Control Committee's refusal to allow imports, has appealed to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office to request a solution from the Export Control Committee.

It is stated that there are 33 photoengraving factories in the city. Most of the equipment is outdated and rudimentary, making it difficult to reach standard levels. The main products are still comparable to foreign goods, but copper plates are significantly inferior to foreign products. Before the war, the industry could produce 2 million inches of plates per month, one-quarter of which was supplied to newspapers, one-quarter to the printing industry, and half to bookstores. Currently, the industry produces only 100,000 inches per month, only for newspapers and the printing industry. Based on the current situation, the industry needs 40 tons of zinc plate raw materials, 60 tons of copper plate raw materials, and various other materials such as sodium nitrate, iodine tablets, and film adhesives, all of which must be supplied by imports. It is hoped that the government can provide exchange settlement convenience. For those that have already been imported, it is hoped that the government will immediately settle the exchange. As for photographic materials, China is currently unable to manufacture them, and they must be ordered from foreign countries. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will allow the import of these materials within the quota.

### Liu Qingyi and Others Establish Huachang Silk Company

China's entire silk industry rarely has large-scale organizations that handle both reeling and weaving. In the state-owned sector, there is only China Silk Company. In the private sector, there is also only China Silk Company. It is learned that Liu Qingyi, a leading figure in the Shanghai silk weaving industry, in view of this, has invited Zhuang Shuhao, Qu Yongzhong, Cai Xintao, Lin Xinnan, and other leading figures in the financial and silk weaving industries to raise 500 million yuan to establish Huachang Silk Company. Zhuang Shuhao was elected as chairman, and Cai Xintao, Qu Yongzhong, and Lin Xinnan were elected as standing directors. Liu Qingyi also serves as general manager. The general management office is located at 210 Jiujiang Road, Shanghai, and the factory is located in Ximen, Wuxi. The factory site is spacious, covering an area of five mu. The equipment is complete and equipped with 140 of the latest rotary reeling machines and Maoye-style silkworm raising machines, comparable in scale to China Silk Company. It also raised funds to set up purchasing stations in the silkworm producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to purchase over 1,000 dan of improved silkworm cocoons as raw materials for reeling high-quality raw silk. It also hired famous technicians to train workers in new technologies to achieve the goal of high quality and quantity. It is scheduled to start work in mid-month.

### Pharmaceuticals Weak and Declining

Yesterday, there was a violent wind and rain, and the market was quiet. In addition, with the approaching yellow calendar period, firms were releasing inventory, leading to a weak downstream market. However, foreign and Guang goods were quite firm due to exchange rate factors. Few visited the market yesterday.

### Government Will Provide Maximum Subsidies to Exporters to Break the Stalemate in Export Trade

[Our Report] Since the emergence of a black market for foreign exchange, and the increasing divergence between the black market rate and the official exchange rate, export trade prices have gradually become incompatible, and recently have completely stalled. On the one hand, the government still needs to supply importers with foreign exchange at the official rate to import foreign goods. This has led to an increasing trade deficit and its contradictory procedures. In order to remedy this defect, Chinese import and export circles have advocated the implementation of an import and export linkage system. Foreign companies, on the other hand, mostly advocate restoring a free foreign exchange trading system. However, according to reliable sources, the authorities have carefully considered both suggestions and ultimately feel that there are difficulties in implementation. As a transitional measure, on the export side, the government will provide maximum subsidies to exporters, accept requests from exporters, and purchase export goods from the government, and then plan to centrally export them in order to break the current stalemate in export trade. At the same time, on the import side, the government will increase a certain amount of tax based on the nature and type of each imported product in order to compensate for the losses suffered by export trade.

### Iron Ox Plows the Soil: Tractor Completes Plowing Two Mu of Land in Half an Hour; Leveling Machine Benefits New Rural Construction

— Hangzhou, 7th Quick Dispatch—Our Newspaper Dispatches Correspondent Rong Yusheng to Yuhang

Two months ago, the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) received tractors and leveling machines from the headquarters. Two months later, these tractors have already begun working on the barren land belonging to Yuhang County, arousing the interest of people from all walks of life in Zhejiang. Ba Yi, the Chief Executive Officer of the Taiwan Executive Office; Shen Honglie, the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government; Zhejiang University; Zhijiang University; YMCA members; and colleagues from the press have all visited. They unanimously expressed their admiration for these scientific and industrial machines. At the invitation of Sun Xiaoji, the director of the Zhejiang Branch of CRRRA, the reporter set off towards Yuhang on a hot early summer day. Yuhang is a neighboring county of Hangzhou, and I have been there twice before. Once was during the war, when we were preparing to defend against the enemy. The other time was in July of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), during the recovery process. At that time, the road to Yuhang was filled with desolation, piles of broken walls and ruins, appearing desolate and dilapidated. The original vast forests had become swamps up to one's knees. This time, it was the second year after the victory, and along the way, there were still no signs of recovery. No new houses had been added, and no large areas of newly cultivated land were seen.

Approaching Yuhang, the car stopped beside the highway, where there were two mobile metal houses, separated by a fence into a courtyard. Two signs were hanging at the entrance: one read "Tractor Driving and Repair Training Class of the Zhejiang Branch" and the other read "Collective Farm of Yuhang County." First, we visited the equipment in the mobile metal houses, and then we looked at the tractor and leveling machine. The so-called tractor (originally named "Tractor") is a machine that uses an engine to tow various agricultural implements. Its body is like a car head, and it can be equipped with plows to plow the soil, iron rakes to rake the soil, and sickles to harvest crops. This machine is produced by Ford and manufactured by Ferguson. Similar machines were already in use in the United States long after the First World War. After the First World War, the United States exported this machine to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, based on the shortcomings of this machine after use, conducted research and improvements, and then the United States researched and improved it again, resulting in the current style. Originally, when this machine plowed the soil, if it encountered a large stone that it could not plow, the front of the car would become light and the rear would become heavy, causing it to overturn and even crush the driver to death. Now it is improved. He invented a mechanism. Two iron buttons are placed on the right side of the driver's seat. Just tap them with two fingers, and the plow, weighing several hundred pounds, will lift up, preventing it from being tripped by a large stone. Two plows can be towed behind the machine.

New Look of Work

When we visited, the ten tractors that had been transported were all working on the barren land. Some had only one plow attached to the rear, and a long iron bar for attaching the plow was raised, like a cow's tail, so the general farmers called it the Iron Ox. The Iron Ox plows very deep, more than a foot deep into the soil. After turning it over, it can also be raked loose, and then sown and fertilized. This machine cannot transplant seedlings because there is water in the fields when transplanting seedlings, and it cannot move. But if the seedlings have not been transplanted before irrigation, these Iron Oxen can fulfill the responsibility of plowing. At harvest time, when the fields are dry, these Iron Oxen can also fulfill the responsibility of harvesting. In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University purchased two of these machines and used them, but because of difficulties in repairing them and improper use, they were put aside and not used. Now all the repair parts for the "Iron Ox" are available, and there are also blacksmithing facilities. This blacksmithing facility also came from the United States. It uses a hand-cranked iron furnace, and the wind blows out, eliminating the need to use bellows like in China. At the same time, the hammer used in blacksmithing can also vary depending on the agricultural implements you need, unlike in China, where only one or two types of hammers are always used.

Another type is the leveling machine (originally named "Bulldozer"), which is specially used for pressing and leveling wet soil. It is used less often on cultivated land, but it is very useful for building new rural areas. This leveling machine is also suitable for building roads.

Encouraging Adoption

I asked the farmers about their interest in using tractors. One said, "This Iron Ox is really great. It can plow two mu of land in half an hour." I then asked a farmer who was working with a hoe not far from the mobile metal house if he thought there were any shortcomings in this method of cultivation. He sighed and said, "This method of cultivation is good, but I still use my own hands to cultivate because it is said that for the land cultivated by machine, the township office has to pay grain, two dou per mu if it is cultivated well and one dou per mu if it is cultivated poorly. It is still more cost-effective to cultivate by hand. Like this two mu of land, it takes twenty workdays, each workday is three sheng of rice, and each sheng of rice costs 3,500 yuan, which amounts to 210,000 yuan. But because it is wasteland reclamation, rent does not have to be paid for three years."

From this, we have found the crux of China's agricultural stagnation. We are a nation established on agriculture, and for thousands of years, we have been using human and animal power. We never think of using machines, nor do we study machines, and we even do not welcome machines. The reason for this is that our grassroots politics do not know how to promote it, but instead harm it! The principles of some of our Chinese agricultural implements and methods of manufacturing agricultural implements are not much different from those of modern Western advanced agricultural implements. The only difference is that there is no further research. Whoever does not let them research, whoever prevents new methods from being introduced into the countryside, this should be the responsibility of grassroots politics. We should encourage farmers to use methods of machine plowing like those in Yuhang! How can we levy extra grain payments? And the CRRRA does not want a penny from the local government.

Collective Farm

A senior staff member of the CRRRA who went with us said, "When we arrived in Yuhang, the county government convened a meeting. We asked if there were any organizations like cooperatives in the countryside. Who knew that the cooperatives were not in the countryside. We hoped that they would organize collective farms, but the barren land was distributed in fragmented pieces, making the work very difficult." Cooperatives need to penetrate into the countryside. We know that Yuhang must have cooperative organizations. Why can't the cooperatives produce results?

Talent Training

The CRRRA branch is now stepping up the training of talents in the use and repair of tractors. There are ten people being trained here, all with university degrees. Four are graduates of the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, three are graduates of Yinda University, one is a graduate of the Horticulture Department of Jinling Experimental Agricultural Vocational School, and there are also two who did not graduate from Zhejiang University. They manage these machines, only provided with lodging, without salary, living a hard life in the countryside. In this era of declining morals and people's fondness for enjoyment, they delve into the countryside with a spirit of creation, which is truly admirable. We are delighted and happy to see them working hard and reclaiming barren land. In a time when the future seems bleak and gray, a glimmer of dawn is emerging because they have reclaimed more than a thousand mu of land.

### Seeing the Economic Trends of Overseas Minnanese from Remittances

— Fuzhou, 7th Special Dispatch—Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu

Wherever the sun shines, there are footprints of overseas Chinese. Foreigners often use this sentence to highly praise China, and Chinese people also take pride in it. However, exactly how many overseas Chinese there are, China, being a country that does not keep statistics, has always lacked precise numbers. The reporter here humbly inquired from overseas Chinese leaders in neighboring countries or consulted relevant books and materials on overseas Chinese affairs. The more reliable statistics obtained, including various parts of Southeast Asia, Europe, America, Africa, Australia, Japan, and Korea, estimate that the total number of overseas Chinese is over 13 million (of which overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia account for more than 7.4 million). People from Fujian province account for one-third of the total. From this, the position of the Minnanese in the overseas Chinese community can be seen.

Fujian, because of the uniqueness of its geographical structure, had a long period of isolation from the Central Plains and a tendency towards overseas relations, forming a link in China's maritime commercial culture system. The Minnanese began migrating overseas in the Qin and Han dynasties, flourished in the Tang and Song dynasties. The first places they arrived at were the barren and undeveloped areas of Southeast Asia. Southeast Asians call overseas Chinese "Tang people," and New York has Chinatown. These are all remnants of the great migrations of that time. In the early Ming Dynasty, the Three Treasure Eunuch Zheng He sailed to Southeast Asia. Legend has it that many Minnanese followed him southward at that time, creating a trend for a time. At that time, Guangzhou and Quanzhou had already been opened as commercial ports for trade with various foreign countries, and sailing ships were as dense as weaving, with regular Southeast Asia ships. As a result of centuries of effort, the Minnanese have opened up a vast living space in Southeast Asia and have mastered considerable economic power. The remittances, which amount to a large sum of money every year, are tantamount to increasing the country's foreign exchange income.

Economic Reasons Predominate for Minnanese Going to Southeast Asia

Within Fujian, mountains are intertwined, and plains only account for 5-10% of the province's area, with less than 3,000 mu of arable land. With a population of more than 13 million, "there are many who leave and few who eat," and a large amount of rice and grain is imported every year. Therefore, the population of Fujian appears relatively excessive due to the shortage of arable land. Economic reasons force the Minnanese to "take an aquatic product, a set of clothes, a grass mat, and a carrying pole" and nothing else, and travel far to Southeast Asia. The famous New Fuzhou (originally named Sibu) reclamation movement in Sarawak in the 19th century was opened up by the people of Fuzhou. The iron bridge connecting Singapore to Johor was also built by the hard work of the Minnanese. The Minnanese have made immortal achievements in the prosperity of Southeast Asia.

The long voyage across the ocean requires brave and strong people to endure. Therefore, most of those who go to Southeast Asia are adults, usually between the ages of sixteen and thirty-five. Among the Minnanese, Haicheng, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Tongan, Nan'an, Hui'an, Xiamen, Shuangqing, and Gutian counties are the most numerous. Shishi in Jinjiang, Shishan in Nan'an, and Qiuyang in Haicheng are the largest overseas Chinese villages.

Minnanese Occupations are Mainly in Industry, Commerce, and Finance

The "social ladder" of the Minnanese in Southeast Asia is generally from workers, peddlers, shop assistants, and small shop owners to big businessmen. They use labor as capital, work diligently, and behave correctly, surpassing others in what they can do. They gradually infiltrate into the activities of various industries in Southeast Asia, and after a long period of hardship, they lay the foundation for their economic foundation. The businesses operated by more than 3 million Minnanese in various parts of Southeast Asia are mainly in industry, commerce, and finance, but they also vary depending on the location. Generally speaking, British Malaya focuses on the management of rubber, tin, coconut, pineapple, finance, and local product trade. Among them, the refined crepe rubber of Singapore enjoys a high reputation in Southeast Asia, and almost all of the operators of this industry are from Yongchun, Fujian Province. In addition, coconut oil and tin are almost all operated by the Minnanese, monopolizing the Southeast Asian market. The Minnanese in the Dutch East Indies mainly operate in petroleum, rubber, tea, sugar, coffee, tin, and coconut oil. Java is mainly engaged in manufacturing refined sugar, while Sumatra emphasizes both fishing and agriculture. The late sugar king Huang Zhonghan of Dutch Indonesia was a Minnanese. The Minnanese in French Indochina are mainly engaged in rice milling, medicinal materials, cotton industry, and rubber plantations. Although there are not many Minnanese in Indochina, they occupy a very important position in commerce. Vietnam is still mainly based on rice, tin, and rubber. Most of the Minnanese in the Philippines are retail merchants, mainly dealing in rice, timber, and cosmetics. One foreigner estimates that three-quarters of the commercial credit in the entire Philippines is controlled by the Minnanese. In 1933, their total investment in the Philippines reached 100 million British yuan. The enterprises operated by the Minnanese in Southeast Asia include rubber factories such as Chen Jiageng's, Yong An Tang of Hu Wenhu, alcohol factories of Huang Yizhu, and countless other business organizations. The Minnanese really occupy the "economic throne" of Southeast Asia.

Huge Remittances Strengthen Foreign Exchange Reserves

Usually, international investment must first have a "capital expenditure" before there can be "business profit income." However, the capital of the enterprises established by overseas Chinese overseas is the accumulation of labor, and there is no actual expenditure for the motherland. Instead, it pays huge amounts of international income. The role of remittances in the national economy is even greater than the significance of encouraging exports because the former is only the payment of labor. Before the war, the amount of remittances every year was quite large, and its contribution to making up for the motherland's import surplus was indispensable. According to relatively reliable statistics in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), including any form of remittance and the property (including donations) brought back to the country by overseas Chinese themselves, the annual amount reached 200 million yuan (the remittances of official or group banks only accounted for about one-tenth of the above). From this figure, we can see the economic status of the Minnanese overseas.

When the Pacific War broke out, remittances were cut off, and the economic strength of the Minnanese in the south was greatly restricted.

In the early days of victory, because the Minnanese were just beginning to recover and were restricted by the strict restrictions of the governments of their places of residence on remittances, remittances were still not smooth. Until April of last year, the Minnanese gradually established contact with their relatives in their hometown, and remittances were restored. According to the statistics of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and the Fujian Provincial Postal Administration, from April to the end of last year, the total amount of remittances received in Fujian Province was more than 8 billion yuan. In addition to the 3.5 billion yuan remitted through the Postal Administration, the amount remitted by the Xiamen Zhongxing Bank was the largest. According to the China Bank report in January and February of this year, the remittances received were approximately 1.2 billion yuan. According to people in the overseas Chinese community, remittances through national banks only account for one or two-tenths of the actual remittances. Most of the remittances are remitted through private remittance agencies because the remittance fees of these agencies are much lower than those of national banks. If we add the various valuable securities and property brought back to the country by a large number of overseas Chinese themselves, we can see that the number of remittances since the victory is still quite considerable. There is also a superstition popular among the overseas Chinese in southern Fujian that every time they send a family letter, they have to attach some money, otherwise, it is considered unlucky. Such sporadic remittances are especially impossible to estimate.

Using Overseas Chinese Capital to Create New Environments and Increase Profits

The lessons learned by overseas Chinese in this war were profound. In addition, the discrimination of indigenous ethnic groups against Chinese has changed the overseas Chinese's concept of "Golden Southeast Asia." Since the victory, according to the statistics of the overseas Chinese affairs agencies here, the number of Minnanese returning to the country is more than 50,000, and the total number of those going abroad is less than 15,000. From this, it can be seen that the Minnanese have gradually increased their centripetal force towards the motherland. This is a good opportunity to absorb overseas Chinese capital. The inflow of overseas Chinese capital into Fujian has a decisive effect on improving the current situation of Fujian's huge import surplus and the prosperity of the local social economy. However, the inflow of overseas Chinese capital must create an environment for the possibility of using overseas Chinese capital; otherwise, even if overseas Chinese capital flows in, it may not help local construction. For example, the relatively wealthy overseas Chinese villages in southern Fujian have a large amount of funds that have nowhere to go. Recently, it has been popular to welcome gods and raise money to build ancestral halls, spending millions of yuan, competing for novelty and wealth, without the slightest stinginess, or using funds to move to high-interest loans, aggravating the rural crisis. There is very little interest in business investment. This time, the Minnanese, led by Hu Wenhu, formed the Fujian Economic Construction Company. Looking at the situation, they are still unable to invite an enthusiastic response from overseas Chinese in various places. Therefore, the progress of raising funds is slow. According to the results of the reporter's contact with the overseas Chinese leaders here, it seems that overseas Chinese feel that the government cannot provide favorable conditions for returning to the country to invest and have concerns, such as uncertain economic goals, the lack of transportation conditions, and the lack of appropriate guarantees and convenience.

The overseas Chinese, as the mother of the Chinese revolution, have an excellent revolutionary tradition. For example, most of the Fujian patriots among the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang lived in Southeast Asia. They love their motherland more than the people in the country, and their financial resources are indeed stronger than those of the people in the country. During the Anti-Japanese War, overseas Chinese actively contributed in manpower and financial resources, giving great help to the Anti-Japanese War. In the future, the cause of national construction will also need this strong economic force.

### Ten Days in Southern Yunnan: Prospects for Gejiu Tin Industry

— Kunming, 2nd Air Dispatch—Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Xu Jilian

The main tin producing area in our country is Gejiu in southern Yunnan. Others include Fuchuan and He County in Guangxi, Hechi, Nandan, Debai, Jianghua in Hunan, Linwu, Yidan, Liuxian, Changning, Guiyang, Dabian, Nankang, Ganxian in Jiangxi, Dianbai, Jieyang in Guangdong, Hainan Island, and areas near Kukeqe in Xinjiang. Although each has its own output, none of them are as far as Gejiu.

Source is Granite, Located on Top of Plateau

Gejiu, known as the Tin Capital of China, was developed very late. The history before the Yuan Dynasty is no longer traceable. It is located in the southern part of Yunnan Province, west of the Zhenyue Railway, 1,800 meters above sea level. Except for tin, all other necessities of life and materials used in the factory area are supplied from other places. Therefore, there is a saying that "burning firewood without seeing trees, eating rice without seeing bran." Precisely because of this, Gejiu has become a place where people from all directions gather, and everyone only cares about profit. The so-called "emphasizing money and despising virtue, not hearing of courtesy, frugality, gentleness, and goodness" can be used as the best portrayal.

The origin of Gejiu tin can be divided into three main branches: The first branch originates from Panshan, which belongs to Jianshui, winds south to Laoyang Mountain in Gejiu, extending for hundreds of miles until it reaches the Honghe River bank. The second branch connects from Zhadian eastward to Laoyin Mountain in Gejiu. The third flower originates from the Qilin Mountain area in Tibet, connecting Wafangchong, Poshanchun, Songshujiao, and Gushan factory areas, covering an area of more than a hundred square miles.

Regarding the distribution of tin veins, some experts have also conducted investigations, stating that the source of Gejiu tin is granite, mostly located on the top of the plateau. The area near the mining area is mostly distributed with limestone, and the main mining areas are mostly in the eastern part of the plateau, with the Laochang, Malage, and Wafangchong areas being the richest. Laochang has the largest area and can be divided into six small areas: Huangmaoshan, Haozimiao, Shuzijie, Huazhakou, Yindong, and Laoyinchang.

Mining of Yunnan Tin Ore Began in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties

The history of tin mining in Yunnan has never been recorded in detail. However, the discovery of Yunnan tin probably dates back to the Han Dynasty. There may have been mining in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. By the middle of the Qing Dynasty, the price of tin rose, and after the opening of the Dianyue Railway in the 23rd year of Guangxu (1897), the factory situation gradually became prosperous. Since the Republic of China, those who run factories have sprung up like mushrooms. The factory affairs are becoming more and more developed.

Unfortunately, good times do not last long. The prosperity of Gejiu did not last long. First, the persecution of war caused a great discount in work and production, and the blockage of transportation caused problems in transportation and export. For example, foreign equipment and machinery could not enter this area. People are shouting about using new methods every day, but scientific production methods cannot be separated from the use of machines. Heavy things cannot be moved in. Furthermore, the application for foreign exchange takes a long time, so it is often impossible to buy the necessary equipment for production. How can one seek improvement in production methods in this way? It is simply a matter of great difficulty!

Three-Year Revival Plan, Too Many Obstacles in the Environment

The Yunnan Tin Industry Company also formulated a three-year revival plan. The design was very thoughtful, but how many difficulties were there in implementation? The company is willing to use machines as much as possible and is willing to cooperate with manufacturers to promote the revival of the entire tin industry. However, in fact, there are many unexpected obstacles that greatly discount their confidence. Moreover, due to the suspicion and jealousy of the manufacturers, the plan cannot be implemented smoothly. In the three-year plan, the Tin Industry Company plans to add an aerial cableway of ten kilometers from Gejiu to Laochang to achieve time-saving and labor-saving results. It can transport 500 to 1,000 tons of ore per day. Secondly, the Xiaolongtan Power Plant must be established as soon as possible, and then the problem of refining will be solved. Finally, there is the plan to strengthen the smelting of ore in tin factories, aiming to reach 300 to 500 tons per day.

If the plan cannot be implemented, it will often become an empty slogan. The Gejiu tin industry revival plan unfortunately encountered this situation. Until now, it has not been able to realize even a small part of the plan. The person in charge sighed and said, "The environment is like this, and there are many difficulties. What good way can be used to break the current deadlock?" Indeed, the power of the individual is so small!

We have also said that Gejiu, apart from tin, is a place where nothing else can be produced. Precisely because of this, if the tin industry in Gejiu cannot be revived, it will not only affect the livelihoods of the people in southern Yunnan but also be a huge loss to the entire Yunnan. Expanding the scope further, it may not be without impact on China's export trade. Therefore, many people are concerned about the future of the Gejiu tin industry.

A Seminar to Discuss the Future of Gejiu Tin

The Tin Industry Company attached great importance to our journalist visiting group. They specially invited local related personnel to hold a very meaningful seminar. Everyone provided many opinions, and everyone had fervent hopes for the future of Gejiu tin. Huang Yuanzhi, the Speaker of the County Council, is a shrewd and capable elderly man. He raised his voice and pointed out the current crisis of the Gejiu tin industry. Of course, the mining of metal mines cannot be done without a large amount of capital, and the fundamental problem of the current Gejiu tin mining is the lack of capital. Therefore, they appealed to the Four Joint Offices to organize tin loans as soon as possible. After thousands of calls, only 1.5 billion yuan was approved, which is a limited number in the eyes of Gejiu tin merchants. Moreover, it is issued in installments, which seems to be a drop in the bucket, and the distant water cannot save the near fire. Speaker Huang shouted loudly, what is needed is the most abundant goods? Executive Manager Lu said more specifically: If the government can provide low-interest loans and continue to lend for three years, there will be no problem in producing 10,000 tons of tin per year. Now, they are requesting that the loan amount be increased to 15 billion yuan. Whether this loan can be successful is a major key to whether China's tin industry can be revived and whether it can gain a place in the world market in the future.

### Poetry

— Shen Xianyuan] A poet who can create poems that span the universe is not a conjurer who turns a startled horse into a dragon steed, but one who controls the dragon steed with his own wisdom, making its hooves, which rise to chase the wind, gallop like cloud-piercing feathered arrows. It is most tragic for a person to merely envy or be jealous of others' good fortune in obtaining such a fine steed, while forgetting to hone his own horsemanship.  Inscribed on Zhang Daqian's Painting for Zhu Danlin's Fiftieth Birthday  Shen Yinmo  Green branches and red leaves in the clear autumn sky, I walk with a new plan, leaning on my staff; Could it be that I know my errors like Qu Boyu, or perhaps I meet Yuanming under the pines.  Impromptu Verse for Zhang Daqian's Portrait of Danlin by Yaguang  Shen Yinmo  The scenery south of the mountains is ever new, See him reciting poetry at ease; Entrust the inspired brush to bearded Zhang, A branch of red tree reveals a rich spirit.  Flying Waterfall at Stone Trough  Yu Jianhua  Mount Tiantai spans hundreds of miles, with countless peaks, but the most important is the Stone Beam Flying Waterfall. Above the precipice, a waterfall plunges down, asking where it comes from; above the waterfall, a stone beam spans horizontally, about fifteen feet long, just wide enough for a foot. Travelers are often frightened and daunted, looking on with awe.  Drinking by A. Cowley Translated by Zhen Qin  The parched earth swallows the rainwater, and still opens its mouth for more; The trees drink water from the soil, drink without end, and so remain ever fresh; The ocean (one might think: the ocean has little need to drink) sucks up ten thousand rivers, full to overflowing. The hurried sun (as can be seen from its drunken, fiery face) drinks the seawater deeply; when it is drunk dry, the moon and stars come to drink the sun: they dance and drink in their own light. They drink and make merry all night long. In nature, nothing is purely sour, yet everywhere is eternal health. Well then, pour a cup full and high! Fill all the cups—please tell me, if everyone else can drink, why can't I! Tell me why? You moralists! [A. Cowley (1618-1667), an English poet and Doctor of Medicine. Dr. Johnson's "Lives of the Poets" begins with Cowley. Though little known to later generations, Macy's "The Story of World Literature" (translated by Hu Zhongchi, Kaiming Press) holds him in high esteem. This poem "Drinking" is one of the author's masterpieces, its bold style comparable to Liu Ling's "Ode to the Virtue of Wine" in our country. --Translator]  Night of June by Victor Hugo Translated by Zuo Hong In summer, when the day has just passed, the flower-covered plain spreads a intoxicating fragrance afar; He closes his eyes, half-closing his ears to the clamorous sounds, he is only in a hazy sleep. The stars are extraordinarily bright and clean, the shadows more beautiful; A vague dawn dyes the semi-circular sky; And that warm and ashen-grey dawn, waiting for its time, The whole night seems to linger in the lower reaches of the sky. (Written in 1839)  An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 531 Ye Jingfeng "That way of putting it is also possible..." I searched through my barren mind, trying to find a simple way to explain to him "...Do you understand the words 'premonition'?" I asked Tsurumi. "I understand the general meaning, but not the specialized definition." "Everyone has premonitions. The formation of this premonition is originally the result of what science calls the 'law of cause and effect.' For example, if you aim a stone at someone's glass window, you can certainly guess the result that will occur. But for us humans, human affairs are extremely complex, and every action inevitably sows a 'cause,' but there are too many of these causes thrown out, and the time distance from cause to effect is sometimes too long, a week, a month, or even ten years, and you have long forgotten the shadow of this 'cause'; of course, you don't know that this 'effect' will eventually come about. Although you have forgotten the shadow, there is an internal function that always remembers it for you, and that is your 'subconscious.' This subconscious sometimes reminds you in your sleep, sometimes in broad daylight, or when you are sober, it warns you 'The cause you planted at such and such a time and place is now about to bear fruit!' This is 'premonition'..." "But this premonition, this kind of warning, ordinary people, especially those who are poor and indulgent, will absolutely not be aware of it. Only those who are pure of heart and have few desires can sense a little. But experts who have cultivated mental unity can have premonitions. So I say that Pingzi's words are also possible..." "As for what novels call 'a sudden impulse,' 'heart pounding' and other expressions indicating that misfortune is about to befall, it's just that some of them are exaggerated and too mythologized. However, it cannot be said that it is completely untrue. Fortunately, in the newspapers and magazines published today, there are often reports of this kind of fact, as long as you pay attention a little, you can collect a lot of evidence with basis..." "Okay, old brother, let me come and visit you as a teacher when I have time in the future, and study with you... Now there is another question, stuck in my heart, what do you think—what do you say is the effect of this trick I played in Shanghai this time?" "This is like when Jiang Gan crossed the river that day, and Cao Cao fell for the trick, which can only deceive for a short time... I think as early as a week, and as late as a month, these Japanese troops will be restless again. You think, their situation at this time is like horses being fed and weapons being sharpened, like an arrow on the string, how can they delay for long?" "There is one more thing, until now, so many heroes and talents in Shanghai, including the Elder Jue of the Bai Ren Manor and the think tank, no one has interpreted the meaning of that strange character '0915,' you...?" "This has nothing to do with wisdom or learning. The day before yesterday, I received a report from Zheng Yan about your affairs in Shanghai, and I told Mr. W about this mystery of '0915' at the time, but I didn't get an explanation. Last night, their captain Dai came back, and everyone mentioned this matter again, and Mr. Dai was also confused, but his Western secretary, Mr. Ma, suddenly thought that he had read a paper in a Western magazine, and only then did he know that '0915' meant 9:15 AM. In the time terminology of the European and American armies, the twenty-four hours of a day and night are recorded without distinguishing between AM and PM: 9 AM is '09,' and 9 PM is '18'." "Ah, I understand, so that strange note originally called us to go to the Hua Mao Hotel at a quarter past nine... Wasn't Pingzi coincidentally rushing there at ten past nine, and accidentally fell into Matsu's trap..." Tsurumi had just said this when the big guy "04" rushed in in a panic, saying that Mr. W upstairs had received two top-secret telegrams from Panyang and Yaoqun, asking us to go upstairs to talk... (End of this chapter)  The Fake Braid (Part Two) Feng Zikai I cut my braid when I was fifteen years old, and I have seen fake braids. In front of people under the age of forty (those over forty must have forgotten), I can boast a little. This is a braid made of false hair, attached to the back of the hat. When the hat is worn, it is impossible to tell the truth from the false. But never take off your hat. There are two kinds of people who wear fake braids: one is people who have returned from foreign countries, and the other is people who have had their braids cut off for adultery. Fake foreign devils belong to the first kind. When I was a child, there were both kinds of people in my hometown. Belonging to the first kind was Mr. Yu in the elementary school. He was hired from another village to teach English and singing. He had studied in Japan and cut off his braid. After returning to China, people would point and laugh at him on the street, and people would often shout "Wife of a foreigner!" behind his back. Therefore, he wore a fake braid to avoid trouble. At that time, "Xiangyang" soap had just appeared in my hometown, and people would put it in a bag and hang it on their lapels as a perfume sachet. But Mr. Yu actually used Xiangyang soap to wash his feet. This matter was widely spread throughout the town, and everyone thought that this person was "not good for anything." Most likely, his braid had been cut off for stealing a wife, and it was not necessarily cut off because of studying abroad. Sure enough, he was soon unwelcome in Shimenwan, packed his bags, and dragged his fake braid to another village. Belonging to the second kind was Rotten Dirty Er. He was a hooligan in my hometown, and his name came from the saying "remove the rotten dirty." One can imagine what kind of person he was. Rotten Dirty Er was a philanderer with a married woman. The woman was beaten badly by her husband and tried to commit suicide. The husband and the people in the area caught Rotten Dirty Er, stripped both him and the dead body naked, tied them together with ropes, and locked them in an empty room. This was during the hot summer weather. When they were released after three days, Rotten Dirty Er had not died, but his whole body was covered with rotten flesh and maggots, and he was also missing a braid. Rotten Dirty Er wore a fake braid because he was afraid of hindering his wrongdoing. He wore a hat even in summer. There was another person named Zhong Qinghe, who was also a hooligan, so he was on good terms with Rotten Dirty Er. The two often teased each other. When Rotten Dirty Er saw Zhong Qinghe, he would greet him loudly in public: "Qinghe, have you eaten yet?" But when he said this, he would pinch his nose and pronounce the two words "Qinghe" as "eat dirt," so the whole sentence would become: "Eat dirt (in my hometown, calling poop dirt) have you eaten yet!" Everyone would laugh. Qinghe would endure this ridicule without saying a word, then rush over and lift his hat, taking the fake braid off with it. Everyone would laugh again. Qinghe wanted to throw the hat and braid onto the roof, and Rotten Dirty Er would kneel down and beg for forgiveness. Only then would the play end. This is very similar to the material in Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q." Now, because of answering the question about fake braids, I have been able to relive my childhood dreams. Written on June 5, 1947 in Hangzhou. Free Talk Hangzhou Should Learn from Switzerland Dongliu Hangzhou has long been known as "China's Little Switzerland." This is not without reason. In terms of the way it attracts tourists and the prosperity of the market due to the large consumption of tourists, the two are quite similar. In March and April, the spring sunshine is beautiful, and the West Lake is at its peak. The number of tourists is indeed unmatched by other scenic spots. This spring, I myself was quite distressed by entertaining guests, spending time and money was a minor matter, but accompanying guests to repeatedly tour "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" and the like was not interesting after all. Any famous scenic spot, if it once has the obligation to be "must-see", the feeling of disgust reflected in the hearts of these tourists can be imagined. Hangzhou attracts so many tourists, spends a lot of their money, and even wins the reputation of "being good at creating cucumber tricks". In theory, Hangzhou's public welfare undertakings should be comparable to the village of Altdorf at the foot of Mount Klausen in the Swiss scenic area, but it is not. In Hangzhou, the only ones who benefit from tourists are temples, nunneries, hotels, restaurants, tea houses, small shops selling local products, beggars..., the general public can only cry out in pain due to the price wave caused by tourists. In addition, the city government's tax revenue has increased a little, which is also a good phenomenon. But then let's see what the situation is like in the Swiss village of Altdorf? The following is Mr. Xiao Qian's report: More than 300 years ago, a major black plague broke out in southern Germany. People died everywhere in Altdorf. So the villagers made a wish to heaven, saying that every ten years the whole village must perform a season of cautionary religious plays. At first, this move was purely religious, like Mount Miaofeng and Mount Putuo, but because world tourists gathered from all over the world every time this drama festival was held, this devout move inevitably became tainted with commercial color. Wood carvings had a world market, and hotels attracted tourists, but the income from the drama festival was always used exclusively for public welfare. This once-a-decade event built hospitals, schools, and swimming pools for Altdorf. At this point in the report, I seem to hear Mr. Xiao Qian sigh, saying: "There is still one that is better than our Hangzhou. This medieval village retains its original simplicity and beauty. There are no villas for important people - at least no houses that look like villas for important people. All the buildings are harmonious and appropriate." There are many people in the world who enjoy the beautiful and happy lives of Bai Letian and Su Dongpo. I grew up in Hangzhou since I was a child, so naturally I would never ignore the scenery in front of me. However, in addition to appreciating and viewing, Hangzhou should also have its own characteristics. Due to the beauty of the West Lake, it attracts many tourists every year and imports a large amount of legal tender, making the Hangzhou market appear very "prosperous" once a year. However, this situation does not last long, and tourist consumption only helps a portion of the "favored ones." Like Switzerland, it is impossible to propose taking some of it to run public utilities. In Hangzhou, just like other parts of China, the villas of the nobles and the beggars sleeping in the open air are in direct proportion. Seeing a corner of red tiles and a white wall peeking out from the excellent scenic spot always makes people feel uncomfortable. Why? It is because of the bloody and non-universal prosperity hidden behind the villa. As a scenic spot, Hangzhou is beautiful and quiet, but we hope that most Hangzhou people should make good use of the income from the incense season and put more effort into public welfare, so that Hangzhou will not only become a beautiful scenic spot, but also the center of academic culture in Southeast China.  Supporting Good People Mengping It is reported that Shanghai celebrities established the Shanghai Social Security Promotion Association in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Its purpose is to "uphold justice, support good people, in order to achieve political integrity, economic prosperity, social security, and national prosperity, so that everyone has work to do, food to eat, freedom, and happiness, and there is no unemployment, no hunger, no plunder, and no terror." The purpose of this association is aimed at reality and can be said to be an unprecedented example for various other associations. High officials and nobles have said these words and shouted these voices, which shows the seriousness of today's social situation. We ordinary people are really leaping with joy and celebrating the future of the country. Good people serve with sincerity and will not deceive or be opportunistic. Good people will abide by the law and will not be greedy or plunder. In today's society, good people dare not speak, are unwilling to speak, and do not want to speak. Speaking directly is afraid of offending people, and speaking directly is useless. Tigers and lions cannot move their hair. As a result, some are silent, some eat their fill all day long, and some struggle with hunger. The country and society are left to evolve on their own. Mr. Pan Gongzhan believes that "the urgent work today is to purify politics and transform society," and I feel the same. But those in power must have the determination, must have the revolutionary spirit, restrain the capital of powerful families, and save the economic crisis. The Shanghai Social Security Promotion Association was born at this time, and we give it unlimited sympathy and expectations.  Looking at Modern Morality from the Case of Filicide Tang Shan Recently, a case of filicide occurred in the capital: a son stabbed his biological father to death with his own hands. The reason was that the father did not allow the son to have promiscuous relationships with girlfriends. If this had happened in the previous dynasty, not only would the murderer have been punished by the law, but even the local officials would not have escaped responsibility. Now, this is just a piece of news in the newspaper. Although it is news, it seems to be valued by people. The news has been expanded and framed, and special dispatches and communications have been reported together. What is the reason for the importance? The focus is still on "filicide." Recently, we have often seen reports in the newspapers of sons beating their fathers, fathers stealing their daughters-in-law, and even mothers and sons committing incest. People with a conscience have to sigh that the world is going downhill from a moral point of view. Really, if such relationships are not distinguished and everything is messed up, what kind of human society will it become? Some people feel that to save China, morality must be saved first. Without the revitalization of morality, no crisis can be overcome. This may be reasonable, but it cannot help the facts. It has not seen through the essence of the problem. In modern times, the relationship between parents and children is mixed and sparse to the point of hatred. Why has the moral code of ethics fallen to this point? This is naturally not a problem of morality itself. Times have changed, and moral concepts have naturally changed with them. Morality is an abstract thing, and the social behavior and economic conditions support this concept. Moral concepts are different under feudal societies and democratic societies; moral standards of the bourgeoisie and the common people are also different. This explains that morality has temporality. Let's talk about this case of filicide. Because Boss Jin was engaged in construction projects, his family was very rich. He only knew about his business relations and took a laissez-faire attitude towards his son. The young Jin boy lived comfortably and did not care about anything. The moral basis between them was established on the relationship of money. This is like the two parties of labor and capital, each standing against each other for the interests of the class. Now the father suddenly feels that this kind of "credit loan" will be shaken, and he wants him to obtain a solid guarantee; but the other party happens to be an empty-headed expert, so the rupture is inevitable. Some people say: The rebellious son is a middle school student. The occurrence of this kind of filicide can also be said to be the bankruptcy of moral education. But you have to know that young Jin boy was not originally studying. He was a student who only cared about paying fees. The current morality of the education sector is only this kind of monetary relationship. You have paid the fee and registered, and you are considered a student of this school. As for you having promiscuous relationships with girlfriends outside and not going to lectures, that does not matter much. Under the system of money-based society, although the name of father and son exists, the face of morality is completely different. The indulgence of children in rich families and the oppression of children in poor families both cause the relationship between parents and children to deviate from the path of "love." The disaster of filicide lies in this. In the process of the new and old morality, we sigh "the demise of morality" and "the hearts of the people are not as good as they used to be," which is all superfluous.  Film Talk "Welcoming Spring Melody" Wubian "Welcoming Spring Melody" is a work with realistic themes. It does not tempt the audience with "pornography" or "espionage." This is a rare work among the many domestic films recently released. The author writes about the life of an old person in a commoner district with simple and unadorned brushstrokes. In this building live painters, musicians, poets, prostitutes, young shop assistants, purple women, old women on their deathbeds, and the loan sharking landlady. They are bullied and humiliated, and there are also people who exploit others. In short, the author uses a sketch-like style to outline a corner of the current society. This group of people who are bullied, humiliated, and living in the cold current is a true reflection of today's sufferers. They struggle in life and yearn for warm and sunny days. However, the author did not tell them when the cold current could pass, or how spring could come. He only let them wait and, at most, welcome it. In fact, this is very passive. Obviously, the author's focus is on the three artists, plus the prostitute, to form this story. But the living circles of these three artists are too narrow. They do not come into contact with more reality, and others do not understand the "words" they are accustomed to using. It can be said that they do not understand them, and even they themselves admit that this is the sorrow of intellectuals. In fact, this is not the sorrow of intellectuals, but the sorrow of these three "artists" who live in small circles. Among these three people, the musician is doing the job of a foreign instrument ghost, the poet is hawking his poetry collection everywhere, and only the painter is fantasizing about creating great works. Without real life, apart from finally seeing him painting a leaf on the wall for the prostitute who is sick, he has done nothing else. This character occupies the most important position in the story. In addition, although the prostitute has lost her husband and children, she has no family burden and relies on herself to solve the life of one person. After she meets the three artists, there is no change in her life, and none of the three people arrange another kind of life for her - not even offering suggestions. Does this show that the prostitute is resigned to her fate, or that she is unconcerned about the humiliation of others? The concern between people cannot be just some empty platitudes, there must be concrete facts. At least now it seems that this prostitute is consciously moving towards depravity. Although this script has these shortcomings, it is still a better work at present. For example, the cart of the street vendor Ah Fa is confiscated, and he even sells his own blood to exchange for the cost of living. The old woman on her deathbed dreams of her son who has been on the expedition for eight years returning. These are all profound and moving. Among the actors, Hu Feng's prostitute and Fan Lai's Ah Fa are the best, natural and vivid. Jin Yan's acting skills are extremely stable, but he lacks a little inner psychological creation. Pei Chong's role is more pleasing, and his efforts can also be seen. In terms of directing achievements, this play is better than any of Wu Yonggang's past plays.  Thoughts on the Tram Fare Increase Xu Qin The tram and bus fares have been increased on the ninth of this month. This matter, for a part of people who are forced by livelihood, at least it cannot be denied that it is a kind of threat. In principle, since the cost of living index has been unfrozen, it is inevitable that the tram and bus fares will increase; moreover, some people think that the small amount of the increase is not a problem. However, although this is the reason, they have forgotten those who are in another kind of environment. The prices of things increase, and the salaries are added, probably in many institutions, it is probably like this. However, if you think about it carefully, you will know that there are many places where this is not the case. For example, in some small-scale shops, the salaries of their employees will not be increased according to the "cost of living index" at all. Again, it is a part of private elementary school teachers, their salaries, compared to the former, are exactly the same. Therefore, the increase in tram and bus fares, although small in number, is actually a great stimulus for them. As a person in a clean and noble position, before the cost of living index was unfrozen, the salary was pitifully small (because I am forced to travel far, I take the tram every day; after deducting the fare, there is very little left). However, at present, this number remains unchanged. Now that the tram and bus fares have increased, it seems that even the tram and bus will not be able to afford it! Hey, I don't know if this is sad or regrettable.  Record of a City in Crisis Qin Shouou It was almost three or four o'clock in the afternoon again. After being extremely exhausted, Zhu Zhaonian took a short nap, but thinking about the car, thinking about Feifei, thinking about Lan, he quickly woke himself up again; he opened his tired eyes and immediately busied himself with looking at Feifei, who was lying in his arms. He found that the child seemed to be breathing heavily, her face was also much paler, and her eyes looked lifeless like a fish out of water. "Feifei, do you want to drink water? Are you tired?" he asked in a low voice. "Headache, Uncle Zhu, Feifei has a headache." She pouted, tears welling up in her eyes. Although the old Zhu, who had no experience in taking care of children, had long expected that such a trip would not be tolerated by an eight-year-old child, her physical strength could not resist such fatigue and what should he do about the train? He looked worriedly at Feifei's face again. Feifei's eyes were already closed, as if she wanted to sleep, but she was a little irritable and could not fall asleep for a while. "Feifei, do you feel better now?" "Want to drink water, Uncle Zhu, is there any water?" she asked anxiously, her two lips were very dry, and she kept licking them with her tongue. Zhu Zhaonian opened his eyes wide like a hungry wolf, and looked sharply at the crowd around him, while loudly asking everyone. "Which one of you will do a good deed? My child is sick! She is in urgent need of water, who is willing to share a cup, I will give you as much money as you want! Thank you! She is only eight years old...!" After shouting for a while, a middle-aged woman finally agreed, but she really didn't have any water - there was simply no one on the car who had a drop of water - she only took out half a strange, sour and astringent native pear from a handkerchief bag, and solemnly handed it to the people next to her, letting them pass it to the old Zhu; but when he saw the black and greasy pear flesh that had already been peeled, he was really scared in his heart and dared not feed it to Feifei.

### Old Canals, New Projects

— Special Dispatch from Xi'an, Second Day of the Month. Our Reporter, Zhang Xianzhou

The area along the Feng River in the southwestern suburbs of Xi'an was very prosperous in ancient times. People who have lived in Chang'an for a long time almost all know about the "Eight Rivers Encircling the City" and King Wen of the Zhou Dynasty's Lingtai (Spirit Terrace). It is said that during the Zhou and Qin dynasties, these rivers were used for canal transportation in the suburbs, and countless historical events must have unfolded along their banks. Later, those projects gradually faded away, and the old dream of the people became the sorrow of drought. The glorious achievements of our ancestors became mere beautiful memories. However, things have now changed, and new projects have been built on the old canals.

One of the Eight Benefits of Guanzhong

The Fenghui Canal starts from Qindu Town and flows northeast. After six years of construction, it cost a huge sum of 416,803,689.84 yuan, transforming 230,000 mu of farmland in the northwestern suburbs of the city into paddy fields. It has a stone-built flow dam, 133.27 meters long and 2.1 meters high, and two large and small sluice gates, totaling seven dou. Compared with canals like the Weihui Canal, this project may not seem grand, but it was started during the Anti-Japanese War. September of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) was a time of national hardship, economic distress, and tense confrontation between the enemy and us across the river. To undertake such a huge project under these circumstances is admirable and worthy of praise. At that time, prices were rising sharply, just like today. The funds for the Fenghui Canal were entirely loans from the Agricultural Bank, but the procedures were complicated, and the budget was often exceeded. In the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), the loans were once suspended, but after repeated telegrams to the central government, it was finally completed. This allowed the residents of this ancient Qin and Han land to celebrate another harvest, and the water to be seen again at the edge of Taiyi Pool in Kunming. The Fenghui Canal was originally one of the "Eight Benefits of Guanzhong" planned by Mr. Li Yishe. It was originally expected to be completed in two years, but due to the Anti-Japanese War, it was delayed for nearly six years. The construction of the Fenghui Canal is similar to the suffering during the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, and its construction is one of the monuments to China's rebirth.

Waterwheels Will Become Obsolete

The reporter visited the Fenghui Canal's water release ceremony last month. After the ribbon-cutting, the sluice gates were raised, and the rapids rushed out from under the gates, splashing water. Military music slowly began to play, firecrackers exploded, the farmers smiled, and enthusiastic applause burst out. Countless paper flowers and handfuls of roses were thrown from the stage into the water, with red flowers and clear water, it was extremely beautiful. The "grand opera" that the villagers automatically hired also started. An old man told the reporter: "If this year's harvest is good, it will be even more lively, who knew that the crops would be damaged this year!" Then he told the reporter that the crops were bad and the "government loans" were too heavy, how could they live... and so on. They are waiting for relief. The reporter asked him about his views on the canal, he said: "I am from Daliu Village, west of the river, and cannot benefit from it. Today, this is just 'empty' excitement!" This year's rural famine is indeed worthy of attention.

Walking on the ancient trails, I had admired many waterwheels. A friend said: "These will all become obsolete in three or four years!" The people in the car silently agreed; the reporter silently imagined, what will prosperity be like here in three or four years.

### Reading Tan Yankai's Collected Poems

— Xiao Zao

I love Mr. Tan Yankai's poems because they have a Tang-like style, which is completely different from the sharp, new, and rigid atmosphere of the Song poetry school.

He has a poem about a seesaw:

"Submitting to others is not meaningless, gaining clear springs fills the Hanyin;

The old gardener does not know the irrigation power, suspecting scheming when there is only the machine."

This indeed has a graceful demeanor. Irrigation power is the main body of all forces. Although the seesaw has "scheming machinery," it absolutely has no "scheming mind." The reason why today's national affairs cannot satisfy people is primarily due to the sabotage of people with scheming minds. The reason why the seesaw can "gain clear springs to fill Hanyin" is that although it has machinery, it has no scheming mind. Mr. Tan only pays attention to irrigation power, and when the water comes, the canal is naturally formed, which is natural and not harmful. I admire his gracefulness, but this cannot be understood by those old countrymen.

The sentence structure of this poem is also based on something. Ye Shaoyun's "Shilin Poetry Talk" says: "On the wall of the South Hall of the old Secretariat, there was a poem by Yan Yuanxian about a prostitute on a pole: 'Balancing on a hundred-foot pole with a graceful body, feet kicking and hanging, startling onlookers. Does the old man of Hanyin know? Embracing wheat with difficulty, but not poor'. At that time, it was inevitable that someone would say that Duke Wen of Lu was in the Secretariat, once meeting with Jinggong at the Secretariat, walking to the inscription and lingering for a long time, he could not have been unintentional. Jinggong wrote another poem after the poem one day: 'Ci can speak but does not know the truth, mistakenly promises his heart to the Hanyin man. It does not matter how much the seesaw bends and stretches, embracing a few areas of wheat, growing old in this body'."

These two poems and Tan Gong's poem use the same allusion, and the sentence structures are somewhat similar, but the themes and artistic conceptions are different. Yuanxian, Jinggong, and Tan Gong's identities are similar, but their atmospheres are different. I prefer Tan Gong's "Seesaw," and feel it "surpasses its predecessor."

Among the poems in the collection, the one most related to historical events is:

"A Farewell Gift to a Russian Returning Home

Farewells are always more numerous than meetings, a fleeting encounter in a foreign land.

Only the bright moon hanging overhead, sends you all the way to Moscow."

This refers to people like Borodin at that time. This heart is "as bright as the moon," and Tan Gong could not help but "worry comes from within."

Also, the poem "Pushing the Vanguard" says:

"Alas, what is the benefit of pushing forward, careful planning and defense, wisdom is already exhausted.

The ghost carriage truly rises and falls again, the dust of slander rises even more groundlessly.

The dark crow does not know who stops its flight, the trapped beast knows that fighting is difficult.

Do not say that floating clouds can temporarily obscure, who would lightly trifle with the bright moon."

This poem is even more obviously a sigh about the situation at that time. Anyone who understands the political situation at that time will not find it difficult to understand. I know that these poems will definitely be extremely valuable historical materials in the future.

After the success of the Northern Expedition, Tan Gong's works revealed a sense of joy, such as "Impromptu on the Dragon Boat Festival":

"Spending the Dragon Boat Festival beyond the Five Ridges, who would have expected to raise a glass to the river and sky:

Because of others' efforts, we have today, slowly in the middle

Feeling Zhou's journey.

One person serves many tasks, forgetting family meals, ten thousand bones succeed, mourning the country with wine:

It is good that the festival is not extravagant, few autumn events, good news is reported to Liaoyang."

If Tan Gong were still alive, seeing today's war in the Northeast, I wonder if he could still retain this joy?

Also, such as "New Year's Day of the Year of Ji Si":

"Old age sees the spring of peace again, the family and the country are harmonious again at this time:

The country has long known that we share happy years, there are no more unreturned people at the ends of the earth.

Enjoying the joy of grandchildren on the knees, abstaining from alcohol does not hurt the gradual entry into the level:

How many childhood pears and dates, it does not hurt to sit together and talk about the new year."

From this, we can see the joy of his family in his later years. But this refers to the younger generation, his wife died first. Every year on the third day of the third month and the fifteenth day of the seventh month, there must be works mourning her, the words are sincere and true, which ordinary poets cannot match. Record a few of them to see a glimpse.

"The moon is full and the autumn is clear as in past years, again seeing children worship before the wine;

Does your soul return to the underworld, the old mood turns more transparent.

I already sigh that the gaps of time mean few days, the wind and flowers are still as beautiful as in the past;

The wheel of ten thousand kalpas will eventually meet, why should a tiny dust cling to one day."

"The room is still as old as it was then, the past is gone and the person is gone, how sad;

Silently grieving for the passing years, diligently remembering the lingering shadows.

Bright lights and laughter, emotions like yesterday, cold rain and desolation, dreams do not come;

Now I am going to appeal to the Xiang River, knowing that my singing pillow is limited by the city."

"The moon on the high building is looking at each other, the old mood is sadly lonely:

Protracted illness does not avoid the nearness of the underworld, only in early autumn do I feel the coolness of ten thousand clothes.

I also know that the fasting and memorial services are just unnecessary, understanding that people and heaven share one light:

Delusional thoughts have been completely removed, why must this body determine existence or death."

This is not inferior to Yuan Wei's (Wei Zhi) most famous elegies, Yuan Wei has such vulgar words as "Today's salary exceeds one hundred thousand, I will use it to build a memorial for you," which is not as transcendent as "I also know that the fasting and memorial services are just unnecessary, understanding that people and heaven share one light." Tan Gong did not care much for his family after running around for the revolution. He lived alone after mourning his wife until his death, so he had the sentence "delusional thoughts removed," which is very different from those colleagues who took many concubines in their later years.

His poems are elegant and true, arising from the deepest emotions, truly as Mr. Ding Shuya said in recent times: "Because there is true emotion, I sigh with emotion, deleting flowery language, transforming into elegance," reading it can be seen that people are loyal to their spouse.

Gong is a true Confucian, taking "loving one's relatives and being benevolent to the people" as the supreme creed. Let us read his "Impromptu with Zhong":

"How many people's tears are about to overflow, passers-by still say welcome:

Heartbreaking to cover my ears on the road to Nan'an, fearing to hear the sound of firecrackers from poor burdens."

The feeling of "fearing the sound of firecrackers from the poor" is painful. It is a pity that the local officials who only knew how to flatter him could not understand.

Due to space limitations, this article can only briefly quote his recent works, long poems, and ancient styles, and cannot comment on them one by one.

### Colloquial Sayings of the Time

— Bai Yuan

During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty, there was a strong trend of collecting colloquial proverbs into couplets. Zhou Zongtai's "More Outrageous Than This" volume three, has "Collection of Proverbs" one hundred and eighty-four couplets, Zhang Nanzhuang's "What a Story," and the wandering Taoist's "Common Sayings" two books, also collected many. The one that was compiled into a special book was Wang Youguang's (Guanguo) "Wu Xia Proverb Couplets" four volumes (Jiaqing Gengchen printed edition), recording one hundred and forty-nine couplets. Even in the collections of scholars' literary works, there are such proverb couplets, such as Zhang Wenhu's "Miscellaneous Writings from the Shuyi Studio" (collected in "Complete Works from the Shuyi Studio")'s "Collection of Proverb Couplets," which is one example.

There was also the practice of collecting colloquial proverbs into poems, which was an extension and expansion of collecting couplets, such as "More Outrageous Than This" volume three "Colloquial Proverbs," collecting twenty-two poems. The preface to the first one says:

"Colloquialisms are everywhere, but they are especially prevalent in our Wu region. Painting is always boring, and I occasionally play with children, collecting ancient ballads and colloquial proverbs, linking them together to form poems. Although the writing is not elegant or docile, knowledgeable people laugh; however, what the old people say, there is quite some meaning in it, worth pondering. Therefore, I record and preserve them, to provide material for poetry society talks and laughs, regardless of skill or clumsiness. The so-called 'quite some meaning, worth pondering,' is also just a formality; it is actually just one end of a word game. What is noteworthy is not its literary value, but its documentary value, which is enough to explain the ebb and flow of this trend. Of the twenty-two poems, only a few are worth seeing, such as the one about illness:

'One knows one's own illness, heart disease should be treated with heart medicine. Let go when you can let go, losing a bargain is a bargain'."

And the poem about money says:

"East hand receives, west hand goes, easy to part, difficult to meet; a penny can kill a hero, how many bystanders watch with cold eyes."

These two collect colloquial proverbs quite naturally, with a lot of humor. Collecting colloquial sayings is a major feature of Paiban literature.

The trend of collecting colloquial proverbs into poems was still very strong during the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods, and there were even special books compiled, such as Shao Yichen's "Collection of Hangzhou Proverb Poems." The poems consist of one hundred and thirty-seven songs, published in the Guangxu period, printed on white cotton paper, and the book quality is quite exquisite. At the end of the book is Shao Xi'en's inscription:

"This is a playful work by my late uncle, Wei Xi Gong. The Duke ascended to the virtuous books at a young age, from the Wei Province to the Eight Direct Secretariats. His talent was quick and agile, and his answers flowed like a stream. Whenever he discussed current affairs, he spoke frankly and never flattered, so the capital praised him highly. Later, because he asked to return home, he closed his door and chanted, only reading ancient texts to amuse himself every day. In his spare time, he compiled one hundred and thirty-seven five-character Hangzhou proverb poems, and the clan parties competed to copy them, and even women and children enjoyed reciting them. The ingenious thoughts are intricately combined, and the starting and ending points often contain profound truths and famous sayings, not just for the sake of matching pairs. During the Xinyou Rebellion of the Yue bandits, the Duke died in his hometown; his works were voluminous, but they were all lost in the fire. ... In the autumn of Yi Hai, En was sent to the capital and found this book at a fellow villager's house. He reviewed it repeatedly, and felt that the Duke's jokes and humor were as rich as yesterday. He quickly borrowed it and copied it by hand, keeping it as a family treasure. ... It should be entrusted to the hand of the people, to provide for the enjoyment of like-minded people. ..."

According to Shao Yichen's word is Wei Xi, Renhe native, Jinshi in the special examination in the twenty-first year of Daoguang, an official in the Zhongshu Sheren, and later an official in the Criminal Department Yuanwailang; later, he worked on the He River project, was impeached, returned to Hangzhou, and died in the Xianfeng eleventh year. His works include: "Shangshu Dayi," lost; "Yili Tonglun" and "Chenxing Lu," with transmitted editions. Pan Zuyin and others also compiled his poems into "Manuscripts of Mr. Huixi" (totaling fifty-six poems), included in the "Pangxi Pian Series."

Shao's poems, numbering over one hundred, were six times more than those of Zhou Zongtai. However, the lack of titles for each poem and the use of obscure proverbs without annotations are its shortcomings. Those that are commendable include:

"Rain falls, heaven keeps guests, time and again ghosts play with people. Knocking on the door breaks the night, setting fire to oneself. The tiger swallows the butterfly, the lazy man serves the people. Three liters, three he, fate, clap hands, no awning."

And:

"Poor man suffers for a long time, the teacher is busy looking for a job. Marry a wife, first look at the mother-in-law, whoever has milk is the mother. Gambling eats up the examination, hemp whiskers are black, fat, and long. Hitting the head doesn't respond to the brain, auntie calls a hundred flowers fragrant."

Also:

"What is asked is not what is answered, can be met but not sought. Not yet returned to three feet of earth, climb another floor. Few desires, many sons, white hair before old age. Adults are not at ease, being a ghost is also romantic."

Looking at them alone, they are indeed neatly matched, but linking them into poems gives a "vague feeling," perhaps the work of a scholar is always separated by a layer from that of a commoner?

In addition, there is also "Wu Proverb Poetry Manuscript," one type. The author, Wang Zhang, Zi Qiao, Suzhou native, uncle of musician Wang Jilie. According to Wang Jilie's postscript, he tried the provincial examination seven times unsuccessfully, probably also a wandering person. The recorded verses include more than two hundred and twenty five-character poems, and several dozen seven-character poems with titles. A volume of lead-printed edition. The first Luoting Zhu Junyu's preface and Wang Zhang's self-preface are both titled Xinyou, which is the tenth year of the Republic of China. It seems that it was made after the entry into the Republic of China, so it is not taken. The purpose of involving this book is to point out: this trend has not died out to this day. Shao Yichen, Hangzhou native Zhou, Zongtai, and Wang Zhang, Suzhou natives, is this perhaps a characteristic of Suzhou and Hangzhou literature?

Collecting proverbs focuses on faithful recording, being able to preserve its original appearance; but in this academic matter, the predecessors lacked an objective attitude. Using them for couplets, after the compiler's cutting and trimming, to the point of combining proverb couplets into poems, it is already a decline. However, it is commendable that the predecessors could pay attention to common affairs and common things.
