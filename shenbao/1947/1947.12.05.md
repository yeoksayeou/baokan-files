### 全經委會通過要案　國內匯率決予調整　水產公司改為官商合辦

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The National Economic Council held its 26th meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon, chaired by Zhang Qun, and resolved:

A.  To adjust the domestic exchange rate and restrict the transportation of cash in order to encourage the inflow of funds, prevent the concentration of floating capital in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, and stimulate commodity prices. During the discussion of this proposal, He Hao-ruo, based on the results of his inspection in the interior, believed that there was a lack of cash in the interior. To avoid the trouble of withdrawing cash, state banks often followed the black market exchange rate and repeatedly increased the exchange rate for remittances to the interior, resulting in the concentration of floating capital in Nanjing and Shanghai. The current domestic exchange rates of state banks are determined through consultation between local branches and reported to the Four Banks Joint Office for record. The rates vary considerably, often depending on the tightness of funds in the market, the amount of cash on hand, and the trend of floating capital. As a result, floating capital also flows to Nanjing and Shanghai. To eliminate the above-mentioned drawbacks, the majority of the committee members believed that in order to encourage the dispersion of funds to the interior and prevent concentration in Nanjing and Shanghai and southward flow to Guangzhou, the Four Banks Joint Office should plan and reduce the domestic exchange rate as a whole, undertake as much business as possible, and facilitate domestic remittances, significantly increasing the exchange rates for remittances to Shanghai and Guangzhou, and restricting large remittances. Local financial management bureaus should also strictly supervise and control local banks. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance should formulate regulations for the transportation of cash, and state banks should supply cash to the interior to cooperate. The resolution was passed and will be handled directly by the Four Banks Joint Office.

B. The government submitted a request to audit whether cotton, rice, wheat, flour, and other commodities should be settled at the official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan. During the discussion of this proposal, some committee members believed that the supply of cotton was insufficient and should be purchased and imported by the government to increase the production of cloth and stabilize the market, and they agreed to settle the exchange at the official rate. Other committee members believed that if control was not strict, merchants often purchased foreign exchange at the official rate and then sold it at the market price for profit, so they did not advocate settling the exchange at the official rate. The resolution was passed and submitted to Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Zhang Jia'ao, Lou Tongsun, Huang Yuanbin, Yu Feipeng, Pan Xulun, Chen Qitian, Liu Zhendong, and other nine committee members for review.

C. Whether the China Fisheries Company could adopt a joint public-private operation method, giving up half of its shares for free participation by fishermen across the country. The resolution was passed in accordance with the opinions of the State-Owned Enterprise Sales Supervision Committee, adopting a joint public-private operation method and giving up half of the shares for free participation by fishermen across the country.

D. Whether De Fu Foreign Firm and Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory could be sold in installments and the price paid in US dollars. The resolution was passed to be sold in installments, and the US dollar bonds of the 36th year of the Republic could be used for payment.

E. Whether the state-owned assets of the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company could be purchased by the company's commercial shareholders. The resolution was passed to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.

### 花紗布加強管制　紡調會改為全國紡管局　滬金融管理局週內成立

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] President of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun reported at the National Economic Council that: as the end of the year approaches, commodity prices have fluctuated slightly. In order to stabilize commodity prices, the highest authorities have instructed the Executive Yuan to quickly formulate effective measures to stabilize commodity prices, focusing on the more easily controlled cotton cloth, and coordinating with financial measures to strictly control the current financial situation. After receiving the order, the Executive Yuan immediately complied. The Ministry of Finance has drafted the organizational regulations for the Financial Management Bureau, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan and can be established in the short term. The control of cotton cloth has also been discussed at the Cotton Cloth Subcommittee of the National Economic Council on November 29, and principles have been determined, and the reorganization of the control agency is underway to strictly implement government policies.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] In order to crack down on hoarding and speculation and strengthen the control of cotton yarn and cloth, the Textile Adjustment Committee has decided to reorganize into the National Textile Industry Management Bureau. Once its organizational charter is approved at the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting on the 5th, it will be formally reorganized and established. In the future, cotton cloth control will adopt the method of commissioned spinning and weaving to achieve the purpose of unified purchase and sales. The current joint distribution policy will continue to run parallel with the commissioned spinning and weaving policy, that is, to use US cotton for relief and foreign cotton purchased by the government to be commissioned to factories for spinning and weaving. Cotton purchased by manufacturers themselves will be made into cotton yarn, and then added to the finished products of the China Textile Company for joint distribution. Once the government can fully control cotton, the thorough commissioned spinning and weaving and unified purchase and sales policies can be implemented. The detailed principles for controlling cotton yarn have also been decided by the Cotton Cloth Problem Subcommittee of the National Economic Council as follows: In order to control yarn and cloth, all commissioned spinning methods should be adopted, and the commissioned weaving policy should also be implemented immediately. To achieve all commissioned spinning, raw materials must be controlled, that is, domestic cotton and foreign cotton should be grasped as much as possible, and foreign cotton should be exchanged for cotton yarn exports. To achieve the purpose of commissioned weaving, the cotton weaving industry and the cotton manufacturing industry must be allocated yarn in a planned manner. The allocation of yarn should focus on cotton cloth for daily use and cotton textiles suitable for export. In order to implement the above principles, the original Textile Adjustment Committee should be reorganized into a control agency (which has been decided to be the National Textile Industry Management Bureau).

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Li Lixia and Bi Delin, the newly appointed director and deputy director of the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau announced by the Ministry of Finance, came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 4th, and visited the relevant authorities, and called on Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun to discuss the promotion of future business and personnel and other issues. Li returned to Shanghai by the night train on the 4th. According to Bi Delin to reporters, the bureau's primary task in the future is to guide floating capital into the right track, so that all floating capital can pass through financial institutions and be fully expressed on the books, so that it is easier to manage. The Shanghai Financial Management Bureau can be established within a week. The Ministry of Finance is discussing candidates for the Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou bureaus, and will officially announce their establishment in the short term.

Our Democratic Politics Takes Another Step Forward

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Zeng Qi, chairman of the China Youth Party, met with Ge Heping, a reporter from the American Life Magazine stationed in China, at his private residence at 11:00 AM on the 4th, and made a statement on the opening of local associations, saying: "China's democratic politics has recently made further progress, that is, the opening of local councils. Yesterday, the government announced the selection of a total of 451 senators to participate in the senates of 26 provinces and 10 cities. Among them, there are 200 members of the Youth Party. This is based on the common policy program, and the government is fulfilling its promises, which is indeed a wise move. Because the expansion of the government's foundation must be from the opening of the 'Central Political Power' to the opening of the 'Local Political Power'. At the same time, opening the local councils can be worthy of the name. Although the opening of the local political power is not as expected, the local councils have been opened, and all parties have the right to vote for the election of supervisory committee members. The supervisory court, similar to the upper house, has seats for all parties, which is the scale of a democratic constitutional government."

### 召開對日和會美立塲不改變　台灣屬中國爲當然事

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Well-informed sources said on the 3rd that the United States' position on the Japanese peace treaty has not changed and will continue to be adhered to. The peace treaty is drafted by all countries that actively fought against Japan, and the resolution of the conference cannot be vetoed by major powers. The United States will refuse to accept China's November 17 proposal to adopt the Far Eastern Commission (in which major powers have veto power) procedure when drafting the peace treaty. The United States' refusal will prove its position. The Soviet Union rejected China's proposal and made a counter-proposal, advocating that China. US. English. The four powers of the Soviet Union will meet in January next year to discuss the issue of the peace conference. The Soviet Union's movements have been widely noted in the United States, so that little attention has been paid to the fact that the United States has not yet responded to China's proposal.

According to a US official who is closely related to the preparation of the treaty: "This is not the case." He said: The treaty cannot logically deal with matters beyond depriving the Japanese of certain rights in Taiwan. He said: In terms of the meaning of both the Cairo Declaration and history, the return of Taiwan to China is a natural and legitimate matter.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in North China, Fu Zuoyi, met with reporters for the first time this morning and answered the questions raised by the reporters as follows:

(Q) Is the area under the jurisdiction of the headquarters five provinces? (A) Yes.

(Q) Where will the headquarters be located? (A) A place will be selected in the suburbs of Ping.

(Q) Is the Taiyuan Pacification Office also under your command? (A) Bandit suppression military affairs should be coordinated.

(Q) What is the future development plan? (A) It is a military secret and cannot be disclosed. What can be told is that in the future, the past passive style will be changed and an active style will be adopted. We will not be beaten, let alone wait to be beaten in one place. The Communist bandits' large-scale attacks on a certain place are all carried out by concentrating forces from various places. When attacking Shanxi, Hebei is empty. We should recognize this weakness and attack them at any time.

(Q) Do you have the confidence to defeat the Communist bandits? (A) Bandit suppression is the people's demand. The Communist bandits are not only traitors but also bandits, which goes against the moral concepts of the Chinese people. I will organize the people, and the people will also help me complete the mission. Moreover, the bandit suppression in the future will be a nationwide cooperation. Under these conditions, I firmly believe that the Communist bandits can be defeated, but it will not be a short-term matter.

(Q) Is it necessary to coordinate military, political, and economic affairs to defeat the Communist bandits? Will the policies you implemented in Chahar-Suiyuan also be applied to the new jurisdiction? (A) It is necessary to coordinate military and political affairs, but the policies suitable for Chahar-Suiyuan may not be applicable to other places. I will discuss a suitable military-political coordination policy with the chief administrative officers.

(Q) Will the Communist bandits attack Pingjin? (A) I welcome them to come, so that we can have the opportunity to annihilate them.

Finally, a foreign reporter asked: Does China need American weapons to fight the Communist Party? Answer: The type of weapons used is entirely up to the central government's allocation, and this is not my business.

[Another cable] After days of negotiations, the organization of Fu Zuoyi's bandit suppression headquarters has been largely decided. This morning, after meeting with Li Zongren and Xiong Shihui again, he returned to Zhang by military vehicle at noon to arrange the military and political affairs of Chahar-Suiyuan after the end of the Zhangyuan Pacification Office. He will return to Ping in three or four days to preside over the establishment of the headquarters.

### 劉匪被迫集中主力　豫南揭開決戰序幕　白部長昨午承機飛抵漢口

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 4th] Minister Bai flew from Xunxi in the early morning of the 4th despite the bad weather and arrived safely in Hankou at noon.

[Our Jiujiang Dispatch, 4th] Liu Bandit's main force contacted the National Army on the 3rd from the early morning in the area south of the Xinyang-Huangchuan Highway in Southern Henan and north of Jifu County. As of the time of dispatch, the fierce fighting has lasted for a day and night without any sign of stopping. Because Chen Yi's 10th Column, which aided Liu Bandit, has about 30,000 people, and is attached with more than 2,000 political workers, bank staff and ammunition. Liu, a week ago, concentrated his main force from the line of Guangji, Huangmei, Susong and Taihu and moved northwestward. His attempt was to support to resolve his current serious difficulties. Liu Bandit has always been able to flow and guerrilla warfare, and he did not dare to contact the main force of the National Army. Now he is forced to concentrate, which gives the National Army a great opportunity to capture him. The Xinhuang campaign is the first decisive battle between the main force of the bandit army and the strong troops of the National Army. The right-wing troops of the National Army achieved good results in the battle on the afternoon of yesterday. Xu Zuyi, chief of staff of the Jiujiang Command of the Ministry of National Defense, told reporters that the war on that line is still in the initial stage. When the National Army reinforcements arrive, the decisive battle can be launched. The future of the war will be clear in about a week or ten days. According to reliable information, Chen Yi's reinforcements have now arrived at Pobo River south of Luoshan in Henan, and Liu Bandit's main force is at Fuzihe, Macheng.

[Our Jiujiang Dispatch, 4th] On the afternoon of the 4th, the bandits on the Xinhuang Highway had the appearance of moving southwest towards Yihua Store. Our air force took off from a certain base on the 4th and reconnaissance in batches on the front line of the Xinhuang Highway and cooperated with the ground troops.

### 進剿劉匪計劃完成　九江指揮部招待記者報告

[Our Jiujiang Dispatch, 3rd] The Jiujiang Command of the Ministry of National Defense held its first press conference on the 3rd, presided over by Liu Ziqing, Director of the News Department, and Chang Jian, Deputy Director. Liu first described the past year of bandit suppression in Henan, Hubei, Shandong, and Anhui, and corrected some people's misconceptions about bandit suppression. He listed the achievements of the National Army on various battlefields, explained the failure of Chen Yi, Chen Geng, Liu Bocheng, and other bandit troops after they fled from Southern Shandong, and judged, based on intelligence, that the strength of the bandit army in the current Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Anhui areas has been wiped out by more than one-third. The maximum strength is about 300,000, which is only equivalent to the strength of Chen Yi's troops before they fled south. Liu Bandit claimed to be 70,000 when he fled south, but now he is only 40,000 to 50,000. Because he was severely damaged by the National Army, he sent an urgent telegram to Chen Yi and others for assistance and to supply ammunition. This proves the severity of Liu Bandit's encounter. After Liu Bandit received assistance, he also launched a military service campaign in the invaded areas, forcing young men to serve as soldiers and trying to struggle, but Chinese history proves that the bandit army will be destroyed. Liu said at the end: After Minister Bai arrived, he has completed his military plan to suppress Liu Bandit and has begun to implement it according to the scheduled steps. Liu said at the end: Although the bandit army does not exaggerate its so-called "dumbbell" and "sparrow" tactics, our military and civilians are united in their efforts to mobilize and suppress the bandits and build the country under the national policy, and it will not be difficult to eliminate the bandits.

Editorial

### How to Relieve Refugees?

Currently, the most serious and pressing issue in society is undoubtedly the refugee relief problem. This issue has always existed and is not a recent development. However, due to years of the War of Resistance, followed by the unrestrained disturbances of the communist bandits, and the frequent occurrences of floods, droughts, and wind disasters year after year, the number of people who cannot make a living or even find a peaceful place to reside has surged dramatically. Therefore, the impoverished refugees who are displaced today can be broadly divided into three categories:  Impoverished people,  Unemployed groups,  Genuine refugees.

The relief agencies that existed before the war in various regions, although there were organizations such as welfare homes and relief centers funded by the government, were limited in resources and small in scale, often insufficient to shoulder this heavy responsibility. After the war, with the country riddled with holes and facing continued difficulties, many relief organizations were unable to recover in time. Other private charitable organizations also struggled to restore their original operations due to dwindling donations. Today, well-known charitable halls in various places are constantly selling assets for cash or reducing their scope. The sources of refugees are increasing daily, while the scope of accommodation is shrinking, making it no wonder that the number of refugees wandering the streets is growing.

Taking Shanghai as an example, in addition to various private charitable organizations, the municipal relief agencies have gradually increased to four, namely the children's education and care center, the women's education and care center, the disability center, and the vocational training center. The total number of people they can accommodate is said to be around four to five thousand, not including the unemployed workers accommodated in the unemployment reception center. These institutions did not exist before the war but were newly established after the war. The municipal treasury bears a significant burden for this, and it cannot be said that it has not fulfilled its considerable responsibility. However, there are too many existing refugees, and the number of those who are unemployed and on the brink of starvation is increasing daily. Moreover, there are frequent reports of people flowing in from other areas and being repatriated from overseas. Considering the existing conditions of funding, quotas, and facilities, it is clear that the various institutions are still unable to cope adequately. Although the Winter Relief Committee is setting up shelters to provide extensive relief, the quotas are limited, and the relief is temporary. When the period ends in March next year, these refugees will inevitably be displaced again.

To truly solve the refugee problem, it is currently not easy to talk about fundamental solutions. However, even for stopgap measures, it is difficult to achieve effective results without comprehensive planning, establishing an overall plan, and implementing it seriously. Because there are too many refugees, helping this group while neglecting that group will not solve the problem. Refugees are also highly mobile. If relief is provided in one area but not in others, people will inevitably flock there with their families, overwhelming the area's resources. Currently, there are particularly many refugees in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai because the relief efforts there are relatively better than in other places. To remedy this defect, the central government should urgently formulate measures to designate major cities to simultaneously conduct relief efforts, distributing the burden to achieve widespread coverage.

The first essential requirement for genuine relief is naturally the economic issue. We believe that although this matter is extremely difficult, it is not without solutions. We will point out several approaches as follows:

Pacifying and gathering the displaced is closely related to using troops to quell rebellions. The central government should designate a large sum of money and allocate it to various regions as a special fund for relief. It should also send special commissioners to supervise the implementation in various regions, without completely pushing this responsibility onto the local governments to avoid shirking and perfunctory actions. This is the first point.

Although the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) have announced their closure, it is said that there are still many remaining materials transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs. These transferred materials should be used as much as possible for this relief effort to live up to their name. Materials that are not very suitable for use can be sold first and then transferred to facilitate their application. This is the second point.

The Sino-American Relief Agreement stipulates that goods worth 30 million US dollars will be shipped to China, including a large amount of food, clothing, and medicine. These should be prioritized for refugee relief to fulfill the original intention of the friendly nations' donations. This is the third point.

For the remaining amount, local governments should be ordered to earnestly raise funds, and in conjunction with local leaders, widely solicit donations to increase the source of funds. This is the fourth point.

While the above points (1) and (4) still need to be planned, points (2) and (3) are readily available and can be implemented with minimal effort. In any case, it would be much more practical than widespread selling, wasting materials, or allowing a few people to use personal connections to obtain materials to carry out some cosmetic and inconsequential welfare projects.

The so-called comprehensive planning does not only refer to the central government. When handling refugee relief, local authorities should also, under the supervision of local officials, coordinate with public and private relief agencies to comprehensively allocate housing, funds, donations, supplies, and management, making the best use of people and resources. The goal should be to provide relief to all local refugees, without deliberately creating divisions or showing favoritism. Currently, many refugees are stranded on the streets without anywhere to go, while many places are unwilling to provide assistance themselves or allow others to use their facilities. Moreover, many institutions have overly strict restrictions and are arbitrarily picky, unwilling to accommodate more refugees, which goes against the original intention of public welfare and charity.

Regardless of how much relief funds are raised, it is uneconomical and unreasonable to support a large number of refugees in the long term. We believe that if the first step of comprehensive relief planning is successful, the second step should focus on the following points:

Repatriation: Those who have homes to return to should be provided with travel expenses or arrangements for transportation by land or water to be dispersed separately. This is especially important for refugees who are transiting through.

Work Relief: It is said that the city's winter relief plan also includes this budget item, which is very meaningful. We believe that this plan can be further expanded so that women, the elderly, and the weak can all have light work to do, transforming idleness into production to channel their emotions during displacement and cultivate their working habits.

Subsidies: Those who have livelihood skills but lack the necessary capital can be provided with small loans, similar to the small-scale loan method, to enable them to run their own businesses.

Referrals: Job referrals are naturally a difficult task, but there are still some avenues to explore that may be in demand. For example, domestic helpers seem to have relatively wider options. As long as the relief agencies are willing to provide convenience and guidance, they can also find a way out.

In conclusion, providing a minimum level of living relief to displaced refugees is a responsibility that society should bear, and it is an obligation that modern governments cannot shirk. Look at the welfare facilities for the elderly, the unemployed, and the sick – how much importance do various countries attach to them, and how large are the expenditure figures they account for in the budget. The United Kingdom has extensive national expenses, but it is still actively expanding these facilities. We are now merely asking the government and society to provide a comprehensive and practical relief effort for refugees who are displaced due to economic oppression or the chaos of war. This should not be considered an extravagant hope!

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Council (Continued from Page 1)

Chairman Shen's Proposals

Chairman Shen personally presented five central proposals covering security, civil affairs, finance, education, and economic development:  Strengthen police and security forces and improve self-defense organizations.  Organize household registration and land administration, and improve township and village self-defense systems.  Improve grain administration and rectify legitimate taxation.  Expand adult education and strengthen cadre training.  Develop agriculture and water conservancy, complete transportation and communication, increase food production, and improve export trade. In addition, he proposed four points that deserve special attention:  Security: There are more than 1,500 remnants of bandits lurking in the mountainous areas of Zhejiang. The current police and security forces are ten times stronger than the bandits, and the political organizations are complete. Efforts should be made to prevent further disturbances and crush the bandits' "Three Mountains Policy" from Dabie to Tianmu to Siming.  Resolve military service and military grain issues, and complete mobilization for the suppression of the rebellion.  Maintain food supplies and strive for disaster relief.  Simplify county-level organizations and solve financial difficulties.

Chairman Chiang's Instructions

Subsequently, Chairman Chiang's telegram was read, instructing that during this period of mobilization for the suppression of the rebellion, the primary task for administrative personnel at all levels is to organize and train the people, strengthen self-defense, eliminate hidden bandits, and consolidate security. This should be supplemented by promoting education, developing cooperation, and improving people's livelihoods so that the people can live in peace and enjoy the practical benefits of prosperity. To achieve this goal, it is essential to improve official governance, strengthen grassroots organizations, suppress local despots, and protect the good people. It is hoped that all attendees of the Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Council will thoroughly review the situation, determine a plan, and work diligently for success. Significant progress should be made in the 37th year [of the Republic of China], setting an example for others. Furthermore, it is hoped that you will effectively supervise and establish strict assessment measures to achieve success according to schedule and fulfill the mission of national construction. This is what is greatly expected.

In the afternoon, Mayor Zhou and the commissioners of various administrative regions reported on their administration. The heads of various departments of the provincial government will report starting tomorrow.

### China Pays Special Attention to the New Constitution of Malaya

Liu Weichi Made a Statement Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] After the British government announced the draft of the new constitution for the Federation of Malaya, despite repeated revisions, the British, Malays, and Indians in Malaya have had unfavorable reactions to the new constitutional proposal. The Overseas Chinese community's opposition is particularly strong, leading to a joint strike by the Overseas Chinese and other ethnic groups. Our foreign affairs authorities are closely monitoring this situation, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is paying special attention. According to Commission Chairman Liu Weichi's statement to reporters yesterday: The status of Overseas Chinese in Malaya is extremely important. They account for half of the total population of over five million. Moreover, the prosperity of Malaya today is due to the hard work of our Overseas Chinese. Their great contribution is known throughout the world, and even the British acknowledge it. Therefore, our government cannot ignore the lives, property, and safety of the over two million Overseas Chinese in Malaya. Although the draft of the new constitution for the Federation of Malaya can be said to be an internal affair of the Federation of Malaya, and other countries have no reason to interfere, imagine what would happen if our country's constitution specifically included provisions that discriminated against a certain ethnic group. Therefore, under these circumstances, we must pay special attention to the draft of the new constitution for the Federation of Malaya.

### London Economist Says U.S. Aid to China Should Not Be Suspended for Long

[Reported by Our Newspaper] A broadcast from London on November 29th: The Economist commented on the 29th regarding the U.S. temporary aid to Asia, stating: "The recent motion by the U.S. House of Representatives to reduce aid to Europe and approve $60 million for China was proposed by Representatives Judd, Herter, and Lewis. This new development of giving priority to aid to China is the inevitable result of the U.S. political situation. If the basis for aid to Europe is anti-communism and the motive is to save countries from falling into communism, then Greece and China, where communists have actually launched civil wars against their governments, should logically have the right to receive priority aid. Moreover, traditional American ideas have always recognized that the United States has a special responsibility towards China." The report also pointed out that the failure of Marshall's mediation in the Chinese government made the U.S. government lack a consistent policy towards China. After learning of the gains of the communist army, Washington officials believed that the funds had lost their proper purpose in China and were unwilling to provide aid. U.S. public opinion has also regretted intervening in the Chinese civil war by standing on the side of a 'notorious corrupt regime without a sufficient democratic foundation.' However, repeated reports from Moscow about the CCP's propaganda against American imperialism have recently made people deeply believe that if the CCP-controlled group replaces the government, China will inevitably be absorbed into the Soviet bloc. Under these circumstances, if the United States does not believe that the Chinese government has lost its ideal of struggle, it cannot suspend its support for a longer period."

In the past two years, the United National General Association has transported large quantities of cotton, wool, old clothes, yarn and sewing machines to China, worth a total of 113 million US dollars, which is the second largest plan in the General Association's relief work in China. It is now known that the person in charge of the project, Mr. Kang Habei (pictured below in the picture), is scheduled to leave for the UK this Sunday, and the above project is hereby announced to be over.

The figure shows: (Top center) Part of the 666,000 bales of raw cotton from the General Association arriving in Shanghai and unloading on the Suzhou River.

### Urgent Foreign Aid Bill: Heated Debate in U.S. House of Representatives; Bullitt Advocated Large-Scale Aid to China

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 4th Broadcast: Washington News, U.S. Acting Secretary of State Lovett told the Senate Appropriations Committee today that if countries such as France and Italy fall into the hands of the Communists, he will recommend to the President that relief aid to these countries be stopped. Lovett's statement was made after the chairman of the committee raised questions. At the same time, members of the committee expressed deep dissatisfaction with the continued shipment of goods to the Soviet Union, believing that the government's attempt to curb Communism while simultaneously supplying the Soviet Union with materials was contradictory.

[United Press Washington, 4th] The emergency foreign aid resolution has been submitted to the House of Representatives for a vote today. Opponents loudly proclaimed that all U.S. aid might eventually be used against the United States. Representative Allen demanded that Congress reject the bill and thoroughly review all future foreign aid proposals to prevent factories built with U.S. money from manufacturing weapons for the Soviet Union to use against the United States. The bill is expected to face obstacles and be amended, with a reduction in the amount of funding or restrictions on its use after at least two days of heated debate. The main issues are the amount of funding and the recipient countries. The Senate has already approved the entire amount of $597 million, but the House Foreign Affairs Committee has only approved $590 million. At the same time, the Senate passed a resolution limiting recipient countries to France, Italy, and Austria, while the House Foreign Affairs Committee added China and recommended a grant of $60 million.

[United Press Washington, 4th] Republican leaders in both the House and Senate reportedly agreed today that the current special session of Congress will adjourn on December 19.

[United Press New York, 4th] Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, William Bullitt, stated in a speech to the American English Union today that the Soviet Union is now striving to mobilize all of Europe and Asia against the United States. The United States must take effective action to lead the construction of a strong and unified Europe and a China free from Communist bondage. Otherwise, the resources of Europe and Asia will eventually be fully mobilized against the United States. With only 140 million people, the United States will inevitably be outnumbered in manpower and machinery. Economic aid alone is not enough; the United States should lead the establishment of a European customs union, followed by a political alliance, to resolutely resist Soviet aggression. Bullitt also criticized the U.S.'s "Alice in Wonderland optimistic policy" towards China, demanding "immediate large-scale aid to China to prevent Stalin from organizing 450 million Chinese people to fight against the United States."

### French Parliament Passes Anti-Strike Bill with Overwhelming Vote; 80,000 Reservists Called Up

[Reuters Paris, 4th] The National Assembly passed a bill this morning by a vote of 423 to 183 to ban strikes and prevent sabotage. Communist Party members voted against the bill. The bill stipulates that anyone who attempts to interfere with the freedom to work of others will be sentenced to up to five years in prison and may also be fined up to US$4,000. Those who interfere with the freedom to work of others through sabotage or carrying weapons will be subject to double penalties.

[Reuters Paris, 4th] The debate in the National Assembly on the bill to ban strikes and prevent sabotage, after more than 120 hours of heated debate, seemed to be nearing its end on the morning of the 4th. The French Ministry of Defense issued a public statement this morning formally announcing the conscription of 80,000 army, navy, and air force reservists. Those called up were born between July 1, 1923, and December 31, 1923. Army Minister Teitgen delivered a radio address last night, stating that the called-up reservists would be used to "protect the people, resist violence, murder, and sabotage."

[Reuters Paris, 3rd] Sabotage in France is gradually expanding, and railway accidents are occurring frequently, gradually becoming a form of guerrilla tactics. After a cabinet meeting today, a public statement was issued, stating that the government considered raising the basic salary to 10,000 francs per month from January 1 when calculating family allowances. However, the current basic salary is 8,000 francs per month, while the National General Confederation of Labor is demanding 10,800 francs.

### American Entrepreneurs Gather to Review the Future of Industry
All Agree on Increasing High Productivity

[Central News Agency New York, 3rd] Three thousand American entrepreneurs are meeting here today to discuss the various problems facing American industry. The meeting is hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers (the most powerful organization in American industry) and opened today, lasting for three days. The topic of the meeting is "The new domestic and international situation facing industry, challenging industry." During the first day of the meeting, American industrialists mostly believed that the challenges to the American free enterprise and individual liberty system came from the Soviet Union's communism from the outside and from inflation from the inside. Speakers encouraged American industry to maintain and increase the current high level of productivity, which can be maintained and can help Western Europe and other parts of the world that are in danger of being eaten away by the Communist Party, and can also show that the American system is the most effective production system in the world.

### Four Foreign Ministers Discuss German and Austrian Treaties; Soviet Union Adopts Delaying Tactics
Issue of Procedures for German Treaty Reconsidered by Subcommittees

[Reuters London, 3rd] Today's Foreign Ministers Conference further showed that Molotov is adopting a delaying strategy. The Foreign Ministers Conference has been discussing the procedures for preparing the German treaty for two weeks, and today it decided to have the issue reconsidered by the Foreign Ministers' representatives, which shows the slow progress of the conference. It is generally speculated that Molotov's motives for delaying are no more than the following: waiting for the political crises in Italy and France to develop more clearly; wanting to know the positive results of the US Congress's review of the Marshall Plan; waiting for other powers to respond to the Soviet proposal to convene a Foreign Ministers Conference in China next January to discuss the Japanese peace treaty; waiting for Western Germany, especially Secretary of State Marshall, to take a stronger initiative within the Foreign Ministers Conference. So far, Marshall has not shown any intention of quickly reaching a resolution.

[Reuters London, 3rd] The Foreign Ministers Conference first reviewed the report of the Foreign Ministers' representatives on the Austrian issue today, and then resumed discussion of the procedures for preparing the German peace treaty. Molotov reached the decision of the Potsdam Conference, determining the basis of the German peace treaty, and the four governments should submit proposals to the Foreign Ministers Conference on preparation within two months. Chairman Bidault stated that he considered this procedure inappropriate, and Molotov then withdrew his proposal. The discussion then entered the issue of the organization of the peace conference, and Molotov still insisted on the important position of the four powers in the peace conference committee. Marshall proposed a classification of four types of countries: the four powers; allied countries bordering Germany and those who participated in the war with troops; other countries that declared war on Germany; and Germany itself. He said that the first category of countries should be responsible for the preliminary and final drafting of the treaty, the second category should participate in the peace conference and the important committees of the peace conference, and the third and fourth categories of countries may submit opinions to the peace conference through representatives of their governments or people. Molotov suggested that the issue of the procedures for preparing the German peace treaty be reconsidered by the Foreign Ministers' representatives, and the United States, Britain, and France did not object. The four Foreign Ministers' representatives will be Vyshinsky (Soviet), Chauvel (France), Murphy (U.S.), and Dean (Britain).

### Truman's Message to the Senate Urges Approval of the Pan-American Convention

[Reuters Washington, 4th] President Truman sent a message to the Senate on the 4th, urging the Senate to quickly approve the Pan-American Defense Treaty signed in Petrópolis, Brazil, in September. The President's message stated: "The principles, purposes, and content of the treaty have my full agreement, so I am happy to recommend that it be given the most satisfactory consideration." Chairman Vandenberg of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had asked the President to submit the treaty to the Senate as quickly as possible so that it could be dealt with before the end of the special session of Congress. He deeply hoped that the U.S. Congress would approve the convention before the Pan-American Conference is held in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, in January next year to discuss the implementation of the treaty and elect the Pan-American Military Advisory Committee. According to the main provisions of the treaty, mutual assistance among American countries will be implemented when any American country encounters an attack. To prevent aggression, a security zone will be established around the American continent, stretching from the Arctic to the Antarctic, as well as the islands of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

[Reuters Washington, 3rd] There is no shortage of U.S. Senators issuing warnings, stating that it may be necessary to send international troops to implement the Palestine partition plan. Some are also asking how Soviet troops can be prevented from setting foot in this strategically important location.

### Housing Charity Sale Plan Approved; First Lottery in February Next Year; Selects Shanghai West Residential Area to Build 100 Western-Style Buildings; 1 Million Tickets Printed, Sold at Two Prices

[Our Newspaper News] The Preparatory Committee for the Winter Relief Housing Charity Sale Ticket Issuance in this city was held at the City Hall Conference Room yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Wu Kaixian, Zhu Ping, Zhao Zengjue, Zhao Zukang, Wang Xianqing, Ye Xianggao, and more than 20 other people attended. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting. In addition to passing the entire plan, three points were resolved: The construction site is expected to be decided and announced by the 10th of this month. The charity sale tickets are expected to be printed by the 20th of this month. The first prize lottery is scheduled for February 15th next year.

Director of the Land Administration Bureau Zhu Ping met with reporters after the meeting to explain the purpose of this move and to supplement the implementation methods, stating briefly: The purpose of issuing winter relief housing charity sale tickets is to raise 150 billion. After deducting the necessary expenses for building houses, which is 100 billion, a net profit of 50 billion can be obtained, which will be used as donations, and the housing shortage can be solved, benefiting public educators and wage earners. This is indeed a move with multiple benefits. As for the implementation outline, it is as follows: One million winter relief housing charity sale tickets will be issued, divided into two types, A and B, with 500,000 tickets of each type. Type A costs 200,000 per ticket, and Type B costs 100,000. One hundred two-story residential houses will be built. Each Type B single room will occupy about one fen of land and should have one living room-dining room, two bedrooms, one bathroom, and one kitchen. Type A double rooms will occupy about two fen and should have one living room, one dining room, one kitchen, two to three bedrooms, and one bathroom. The principle is to be economical, sturdy, and durable, and there are three or four different styles of blueprints to choose from. The construction site will be selected in three or four areas of the city with convenient transportation and water and electricity facilities, using public land and negotiating with real estate developers to sell private land for cooperation. The location is expected to be in the residential area of West Shanghai. When the charity sale ticket promotion has not yielded results, the Winter Relief Association will first use the charity sale tickets as collateral to borrow from the bank and then repay them in succession. After the bidding is determined, construction will begin immediately, and all construction is expected to be completed within three months from the date of commencement. As for the handling agency, the Winter Relief Committee will set up a housing charity sale department with one director, who will be appointed by the director of the fundraising committee. There will be three deputy directors, who will be appointed by the director of the Land Administration Bureau, the director of the Public Works Bureau, and the chairman of the local real estate industry association. The following groups will also be set up, each responsible for its own duties: General Affairs Group, Finance Group, Land Purchase Group, Construction Group, Material Purchase Group, Supervision Group, and Charity Sale Group.

### Increased Frequency of Use, Lines Cannot Meet Demand; Lack of Foreign Exchange Funds, Telephone Maintenance Difficult

[Our Headquarters News] There is a phenomenon that telephone lines in this city cannot meet the demand. Telephone communications often require time to wait due to congested lines. Various sectors have a lot of criticism for the telephone company. Vice President O'Sullivan of the Shanghai Telephone Company recently reported the difficulties after the war, stating: The telephone lines in this city were originally designed based on the normal population and socio-economic situation, but now the population of Shanghai has increased, and the number of people using the telephone has increased several times. The proportion of telephone charges is lower than before the war. In 1936, a commercial telephone monthly rental was about 10 national currency units, and now it only costs 120,000 for 150 uses per month, which is 12,000 times the pre-war rate, but the cost of living index is more than 50,000 times, which is obviously extremely affordable compared to telephone fees. Therefore, the number of unnecessary uses has increased. Comparing July 1947 with July 1936, the number of uses increased by 68%. The obstruction of traffic in the urban area and the rapidly changing economic situation also make people tend to use the telephone more. As for equipment, it was occupied by the Japanese during the war and lost a lot. After the end of the war, due to unstable foreign exchange funds, it was unable to improve quickly. However, it has tried its best to order equipment for 10,000 lines from abroad, hoping to complete the installation by the autumn of next year. The value of this equipment is about 3.5 million US dollars. Last year, it was originally planned to purchase another 15,000 lines, but due to the lack of foreign exchange, it was postponed. The company's financial situation is now much worse than before. Since 1940, no dividends have been distributed in any year. Under the current inflationary and constantly changing economic situation, unless fees can be adjusted at any time and foreign exchange can be fully supplied, even the current standards will be difficult to maintain.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The trial of the Chou Lianhuan murder case concluded yesterday in the Criminal Court No. 9 of the District Court, with the verdict scheduled to be announced on the 11th of this month.

### American Ten-Thousand-Ton Cargo Ship Grounded at Wusong Port White Russian Pilot Nearly Caused a Disaster Tugs Were Deployed and the Ship Escaped Danger at High Tide

[Report from Our Newspaper] The ten-thousand-ton "Lookkiut," operated by the American President Lines, was en route from the US to Shanghai when it ran aground at Wusong Port upon entering the port on the afternoon of the 3rd. The ship was being guided by a newly hired White Russian pilot of the customs. The ship ran aground on a breakwater at the intersection of the Yangtze and Huangpu Rivers. At that time, the Hai Lan, a barge belonging to the Water Transport Brigade of the Relief Administration, witnessed the event and immediately sailed over to attempt to tow the ship using cables. However, after four hours of effort, the ship could not be dislodged, and the cables broke. The captain of the "Lookout" planned to wait for high tide to float the ship, but that also failed. He then urgently telegraphed the Water Transport Brigade to dispatch four more barges to assist. They again used cables to tow the ship, but the cables broke again, and the ship slid back, nearly hitting the breakwater, creating a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, the tide had begun to rise, and the ship was able to escape danger by using its engines at full power. The ship then sailed into port under its own power at 7 AM yesterday. The extent of the damage is still under investigation. Regarding the issue of responsibility, the customs department believes that the White Russian pilot had also guided a ship into port the previous day without incident. However, some have pointed out that the White Russian's English is very poor, so the sailors on the ship could not understand his commands.

The exchange matter took place last year, while he took office as chairman in March of this year, so he was not responsible for this matter. As for the 700 pieces of cloth, they were transported from Shanghai to Shantou for sale. Finally, after the defendants Wang Xiangfa and the witnesses testified, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date. Peng Bingcheng was remanded to custody, and the remaining defendants were released on their original bail. He Jiashu (assistant manager of the Postal Remittances Bureau) was ordered to bring the Lida Company's exchange payment date, the procedures for arrival and delivery of goods, and the exchange and delivery dates, as well as the number of parts in which Yuanyang Company applied for exchange, for testimony at the next hearing.

### Verdict of Bai Lu's Death Case Approaching, Jiang Junchao's Eyes Filled with Tears Demanding Compensation of 1.3 Billion Yuan Willing to Donate to Charity Relief Funds

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of the film star Bai Lu (Du Xiaomu) falling to her death was concluded yesterday in the Criminal Court No. 2 of the District Court, presided over by Judge Zhong Xianda, with the verdict scheduled to be announced on the 9th of this month. During yesterday's hearing, the plaintiff, Jiang Junchao, stated that his deceased wife, Du Xiaomu, had come to Shanghai from Hong Kong to film "Children of the Troubled Times" and "Hope in the World." Unexpectedly, she suffered a tragic fall due to the negligence of the elevator management at the International Hotel. He hoped that the defendant would be severely punished and that the International Hotel would be ordered to compensate for all mental and material losses. The plaintiff said he would donate the compensation to charity organizations and would not accept a single cent. After Jiang finished his statement, tears filled his eyes, and he sat alone in sorrow. The defendant, Zhang Xiliang, the elevator operator at the International Hotel, still denied any criminal responsibility. After the foreign manager of the International Hotel, Fugier, and the Chinese manager, Wu Shenyi, testified, the defendant's lawyer began his defense. Then the plaintiff's lawyer read the incidental civil complaint, demanding compensation of 1.2 billion yuan for losses and 193,412,600 yuan for funeral expenses, totaling 1,393,412,600 yuan.

### Huge Checks Dishonored Summoning Importer and Exporter, American Ordered to Provide Written Guarantee of 300 Million Yuan Another Accusation Under Investigation

[Report from Our Newspaper] American Kong Xiangguo, an importer and exporter from Room 302 of the Qufeng Building, was accused of fraud by Mrs. Xu Ruifang, the wife of Spielman, to the District Procuratorate. Yesterday, Prosecutor Gu Ruilin summoned both parties for interrogation. As a result, Kong was ordered to provide a written guarantee of 300 million yuan in legal tender, and Xu was ordered to return. According to the indictment, Kong borrowed 50,000 US dollars from Xu, but failed to repay the loan when it was due. Xu filed a lawsuit with the District Procuratorate, and the prosecutor persuaded the parties to settle. Later, Xu filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the District Court, and the Civil Court ruled against Kong. In addition to repaying the 50,000 US dollars, Kong also had to compensate Xu for losses of 400 million yuan in legal tender and was granted provisional execution.

Kong then issued three checks from the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, dated July 14, for a total of 400 million yuan. The checks were dishonored due to insufficient funds. Xu claimed that his actions constituted issuing bad checks, fraud, and breach of trust, and filed another lawsuit with the District Procuratorate. Kong admitted all of the debts yesterday, but said that the reason the Zhejiang Provincial Bank dishonored the checks was that someone else owed him a sum of money, which he could have used to offset the debt. However, the debt was not recovered by the due date, resulting in insufficient funds, and the checks could not be honored. It is also heard that Kong is also facing another fraud case. In August of last year, he borrowed 6,000 US dollars from Mrs. Suria, a British-Chinese national, promising to repay the principal and interest of 25,000 US dollars by July of this year, and issued a check dated July 23. The check also could not be honored when it was due. Mrs. Suria filed a lawsuit against him with the District Procuratorate for fraud. The investigative court has been held twice, but the case has not yet been closed. This case is being investigated by Prosecutor Zhang Yuanzhen.

### Celebration Held for the Anniversary of the Zhaohe Uprising. Yang Hu Publishes "The Value of the Zhaohe Uprising"

The 3rd Seafarers' Day and the anniversary celebration of the Zhaohe Uprising will be held at the International Grand Theater on Haining Road at 10:00 this morning. Party Director Yang will preside over the celebration ceremony and invite the city's leaders to attend and observe the ceremony. In addition, Mr. Yang, having personally participated in the uprising, has specially published an article entitled "The Value of the Zhaohe Uprising," excerpts of which are as follows:

The Situation Before the Uprising: On December 5th of the fourth year of the Republic, the Zhaohe soldiers launched an uprising in Shanghai. Its revolutionary influence and value are as significant as the Xinhai Huanghua Uprising.

Assassination of Zheng Ruicheng: Yuan Shikai, harboring imperial ambitions, in order to guard against the Party members, appointed Zheng Ruicheng as the Shanghai garrison commander. Zheng, a sinister and treacherous individual, commanded tens of thousands of elite soldiers and controlled naval operations. To plot against Yuan, Zheng had to be eliminated first. Fortunately, comrades Wang Xiaofeng and Wang Mingshan, filled with righteous indignation, were willing to sacrifice themselves for the revolution. On November 10th, Zheng went to the Japanese consulate to celebrate Tencho-setsu (the Emperor's Birthday). Taking the opportunity, gunshots rang out on Waibaidu Bridge, and Zheng died on the spot.

### Bloody Battle on the Huangpu River

The Arduous Preparations for the Uprising: On June 22nd of the third year of the Republic, the Premier, in order to reorganize the revolutionary ranks, concentrated in Shanghai to plot a major undertaking, specially appointing Mr. Chen Qimei as commander-in-chief, and now President Chiang as chief of staff, overseeing everything. Shanghai is surrounded by water on three sides, so it was necessary to control the Huangpu River in order to occupy the land. The initial steps were decided to be taken from the seizing of the Huangpu River fleet. Therefore, I was assigned the responsibility of initiating the action on the water, with land forces responding, entrusted to Wu Zhongxin.

Seizing the Zhaohe Warship: At that time, the naval vessels stationed in Shanghai included the Zhaohe, Yingrui, Tongji, and Haichen warships. The Commander-in-Chief Chiang issued operational orders, assigning me the responsibility of seizing the Zhaohe, while Sun was assigned to seize the Yingrui. Around 4:00 PM on December 5th, I led dozens of comrades, sailing in a motorboat towards the Zhaohe warship. Upon arrival, we quickly climbed aboard, fired our guns to alert the crew, and announced the revolutionary cause. The officers and soldiers on board obeyed our orders. Using flag signals, we directed the Yingrui and Tongji to bombard the Manufacturing Bureau and the eastern and western forts. The bloody curtain of the Zhaohe Uprising was officially raised.

### Defeat of Reinforcements

The Yingrui Failed to Respond in Time: Unexpectedly, the Yingrui, commanded by Sun Xiangfu, was unable to sail out due to the lack of a customs passport. Amidst this hasty hesitation, the ship was intercepted by patrolmen and forced to turn back, losing a golden opportunity.

Failure of Land Reinforcements: The original plan was for the naval forces to initiate the uprising first, with land forces responding. However, due to the Yingrui's failure and the fact that Mr. Chen Qimei's organization at No. 5 Yuyangli, which was in charge of the land uprising, had been breached, the land forces were blocked and attacked by Yuan's troops and completely defeated.

The Lone Warship's Bloody Battle on the Huangpu River: At that time, friendly ships did not respond, the land forces were defeated, and the headquarters had been raided, disrupting communication with all parties. I, on the Zhaohe, knew that there was no hope of success and advocated sailing the Zhaohe out to Wusong. Unexpectedly, Yuan had ordered Sa Zhenbing to heavily bribe the officers and soldiers of the Yingrui and Tongji with 200,000 yuan in cash to encircle and attack the Zhaohe. Comrades on board suffered heavy casualties. Soon, the boiler was hit and exploded. We then ordered the surviving comrades to find a way to escape. I boarded the last lifeboat, reluctantly leaving the warship.

### The Enemy's Courage Lost

Glorious Failure: This reckless uprising failed, but its great and unyielding spirit was victorious. The revolutionary soldiers' resolve to face enemies without fear was a success. Therefore, I say that this failure was a glorious failure.

Yuan Shikai's Courage Lost: Since the second year of the Republic, Yuan Shikai had used military force to eliminate the Party's three military governors and deployed his proteges from the Xiaozhan training camp in strategic locations in order to carry out his imperial ambitions. The Zhaohe Uprising shook the world, followed by anti-Yuan military actions. Within months, Yuan died violently, and the Republic regained its glory. Observers say that the Zhaohe's cannons were like Bolang's hammer. Although they did not hit the target, they caused Yuan to lose courage and indeed had an unexpected effect.

### Inexhaustible Excitement

Cutting Off Yuan Shikai's Diplomacy: The Zhaohe Uprising shattered Yuan Shikai's diplomatic facade, exposed his defiance of public opinion, revealed his military incompetence, and led to a decline in diplomatic credibility, making it impossible to borrow foreign debt.

The Revolutionary Party's Momentum Greatly Boosted: After the Shanghai uprising, anti-Yuan militias rose up everywhere. It can be said that without the Zhaohe Uprising, there would have been no subsequent successful uprising in Yunnan.

This Campaign as Our Lighthouse: The Zhaohe Uprising is now thirty-two years past. The difficulties currently faced by China are many times greater than those in the fourth year of the Republic. But the belief in the Three Principles of the People has taken deep root in the hearts of the people. Even more gratifying is that the Chief of Staff, President Chiang, who commanded the Zhaohe Uprising, is now leading us in suppressing the rebellion, building the nation, and revitalizing the nation. Based on past events, China in the near future is sure to have a solution. As a member of the Zhaohe Uprising, I have no regrets but only excitement after recounting this great and historic event.

### Two Major Swindles Occur in Hong Kong in Two Days

In this dispatch, our reporter analyzes in detail the important factors that led to the recent major swindles in Hong Kong and includes a report on a modern young woman selling counterfeit through-tickets, which is of reference and study value to all sectors. The sudden occurrence of two major swindles within a short span of two days is especially astonishing!

[Special dispatch from Hong Kong on the 1st of the month] The day after Song Ziwen's official visit to Hong Kong, a swindler forged Mr. Song's personal seal and defrauded the Hong Kong branch of Guangdong Provincial Bank of 100,000 Hong Kong dollars. This case was reported in our news report. We now report on the relevant news obtained in the past few days, as follows:

It is said that after the branch authorities reported the case to the police station, both the bank and the police strictly kept it secret. But the news was known to a reporter from the Central News Agency. The Central News Agency did not release the story in Hong Kong. One or two newspapers mistook the Guangdong Provincial Bank for the Guangdong Bank, and one even mistook it for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The fact that the incident occurred at the Guangdong Provincial Bank involves a "psychological factor," which shows that the swindler is indeed a fellow who knows the inside story of the "banking industry" very well. Otherwise, he is at least related to people in this area. In the early days of Song Ziwen's arrival in Guangdong, he once called the Guangdong Provincial Bank in Guangzhou to withdraw 500,000 Hong Kong dollars. The provincial bank authorities were unable to comply because it was inconvenient to raise the money at that time. Soon, the president of the bank, Liu Zuoren, was dismissed. Although it is unknown whether Liu Zuoren's dismissal was really due to "disobedience," this fact has already caused the Hong Kong bank authorities to have a considerable

nervous reaction. This is a very important factor in falling into the swindler's trap. It is heard that the person in charge of the Hong Kong bank had doubts about the actions of the visitor that day. The swindler immediately said: Director Song is at a certain mansion at a certain number. Please call to confirm. The person in charge called and asked about the facts and received a "Yes, Yes" reply. The person in charge then trusted him without doubt. This is the third important factor.

In the past two days, the Hong Kong government has been investigating everywhere. All parties do not want to talk more about this shocking incident, so as not to

cause trouble and harm themselves. The day after this case occurred (Saturday), another major swindle occurred in Hong Kong, with the amount reaching 100,000 Hong Kong dollars. The case is as follows:

The day before yesterday afternoon, a modernly dressed young woman brought US dollar through-tickets to a silver shop for sale, saying that today is Saturday and there is no way to withdraw money, so she is willing to sell them at a lower price. Silver shops are also accustomed to buying and selling through-tickets, so they did not doubt much, but still asked the young woman to find a shop to guarantee it. The woman then took them to a customs broker in Connaught Road Central. A clerk from the shop stamped the tickets, and the two parties traded and left. Later, a silver shop clerk asked someone in the bank and learned that these through-tickets were counterfeit. He immediately went to the customs broker who guaranteed it to question them. It happened that the shop clerk was answering an outside phone call, saying

the matter had been revealed. He was immediately asked to escape. Everyone immediately arrested the clerk and reported the case to the police station.

It is heard that the total amount of money swindled from each silver shop is 100,000 Hong Kong dollars. Among them, the following have reported the case to the police station: Dadao No. 114 Daily bought 5,000 US dollars, and Des Voeux Road Central No. 118 Fa Chang bought 3,000 US dollars.

Whether these two groups of swindlers belong to the same gang is still under investigation. However, Hong Kong society is greatly shocked by the activities of the swindlers! (Special Correspondent from this newspaper, Zijian)

### Traitor Chen Jingping Practices Bombing Techniques in Prison and is Fined 100,000 Yuan

[Special dispatch from Hainan Island on the 2nd of the month] Traitor Chen Jingping was arrested and imprisoned by the Anti-Traitor Association after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War because he served as a staff member of the puppet foreign affairs section during the enemy's occupation of the island. He was sentenced to three years and six months in prison and detained in the Qiongshan County Court Fucheng Prison. Recently, the case was brought back to the Haidun Detention Center because Wang Wu and Lin Yunlan and others were involved in a property dispute over No. 33 Nanmenwai, Haikou City. They held five copies of a winning judgment. Wang Wu had mortgaged the house to Wu Guiyao and sold it to the wife of Wang Haijing. After preparing the redemption price separately, they asked Wang Haijing to return the deed of the house in December of the 33rd year. Wang Haijing had mortgaged the deed to the defendant Chen Jingping. Wang Wu and Wang Haijing asked him to return it. Unexpectedly, Chen Jingping had ulterior motives. He falsely told Wang Wu that the content of the judgment between Wang Wu and the Lin family was how. He had to bring it to him for reading before returning it. Wang Wu believed it to be true and did not suspect him of anything else, so he checked the five copies of the judgment and handed them over for him to read. Unexpectedly, Chen Jingping did not return them. Wang Wu then filed a lawsuit in the High Court of the Third Branch in April last year to demand the return. The High Court ruled that the defendant return the judgment, which was determined on record, and it had been enforced. However, the defendant still did not return it. Wang Wu then filed a private prosecution with the District Court in recent days on the charge of embezzlement, and it was also ruled that Chen Jingping had attempted to obtain unlawful possession for himself and used fraud to make people hand over their own property, and was fined 100,000 yuan. If he performed labor service, it would be calculated at 1,000 yuan per day. It was a good story for a while.

### Sudden Decrease in Overseas Remittances in Xiamen

[Dispatch from Xiamen on the 2nd of the month] According to unofficial statistics from the Bank of China in the city, overseas remittances have decreased by 70% in recent months, and 30% have been remitted to Hong Kong for conversion into US dollars or Hong Kong dollars and brought back to the country. Although the local private remittance agencies could collect 70 million in overseas remittances in the past, the amount has decreased significantly in recent months. Another report: Lieutenant General Wang Lufeng, commander of the Minnan Garrison District, arrived the other day. Yesterday (the 1st), the "Tan-Quan-Xia Winter Defense Headquarters" was officially established at No. 20 Lihua Lane in the city and began operations.

### Retired Military Officer Nie Shilong Commits Suicide by Poison in Suzhou

[Dispatch from Suzhou on the 3rd of the month] Nie Shilong, a retired captain military officer from the fourth squadron of the 12th military officer regiment of the Central Training Corps, a native of Jiangxi Province, graduated from the 17th term of the Military Supplies School. Because he had been unemployed for a long time and had no way to make a living, he committed suicide by drinking iodine in a room at the Sanshing Hotel on the outer Main Street at noon on the 2nd and died.

### "Flying Thief" Cannot Fly. Qin Shijing Directly Admits to Theft. His Life is Miserable and He Deeply Regrets It

[Dispatch from Wuxi on the 3rd of the month] Qin Shijing, a "flying thief," was captured by the flying police at the end of last month. After the police station transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office, he denied that he could "fly," but he admitted to theft. After interrogating him, Prosecutor Zhu Guohua filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court of the same court for theft, as Qin's criminal facts were extremely obvious.

Yesterday afternoon, the reporter met this young "flying thief" at the detention center. According to him, he regretted

taking the wrong road and did not want his 70-year-old maternal grandmother and his 40- or 50-year-old mother to know about his arrest in Wuxi this time, fearing that they would suffer accidents after being stimulated. He said that he was from Luoyang, Henan Province, and was only twenty years old this year. He is short and sturdy. He does not admit that he can fly. He said, "If I could really fly, why not fly into the homes of corrupt officials and steal more gold bars and banknotes tainted with the blood of the people? I can't use them myself, but I can save those who are hungry and cold." He also talked about how his father used to be very rich and opened an opium den, and he himself

smoked opium. Within a few years, all the property was used up. When he was seven years old, his father died of illness. From then on, he moved into his maternal grandmother's house with his mother and sister and made a living by sewing every day. After dropping out of school at the age of eleven, he helped his mother with the money he earned from hard labor. Later, his uncle introduced him to work as a school worker at a nearby vocational school. Soon, the principal changed, and he left the school again. After more than three years, he was introduced by relatives to attend a training class for the Boy Scouts. With the arrival of victory, he joined the 10th War Zone Transport Brigade. Before long, he transferred to the 78th Division Political Department as an orderly.

Good times do not last. The director of the unit was promoted and transferred, so he left the unit. However, encouraged by his self-esteem, he did not want to go home and rely on his old mother. In his hesitation, he thought of his former classmates at the Nanjing Youth Army 202nd Division Automobile Corps, preparing to learn to drive a car to make a living. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Beijing, he could not find his classmates. Asking the police, he said that the troops had already left. If he wanted to go home, the railway was also cut off. Within a few days,

he was starving and cold. Under the demands of life, he drifted into theft. According to him, on the first day he came to Wuxi, he stole in Huaishuxiang. The next day, he went to Wujin and stole the suit of Vice Manager Feng of the Wujin Commercial Bank. He came to Wuxi again and was caught in the Yudechi bathhouse. When he spoke, he looked very pitiful. Although what he said could not be determined to be true or false, it was quite moving. Since he entered the prison, he has also been very docile. Now he is quietly waiting for the verdict of the law.

### Li Wenbin and Others Arrive in Suzhou

[Dispatch from Suzhou on the 4th of the month] Lieutenant General Li Wenbin, deputy commander of the Jiangsu Military Control District, and his party, accompanied by Mei Zhanyi, deputy commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, arrived in Suzhou from Shanghai yesterday. This morning, they inspected the Wuxian County Regiment Management District and listened to the new recruits. In the afternoon, they summoned cadres in Suzhou and held a business review meeting to discuss the shortcomings of this year's conscription work. It is heard that Li's trip is specifically for collecting preparatory materials for next year's conscription.

Another report: The Xihua class barge sailed from Suzhou to Xihua on the afternoon of the 2nd. When passing the river near Yangshan, it encountered a bandit ship. All the passengers on the boat were robbed and no one was spared. The losses were quite large.

Another report: The security force stationed in Nanfangquan, Wuxi, was induced by bandits to rebel. The people were shocked. The Wuxi County Government and the County Council repeatedly telegraphed the Taihu Lake Water Police Bureau, requesting that a team be sent to station there. It is now learned that the bureau has drawn up all the officers and soldiers of the first brigade under its jurisdiction on the 2nd, led by Brigade Commander Pan Bin, and drove to the place by gunboat to take over the defense and be responsible for clearing the banditry.

### Zhou Mingxin Arrives in Suzhou to Collect Grain Tax

[Dispatch from Suzhou on the 4th of the month] The grain tax in this county this year has already begun to be collected. However, of the more than 500,000 stones of grain tax in the entire county, only more than 10,000 stones have been collected so far. The province ordered that 80% be collected by the end of the month. Recently, Zhou Mingjian, deputy director of the Provincial Grain Bureau, arrived in Suzhou to supervise the collection.

### He Guannan is Wanted

[Dispatch from Suzhou on the 4th of the month] He Guannan, prosecutor of the Suzhou High Court, fled without a trace after the victory. Recently, the Suzhou High Prosecutor's Office investigated and found that the crime was true and filed a public prosecution, transferred it to the Criminal Court for trial, and ordered that he be wanted and brought to justice.

### Central Government Purchases Provincial and County Grain Tax at a Higher Price

[Dispatch from Zhenjiang on the 4th of the month] Finance Director Dong Che used to say that the central government's purchase of provincial and county grain tax was too low, only 80,000 yuan per stone, which was too much of a loss to provincial and county finances. He specially met with Director He of the Grain Bureau and Director Shen of the Civil Affairs Bureau to go to Beijing to request an increase. Dong and others have returned to Zhenjiang today. According to reports, the central government has agreed to appropriately increase it to 174,000 yuan per stone.

### No Newspaper in Changzhou. Labor and Management are Still at a Stalemate

[This Newspaper] The town's printing workers demanded an increase in wages, originally at a rice discount, averaging two stones and five dou and five sheng per worker. Later, due to the sharp rise in rice prices, the newspaper was unable to pay. After several agreements, the rice price was frozen at 286,000 yuan per stone. Recently, the price of rice has soared to more than 700,000 yuan per stone. In an extremely difficult situation, the newspaper, in addition to paying four dou and five sheng of food per worker at the market price, paid the remaining two stones and one dou at 70% of the market price. The workers insisted on demanding 90%, and the agreement failed. They suddenly went on strike on the 27th of last month. There have been no newspapers for five days. Although the government agencies have mediated in many ways, there have been no results so far. It is expected that the stalemate will last for another day or two. The problem lies in the economy, and it is difficult to find a solution for a while.

### A Picture of Lamentation in Fuzhou Amidst High Rice Prices

[Dispatch from Fuzhou] In the past week, the price of rice in Fuzhou has soared, rising by one-third, making it difficult for petty citizens and salaried workers to eat. Several things have happened in the Banyan City in recent days due to the high price of rice: A poor family of five knelt on the sidewalk near the Provincial Hospital yesterday, willing to sell their young children to maintain the livelihood of their entire family. Passers-by donated money to help them, but no one was heard to buy their children. A blind man in Nantai threw himself into the river five times and was rescued. According to him, it was impossible to live in the midst of expensive rice and firewood, and he was afraid that he would succeed in committing suicide once. A student carried dozens of catties of rice. On the way, the rice bag leaked. An old woman followed all the way, picking up the leaked rice. Although there were only a few grains, it was still treasured by the poor woman.

### Third Day of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly. Wei Daoming Gives a Policy Report, Emphasizing Refuting Rumors and Exposing Conspiracies

[Dispatch from Taipei on the 4th of the month] On the third day of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, Chairman Wei Daoming gave a general report on policy, emphasizing explaining and defending against criticisms and rumors from the outside world. He made it clear that the rumors about Taiwan from the outside world and the attacks on individuals were by no means accidental. He cited examples, saying: It is said that Chen Yi is a tiger and Wei is a jackal, that the current extortion is more severe than before, that the provincial government is incompetent, that production has stalled, that the people's livelihood is unstable, and that it is even worse than during the 228 Incident. It is also said that Mrs. Wei is doing business and monopolizing the market, and it is also said that there are 100,000 troops stationed in the province, and that there are people starving to death on the streets every day. Taiwan compatriots have separated from the motherland and demanded Japanese rule or trusteeship. Wei said: This kind of rumor is enough to represent general rumors. Whether the jackal is more greedy than the tiger seems to need to be studied by zoologists. As for the rumor that I have indeed committed extortion, I am willing to be punished by law, and if my wife is engaged in business, I am willing to be punished jointly. As for the rumors of production stagnation and 100,000 troops stationed, the senators present are all from various places and should be able to understand it, so there is no need to waste words. Wei insisted on answering rumors factually, but the slander that Taiwan compatriots want to break away from the motherland and be subject to foreign rule should not be taken lightly. Taiwan compatriots are full of revolutionary consciousness. The tragic cries of Taiwan compatriots when the Japanese invaded and the excitement of the restoration are enough to show that the above rumors are intended to slander and are a heartbreaking thing for Taiwan compatriots. Some of these constantly spread rumors are caused by the Communist Party, and some are released by foreign newspapers. Some issues caused during the war must be decided by the Far East Peace Conference. However, Taiwan has already been decided to be returned to China at the Cairo Conference. In theory, it is natural for the lost land to be returned to its original owner. Taiwan was exchanged for the sacrifices of thousands of soldiers and civilians during the Anti-Japanese War, and 6.3 million Taiwan compatriots have also decided to be a province of China. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be a problem when the peace conference with Japan is convened. If there is a problem, it will not only be an event in which 6.3 million Taiwan compatriots are prepared to shed blood, but also an event in which 460 million Chinese compatriots are prepared to shed blood. In this world of anti-aggression and anti-violence, this kind of conspiracy cannot have any effect. We must understand that before the peace treaty is signed, these rumors will become more and more widespread and will appear in various forms. We have already thought about it carefully. If we are not surprised by strange things, then the strange things will defeat themselves, and this conspiracy will not have any effect.

### Outline of Jiangnan University Planned by Mr. Bing Nongshan

[Our Wuxi Correspondent] Mr. Bing Nongshan, a famous biologist in China, is assisting Mr. Rong Desheng this year in founding Jiangnan University. Recently, in the name of the Board of Directors of Jiangnan University, he drafted the following outline: Selection of Talent: The president and department heads must have research achievements in China and have published works in domestic and foreign academic institutions or specialized journals. If such talents are difficult to find, it is better to have vacancies than to accept substandard candidates. If the school can find individuals of both excellent character and scholarship to serve as president and department heads, then like water flowing downwards or fire rising upwards, the professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and students they attract and guide will all be talented and eager to learn. Everything at the school will then naturally be on the right track. A good school ethos and excellent results will follow as a matter of course. Therefore, the recruitment of talent is difficult and must be treated with utmost caution, allowing no compromise. Work Equipment: It is essential to facilitate work for existing excellent personnel. Reference books, machinery, laboratories, workshops, farms, and all necessary equipment should be planned and managed by the president and department heads, aiming for substantial completion by the end of the year. The school will follow the experts' instructions and do its utmost to enrich these resources. Student Enrollment: The school has already recruited first-year students by the thousands, and classes are being conducted following the usual university practice. However, the primary task is to cultivate ambitious young people into accomplished experts. Therefore, the school aims to enroll graduates from universities across the country after one year, allowing them to engage in research under the guidance of professors, absorbing the essence and applying it widely, to become accomplished individuals. Educational Policy: All disciplines, whether in science, engineering, liberal arts, agriculture, etc., should be equally valued to avoid unbalanced development. The school will not only focus on students' academic and skill progress but also dedicate itself to nurturing their character, morality, and physical health. Achievement Awards: The school will award prizes to the president, department heads, and professors after three years, based on their service performance. Those who teach conscientiously but have not engaged in research will receive a Class C award, with salary increases and other incentives. Those who teach conscientiously and have research achievements will receive a Class B award, with even more generous incentives. Those who have significant contributions in addition to teaching and research achievements (such as inventions, discoveries, or important works) will receive a Class A award, with the most generous incentives. If lecturers, teaching assistants, and graduate students demonstrate outstanding performance and show great promise, the school will provide them with scholarships for overseas study, allowing them to study under foreign experts for further development. Service Leave: After serving for a certain number of years, the president, department heads, and professors will be granted one year of leave by the school, with full pay. If they wish to study or conduct research abroad, the school will provide travel expenses. Exchange of Professors: The school will cooperate with domestic and foreign universities to exchange professors, in order to obtain mutual benefits. Visiting Scholars: Professors from domestic and foreign universities who wish to work at our school and are needed by our school will be invited to serve as visiting professors.

### Malaya Chinese Suffers Unprecedented Defeat in Hong Kong: Loses 6-2 to Chinese Selection

[Our Hong Kong Airmail] The Malayan Chinese Soccer Team has come to Hong Kong for the second time, and failed to win a single game in three matches. The first two games ended in a 3-3 draw with the Army Selection and the Western District Staff. On the 29th, they suffered a crushing 6-2 defeat to the Chinese Selection. This defeat was due to the difference in skill. The Malayan Chinese team was simply inferior in skill to the Chinese Selection. The Malayan Chinese Team will fly directly to the Philippines on December 1st and play Hong Kong China Joint Selection in the Philippines on the 7th, then return to Hong Kong together, and then wait in Hong Kong for their return to Malaya.

The Chinese Selection lived up to expectations, breathing a sigh of relief and raising their eyebrows at the Naval Stadium. The 6-2 victory was clear and resounding, overwhelming the visiting team. Walking out of the Bronze Gate, they felt refreshed and happy. Zou, Cao, and Song were absent from the Chinese Selection lineup, and the visiting team also made some adjustments. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

(Chinese Selection)

Yu Qien

Zeng Zhongzhen Hou Rongsheng

Zhang Jinhai Jin Hong Guo Yingqi

Zhu Yongqiang Li Zhaorong Chen Dehui Feng Jingxiang He Yingfen

(Malayan Chinese)

Zhu Zhicheng

Chen Jiawan Zhang Guoxing

Zhu Guangliang Li Yi

Huang Guodong Ye Qingrong Xie Wenliang Xia Liguan Hu Wenxiang Guan Shunde

Hat-Trick

The game began with the Chinese Selection attacking quickly and aggressively. In just one minute, Dehui headed the ball high in a melee, and Zhaorong took advantage of the momentum to jump and score. The Malayan Chinese counterattacked immediately, Shunde took a corner kick, and Xia first hit the post, but Wenxiang's shot failed. In the eighth minute, the Chinese Selection had another chance to penetrate, Jingxiang sent the ball far, Zhaorong caught it, lightly kicked it, and the ball went into the corner, giving the Chinese Selection a 2-0 lead.

After that, the Chinese Selection continued to press forward. Yongqiang once passed the ball into the center, and Jingxiang headed it well, but unfortunately it went wide. The Malayan Chinese also missed an opportunity when Huang Guodong took a kick, the ball was strong, and bounced off the post. In the 30th minute of the melee, Jingxiang and Dehui advanced side by side, in the penalty area, Dehui hooked the ball to the front of the goal, and Jingxiang ran forward and headed it into the net, making it 3-0.

Then, Ye Qingrong flashed in, dribbled past Rongsheng, and took a quick shot at the goal. Qien was careless and did not defend against Wenxiang's attack. The first half ended 3-1.

Two Goals Pulled Back

At the beginning of the second half, Jingxiang passed the ball forward, and Dehui kicked it in, making it 4-1. The Chinese Selection had an absolute advantage. A few minutes later, Jingxiang took a long shot from 20 yards, but Zhicheng managed to push it out.

In the 18th minute, Wenliang and Xia advanced, quickly passing Jin Hong and Zhongling. Qien saw the situation was not good and fell to the ground to save, but it was too late, and Xia gently selected the ball, making it 4-2. At this time, the Malayan Chinese seemed to want to counterattack, but they could not penetrate deeply.

In the last five minutes, Yongqiang got the ball and shot, the ball rolled in from the left corner, making it 5-1. Then, Jingxiang shot hard from 15 yards, Zhicheng blocked it, and "Second Uncle" followed with a left foot shot, the ball went in clearly and crisply, ending the game 6-2.

Inferior Skill

In this game, the visiting team did not relax at all, so their defeat was simply due to inferior skill, and there was nothing to say.

The Chinese Selection's performance was better in the front line than in the defense, and Jingxiang's command was effective. The players of the Malayan Chinese team such as Jiawan and Zhicheng did their best to resist the enemy.

### Authorities Plan to Implement Full Rationing to Stabilize People's Livelihoods, Starting with Shanghai, Nanking, Peiping, Tientsin, and Guangzhou; Sufficient Assurance of Rationed Supplies

[Our Report] According to authoritative sources, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities have begun planning to implement a full rationing system for daily necessities such as rice, flour, cooking oil, sugar, and coal.

The initial plan is to implement rationing in Shanghai, Nanking, Peiping, Tientsin, and Guangzhou first. In Nanking and Shanghai, sugar is already fully rationed. The authorities are now planning to expand the scope of full rationing to include cooking oil and coal. As for rice, the scope of rationing will be gradually expanded based on the supply and inventory of rice.

In Peiping and Tientsin, rationing will begin with flour, cooking oil, and coal. In Guangzhou, rationing will begin with rice and cooking oil. The initial rationing plans for these three cities will focus on public servants, teachers, students, workers, and the poor.

If the implementation of the rationing plans in the above cities goes well, the rationing system will be extended to Qingdao, Wuhan, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou in the future, in order to achieve general stability in the livelihoods of the people in major cities across the country.

The authorities have sufficient assurance of the source of rice for rationing. The main sources are: 1. The first batch of US$30 million in US aid loans, of which US$5 million will be used to purchase medical and health supplies, and the majority of the funds have been used to order 73,000 tons of rice. 2. The second batch of US$60 million in US aid loans is about to be approved. All of these funds will be used to purchase daily necessities for the people and will be shipped to China for distribution. In addition, the authorities will purchase necessary rationed supplies domestically as possible. The price of rationed supplies will be fair and reasonable in order to reduce the economic burden on the people.

The implementation of the rationing plan will be led by the Central Rationing Supervision Committee of the National Economic Commission, and will be implemented in coordination with relevant local governments and organizations such as the Civil Food Allocation Association. The initial plans are currently being gradually deployed, and it is estimated that they will be implemented by January or February of next year at the latest.

Now, this batch of iron sand has been purchased by the British firm Arnhold & Co. The price has been agreed upon, calculated at US$7 per ton according to world market prices, for delivery at the mine on Hainan Island. The contract will be signed by the Resources Commission and the company in the coming days.

### Buyers Cautious, Sentiment Weak: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Consistently Weak

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was subdued due to the finalized unified purchase and sale measures, and strengthened control by the cotton yarn trade, leading to weak sentiment. Buyers were inactive, and the substantial allocation of spinning quotas on alternate days tightened the cash flow of businesses, leading to considerable selling at cut prices. It was also reported that sales in other ports were stagnant, and although some Shanghai yarn firms were taking advantage of the low prices to buy in, their appetite was small. As a result, the final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell to a low of 47.2 million yuan, a further decrease of 200,000 yuan from the previous day. The market for other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 200,000 to 1 million yuan.

Cotton Cloth

At the market's opening, due to tight cash flow, both buyers and sellers were cautious, and Hankou merchants in other ports were selling off their stock, with manufacturers absorbing little. The market lingered in a soft position for a long time. Towards the close, floating positions were hedged, and retail investors took advantage of the low prices to buy in slightly. However, as a result, the prices of 12-pound Dragon Head and other fine cloth grades uniformly fell by 20,000 to 45,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Because of the large allocation of material, Poplin, Four Gentlemen, and Golden Lotus Miu Wu also fell by more than 30,000 to 40,000. Throughout the day, only bleached cloth, dyed cloth, and Prussian cloth were relatively strong, while the underlying trend for other cloths was soft.

Raw Cotton

Yesterday's raw cotton market saw quiet trading. Businesses faced tight cash flow. Buyers were cautious and cooperative, yarn factories did not offer high prices, and sellers were unwilling to sell cheaply, leading to a stalemate in transactions. 160 bales were transacted. The factory delivery price for Kaikai yarn was 4.547 million yuan, with 60 bales transacted. The warehouse delivery price for Huoji was 3.523 million yuan, with 100 bales transacted. Zhoupu seed cotton was at 900,000 yuan.

### Rayon Price Appraisal, Limited Black Market Transactions: Factory-Managed Silk Goods Slightly Increase

The rayon market remained firm yesterday. 120-count 1A Asahi yarn with luster was around 97 million yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, there were buyers at 7 million yuan, and the selling price was 8 million yuan, resulting in prices similar to the previous day. 4A Asahi yarn with luster had transactions at 88 million yuan in the morning. The China Trust Bureau's allocation of rayon to the silk weaving industry is scheduled for payment and delivery next Tuesday and Wednesday, so black market transactions were very quiet.

Factory-Managed

The market saw a slight increase yesterday. C-grade was transacted at 86 million yuan. Special grade, five-load opening goods were traded at 85 million yuan, and special grade Gao Ling load opened at 87 million yuan, a significant increase of 1 million to 2 million yuan compared to the previous day. Dry-spun prices also increased by about 1 million to 2 million yuan.

Silk Goods

The market opened higher and then remained stable in the morning. In the afternoon, pure silk quilt covers were slightly higher by 200,000 yuan compared to the final price of the previous day. Dachang and Huaqiang goods opened as high as 30.07 million yuan in the morning, immediately falling to around 400,000 yuan. Later, due to fluctuations in the stock market and a gradual softening of confidence, the price fell to 30 million yuan by the close. In the afternoon, because both factory silk and the stock market showed improvements, Cheng Gezi [blank space] crepe was still quoted at around 120,000 yuan, while other goods remained stable.

### Japanese Rayon Arrives in Shanghai, China Trust Bureau Expedites Allocation

A batch of rayon, 4,500 cases, from the China Trust Bureau's barter trade with Japan arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is being unloaded. The Bureau is expediting the supplementary allocation procedures for the three countries for November upon the arrival of the rayon. The quota is 12% of the total amount. The silk weaving and ribbon industries in Shanghai have separately applied to the Social Bureau, and the China Trust Bureau will distribute the allocation in the next two days.

### Textile Construction Company's Purchase of Domestic Cotton Stagnates

[Our Report] Since the Textile Construction Company began purchasing this year's domestic cotton, it has received over 490,000 piculs to date. Of these, over 180,000 piculs have already arrived in Shanghai or are on their way. It is reported that the company is currently experiencing a severe shortage of cash and its purchase of domestic cotton is nearly at a standstill.

### Increased Sugar Allocation Price Leads to General Tightening of the Sugar Market

Yesterday's market saw a general tightening due to the Taiwan Sugar Company's increased allocation price and an additional 60,000 yuan. This was heard in the morning, so the public association's [blank space] Liu [blank space] saw tighter prices. Real No. 24 white sugar was at 1.19 million yuan. Thread-single was at 1.18 million yuan, No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was at 1.12 million yuan, and the next grade was at 1.08 million yuan, increases ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Native sugar opened with Shantou Qing at 910,000 to 900,000 yuan, an increase of over 20,000 yuan. Xinghua high-grade white sugar was at 1.156 million yuan, an increase of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Basket-packed Zhuang was at 1.12 million to 1.08 million yuan, Xing red was at 1.045 million yuan, basket-packed was at 980,000 yuan, Hainan red was at 1.02 million yuan, and Diao Qing was up 10,000 yuan to 830,000 yuan. Total transactions were 800 to 900 lots.

### Chinese Stock Market Erratic, Slight Rebound at Closing

The Chinese stock market was still very erratic yesterday, with a growing sense of pessimism. It inevitably experienced further declines in a state of panic. Unexpectedly, when bank traders entered, rumors suddenly arose, covering short positions and becoming enthusiastic, leading to a rebound at the close. The market opened low in the morning due to a heightened sense of instability. Wing On Textile opened at 359 yuan for immediate delivery and 372 yuan for deferred delivery, initially showing slight fatigue. After rising to high prices of 364 yuan for immediate delivery and 378 yuan for deferred delivery, it retreated to 355 yuan and 367 yuan. The off-market interest rate opened at 22.5% and 27%. Near noon, there was a lack of support, and the market gradually fell to low prices of 338 yuan for immediate delivery and 349 yuan for deferred delivery. The noon close was 342 yuan and 353 yuan. The remaining stocks were even more depressed. As a result, compared to the previous close for immediate delivery shares, Wing On Textile, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, American Asiatic, New China, Jingfu, Quanyu, Jinglun, China Silk, and Tungsheng all fell by about 5%, Zhabei Match fell by about 10%, and the rest experienced slight declines. Deferred delivery shares were affected by swap transactions, with American Asiatic remaining flat, Le Hing falling by 5%, New China [blank space] rising slightly, and Wing On Textile, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, and Jingfu falling slightly.

The evening report indicated a comprehensive effort to suppress prices, leading to pessimistic sentiment. After the opening, [blank space] it showed signs of having no support, with immediate delivery falling to 339 yuan and [blank space] deferred delivery to 350 yuan. Bank traders entered deferred delivery, and [blank space] sentiment gradually increased. Rumors of failed loans and large denomination notes also arose, rebounding to 357 yuan and 368 yuan. Subsequently, there were two declines to around 362 yuan and 352 yuan. Finally, with limited intervention from the national banks, covering short positions and new transactions still drove [the market] up to high prices of 360 yuan for immediate delivery and 371 yuan for deferred delivery. It then closed at 357 yuan and 368 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close for immediate delivery shares, New Asia Underwear [blank space] was flat, while American Asiatic, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf, Qinxing, Zhabei, and China United all rose by 5%, and the rest rose slightly. Deferred delivery shares saw Dung Hing and Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf rising by about 5%, and the rest rose slightly. Off-market old stocks, except for bank stocks which declined, remained stable.

Arbitrage transactions saw financial firms still feeling an excess of positions. Initial prices were high, then fell. Premiums paid were 13 to 16%, while premiums received were about 16 to 18.5%. The Wing On Textile premium opened at 13.5 yuan, retreating from 14 yuan to 11.8 yuan, and then closing at 12.5 yuan. American Asiatic fell from 20 yuan to 16 yuan, and Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf retreated from 6.5 yuan to close at 5.5 yuan. New China had many pre-orders, but few transactions on the board.

Fashion Special

### This Year's Fashion

— Xie Binzhu

Sixty years a cycle of fate turns, but women's clothing can be said to change every year, especially in Europe and America. The most significant difference in women's clothing this year is that it is longer than in previous years by one or two inches. The standard calculation is 14 inches from the ground, but some are 12 inches from the ground. Taking the cheongsam as an example, it used to be commonly made at 2 feet 8 inches (i.e., 40 inches), but now it should be made at 3 feet 2 inches (44 inches). Coats are also 44 inches.

According to the past experience of fashion expert Jin Hongxiang's younger brother, Mr. Yixiang, new styles mostly originate in Paris, become popular in England six months later, and generally become widespread in China only after a year. Like this year's new fashion, it was popular in Paris in the spring and only caught on in the United States in the winter.

Jin's eldest son, Tai Zhong, recently returned from a fashion study tour in France, Switzerland, and England. He talked about the styles of coats for this year and next year, which can be used as a reference for ladies and gentlemen who are particular about clothing:

The outline of the coat looks almost exactly like a morning gown or dressing gown. The collar is a small, rounded, narrow, and outward-turned shape. The body is narrow and long rather than wide. Both fitted and straight waistlines are equally popular. Butterfly-shaped (Japanese-style) shoulder pads are outdated. Now, they are made in ordinary sizes, and the shoulder pads are no longer padded up, but only a thin layer. For cuffs, leather coats mostly have lantern sleeves or large turned-up cuffs, while wool coats have medium-sized cuffs. Bulky hand muffs that resemble incense burners are no longer fashionable. Instead, long gloves and handbags are used, which not only show off your figure but also make you look more energetic.

Beautiful Parisian ladies also like to nail fox fur around the hem of the coat or on the collar and cuffs, almost the same as they wore thirty years ago.

As for colors, the most popular are yellow and green. The trend for next year will be a brown with some red in it. Speaking of cheongsam styles, ordinary tailors are making butterfly sleeves with large shoulder pads and very small cuffs. When spread open, they look like a flying butterfly. The front flaps can be opened on the shoulder or in a straight line below the collar. Short sleeves only go down from the shoulder pads, halfway to the elbow, and there are also medium sleeves (i.e., three-quarter length). However, according to the person in charge of Mme. Greenhouse, their long-sleeved clothes are made with tailored sleeves (i.e., sleeves attached to the shoulders), small cuffs, and no openings on the shoulders. The shoulder pads are slightly padded, and there is not much sewing on the chest, because this is more elegant and can be decorated with ornaments or flowers. If the front flap is opened, the exposed stitching is not beautiful, and if the material is loose, the fur will be exposed. Short sleeves can be short to the shoulders or connected to a length of nine inches. Medium sleeves are not popular. Of course, high collars are popular now, but this depends on the height of each person's neck. For evening dresses, the most common, generous, and timeless fabric is velvet, and it is fashionable to attach gold and silver sequins to the clothes.

Finally, I want to mention how this year's new Parisian fashion is doing in the United States: According to reporters from American magazines, these clothes, which are longer than in previous years, are gradually becoming popular in the United States, but their development is not widespread. Why is this? Because new fashions in the United States start from Hollywood movies. In general, fashionable ladies copy a new dress after seeing it in a new movie. Then, do Hollywood filmmakers dislike this new style? That's not true. The problem is that if filmmakers immediately change the clothes in their new movies to be longer, then old movies shot before 1947 will become antiques, and their sales will be greatly affected, which will affect their income.

### International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union

Sewing may be the oldest profession in the world, but it has always been within the scope of household handicrafts. The rise of large-scale garment manufacturing is only a matter of recent decades. In the late nineteenth century, the invention of the sewing machine led the sewing industry onto the path of industrialization. Later, the invention of power machines and cutting blades laid the foundation for the sewing industry. With the advancement of machinery, the sewing industry gradually expanded. Today, all kinds of clothes can be sewn by machine.

In the early twentieth century, people from Eastern Europe and Russia moved to the New World, causing wages to fall in the United States and working hours to become irregular. The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was born under these circumstances. It is an organization of women's clothing workers in the United States (manufacturing), and all those engaged in shawls, bathrobes, aprons, raincoats, uniforms, and other forms of women's clothing are members, with a total of 400,000 people, three-quarters of whom are women. It is called the "International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union" because many of its members are Jewish, Italian, Chinese, Polish, and Czech. New York is the fashion center of the United States, and workers there account for more than 70% of the total.

Since its establishment, the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union has made great progress after decades of struggle. In 1909 and 1910, there were two strikes by shirt and coat workers in New York, but the labor side did not win. From 1910 to 1926, the union gradually gained a reputation for fighting for better wages and working hours for its members, but its strength was reduced due to internal disputes. It was not until Dubinsky was elected president of the union in 1932 that it gradually raised its head again.

In 1934, the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and the United Mine Workers joined hands to form the Congress of Industrial Organizations. It replaced the previous Committee for Industrial Organization and united workers in the industrial sector to engage in various craft worker organizations. It was not until the Congress of Industrial Organizations competed with the American Federation of Labor in 1938 and withdrew as an independent organization that it rejoined the American Federation of Labor.

The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union is not just an ordinary trade union, but a welfare organization for workers. It is not only a negotiating agency, but also a center for guiding workers' lives. It has established many health, education, culture, and entertainment undertakings to help solve the difficulties in workers' lives and relieve their mental boredom. (Our Newspaper Data Room)

### The Price of Beauty

— Yue

In the world, past and present, China and abroad, women pay attention to makeup, as if it is a matter of course. From hair to toes, they have to add a lot of decoration. Clothes, shoes and socks, rouge, and lipstick are all tools to beautify them. It is said that women spend one-seventh of their lives in front of the mirror, which shows how much attention they pay to their beauty! Originally, a beautiful woman can often make people miss her, just like a great hero who will never be forgotten. Xi Shi, Wang Zhaojun, Diao Chan, and Yang Guifei have all died for thousands of years, but they are still being discussed. But some people want to ask, how much is beauty worth?

In the United States, the cost of women's cosmetics in a year has exceeded 500 million yuan. 20 million lipsticks are sold in a year, and the number of powder and cold boxes are in the range of 60 to 70 million yuan. As for clothing, leather goods, silk stockings, leather shoes, and precious ornaments, the number is even more difficult to calculate. This is only the consumption of the United States alone, although it is the richest and most luxurious. But in big cities such as Paris, London, and Shanghai, the money spent by women to increase their beauty is also not a small amount.

But on the other hand, makeup can also be exchanged for an intangible gain. Women's makeup is not only to please the opposite sex, but also has a great effect. Here is a very interesting example: During the war, in order to save money, the United Kingdom restricted the production of cosmetics to 25% of that before the war. As a result, according to the British War Production Bureau, people's emotions were greatly depressed, and the productivity of wartime industry gradually declined. Later, cosmetic stations were set up in various factories, and production records rose again. The effect of makeup is so remarkable, it is unexpected. So the output of cosmetics was increased to half of that before the war, and it was stipulated that female workers in military factories should be able to reapply their makeup, and the government even supplied them with some cosmetics. As for the psychiatrist Karl S. Tum, he also said: Women's makeup is a "necessary unnecessary." Women hope to maintain their hobbies, especially not forgetting the attention of the opposite sex. Decoration is to attract the attention of the opposite sex. This is the instinct of the animal kingdom, and human beings cannot eliminate it. If women do not apply makeup, human feelings will be greatly hit. Completely prohibiting women from using lipstick and rouge seems to hinder their daily habits and will produce a comprehensive sense of anxiety.

LaGuardia's secretary, Loni, said: "The money spent on women's frugality is enough to buy how many green vegetables!" How much is beauty worth after all? This is difficult to answer. A man-made rubber engineer said well, "Women's makeup is essential. We men spend more money on cigarettes and cigars, but the results are not as moving as women's makeup." That's right, but we shouldn't advocate extravagant consumption. We hope that women will still not forget to save when they put on makeup.

### Research on Japan

— Mei Bai

We should study Japan, that is certainly without doubt. If Japan is fortunate enough to become a democratic and friendly country in the future, then China and Japan, located next to each other, can naturally cooperate. In the unlikely event that Japan sings the old tune of "Hakkō ichiu" again, and its imperialist ambitions are revived, then the first goal it wants to seize is still China, and we must prepare for it even more.

The question is: How can we study Japan effectively? How can we train excellent cadres for work related to Japan?

I think the most appropriate method is probably the method that the Japanese themselves adopted in the past. Everyone who has lived in the occupied areas knows that many of the Japanese in China are proficient in Chinese language and characters. The most terrifying plainclothes Japanese military police can make you hardly recognize that they are Japanese—there are also many such people in the diplomatic and cultural fields. Their invasion of China was indeed premeditated for a long time, but the preparations they made are really worth emulating.

The best cadres for work related to China trained by the Japanese were mostly from the Tōa Dōbun Shoin—then why don't we also go to Japan as soon as possible to run a school equivalent to the Tōa Dōbun Shoin? It is said that most of the students at Tōa Dōbun were funded by the government, and they were separately recommended by counties and cities across the country. The screening was extremely strict, and the students' level was extremely high. We can also carefully select pure and good young people (especially the children of anti-Japanese soldiers) from various provinces and cities, and have our country's first-class experts on Japanese issues give them strict and extensive training—and the training location should be in Japan. On the one hand, it can be easier to improve when learning the language, and on the other hand, there can be opportunities to travel to various parts of Japan in a planned manner. Students should have the opportunity to participate in internships and conduct investigations in various departments of Japanese government agencies. The most important point is that this school must have sufficient funding and must not be run carelessly and simply; as long as such a school is run well enough, even if it costs more money, it will definitely not be a waste.

### Starting with "Flying Thieves"

— Jing Wen

A "flying thief" appeared in the urban and rural areas of Wuxi. The newspaper said that he possessed a "flying over eaves and walls" stunt, but after looking at the "performance" photos of climbing common wooden poles after he was caught, I felt that any naughty child could do such a "stunt." Why would this "flying thief" bother to perform it?

Of course, "flying thief" is just a figure of speech. Apart from flying in an airplane, there are still no people who can fly. But because of this incident, it reminds people of some other issues.

Not long ago, didn't Shanghai also have some sensational cases such as "Four Famous Mountains," "Five Tiger Generals," as well as "Train Robbers" and "Double-Gun Carjacking Robbers"? Every time I read such news, I always think of characters in books like "Jianghu Knight Biographies" or "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights," as well as Western scenes in American movies.

In Chinese Jianghu society, it is very common to add a nickname on top of the real name or translated name. For example, many suspects in the "Qiu Lianhuan Assassination Case," which has not yet ended, almost all have a nickname that is "appropriate for the person." Moreover, this situation is not limited to China. For example, the late American gangster Al Capone used "Scarface" as his name trademark, just as names like "Hercules," "Rotten Foot," and "Scabby Head" became the English names of Shanghai road heroes.

However, elegant names such as "Rotten Foot" and "Scabby Head" are nothing more than derived from personal physiological characteristics, and are just nicknames made by these people teasing each other, and do not have any other meaning.

But names like "Four Famous Mountains," "Five Tiger Generals," and "Flying Thief" are different: These names are obviously not taken by the gang of thieves themselves, because now is not the era of Liangshan Marsh. Thieves may have their own organizations, but it is difficult to believe that they are grandly crowned with some names. In particular, terms such as "Train Robber" and "Two-Gun General" are even more obviously the product of certain people's concoctions. It is the consciousness of the Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights and Hollywood movie stories that is playing tricks in the minds of some people.

Turning news into an episodic story may be a worthwhile attempt, but it is valuable to take the concise and smooth style of the episodic story, rather than inheriting the feudal consciousness of the episodic story. Because no matter how "chivalrous" the thieves are, it is not good for social order to publicize them too much.

Finally, I must add that this type of news may have been written or said in this way by the initial publishing agency, but the essence of the problem is still the same.

### On Women and Art

— Wen Song

If there were no women in the world, there would be no art. This is a simple and obvious truth, understood and acknowledged by everyone. Take literature, for example. Dante's Beatrice is, of course, a well-known figure. Perhaps one day we will forget Dante's "Divine Comedy," but we will never erase the love story of this great poet. Napoleon's iron cavalry swept across Europe, seemingly invincible, but people may, thousands of years later, with increased intelligence, regard Napoleon as nothing more than a madman—but those hundreds of letters to Josephine will still be indelible, right? Furthermore, who pays attention to a reclusive French monk from the Middle Ages? Yet, the love letters that Abelard wrote to Heloise are beloved by every young reader.

Aren't Chinese literati the same? Without women, how could we have such beautiful lines as "Her body has no colorful phoenix wings to fly with, but our hearts have the magic touch of mutual understanding"—Li Yishan would not have become Li Yishan! What about Liu Yong? Zhou Meicheng? Wang Binfu? ...

It's not just literature! Aren't the romances of musicians the most charming? If Schubert hadn't experienced a poignant and sorrowful passion, would he have written such heart-wrenching elegies! Rodin's sculptures, Rembrandt's paintings, even Hollywood movies! Where does all that inspiration come from?

Doesn't Kouchuan Baicun's literary theory use "the symbolism of suffering" as a metaphor for all art? And who is better at creating suffering than young ladies!

What about Freud's "psychoanalysis"? He says that all art is motivated by desire!

The Greeks used young and beautiful goddesses, the Muses, as goddesses of arts and literature. There is good reason for that.

### On Righteousness and Perversity

— Xuan Xuan

Huang Zhongze's poem says: "Making poetry lacking the atmosphere of Youyan, so creating the image of galloping horses in icy skies." The "atmosphere of Youyan" that Huang Zhongze yearned for is actually just the perverse spirit of heaven and earth, not righteousness. Heroic and tragic songs are merely a stylistic option; to say that poetry must be heroic and tragic is to create an atmosphere of killing, and what kind of society would that create?

The traditional "hero" is also just a manifestation of perversity. Calling him a "hero" is not because he kills people like flies, but because his conscience is particularly bad. The righteousness of heaven and earth should be the ordinary people, not exploited, nor exploiting others. Even officials can express the righteousness of heaven and earth, as long as they are not corrupt; but when the official salary is only enough to feed a crane, they must necessarily embezzle. As for official income that is less than that of a rickshaw puller, even if there is corruption, it cannot be regarded as being influenced by perversity.

After all that talk, it seems that righteousness and perversity are still not clear. In fact, what I mean is that people are all pretty much the same, with only small differences, not great ones. Heroes and thieves are not normal, and we only want a few of them. The differences between people should be reduced, and people should achieve relative equality. This is a normal society, and also an ideal society, but historical societies are still far from it. In short, the righteousness of heaven and earth is "moderation and peace."

In fact, democracy means this: that everyone is not too far apart. Only when everyone is not too far apart can the value of people be revealed, and only then is human life precious. Otherwise, worshipping heroes on one hand, while being indifferent to the plight of the lowly, violates the principle of moderation and peace.

Chinese people claim to uphold the doctrine of the Mean, but in fact, there are many extremes: they like to hear about people's faults and do not like to praise people's virtues, this is one. On one hand, they worship Wen Tianxiang, and on the other hand, they regret not being able to follow Wei Zhongxian's coattails, this is two. Losing money gambling, they vow to quit gambling, but winning money, they proclaim everywhere that people should have leisure time after work, this is three. All of these are not normal principles, and are what is called perversity.

It seems that Zhang Shanlai said: Spring is the righteousness of heaven and earth, autumn is a different tune of heaven and earth. There should be very little righteousness, and even less of a different tune. Just as articles full of pornography are ultimately not good works, novels that focus solely on slogans and catchphrases cannot really be called novels.

### Defending the Ancients from False Accusations

— Xu Xilu

The Misunderstanding of Lan Caihe

According to the biography of Chen Tao in the "Southern Tang Book," Chen Tao collected dozens of kinds of herbs from Xishan, and consumed them. During the Kai Bao period, he once saw an old man with horned hair and wearing sackcloth, and an old woman selling herbs in the market. They bought fresh food with the money they earned, and drank together, oblivious to others. When drunk, they danced and sang: "Lan Caihe, Lan Caihe, the world is full of many troubles, how can it compare to selling medicine and drinking wine, returning to the deep mountains to sing and clap hands." Some suspected that they were Tao's couple. According to this biography, the Lan Caihe in the folk paintings of the Eight Immortals is not a person's name, but a misreading of "禾" (he) as "和" (he), and "籃" (lan) as "藍" (lan).

The Death of Li Bai

Li Bai was born in Qingyun Township, Changming County, Shu. Changming is also Zhangming. He studied in Kuangshan, south of the county. Deng Gu's poem sending people to Shu says: "Snow falls in Wenjun's wine-selling market, clouds hide Li Bai's reading mountain." According to the records of Li Bai, he died in Caishi. Even when he was ill, he entrusted poems to his friends. The story of grasping the moon is a misunderstanding.

Xi Shi Was from Xiaoshan

The "Book of the Later Han Dynasty: Records of Commanderies and States" says: "The 'Yue Jue Shu' says: 'Xiaoshan is where Xi Shi came from.'" This is the original text of "Yue Jue Shu," which is credible. Also, the "Xi He Shi Hua" says: "Today, Xiaoshan has a Zhumiao Village, and the village has Zhumiao Mountain. In front of the mountain is the Xi Shi Altar, which proves that Xi Shi came from Xiaoshan." According to legend, the Xi Shi Temple is very sacred. The pink stone in front of the temple is said to be the place where she washed silk. A student from Xi Shi's hometown wrote a poem on the wall, saying: "The pink stone by the stream, is covered with fallen flowers every year. The smoke and water of the Five Lakes are vast, where is spring to be found?" When the educational commissioner inspected Yue, he dreamed of a beautiful woman who claimed to be Xi Shi, and said that she unfortunately entered Wu, but did not have the incident of floating on the lake. The student from Xiaoshan was speaking nonsense and should be dismissed. When the commissioner called the student's name on the day of the examination, the student recited the poem, repented, and the commissioner ordered him to go to the temple to apologize.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shengyan

Chapter 1: Joyfully Finding a Soulmate (5)

The young lady saw that Mr. Zhu Zhai was looking at her, and stood there smiling without leaving. Zhu Zhai patted a small chair beside him and said, "Please sit down!" The young lady shook her head and remained standing. Zhu Zhai then casually asked, "Where is Boss Gu going?" The young lady said, "To Director Lin's house." Zhu Zhai asked, "Which Director Lin?" The young lady said, "Don't you know him? Short, with a dark face, some pockmarks, and a pair of triangular eyes that stare at people, it's so annoying." Zhu Zhai said, "According to what you say, he doesn't look very good!" The young lady said, "Not only is he not good-looking, but he's also very ugly." Zhu Zhai asked, "Why does Boss Gu consider him a friend?" The young lady said, "I don't know, maybe the boss has his own reasons." Zhu Zhai asked, "Does Director Lin come here often?" The young lady said, "No, our boss often goes to his house." Zhu Zhai asked, "Boss Gu often goes to his house?" The young lady nodded and said, "Yes, that house can also be said to be our boss's house." Zhu Zhai didn't say a word after hearing this. The young lady smiled and said, "Mr. Xu, don't you like to hear that?" Zhu Zhai forced a smile and said, "I don't mind hearing it!" Just as the young lady was about to speak, she heard the sound of a car horn outside the door. She didn't have time to say anything more and hurried out. After a while, she heard Qihuan's voice, seeming to ask if Mr. Xu had arrived. Zhu Zhai was very happy when he heard this inside, knowing that Qihuan was paying attention to him.

In the blink of an eye, Qihuan walked into the room. Zhu Zhai hurriedly stood up and greeted her, saying, "You're back? Am I bothering you by coming here?" Qihuan, while taking off her coat, complained to the young lady, "Why don't you even bring out cigarettes! Quickly, bring me my cigarettes." Just as the young lady was about to go out, Zhu Zhai stopped her and said, "I don't smoke." Qihuan said, "Mr. Xu doesn't even smoke? Wang Ma, go get some snacks." Before Zhu Zhai could stop her again, Wang Ma had already left. Qihuan smiled at Zhu Zhai and said, "I heard Mr. Xu's broadcast on the radio just now, you sang really well!" Zhu Zhai said, "I'm very ashamed, please don't laugh at me. If there's anything wrong, I hope you can point it out." Qihuan thought for a moment, shook her head, and said, "The play 'Yutangchun' is a highlight. I also learned it recently from Master Zhu Lanfen, who explained the play to me, and then I consulted Mr. Xu Guifang. Your singing is completely in the Mei style, but what I learned is slightly different in a few places. Like when you sing, 'The warbling of the oriole moves the neighbors and the local constable, so they dragged and pulled her to the government office.' The phrase 'dragged and pulled' is sung in a small tune, with a double sound. That's how Master Zhu and Mr. Xu taught me. When you sang 'dragged and pulled,' you added the four words 'pulled and dragged,' singing it repeatedly, which is very clever, but I'm not sure if the Mei style sings it that way. I'll ask Master Zhu tomorrow and tell you." Zhu Zhai said, "I'm just singing randomly, there's no question of Mei style. I think everything is lacking. I'm very grateful for your guidance today, and I hope you won't be polite. Please tell me all my mistakes." Qihuan said, "If I were polite with you, I wouldn't dare to speak frankly. I think you're very honest, and I'm straightforward, so I dare to say whatever comes to mind, so that we can study it together." Zhu Zhai said, "Boss Gu thinks so highly of me, I consider you my soulmate. I'm being very presumptuous, but I hope Boss Gu can tell me all about your hard work and how you were able to achieve today's accomplishments, so that I can learn from you." Qihuan said, "Speaking of my process of learning opera, there have been many twists and turns. I'm still far from success today, and it can be said that the initial goal has not been achieved at all!" As she said this, she seemed to have endless emotions. Just as Zhu Zhai was about to ask further, he suddenly saw the door move slightly, and the young lady stepped in, and whispered to Qihuan, "Director Lin is on the phone." Qihuan frowned slightly and followed the young lady out. (End of this chapter)

### Rat Pit

— Er Bi

Recently, Shanghai screened a movie based on the life of the violin virtuoso Paganini, called "The Magic Bow." The English title is "Magic Bow," and it was adapted from the novel by Manuel Komroff. As far as I know, Komroff was originally a White Russian who later became an American citizen, and has become one of the famous contemporary novelists—although he doesn't seem to have gained the favor of academics. He visited China, probably lived in Harbin for quite some time, and his historical novels have one characteristic: they are particularly dramatic and quite well-researched.

Recently, I read another of his non-fiction novels, "Human Tempest," which is about the situation in New York in 1835.

At that time, New York had many small bars, and most of the people who drank there were outlaws who had no fear of the law. They often drew knives and stabbed each other at the slightest disagreement. In one of the bars with the worst reputation, there was a special "entertainment" added. They dug a shallow pit two or three feet deep in the ground, about twenty feet long and wide, slightly rectangular. Ropes were tied around it, and the guests sat outside drinking liquor. The four sides of the pit were covered with galvanized iron sheets, and the inside was filled with old clothes and garbage. The owner hired many children to search the whole city for rats, buying them by the basket. After buying them, they poured them into the pit.

Above was a dimly lit oil lamp, but inside the pit were thousands of rats scurrying around in the stinking garbage, and the sound on the surrounding galvanized iron sheets was like a rainstorm!

Then, the owner caught an extremely ferocious hunting dog and threw it into the pit. The hunting dog cruelly killed the rats slowly, and then the dead rats disappeared in a moment, because they had been snatched away by the live rats and eaten clean!

There were also many white bones piled up in the pit, because this was the best place to destroy evidence – if you threw someone who was half-dead into it, in less than half an hour, only a pure white skeleton would be left!

Jiang Donglin Seeks His Son Editor: My son, Xinde (male, 17 years old), was studying garment making at the Hongyi Fashion Company on Lin Sen Middle Road. He suddenly ran away in anger on the 13th of this month, and there has been no news of him since, and his fate is unknown. The boy has a long face, a slightly dark complexion, slightly protruding eyes, and a slightly pointed mouth. He is wearing thin clothes and is unable to withstand the cold. I am very anxious to find my son and eagerly hope that he will return. If any kind person knows his whereabouts, please notify me. I am extremely grateful! With respectful greetings. From Jiang Donglin, Kitchen Room, Xuhui Middle School, Xujiahui, Shanghai.
