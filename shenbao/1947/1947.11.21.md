[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Approximately 250 million voters in the Republic of China will, from the 21st to the 23rd, cast their ballots at polling stations in various electoral districts across the country, freely choosing representatives to the National Assembly. All 47 provinces and cities, as well as the 18 leagues and banners of Mongolia and the electoral districts of Tibet, along with various domestic professional organizations, will hold elections as scheduled. This marks the beginning of a truly universal suffrage in our country and the first time that voters nationwide will exercise their sacred right to vote, thereby laying the foundation for the nation's democratic constitutionalism.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the preparatory work for the National Assembly, this reporter recently interviewed Interior Minister Zhang Lisheng, who stated that the establishment of the National Assembly Preparatory Office is still awaiting an official order from the National Government. As for the expenses for the preparatory work and the National Assembly period, the budget has not yet been approved. Zhang continued, saying that in the work he is overseeing, such as the renovation of the assembly hall under the Ministry of Interior and the public announcement of the list of candidates under the Election Headquarters, everything has been completed as scheduled, which is quite gratifying. This reporter then asked him to comment on the opening of the National Assembly election on the 21st, but Zhang only smiled and did not answer.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The voting for National Assembly representatives, which marks the beginning of democratic politics, will commence on the 21st.

Xu told reporters today that the list proposed by the party contains 100 names, which is the result of negotiations between Zhang Junmai and President Chiang. However, other members of the Democratic Socialist Party claim that they still insist on the same number of 120 as requested by the Youth Party, which was a promise made by the Kuomintang.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Kuomintang's list of Legislative Yuan candidates has been largely reviewed and completed today.

It is merely reiterating the proposal made by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie in New York this fall and putting it on formal record.

### Country Divided into Four Air Defense Zones; Communist Bandits in North China Have Secret Airfields

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] The country's air defense situation is divided into four zones. The capital zone includes Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Henan, with Zhang Zhen as commander-in-chief and Chen Du as deputy. The Beiping zone includes Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Hebei, with Li Zongren as commander-in-chief and Hu Bohan as deputy. The Lanzhou zone includes Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, with Zhang Zhizhong as commander-in-chief and Gu Huixin as deputy. The Northeast zone includes the nine provinces of the Northeast, with Chen Cheng as commander-in-chief and He Kui as deputy. Also, the Ministry of National Defense's Air Defense School has decided to move from Guizhou to Huangsi on the outskirts of Beiping and is currently en route. Classes are expected to begin next spring.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] Hu Bohan, former deputy commander of air defense in Chongqing, who was known for using red balls to assist in alarms during the Anti-Japanese War, is now the deputy commander of air defense in the Beiping zone, in charge of air defense in North China. On the eve of Air Defense Day, Hu told reporters that the Communist bandits in North China currently possess many secret airfields, but they are all used for the travel of important figures and for communication and liaison, and have not been used for combat. Although the air defense intelligence network in North China has not yet been widely established, it is barely sufficient. If radar is used in the future, this artificial intelligence network will become secondary. He warned that urban and industrial construction should take air defense into account, saying that a 4,000-pound bomb could turn the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant into ruins. Therefore, efforts should be made to disperse construction. He could not forget the air raid shelters in Chongqing, saying that they should be used to open small teahouses, which would be both a waste of talent and a benefit to the country.

Editorial

### A Proposal Harmonizing U.S. and Soviet Views

To break the deadlock between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, our government specifically sent notes to the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union on the 17th, proposing the following suggestions regarding the convening of a preparatory meeting for a peace treaty with Japan: 1. A preparatory meeting for a peace treaty with Japan should be composed of member states of the Far Eastern Commission. The date for the meeting should be agreed upon by China, Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union as soon as possible, in order to draft a peace treaty and discuss matters related to the convening of the final peace conference. 2. Voting at the meeting should be by a majority of all member states of the meeting. The previous requirement of a two-thirds majority will now be a simple majority, but this majority must include the affirmative votes of China, Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union. This proposal has been announced by the Information Office of the Executive Yuan, and the U.S. State Department is also studying it. It is clear that the proposal of our government is to reconcile the views of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Therefore, in the sense of respecting the views of the U.S. and the Soviet Union and respecting the status of the other eight countries, this proposal is a reasonable and constructive plan worthy of the attention of the Allied countries.

Concluding a peace treaty is a necessary step for belligerent countries to restore peaceful relations. Historically, every international war has been followed by the conclusion of a peace treaty, with very few exceptions. More than two years have passed since the end of World War II, but peace treaties with Germany and Japan have not yet been concluded. The victorious countries feel the urgent need for peace treaties, and the defeated countries feel even more fearful without them. Therefore, whether it is a peace treaty with Germany or a peace treaty with Japan, the victorious countries should negotiate as soon as possible. In principle, this must be done, and there should not be major problems. The only questions are how to conclude it, where to conclude it, and which countries should be the main participants. On these issues, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have divergent opinions, and even deviate from the decisions of the Potsdam Conference and the Moscow Conference, which shows that the minority does not respect the majority, and power politics does not respect public will. For the sake of obtaining the fruits of the war and for the sake of establishing world peace in the future, this is a great misfortune for the victorious countries.

Our country has always consistently hoped that negotiations for a peace treaty with Japan will begin as soon as possible and that it will be concluded as soon as possible. The peace treaty with Japan is the final chapter of our War of Resistance, and it has a great bearing on our country and the peace of the Far East. We should express any reasonable wishes. In August of this year, the United States proposed convening a preliminary peace conference, and our country responded with a welcoming attitude. However, the U.S. and the Soviet Union had disputes over procedural issues and veto power, which almost led to a deadlock. Our country took a detached stance and reconciled the views of both sides. Our country even issued a warning that it would not participate in a peace conference with Japan without the Soviet Union. Our country cherishes the achievements of the eleven Far Eastern countries in the war against Japan, and also places expectations on the Far Eastern Commission to complete its final mission. Based on this sentiment and the stance of respecting the public, our government put forward a new plan on the 17th of this month. Although the content of this plan is a compromise of the views of the U.S. and the Soviet Union and a reconciliation of the two major differences, its open and aboveboard attitude should be valued by the Allied countries. Our public opinion circles agree with this proposal and are willing to explain its significance as follows:

First, our country advocates that the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan should be composed of all member states of the Far Eastern Commission, which is close to the U.S. proposal to convene a preliminary peace conference of the eleven Far Eastern countries against Japan. According to the organization of the Far Eastern Commission, it is based on the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, "to fulfill the will of the Potsdam Declaration, implement the terms of surrender, and establish international security and stability." Any decision of the Far Eastern Commission must be agreed upon by all eleven countries. The peace treaty with Japan is the final chapter of the war against Japan and also the final chapter of the Far Eastern Commission. Therefore, it is beyond doubt that the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty should be composed of member states of the Far Eastern Commission and complete matters related to the formal peace conference. However, the date, location, and content of the peace conference will be decided by China, Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union. This is close to the Soviet Union's proposal that the peace treaty with Japan should be decided by the four powers.

Second, regarding the voting system of the peace conference, the United States focuses on striving for a "majority," while the Soviet Union focuses on maintaining its "veto power." The British Canberra Conference also expressed its support for the two-thirds voting system. Our country advocates that voting should be by a simple majority, but the majority must include the affirmative votes of China, Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union, which is tantamount to supporting the Soviet Union's proposal to maintain its veto power.

In short, the peace treaty with Japan should be completed as soon as possible, and the peace conference with Japan should not be delayed any longer. This time, the proposal of our government has, in principle, strived for diplomatic initiative. Now that the proposal has been put forward, we should seize the opportunity, work hard to implement it, and promote its realization. In terms of timing, this proposal is suitable to be put forward during the London Four Foreign Ministers Conference, which shows that although the procedural issue of the peace treaty with Japan has fallen into a deadlock, there is still a way to go. China's proposal is conciliatory and should be used as a diplomatic compromise plan between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. If the U.S. and the Soviet Union are willing to be tolerant and seek a compromise, then our country's proposal is undoubtedly a constructive plan. We hope that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will calmly consider this and take immediate action for the success of concluding a peace treaty with Japan!

All factories and households in Shanghai and other ports engaged in the cotton yarn re-manufacturing industry shall register in accordance with regulations and shall be responsible for investigation and verification by the respective trade associations to ensure accuracy. The committee may also send personnel to conduct spot checks at any time. The respective trade associations of the cotton yarn re-manufacturing industry in Shanghai and other ports shall, according to the equipment and yarn demand of their member factories and households, negotiate and stipulate the minimum amount of cotton yarn to be allocated to each factory and household each month, prepare a list of yarn allocations, and submit it to the committee for distribution to the six-district association and the China Textile Corporation as the basis for distributing cotton yarn.

### Measures for Improving Grain Storage, Transportation, Sales, and Distribution

(Our newspaper Nanjing 20th dispatch) The measures for improving grain storage, transportation, sales, and distribution drafted by the Ministry of Food to enrich the grain supply in Shanghai have been approved by the Full Economic Committee on the 20th. These measures are based on the investigation report of Liu Zhendong, a member of the Full Economic Committee, after his visit to Shanghai. The key points are as follows: Regarding transportation, the Ministry of Communications shall issue an order to its subordinate water and land transportation agencies to give priority to the loading and transportation of rice and grain and reduce transportation costs. It is also proposed to request the National Government to issue an order to the provincial and municipal governments and local military and police units to provide practical assistance to the transportation and sales of grain that comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Food. Grain merchants purchasing and transporting civilian food can apply for remittance and deposit funds in accordance with the principles of grain deposit and remittance loans and the provisions of their implementation measures. The Shanghai Municipal Government should request Shanghai grain merchants to manage them in accordance with the regulations on grain merchant registration. As for brokers collecting commissions, they must also apply in accordance with regulations and report to the competent authorities for approval. If there are any cases of grain profiteering, they must be strictly investigated and dealt with. The allocation and sale of civilian food in Shanghai has established a Civilian Food Allocation Committee, which directly allocates and sells to users at fixed quantities and prices for certain targets, without selling grain numbers, and should continue to do so in the future. Grain merchants should join the local grain industry association. If the Shanghai Grain Industry Association is not yet sound, the Shanghai Municipal Government should earnestly supervise and inspect it to improve the organization, so as to assist in purchasing and transporting and prevent hoarding. In accordance with the economic reform plan, the Ministry of Food will list Shanghai as the first phase of Changpingcang construction areas and will handle it from the 37th year onwards. It will be prepared as soon as the Executive Yuan approves it.

### Longhai Railway Intermittent, Highway Line Planned for Remedy, Trial Car Starts from Ningxia to Han

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 20th] The Longhai Railway is intermittently cut off, which greatly affects transportation between the Northwest and Southeast. This problem is currently being addressed by the responsible authorities. According to Shen Qi, the director of the Seventh District Highway Transportation Office who is currently in Nanjing, the interruption of the Longhai Railway has had a significant impact on the region's external transportation, and the transportation of various equipment to be used is inconvenient. After continuous negotiations with relevant parties in Beijing, it is believed that there are three routes that can be used: From Chongqing via Guangyuan, and then to the Northwest provinces. From Hankou via Laohekou, Ankang, and then to the Northwest provinces. From Baotou via Ningxia and then to the Northwest provinces. Among them, the second route is the most convenient. The Seventh District Bureau already has a trial car carrying more than ten passengers from Ningxia to Hankou. If the trial car is successful, there will be further development in transportation between the Southeast and Northwest provinces in the future.

### Four Joint Loan Interest Rate Policy Remains Unchanged Xu Baiyuan's Speech Reveals Defects in Low-Interest Rate Policy Decided to Remedy

(Our newspaper Nanjing 20th dispatch) Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Four Joint Offices, received reporters in the afternoon of the 20th and expressed his views on the adjustment of interest rates, and announced that the Four Joint Offices would temporarily not change the current loan interest rate policy. The full text of the speech is as follows: Since the reorganization of the Four Joint Offices in the 28th year, the reasons for the low-interest rate policy adopted for loans to national bureaus and offices have been very clear. First, during the War of Resistance, the rear area needed to be self-sufficient, and prices needed to be stable. National bureaus and offices should provide capital assistance to the necessary production undertakings for the national economy and people's livelihood at low interest rates to reduce the burden and encourage increased production. Although the national bureaus and offices have low interest rates, they are of great benefit to the national economy and people's livelihood, as can be proven by past various industrial and mining loans, agricultural loans, grain loans, etc. Second, most of the loans from national bureaus and offices are directly related to the government's financial burden and economic policies. For example, increasing loan interest rates will directly increase government expenditures or directly contradict the price stabilization policy. For example, for loans from government agencies secured by budgets, increasing the interest rate will inevitably increase their burden. Also, for loans to assist in the production and sales of price-stabilized goods, the higher the interest rate, the higher the pricing will be. If high interest rates are adopted, they will contradict the original policy. For example, for certain public utilities, their pricing and debt financing are limited. The low-interest rate policy is precisely to reduce the burden on the undertaking and maintain its price limit, and its benefits are enjoyed by the local citizens. Also, for loans to assist in the production and sales of export goods, the purpose is to earn foreign exchange to replenish the fund. Sometimes the government would rather subsidize it or bear the exchange losses. If the loan also adopts high interest rates, it would be self-contradictory. Other loans such as agricultural improvement and increased production loans, water conservancy loans, cooperative production loans, and loans related to cultural education - such as the loan for printing primary and secondary school textbooks in previous years - are all concrete manifestations of the national bureaus and offices serving the country and society loyally by implementing a low-interest rate policy in the past.

In principle, national bureaus and offices maintain a low-interest rate policy for loans, but the interest rate has gradually increased. Before the 29th year, the average interest rate for various loans was less than 1% per month. Before the 31st year of the Republic of China, it rarely exceeded 2% per month. Afterwards, it gradually increased, but before victory, it rarely exceeded 3.6% per month. Since the restoration, the financial market has changed frequently, the money supply has been tight and loose from time to time, and the magnitude of price increases and decreases has increased significantly. Interest rates have generally trended upward. The average loan interest rate of national bureaus and offices a month ago was about 5% per month.

The loan interest rate of national bureaus and offices is much lower than the market interest rate. Before victory, the market interest rate in the rear area was about 1% per month. Since the restoration, it has risen steadily. Recently, the interest rate in Shanghai is often above 2% per month. Other important cities are roughly the same. Commercial banks absorb deposits at high interest rates and then make short-term loans at even higher interest rates. The higher the interest rate, the greater the profits of the bank. However, this high-interest rate environment will inevitably hinder the development of legitimate production undertakings and inevitably force prices to jump up. For example, calculated at 2% per month with monthly compound interest, the interest cost in one year is more than eight times the principal.

Today, the loan interest rate of national bureaus and offices differs too much from the general market interest rate, which can easily lead to various malpractices. For example: 1. For production undertakings that meet the loan principles but whose products are not subject to price controls, if they can obtain loans or loans are particularly large, they are in a better position than other manufacturers, and the price of their products is still calculated based on the general high-interest rate cost, so the low-interest rate is not an extra subsidy. 2. Therefore, it is easy to delay loan repayments, or those who have sufficient funds themselves or whose production does not meet the golden rules and is below the margin will inevitably try to obtain loans in various ways. Therefore, reviewing loan applications and assessing loan uses has become an extremely complex and difficult task, and each bureau's handling of loans is also troublesome and difficult. The above points are the defects that are most likely to occur under a low-interest rate policy. After repeated discussions, it is generally believed that the way forward is to choose one of the following two methods: 1. Loans from national bureaus and offices should be limited to those that strictly match national policy. For production undertakings that are not subject to price controls and are responsible for their own profits and losses, even if they meet the original loan principles, they will not be granted loans. The Ministry of Finance will order commercial banks to provide them with financial accommodation as soon as possible. 2. National bureaus and offices should implement differentiated interest rates for loans. Low-interest rate policies will still be adopted for loans that fully comply with national policies. For the aforementioned production undertakings that are responsible for their own profits and losses, interest will be calculated with reference to market interest rates. The use and effectiveness of the loan should still be strictly assessed, and the organization and implementation of the audit and inspection agency should be strengthened. (The Four Joint Offices decided not to change the four principles of the loan interest rate, published on the seventh page)

Currently, each ton has reached 280,000 yuan in circulation. Except for a few wealthy families who can still afford to buy coal for heating, general civil servants and citizens are using coal residue for heating. All agencies and organizations have now suspended heating to save coal.

### French President Accepts Ramadier's Resignation, Blum Appointed to Form Cabinet, Government Calls in Troops to Suppress Labor Unrest

(United Press, Paris, 19th) Premier Ramadier, unable to cope with the national labor unrest, resigned to President Auriol tonight. After granting permission, the President expressed his gratitude for Ramadier's courage and self-sacrifice and formally appointed Blum (see picture) to form a new cabinet. Blum then held a meeting with Ramadier, Socialist Party Secretary-General Mollet, Labor Minister Mayoux, and other party leaders at the Ministry of Labor to discuss national affairs.

(Reuters, Paris, 20th) France, where 600,000 major industrial workers have downed tools, has not yet formed a new government since the resignation of the Ramadier government. However, negotiations to form a middle-of-the-road government are actively underway. It is rumored that Blum has reached an agreement with middle-party leaders, including People's Republican Party leader Bidault, to establish a joint plan to resolve France's turbulent situation and economic problems. Sources predict that if Blum succeeds in forming a cabinet, he will also serve as Foreign Minister, in which case the French representative to the London Foreign Ministers' Conference will definitely be replaced. President Auriol received People's Republican Party leaders and National Assembly Speaker Herriot yesterday, and this morning summoned Socialist Party and other parliamentary leaders.

The situation in the Marseille labor unrest has not improved, with more than 100,000 dockworkers and other workers still on strike.

Three naval barges also arrived in Marseille with the destroyers to perform towing tasks. 350,000 metalworkers in Paris are on strike, demanding a 25% wage increase, and the situation remains deadlocked. There are no signs of resumption of work by 150,000 miners in the northern French coalfields and 15,000 flour mill workers in Paris. Newspapers in Paris are concerned and even doubtful about whether any new government can handle the situation facing the country. The right-wing "L'Aurore" newspaper straightforwardly advocates holding general elections, believing that the current situation cannot be resolved by personnel changes.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Emergency Aid to Europe Bill, But Does Not Guarantee Availability of Supplies

(Reuters, Washington, 19th) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed a bill to provide emergency aid to France, Italy, and Austria by a vote of 13 to 0. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg said: The Foreign Relations Committee has passed some amendments to the State Department's original emergency foreign aid plan. One of these is that "the Emergency Aid Act shall not contain any obligation to provide aid to any of the countries listed in this bill, nor shall it guarantee the availability of any specific goods." The purpose of this amendment is to address criticisms that the US economy lacks many of the items listed in the bill. Vandenberg also expressed hope that the bill would be passed by the full Senate on November 27. The original request for the bill was to allocate $597 million to supply food and other materials to France, Italy, and Austria. The bill passed by the Foreign Relations Committee stipulates that the US loans obtained by France, Italy, and Austria can only be used to purchase goods in the United States up to 75%, allowing the three countries to purchase goods from other countries with more US dollars. Vandenberg also specifically pointed out a crucial amendment: the quantities of various materials listed in the bill are expected targets, not obligations or contracts that the United States must fulfill. The Foreign Relations Committee did not change the total amount of aid, which is $598 million. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to complete a draft of the Emergency Aid to France, Italy, and Austria bill early next week, and the content is not expected to differ significantly from that passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Count Sforza also stated that Italy's request for trusteeship over these three territories is based on a generous spirit of freedom, and the Italian government is deeply aware that this spirit of freedom is the new guiding principle of world international relations. Italy's acquisition of these lands was also based on legitimate possession, and the Italian people deeply hope that their mission in Africa can be resumed under a different spirit and new legal and political system.

### Marshall Flies to London to Attend the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, US-Soviet Diplomacy Will Be Given Serious Consideration

(United Press, Washington, 20th) Secretary of State Marshall flew to London this afternoon aboard the presidential aircraft "Sacred Cow" to attend the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. State Department Counselor and Soviet Affairs Advisor Bohlen accompanied him. US relations with the Soviet government are expected to face a new and more serious test as a result.

Marshall's mission is the same as the goal of the previous four conferences, which is to seek an agreement with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the Austrian peace treaty and at least determine the outline of the German peace treaty, but the fundamental problem lies in the increasingly tense relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries. If the Soviet Union obstructs again, France may join Britain and the United States in establishing a joint three-nation occupation zone in Germany.

(Central News Agency, London, 19th) "The Daily Sketch" reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will arrive in London soon. The newspaper said that a British airport received a telegram from Moscow last night stating that two aircraft had taken off from Moscow and requested that the airport be prepared.

### Austin Discusses US-Soviet Relations

(US Information Service, Lake Success, 19th) US Representative to the United Nations Austin declared today that "this session of the General Assembly has proven to be the most outstanding conference since the establishment of the United Nations organization." In response to several questions raised by reporters, Austin reiterated his belief that US-Soviet relations can be improved by "deepening our understanding of each other." He said that negotiations with Soviet officials have been difficult and almost permanently fruitless. A frank exchange of views is rarely possible, and this is something that can often help resolve disputes with other countries. Austin emphasized the achievements of this session of the General Assembly, including the establishment of the Small Assembly, the Balkan Committee, and the Committee for the Promotion of Korean Independence.

### The Five-Power Veto Issue Submitted to the Small Assembly for Discussion

(Reuters, Lake Success, 19th) The General Assembly's Political Committee recently decided by a vote of 30 to 7, with 11 abstentions, to submit the veto issue to the newly established "Small Assembly" for study. In addition, it passed by a vote of 43 to 1, with 8 abstentions, a resolution that the permanent members of the committee should consult on the veto power in order to agree on measures to enable the Security Council to exercise its functions quickly and effectively. Soviet representative Gromyko pointed out that the US request for the Small Assembly to discuss the veto power is an attempt to revise the provisions of the Charter regarding the veto power of the great powers, and he absolutely opposes this move, as the Charter clearly stipulates that the veto power cannot be changed.

### Firmly Opposed to the Partition of the Holy Land, the Arab Group Proposes a Recommendation Requiring the Establishment of a Unified and Independent State Ruled by Arabs

(Associated Press, Lake Success, 19th) Six Arab countries, as well as Pakistan and Afghanistan, today submitted a lengthy ten-point report to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, requesting the establishment of a unified and independent state controlled by Arabs, the termination of the British Mandate, the withdrawal of British troops within one year, and warned that any attempt at partition would lead to a prolonged war. The Nine-Nation Subcommittee has finally approved the partition plan proposed by the United States and the Soviet Union, which will be discussed tonight by the 57-nation Palestine Special Committee.

(Reuters, Lake Success, 19th) The General Assembly's Palestine Committee's partition subcommittee agreed today to place the city of Jerusalem under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, and Jerusalem and the surrounding area will become an international zone. The Soviet representative, who had previously opposed trusteeship, surprisingly expressed support, allowing the entire subcommittee to reach a unanimous agreement.

(Reuters, Lake Success, 19th) The main points of the report of the representatives of the Arab countries are as follows: 1. The partition proposal violates the principles of the Mandate and directly violates the principles of the League of Nations and the United Nations Charter. 2. The Arab people have been the occupants of Palestine for centuries and have the right to establish a state and self-determination in that land. 3. The doubts about the letters exchanged between McMahon and Hussein should be resolved by the International Court of Justice (the letters mainly stated that Britain's promises to the Arab people could not coexist with its promises to the Jewish people). 4. The legality and interpretation of the Balfour Declaration should be referred to the International Court of Justice for a ruling. 5. The League of Nations has already temporarily recognized the independence of Palestine. 6. After the dissolution of the League of Nations, the Mandate lost its legal basis, and Britain has also announced its intention to abandon the Mandate, so there is no obstacle to Palestine becoming an independent country. 7. The United Nations organization does not inherit the powers of the League of Nations and therefore cannot succeed the League of Nations as the supervisor of the Mandate system. The report also argued that unless a trusteeship agreement is negotiated by the Mandatory Power, the General Assembly or other United Nations bodies have no right to implement resolutions on Mandated Territories. The report further suggested that the Palestine issue be removed from the General Assembly's agenda and that, in any case, the opinion of the International Court of Justice should be obtained first. The report further emphasized that neither the whole nor part of Palestine can be placed under the control of any foreign government, and the United Nations organization must respect the principle of national self-determination.

### The Soviet Union Refuses to Attend

[Report from this newspaper] New York Radio 20th: Lake Success, the United Nations Trusteeship Council convened today, with US Representative Sayre serving as chairman, and the chairman announced the meeting's opening.

### Crowds Gather at Westminster Abbey, Tens of Thousands Cheer on Both Sides of the Road as the British Heir to the Throne Marries, Mountbatten Promoted to Duke

(Associated Press, Westminster, 20th) Today is the auspicious day for the Princess Elizabeth's wedding. The morning mist was hazy, and the weather was mild. When the wedding ceremony was held, the morning sun began to drive away the clouds. Shortly after 7:00 AM, the Princess had already risen and applied makeup in front of the mirror. She only called for her maid to help when she put on her wedding dress. Before dawn, 40,000 people had gathered in Parliament Square, mostly women. The Duke of Edinburgh, the newly ennobled groom Philip Mountbatten, also washed at Kensington Palace around 7:00 AM, with his hangover from last night still lingering.

Before 9:00 AM, 250,000 people had filled the streets, some carrying footstools, others climbing trees for a high vantage point. Thousands of policemen lined the route the royal carriage would take, preventing this behavior. At 9:30 AM, soldiers came out to block the lines. The soldiers wore military uniforms instead of formal attire. Shortly after 9:00 AM, the guests began to arrive at Westminster Abbey in an endless stream. Four Englishmen had been standing outside the abbey all night. At that moment, they collapsed and were sent to the first aid station for treatment. There were 30 first aid stations and thousands of personnel along both sides of the route.

Before 9:00 AM, the fog cleared slightly, but the sky was still not clear.

Police estimated that the crowds watching the ceremony were as large as those at the coronation of George VI. The guests were either in uniform or wearing morning dress, and some Scots wore kilts. Many of the female guests wore fur coats. Four Royal Air Force guards fainted in front of the White House War Memorial and received immediate first aid. Within ten minutes, eight women also fainted around the memorial.

At 10:30 AM, the sunlight broke through the clouds and shone everywhere, but soon receded. The first aid stations were doing brisk business. By 10:00 AM, 200 people had sought treatment, and six had been sent to the hospital.

At 11:03 AM, the Queen, accompanied by Princess Margaret and members of the royal families of various countries, left Buckingham Palace, and thousands of people outside the palace shouted to welcome them. At the same time, Queen Mary left Marlborough House and arrived at Westminster Abbey at 11:10 AM. The band played "God Save the King," and the tens of thousands of people outside the abbey cheered in unison. The cavalry escorting the Queen's carriage wore new and fashionable uniforms, and the horses were tall and beautiful, looking around with extraordinary demeanour.

At 11:16 AM, Princess Elizabeth, accompanied by George VI, left Buckingham Palace and boarded the Irish State Coach. The crowds along the road cheered thunderously. At 11:15 AM, the Duke of Edinburgh arrived at the Poets' Corner entrance of Westminster Abbey. King George and his daughter arrived at Westminster Abbey at 11:28 AM. As the carriage approached, the huge crowd suddenly fell silent, and then suddenly erupted in cheers like a landslide, lasting for a long time. King George helped his daughter out of the carriage. Elizabeth straightened her clothes slightly and then walked into the abbey.

Among the guests, Churchill was cheered repeatedly. As Churchill stepped out of the car, he took off his cigar and nodded to the crowd.

To the sound of bugles, Elizabeth and her father slowly walked 300 feet forward on the red carpet, walking slightly to one side, lest they accidentally step on the tomb of the Unknown Warrior.

At 11:35 AM, the Bishop of Westminster began to lead the wedding service, reciting the famous words of the Church of England: "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this Man and this Woman in holy Matrimony."

The Bishop then asked Philip whether he would take Elizabeth to be his wife. Philip answered in a calm and low voice: "I will." Elizabeth's voice trembled slightly as she uttered the words "I will." Philip's answer was calm and steady, while the Princess's was enthusiastic and eager. At 11:45 AM, the Church of England wedding ceremony was completed, and the choir sang Hymn 67. The Archbishop of York then delivered a brief homily, saying: "Life should not be selfish, and a happy married life is unselfish." He urged the couple to make their home "an oasis of peace and tranquility" and blessed them with "joy, peace, and happiness."

The newlyweds then walked to Edward the Confessor's Chapel to sign the register with the gold pen that the Princess's parents had used before. At this time, the Princess's dress was accidentally blocked by a candlestick, and the attendants untangled it. The two signed their names four times to comply with the domestic law. Then they returned to the hall to meet the crowd. When they went out, Philip repeatedly looked back at the train of his wife's wedding dress. The organist slowly played sweet music, and the newlyweds walked down the sidewalk from the west gate. The crowd cheered again, and the Princess smiled to thank them. The two got into the carriage together and returned to Buckingham Palace to host a grand banquet. As the beautiful couple returned to the palace, the bells of Westminster Abbey rang out, echoing throughout London.

### Zhao's Lechery Leads to Murder: Young Woman Dies Tragically Under Butcher's Knife; Case Solved in Just 24 Hours

The Murderer Liu Xigen was Arrested in Changzhou and Escorted to Shanghai for Trial and Punishment. The Following is a Record of the Beginning and End of the Incident.

The deceased, Lu Jinfeng, 27 years old, was from Ningbo and was quite beautiful. In her early years, she was betrothed to Li Ronggen (a copper craftsman) as his wife, but she could not support herself. Lu Jinfeng was accustomed to vanity. At the end of the 31st year, she met Wu Jinhai, a fellow villager, and eloped with him. She returned to her hometown in Changzhou and lived with him for eight months. Later, Wu died of illness, and Jinfeng also unfortunately fell ill and could not afford medical treatment. Through an introduction, she met the murderer Liu Xigen (29 years old, from Changzhou), who helped her seek medical treatment. After recovering from her illness, she held a banquet with three tables of wine, but she did not hold a ceremony and lived together hastily.

The incident started when Liu, in addition to farming in the countryside at the time, saw the end of the business. Soon after, he came to Shanghai with her. Liu joined the Jiali Box Factory on Huai'an Road, but soon became unemployed. Due to economic difficulties, Jinfeng worked as a female worker in the Jiuzhang Cloth Factory, where the remuneration was very high, but she still had a passion for dressing up and had illicit relationships with men outside. As a result, the feelings between the two gradually deteriorated. Recently, Liu went to Jinfeng's factory to ask for money but was rejected, which made him even more resentful, so he plotted to kill her.

At 8:00 p.m. on the 15th, Liu went to Feng's factory again, but his request for a loan was not granted and he was scolded. That night, Liu returned home, tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep. On the morning of the 16th, he found a butcher knife in Huangzhong and hid it on his body. He went straight to the Jiuzhang Cloth Factory, but because he saw many people in the factory, it was not easy to attack, so he wandered around in front of the factory.

The murder occurred at 2:30 p.m. Feng's mother, Chen, happened to be going out of the factory and met him. She told him that Feng had gone with her sister A to the Nanyang Tobacco Company on Jiaozhou Road to find her brother-in-law Cao Junsheng. When Liu heard this, he hurriedly chased after them. He saw the two sisters sitting idly in the company's gatehouse. He invited them to go to Cao Junsheng's house for dinner. At about 8:00 p.m., he accompanied Feng in hiring a pedicab to go to the Jiuzhang Cloth Factory. Along the way, Feng was unhappy. After the pedicab reached its destination, Feng quickly walked into the alley, and Liu followed in. When he reached the corner, he looked around and saw no one, and it was extremely dark, so he took out the butcher knife, used his left hand to hold Feng's neck, and stabbed her left cheek with the knife. Feng screamed in pain, blood gushing out like a spring, and staggered to the ground.

Fled at Night

At this point, the murderer abandoned the knife and fled wildly. He went to the North Railway Station, but because he had no money, he sold a white cloth shirt for 28,000 yuan. At 4:00 a.m. the next morning, he took a bus back to Changzhou. After the Jiangning Police Bureau in charge of the area was informed, Wang, the branch director, ordered Lin Deming, the section chief, to lead the police to investigate and obtained the name and identity of the murderer from the deceased before her death. The handling police immediately tracked down the murderer's mother-in-law Lu Chen, brother-in-law Cao Junsheng, his brother Liu Genrong, uncle Liu Chaotian, and the factory where the murderer worked. Finally, they determined that the murderer must have fled to his hometown in the countryside.

Arrested

Later, it was learned from Cao Junsheng that Liu often went to Longhutang Houhuzhuang outside Changzhou Gate. Dai, a section member, led police Zhao Bingliang and Cao to Changzhou on the morning after the incident. They went to the above-mentioned location and found the murderer sleeping in a straw shed, surrendering without resistance. He was escorted back to Shanghai immediately. After interrogation, he was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. This case, from the time it occurred to the time it was solved, took only 24 hours.

### The District Prosecutor's Office Summoned Leng Shan to Confront Zhang Chunfan

(Our Newspaper) In the case of Zhang Chunfan accusing Leng Shan of abducting women and obstructing freedom, prosecutor Lu Zhennan summoned Leng Shan for questioning at 2:00 p.m. yesterday and brought the detained Zhang Chunfan for confrontation. At 3:15 p.m., the interrogation seemed to be over. Leng Shan was released on bail, and Zhang was still detained.

It is reported that Leng first expressed doubts about whether Zhang had the qualifications to sue, because the household registration records showed that they were uncle and niece. The court questioned Zhang on this basis, and he replied that he and Xiao Shi were living together. As for the information recorded in the household registration, it was because they needed to act, so they filled in the information as uncle. The court turned to question Leng Shan, asking if there were more than 70 hugs when performing the play "Qinhuai Moon"? Since the correspondence was for studying art, why did he borrow Liu Qiong's mailbox? Leng replied: When "Qinhuai Moon" was performed, he himself was in Suzhou. Zhang's claim that he was the screenwriter and director of the play was also incorrect. The director of the play was Ying Jian, and the screenwriter was Liu Tao. He also submitted explanations to the court as evidence. As for borrowing Liu Qiong's mailbox, it was also at Xiao's request, because in the past, Yue Opera fans wrote letters to Xiao, and the wording was slightly inappropriate, so Zhang ordered people to go and beat them, so he did it according to Xiao's instructions.

According to the original regulations of the central government, the implementation of the authorization measures should end at the end of August of this year. Now that it has been approved to extend it for another year, the current dispute over the municipal government's staffing reduction can come to an end.

### The Yu Shengxiao Murder Case Ends; Que Li is Sentenced to Long-Term Imprisonment; The British Consulate Believes it is Fair

(Our Newspaper) The Shanghai-Qingpu Highway blood case, which has attracted much attention, in which American Corporal Malai and British national Que Li A Que jointly murdered black market gold note broker Yu Ganxiao, has been clear since Malai was found guilty of shooting and killing Qing Yu Shengxiao by the US military court and sentenced to life imprisonment. From 3:00 p.m. to 3:25 p.m. yesterday, this murder for money, which had been delayed for four months, came to an end completely. British national Que Li was also sentenced to life imprisonment by our local court.

At 3:00 p.m., Que Li A Que was escorted to court by 30 bailiffs. Que wore a white mesh shirt with a large lapel, a coffee-colored plaid Harris jacket, gray legal-grade velvet trousers, and yellow leather shoes. He was calm and composed, but his face was pale. At 3:02 p.m., Presiding Judge Zhu Yuhuang, Prosecutor Ding Tongjun, and Clerk Zhuang Zhide took their seats and ordered Que Li to stand in the defendant's column, with six bailiffs and five court attendants guarding him on the side. After questioning his name and age, Judge Zhu stood up and read the main text: "Que Li A Que is sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life for jointly robbing and intentionally killing people." When Que Li heard the verdict, he initially forced himself to remain calm and his face did not change, but as the presiding judge read the main points of the reasoning, his emotions gradually became tense and he showed obvious signs of anger. After reading, Judge Zhu declared that the case must be automatically submitted to the Supreme Court for review according to law. If the defendant does not agree, he can submit concrete reasons within ten days after receiving the judgment. Que's defense lawyer, Tang Huaiqun, immediately stood up and requested that the judgment be sent to the defense lawyer to translate it into English and hand it over to the defendant for detailed reading. Judge Zhu approved it. At 3:25 p.m., the court adjourned and Que Li was returned to custody. Afterwards, Jill, the British Vice Consul who was in court, said that the reasoning for the court's judgment was sufficient and extremely fair, and expressed satisfaction before leaving.

### How the Initial Passage Through the Three Gorges' Kongling Shoal Came to Be Known as "Gates of Hell"

(Special dispatch from Yichang by our newspaper, dated the 12th) The beautiful scenery and perilous terrain of the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River have long been renowned throughout history and across the world. A mere pen cannot even begin to capture its essence. Taking a downstream boat from Chongqing, one would only enter the first gorge, Qutang Gorge, around 5 PM on the second day. This gorge is also known as Guangxi Gorge, stretching from Baidi City in the west to Wushan County in the east. At the narrowest point of the gorge entrance, the river surface is extremely constricted, with towering cliffs rising vertically from both banks, soaring into the clouds. The tranquil river flow is suddenly constrained, stirring up countless waves. The river surface is filled with rapidly swirling eddies. All along the way, there are precipitous cliffs, and without the sun directly overhead, it is difficult to see the sun and moon.

By the time we arrived at Wushan County, it was already dark, so appreciating the scenery of the Wushan Gorge had to wait until early the next morning. This section, from Wushan County to Gongbokou, is famous for the Twelve Peaks of Wushan, standing majestically in between. They are situated half on the north bank and half on the south bank of the river. The sailors on the boat pointed out the names of the twelve peaks as if reciting a family treasure. There were names like Wangxia, Cuiping, Chaoyun, Songluan, Jixian, Juhe, Jingtan, Shangsheng, Qiyun, Feifeng, Denglong, and Shengquan. Whenever a high peak was spotted, its name was immediately called out. However, to unfamiliar travelers, these peaks seemed more like identical twins, and it was impossible to remember them all. One only felt that the peaks were staggered and closely packed, with overlapping cliffs and rocks, blocking the sun and obscuring its rays, making the Yangtze River twist and turn beyond recognition.

When the boat reached Badong, we were told that we had entered the Xiling Gorge. This section, extending all the way to Yichang, is the longest of the Three Gorges, with even more shoals and gorges. The names are novel and the terrain extremely perilous. A few of the most famous ones include Niukou Shoal, Kongling Shoal, Xietan Shoal, Binghuabinjian Gorge, Niuganmafei Gorge, and Dengying Gorge. Among them, the Kongling Shoal is the place where boats on the Sichuan River are most likely to have accidents. Sailors navigating the Sichuan River often say: "Xietan Shoal is not a shoal, but Kongling is truly the Gates of Hell."

Navigating the Sichuan River (referring to the stretch of the Yangtze River between Chongqing and Yichang) is not like sailing on the ocean. Everywhere there are hidden reefs and numerous shoals, and the water level varies greatly between the high-water and low-water seasons each year. It is essential to have an experienced pilot when navigating. These pilots must remember the height and size of every shoal and every hidden reef on the Sichuan River, and, on the treacherous Sichuan River filled with traps, they must feel their way forward as if walking on thin ice to find a safe passage. Almost all of the current Sichuan River pilots are former captains of wooden boats that navigated the Sichuan River in the early years. With decades of experience navigating the Sichuan River, they serve as the eyes for the safety of every shipping vessel.

In the 26th year of the Guangxu reign (1900), the German ship "Ruishui" attempted to navigate the Sichuan River. When the ship reached Kongling Shoal, the Chinese helmsman on board steered directly towards a large rock called "Come at Me" standing on the shoal, as if determined to crash into the reef. The German captain, unable to bear it any longer, grabbed the helm and immediately turned the ship. But as soon as he turned the helm, the ship struck a hidden reef on the riverbed and immediately broke apart and sank. At this point, the German captain finally understood that the helmsman steering directly towards the "Come at Me" rock had a purpose. Ashamed and furious, he pulled out a gun and took his own life. It turned out that when a ship reached Kongling Shoal, because of the complex arrangement of nearby hidden reefs, it had to steer directly towards the "Come at Me" rock, and only when it was about to hit the rock could the helm be turned, so that the ship could enter the only narrow, safe escape route. Turning the helm too soon, before the right moment, would cause the ship to hit the reef. That is why Kongling Shoal earned the honored name "Gates of Hell." Countless ships have met tragic ends here. Sichuan River pilots still "pale at the mention of the tiger" when they tell this anecdote.

Passing through the Three Gorges, one is reminded of how, in prehistoric times, the Yangtze River engaged in a thrilling and fierce struggle with the Kunlun Mountains and its branches. In the end, the thousands of cliffs and peaks of Kunlun could not stop the raging waves of the Yangtze River. After conquering over 5,500 kilometers and flowing through nine provinces, it flows eastward into the sea. The unyielding perseverance and spirit of the Yangtze River should serve as a warning sign for the Chinese people. Let us learn from the Yangtze River! (Special correspondent Hu Longchang)

### The Central Government Allocates 300 Million to Relief Disaster Victims in Yancheng and Suining

[Special dispatch from Zhenjiang by our newspaper, dated the 19th] Yancheng in northern Jiangsu province was once captured by bandits at the beginning of last month. Suining city was besieged by more than 10,000 communist bandits. The people in both places suffered huge losses, and the disaster situation is particularly severe. The provincial government has previously requested emergency relief from the central government. The Executive Yuan has now telegraphed that 100 million will be allocated to Yancheng for emergency relief, and 200 million to Suining. The funds will be transferred to the provincial treasury by the Ministry of Finance and then remitted and distributed separately for investigation. Also: The Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly believes that the counties in northern Jiangsu are suffering from floods and bandit disasters, and that there will be more refugees during this winter. It has specifically sent a letter to the Provincial Department of Land and Food and the Department of Social Affairs to transfer grain from the bountiful counties where the land tax has already been collected to provide relief to disaster victims in northern Jiangsu. The departments have forwarded the request to the provincial government for approval. Another report: The Provincial Capital Security Conference was convened yesterday and resolved three items: 1. The curfew hours will be changed to 11 PM to 5 AM, effective immediately. 2. Strictly prohibit garrison troops from arbitrarily arresting people. 3.

### A Large Number of Highway Bridges in Northern Jiangsu Were Destroyed

(Special dispatch from Zhenjiang by our newspaper, dated the 19th) The Tongjian Road, including the Dingxi Gate Bridge, Caonian North Bridge, Zangjiashe Bridge, Jiulian Bridge, Tianxia Bridge, Xinhe Bridge, and Bazao Bridge, have all been burned by the communist bandits. The roadbed of the highway from Fuan to Liangduo, Dingxi, to Cao'an has been dug up and destroyed. The destruction between Yancheng and Funing is even greater. The Jiangnian to Hai'an highway has also been dug up and cut off. The Highway Bureau is mobilizing for emergency repairs.

[Another Report] According to Director Dong of the Construction Department, the emergency repairs of roads in northern Jiangsu total more than 6,000 kilometers, and about 200 bridges are being rebuilt or rebuilt. When sixteen people were working in Jiangyin, all the workers were abducted by bandits, and their whereabouts are still unknown. The Tongyu Road, including Dingxi Gate Bridge, Cao'an North Bridge, Zangjiashe Bridge, Jiulian Bridge, Tianxia Bridge, Xinhe Bridge, and Bazao Bridge, have all been burned. The roadbed along the line from Fuan to Liangduo Dingxi to Cao'an has been dug up and destroyed. The destruction between Yancheng and Funing is even greater.

### Election Activities in Taiwan

(Special dispatch from Taipei by our newspaper, dated the 17th) The provincial capital has not seen clear skies for half a month, as if it were the rainy season, but the election activities have not been affected in the slightest. The election atmosphere in Taiwan province is quite normal due to the balanced intellectual level of the voters. According to the three supervisors sent to this province by the General Election, the number of voters in this province is very accurate, and the roster sent to the General Election Office was also the earliest in the country, and the election methods are also more appropriate. There are a total of sixty-eight National Assembly candidates in the eight counties and nine cities of this province. Later, due to President Chiang's instruction that "suppressing the rebellion is more important than elections," some candidates voluntarily withdrew, and there are currently sixty-one candidates competing. Taichung and Tainan, with large populations, each elected one female representative. There is only one female candidate in Taichung, Guan Tie, who is almost certain to win. In Tainan, Yang Guo Xing, Chen A Xiu, still have to compete. The most common method of campaigning is to publish advertisements in newspapers, explaining detailed experiences in "like-mindedness," and printing the name on a zinc plate to win with its small size and conspicuousness. Some even write "A newcomer appears! A man with hot blood!" like a movie publicity advertisement. Regardless of their status, eight or nine out of ten appear with a bold and decisive attitude. The second is broadcasting speeches, neglecting the "XURA". The province's electrification education is developed, and this method is still effective. The third is posting slides, colorful and beautiful, which is a considerable investment. The "Constitutional Advancement Association" organized a "Policy Presentation Speech Conference," and the enthusiasm was not diminished by wind or rain. The regrettable thing is that "election offices" for individuals have appeared in some places, and the Provincial Election Office has now banned them to avoid confusion. This also shows the enthusiasm of the provincial compatriots for the election. Although Taitung is remote, there are as many as nine regional candidates, the highest in the province. Many indigenous compatriots cannot write Chinese characters, and it has been stipulated that the administrator will write on their behalf. Currently, the atmosphere of the election is quite tense. If God blesses us, there will be many wonderful scenes, which can be predicted.

### Mu Qiujie, Director of the Salt Affairs Administration, Talks About Sichuan Salt

(Special dispatch from Chengdu by our newspaper, dated the 17th) Mu Qiujie, Director of the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, has visited Zigong, Leshan, northern Sichuan, and eastern Sichuan during his trip to Sichuan. After returning to Chengdu, he discussed with Chairman Deng and Speaker Xiang again and again, and is confident in saving the Sichuan salt crisis. Before leaving, he told reporters that Sichuan salt is not only the largest special product in the rear, but also supplied the whole country during the Anti-Japanese War, which made great contributions. The central government will definitely fully support it to become the largest and most advanced salt production industrial zone in the country through industrialization and scientificization. Mu said: The issue of salt loans and production relief has been negotiated with the Four Allied Banks and Two Bureaus, and the total amount is determined to be 290 billion yuan, which will be distributed to Zigong, Leshan, and northern Sichuan salt fields for increasing production, improving technology, and providing relief. As for the issue of export sales, the sales of Sichuan salt are currently very good in Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, and Kang provinces. Although transportation is not smooth due to the suppression of the rebellion, the future is still promising. Mu finally talked about the fundamental way to resolve the Sichuan salt crisis, which is that salt industry personnel, labor and capital should cooperate, recognize the difficulties, and rely on their own efforts. The government is determined to fully support it to embark on the path of collective production, scientificization, and industrialization.

### Keelung Port Enters the Rainy Season and Exports Decrease Daily

(Special dispatch from Taipei by our newspaper, dated the 18th) Keelung Port, which has entered the rainy season for half a month, has seen an imbalance in its import and export trade. According to statistics from the Port Bureau, imported goods such as bulk oils, beans, fertilizers, chemicals, and bean cakes totaled 13,212 metric tons. Exported coal, fruits, tea, sugar, timber, canned food, cement, and timber totaled 4,949 metric tons, a difference of 8,263 metric tons. The port's imports and exports are sufficient to reflect the province's economic prosperity and decline, and also sufficient to illustrate the province's low production, with exports decreasing daily. However, according to sources, the actual amount of exported goods restricted by unilateral regulations in Taiwan Province is not as small as the figures show. Smuggling is still rampant, making it impossible to collect statistics. Director Li of the Keelung Port Affairs Police Bureau said: Currently, the port police have neither the strength nor the financial resources to cope with sea patrols. The people of the province are all hoping that the authorities will have a comprehensive plan to strictly prevent smuggling, strengthen production, and expand exports.

### Ministry of Education Revises Curriculum Standards: Elementary Section to be Officially Announced Next Month, Secondary Section Nearing Completion, University Section to Remain Temporarily Unchanged This Year

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th) This newspaper has repeatedly reported on the Ministry of Education's revision of curriculum standards for schools at all levels. Here is the latest update:

Elementary School Curriculum

The revision of elementary school curriculum standards has been repeatedly conducted through meetings of experts convened by the Ministry of Education. To gather diverse opinions and strive for excellence, the Ministry continues to consult with experts and refer to their opinions. The relevant department and staff have also continuously researched multiple times, and the entire elementary school curriculum standard for each subject has been finalized. The full draft is currently being printed and is expected to undergo a final review by the relevant authorities within the Ministry by the middle of next week. After being approved by the Minister, it can be officially announced in mid-December of this year. It is heard that there are often misunderstandings outside, thinking that the curriculum standard is based on the standard of class, in fact, the so-called standard is not to make the curriculum, only for the outline, the standard is a standard rule used in general, local governments may formulate relevant courses in accordance with the local environment. The standard set by the Ministry is only a general outline, which is quite flexible, and separate implementation measures are prescribed, so it can be used flexibly not only in the inland provinces and cities, but also in the border areas and even overseas Chinese areas, all of which can formulate courses that adapt to the environment based on the principles of the curriculum standard. External criticisms suggest that the curriculum standard of the 31st year is not as good as that of the 25th year because the 31st year was during the war, and in many places, due to insufficient talent, they could not choose suitable teaching materials and compile ideal courses. Feeling a shortage of books, the Ministry had to make some mandatory provisions in the curriculum standard. This time, the spirit of the 25th year is adopted and improved, so the new curriculum standard is relatively appropriate.

Secondary School Curriculum

For the secondary school curriculum standards, the Ministry of Education previously divided the more than ten secondary school subjects and invited experts, five to seven for each subject, to hold departmental meetings in the Ministry to revise them. After the revision, a circular was sent to each expert for their signed opinions. The Ministry of Education is still continuously organizing the opinions returned by the experts. It will be completed before December 10th, and then educators actually engaged in secondary school education will be invited, along with one or two experts in each subject, to hold a comprehensive meeting for the final decision. The entire curriculum may be approved and officially announced within this year or early next year.

University Curriculum

The Ministry of Education initially intended to organize and revise the curriculum outlines of various university colleges. However, due to considerations of time, finances, faculty, and other issues, the original curriculum will remain temporarily unchanged. It is heard that no expert meetings will be convened this year for revision, and the situation will be considered next year for appropriate action.

### The Board of Directors of the Four Banks Joint Treasury Decided to Keep the Current Lending Rate Unchanged, Non-Essential Loans Will Be Stopped Across the Board

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20] The 357th board meeting of the Four Banks Joint Treasury was held yesterday morning at 9 a.m. Deputy Chairman Zhang Qun acted as chairman, and many important cases were passed at the meeting. Secretary-General Xu Bolan received reporters at 2 p.m. and answered many questions from the reporters on the spot. The key points are recorded below: 1. In the past two months, exports have exceeded imports, and the trade situation has gradually improved. 2. The news of the reorganization of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee is purely general rumor. 3. Regarding the current lending rate, after discussion by the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, it will not be changed for the time being, and the following four principles have been decided:

A. The main purpose of adjusting interest rates was originally to avoid unnecessary lending and tighten credit, but adjusting interest rates has its advantages and disadvantages, so it still needs to be carefully considered.

B. In order to tighten credit, considering the current economic environment, it seems that all non-essential loans should be stopped across the board.

C. For matters related to national economy and people's livelihood, state-owned and private production and sales, and transportation public utilities, it seems that they should be allocated in a planned manner according to actual needs, and should be assisted by national banks. A detailed plan will be completed by the end of this year.

D. Regarding the control of deposits and remittances of administrative agencies and public institutions, the Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Audit Department to stipulate strict assessment and punishment measures, and effectively implement them.

[Another dispatch] The deposits of the same industry absorbed by the National Bank have reached more than 100 billion yuan so far. The interest on the deposit is 8%, the period is 10 days, and the unit of money is 100 million. It is rumored that the interest rate will be raised. The bank said that there is no need to change it at present.

### Three Ways to Eliminate Black Market Exchange Rates

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20] Xu Bai, the secretary-general of the Ministry of Finance and the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks, said in response to reporters' inquiries about finance and economics on the 20th: In the past two months, the situation of export exchange settlement has obviously improved. The foreign exchange received by the government exceeds its expenditure, and although the amount is not very large, it is the fact that receipts are more than payments. There is a distance between the current listed market price and the black market price, and overseas remittances have not been absorbed much, which is also one of the reasons. The Ministry of Finance and the National Bank attach great importance to how to improve the exchange rate and absorb foreign exchange, and this situation is expected to improve recently. As far as the current foreign exchange policy is concerned, it will not go beyond raising the listed price and lowering the black market price. As far as the latter is concerned, the black market is an illegal act, and if the government makes a decision, it is expected to lower the black market in fact. According to his personal view, there are only three ways to seek equalization: 1. Strictly prohibit smuggling, so that the market does not need black market foreign exchange. 2. Strictly investigate illegal transactions of gold banknotes, and do not allow them to be raised arbitrarily. 3. Provide the necessary supply for normal foreign exchange needs on time. If these three points can be achieved, the government can control foreign exchange.

### Lateral Estimation of the Amount of Legal Tender

The reporter asked Xu to publish the current amount of legal tender issued in China. Xu replied laterally: Pulit recently said that 250 million US dollars can be used to recover all the legal tender. If this 250 million is calculated according to the black market, it is more than enough to recover the current amount issued. Even if it is calculated at the official price, the difference is not very far. If my issuance is announced, some people will definitely find it hard to believe. Some people advocate announcing the amount of issuance, and that is the reason. Some people think that the country's expenditure this year is less than 50 trillion, which is surprising. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that the expenditure is 30 trillion, which is already difficult. It can be seen that the general impression is not entirely consistent with the facts. Xu also talked about the merger of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury. He believed that this matter was worthy of study, but there were many difficulties in implementing it at present, so he was not willing to make a conclusion.

### Difficult to Allow the Relaxation of Scale

Xu also answered two inquiries related to Shanghai. 1. The Ministry of Finance is studying the issue of discounting current day bills. It will be announced soon. 2. Various chambers of commerce requested the National Bank to relax the scale of re-mortgages, but the government is now trying to tighten credit, so this point is difficult to allow. The key to this matter does not lie in the scale of the actual value, but in how it is used.

### The Four Banks Strengthen Their Institutions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20] Xu Boguo, Secretary-General of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, announced on the 20th that in order to strengthen the control of the market finance, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has decided to reorganize and strengthen the organization of its institutions in Shanghai, so that they can always be in a position to supervise and connect various businesses of the local national banks. It was also decided to invite President Zhang of the National Bank to take charge of the command and supervision nearby.

Xu also announced that since July this year, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has jointly organized a loan inspection and audit team with various banks, which has inspected more than 100 factories in succession, including more than a dozen industries. According to the investigation report, the funds released by various banks are all used appropriately.

In addition, the loans approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury are all in accordance with the regulations. Government agencies or public opinion institutions can check the loan situation handled by the national banks at any time if they want to understand it.

### Responsible Person of the Equalization Committee Talks About Foreign Exchange Adjustment Strategy to Promote Exports and Fight for Overseas Remittances

[Reported by Our Newspaper] It has been rumored that the foreign exchange policy will be changed and that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee will be reorganized. The reporter specifically visited a responsible person of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee yesterday. According to his talk, he has not heard of the reorganization of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, and repeatedly emphasized that the foreign exchange revenue and expenditure of the Fund Committee have been balanced in recent months, and there is no need to change the foreign exchange policy. As for raising the foreign exchange rate, it aims to promote exports, fight for overseas remittances, and reduce the excessive profits of importers. Because domestic prices and black market foreign exchange are rising day by day, importers obtain cheap foreign exchange to import goods, and sell them in the market to make profits. Overseas remittances also tend to the high-priced black market, so foreign exchange must be adjusted at any time to improve it, but it is definitely not to follow the black market. He also answered various questions from reporters: 1. The recent rise in black market foreign exchange is due to the southward flow of capital escaping from the north, which sucks up black market foreign exchange. Absorbing this floating capital is the fundamental way to manage it. 2. Stopping the settlement and purchase of forward foreign exchange makes it impossible for importers to hoard goods for profit, and the government's sale of foreign exchange can have the effect of contracting the currency. The settlement and purchase of forward foreign exchange requires delaying payment for three months, which loses the effect of contracting the currency. 3. The statement that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee cannot supply the approved foreign exchange head position is completely unfounded. The official price of 12,000 yuan of foreign exchange is supplied by the government and has nothing to do with the Equalization Fund Committee. 4. The export trade situation is not pessimistic. After the recovery of Shandong, the export of peanuts will be considerable. 5. The free foreign exchange policy is not inconsistent in economic theory, but the current environment in our country does not allow it. If the government gives up control, it is already unimaginable if there are any rumors in the market. 6. Regarding the US loan, he believes that although China urgently needs foreign aid, it also needs to consider the time of repayment in the future before the loan, and whether or not the loan needs to be decided by the US Congress, and our people's mere hope is of no help to the matter.

Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation saw the arrival of personnel from the Simplification Committee to supervise matters in the marketplace. Fellow merchants did not dare to be active. However, the off-exchange market situation, due to the increase in the US exchange rate, stirred up people's spirits. Bidding prices rose step by step, and the situation appeared quite chaotic. Towards the close of the market, the floor seemed to soften slightly. However, as a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn continued to soar by 2.3 million, reaching 46.5 million. 20-count Double Horse yarn also rose step by step by 800,000, with each piece nearing 30 million. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also reached unprecedented peaks. The cotton cloth market, at the beginning, carried on the momentum from the previous day's close, with each type of cloth creating new records. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was pushed to a peak of 1.31 million. Subsequently, those in the industry, fearing the high prices, and those taking profits successively emerged. Furthermore, encountering economic police arriving to monitor the market, the market situation suddenly declined. At the final close, the price was 1.265 million yuan, a drop of 25,000 yuan from the previous day. Other grades of fine cloth also declined by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. However, Chen Chung was uniquely strong, rising by 60,000 yuan. High-grade Prussian blue cloth rose step by step by about 50,000 to 100,000 due to repeated rises in dyes. The remaining cloths had rises and falls ranging from 10,000 to 60,000 or 70,000. Yesterday's spot cotton market, carrying on the rising trend of the previous day, unanimously rose across all grades. Yarn factories scrambled to absorb the supply. Fellow merchants mutually offset each other, and the market situation reached an unprecedented peak. Ultimately, those with floating profits took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the rising trend flattened out slightly. As a result, compared to the previous day, prices rose by about 30 million. The total daily transaction volume was 1,900 bales. The factory delivery price for Ling Sai opened at 5.16 million, Han Fine at 4.05 million, Shashi at 5.018 million, Brazilian at 5.308 million, Jingyang at 5.257 million, and Hekou at 4.878 million, with a transaction volume of 840 bales. The bonded warehouse price for Ling opened at 4.96 million, Han Fine at 4.588 million, Haitian Top at 3.472 million, Luoyang at 4.464 million, North Tai at 3.638 million, and Fire Machine at 3.22 million, with a transaction volume of 1,060 bales. Zhoupu cottonseed cost 790,000.

### High Exchange Rates for British and American Currencies

The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, on behalf of Gan Rizui, increased the benchmark price of the US dollar by 5,000 yuan, to 64,500 yuan. The British pound was increased by 9,000 yuan, to 197,000 yuan. The Hong Kong dollar was increased by 56026 yuan, to 12261.20 yuan. The Indian rupee was increased by 663.81 yuan, to 14749.35 yuan.

Yesterday, the off-exchange market for Chinese stocks was consistently higher than the on-exchange market. New buying groups continued to make advances. The arrogance of the sellers was invisibly suppressed, making it easier to rise and harder to fall. Wing On Textile saw new high prices again. The closing price rose again to 360 yuan and 370 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, shares of Sino-French, Ching Foong, Wing On Public, Ching Transport, Match, and Tung Yi rose by about half a percent, and the remainder all rose slightly. Forward delivery shares all rose slightly. Off-exchange old stocks and bank stocks jumped again by more than half a percent. Cultural stocks remained stable, and the rest were peaceful.

Spot and Forward

Arbitrage, yesterday, was still high first and then low. Bank brokers still saw excess funds. The interest rate differences for each stock varied greatly. For example, the premium for Wing On Textile was generally between 13 cents and 18 cents, with Mei Ya's premium being as high as 17 cents and as low as 10 cents. Trading in Sun Kwong was less frequent, around 18 cents. In terms of the premium, Wing On Textile opened at 13 yuan, with a high price of 14 yuan and a low price of 12 yuan. Hsin Ho retreated from 6.7 yuan to 5.5 yuan, and Mei Ya retreated from 23 yuan to 20 yuan at the close.

### Rice Prices Advance to Peak. Oil Prices Rise Endlessly.

Today, the North and South markets together received more than 20,500 shi of rice. The market situation is still advancing towards a peak. Japonica and Yuan rice both rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

Flour is rising straight upward, continuing to jump by 10,000 yuan. Bran is rising madly by 10,000 yuan.

Soybean cake is soaring by 10,000 yuan due to expensive raw materials. Yellow soybeans are selling briskly and continuing to rise, stepping up by 30,000 yuan. Cowpeas have little supply or demand, and the situation is stable. Mung beans are slightly moving in Zhejiang, temporarily with no movement. Medium and substandard goods are rare, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Red beans are similar. There is not much trading in broad beans, slightly rising by 10,000 yuan. Northern red sorghum continues to move, rising step by step, adding another 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

Qingdao is purchasing corn, continuing to rise by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts have turned weak in Guangdong and Guangxi, temporarily in a stable rising pattern. The sesame oil market is absorbing strongly, with the local market being very eager, gradually rising and sharply increasing by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.

Oil prices are rising endlessly, reaching the peak. All oils have uniformly soared by more than 200,000 yuan, with the closing slightly weak.

### China Trust Bureau's Rayon Arrives in Shanghai. Sales to Begin Next Week.

Yesterday's Market Price Plunged, Once Entering the 100 Million Level

The rayon market was still stable yesterday morning, but it plunged in the afternoon because the China Trust Bureau's rayon had already arrived, and people's spirits were inevitably soft. No. 120 Asahi No. 1 Bright, opened at 106 million yuan for spot trading. Then, one box for next day was opened at 6 million yuan, but there was a lack of trading after that. At noon, it fell to 4 million yuan at the close. In the afternoon, it fell to below 100 million yuan at the lowest, and finally returned to a high of 103 million yuan selling price. As a result, it fell by 5 million yuan compared to the previous day.

The 3,000 boxes of rayon from Japan in exchange for goods from the Central Trust Bureau have already arrived at the port. Sales will be restored within the next week, and the shortage can be made up in full by then. The American rayon ordered by the silk weaving industry with foreign exchange allocations will have 200 boxes arriving in Shanghai tomorrow, and there are still 800 boxes to be loaded in two batches next month.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### Guanyin Powder

— Cheng Hanzhang

In post-war China, apart from the people in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, who can barely maintain a living, especially in areas such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, where transportation is convenient, the people are more enlightened, and the ability to survive is stronger, it is still prosperous and consumerist. However, if you go to remote and backward areas or to provinces plagued by natural disasters and continuous warfare, you will often see groups of refugees who are poorly clothed and emaciated, eating grass roots and tree bark. In some places, even grass roots and tree bark have been scavenged completely, and they are digging white clay from the ground to fill their stomachs. They call it Guanyin powder.

Guanyin powder is a slippery, fine clay. Its composition is silicon hydroxide salt or contains aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, etc. It has a fatty texture and a certain flavor. According to documents from various countries, the indigenous people of tea islands in Southeast Asia, a tribe along the Orinoco River in South America, and black African tribes also have records of eating soil. This so-called Guanyin powder clay has a milky white appearance, so in the past, people in places like Germany and Finland were curious and spread it on bread to eat it. However, from a medical perspective, eating soil certainly has no nutritional value at all. For hungry people, it is completely used to fill the stomach and relieve hunger, that is to say, to eliminate the empty feeling in their stomachs. In 1923, Mr. Puchner of Germany also recorded that wild animals in remote mountains, such as wolves and deer, would also climb to find white clay to fill their hunger when they were extremely hungry.

Speaking of white clay, it has many wonderful uses in medicine. In the past, in many places, when new medicines had not yet developed in the countryside, when encountering patients with opium poisoning, white clay was used to absorb toxins in the stomach and intestines, probably because it can prevent the rapid absorption function of the intestinal tract and help the excretion of toxic substances. At the same time, it can also be used to treat diarrhea, dysentery, worm dysentery, etc. We still use this method sometimes now. Mr. Sandeith recorded that Egyptian natives ate clay from the Nile River with lemon juice to treat vomiting in pregnant women.

Going back to ancient times, the famous Western physician Galen also studied the therapeutic effects of clay from a certain island. Later, this belief was once lost. It was not until the end of the last century, that is, in 1898, that Luo Shi once again recognized the therapeutic value of white clay and kaolin. He advocated its miraculous effect on vomiting, diarrhea, or cholera. Even today, doctors still use white clay to treat gastrointestinal diseases. For example, when using aluminum hydroxide powder to treat gastric ulcers, it can cover the damaged surface of the gastric mucosa and reduce the irritation and pain of gastric acid. Silicon hydroxide is used to absorb toxins from intestinal bacteria and protein decomposition toxins from feces, reducing their toxic effects. Also, because these clays are not absorbed by the intestinal tract, they can help with bowel movements. In this way, the clay of Guanyin powder cannot be said to be absolutely useless.

### General Assembly of the Physicians' Association

— Zhu Shanji

The Shanghai Physicians' Association held its autumn general assembly at the Municipal Gymnasium at 9:00 am on the 16th of this month. Over 1,000 members attended, along with representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, Liu Zhengping, and the Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei, represented by Jiang Shicheng and Liu Guansheng.

The above two cases were discussed together, (Resolved) Approved for immediate action.

### Bleeding from the Female Genitals

— Xie Yunshou

Why do I use such a title? Because I often encounter women who come for treatment, and when they have blood flowing from their genitals, they always think it is menstruation. In fact, menstruation and bleeding from the genitals are two different things. Although menstrual bleeding also flows from the uterus, such bleeding belongs to the physiological aspect of women, and it recurs every month in a regular manner. Apart from such formal, regular menstruation, if there is blood flowing from the genitals, then it is called bleeding. Why do I want to tell everyone the difference between menstruation and bleeding? Because menstruation is a normal thing for women, medically called a physiological thing; bleeding is something that should not happen, medically called a pathological thing. Women who do not understand the difference between menstruation and bleeding often mistake pathological bleeding for menstruation, not only failing to receive proper treatment, but even delaying the time for treatment, leading to regrets.

So, what are the causes that can cause bleeding from the female genitals? It's a long story, so I can only explain the simple and most commonly encountered diseases; ulcers of the vulva, lacerations, ulcers of the vagina, vaginitis, lacerations of the vaginal wall, erosion of the uterine cavity, etc. In such cases, because of the tissue ulceration and inflammation, blood often flows out, especially during labor and sexual intercourse, there is more bleeding. If the patient herself is not careful, she may mistakenly think it is menstruation, which would be completely wrong, and she would lose the opportunity for correct treatment. In addition, in cases of polyps of the uterine mucosa, endometritis, uterine fibroids, and abnormal uterine position, the bleeding often occurs at the same time as menstruation, causing an increase in menstrual blood volume and an extension of the duration, sometimes not stopping for ten and a half months, or bleeding once every ten to fifteen days. Patients often mistakenly think it is menstruation. The most important thing is cancer. In women over forty, if menstrual blood suddenly increases, or in women after menopause, menstruation returns, which is commonly called "reversing flowering," it is actually not menstruation, but because of uterine or vaginal bleeding caused by cancer. I once wrote an article "The Terrible Uterine Cancer," published in this magazine. Cancer should be treated early, and if the opportunity is lost, there is no hope of saving it. Acute salpingitis, ovarian tumors, ovarian dysfunction, etc. can also cause bleeding.

The above is about bleeding in gynecology. Regarding bleeding in obstetrics, for example, abortion in the first or second month of pregnancy may be mistaken for menstruation by inexperienced women. If the remnants after an abortion are not completely removed, it can cause post-abortion endometritis, with continuous bleeding, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, and even affect the whole body, causing a sallow complexion, weakness, and lack of strength. There is also a condition called ectopic pregnancy, where the fertilized egg does not develop in the uterus, but grows in a part outside the uterus. The most common is tubal pregnancy. The fallopian tube is a narrow tube that cannot accommodate the gradually growing fertilized egg, and it will rupture. In addition to lower abdominal pain and internal bleeding, there is also uterine bleeding. If the patient is not aware of this, she may mistakenly think it is dysmenorrhea.

The above is a brief explanation of the bleeding diseases in gynecology and obstetrics. I hope readers will regard menstruation and bleeding as two different things. At the same time, when encountering abnormal bleeding, you should find out the cause and seek medical treatment quickly.

### About Vitamins (Continued)

— Yin Jiting

In modern science of the past ten years, perhaps nothing has attracted more attention than vitamins. The advertisements in newspapers and magazines are all focused on them, and they have become the darlings of the times that people pursue. They have a close relationship with life, and who doesn't want to be healthy? Coupled with the promotion of pharmaceutical companies, many people have been led astray and are blindly abusing vitamins.

The birth of vitamins was conceived as early as the nineteenth century. In 1880, the Russian chemist Lunin, while working in the Physiology Department of Basel University, fed mice with a mixture of casein, fat, and sucrose. As a result, they died in a short time. However, if they were fed only milk powder, they could live longer. He believed that in addition to the known elements, milk must also contain other elements, and these unknown elements must also be indispensable for human life. In 1897, the Dutch Eijkman, while serving as a prison doctor in Java, saw that the chickens in the prison were fed with the leftover cooked white rice from the prisoners. After a long time, they suffered from paralysis. After an autopsy, there were no bacteria that could cause death. Since it was not an infectious disease, he turned his attention to the variation of food. He tested it on poultry, and it initially developed polyneuritis, followed by paralysis and death. Later, Fraser and Staiten of the Malay Peninsula continued to test it on humans, and they also obtained the same results. Thus, the reason was clear. It was only then that it was known that in addition to protein, fat, and carbohydrates, food also contains elements indispensable for life. It was not until 1911 that the Dutch chemist Funk named this element "vitamin." In the past 30 years, through the continued research of scientists, new discoveries and new knowledge about vitamins have emerged one after another like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

Spring and Autumn

### Jewish Writer Sholem Asch, Winner of the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award

— Zhao Jingshen

The Anisfield-Wolf Book Award was established by Ms. Edith Anisfield Wolf of the United States in memory of her father, John Anisfield, and her husband, Eugene E. Wolf. The award began in 1934, with the winner receiving US$1,000. This year's award went to Jewish writer Sholem Asch. The winning work is "East River." The general gist of the commentary is: "East River is a literary masterpiece. It is not only the best work in the novel, but also very sensitive, sympathetic, and has profound analysis. We see the tense relationships between Jews and non-Jews, Catholics and Protestants, employers and workers, and orthodoxy and new ideas, rigor and leniency, freedom and conservatism are also written in it. Through everything, and victoriously overcoming everything, are the basic emotions of all mankind."

Asch's works are mostly published by G.P. Putnam's Sons. In addition to "East River," there are also "The Apostle" (1943), "Children of Abraham" (1942), "One Destiny," "Song of the Valley" (1938), "The Nazarene" (1939), "The Mother" (1925), "What I Believe" (1947), "Three Novels" (1938, including "Uncle Moses," "Three Cities, C. Lederer’s Return," and "Judge Not"), "In the Beginning" (1923), "Mottke the Thief" (1916), "Salvation" (1934), "Three Cities" (1933), etc.

This year's Pulitzer Prize for Fiction was awarded to Robert Penn Warren for "All the King's Men," and the Poetry Prize was awarded to Robert Lowell for "Lord Weary's Castle." However, many publication editors advocate that this year's Pulitzer Prize for Fiction should be awarded to the author of "East River," the Jewish Sholem Asch.

Asch not only writes novels but also short stories and plays. He was born in 1880 in Kutno, a small town in Poland, which was then a territory of Russia. Asch was the tenth child in a small merchant family. At the age of nineteen, he went to Warsaw. The limited education he received in school was only in ancient and modern Hebrew language and literature. He acquired delicate romantic ideas from his mother and self-confidence from his father. He sketched the life of the small town and brought it to Warsaw, and published it the following year. In 1904, he wrote many lyrical essays and published a book called "Dos Shtetl" (1905). This depiction of the semi-pastoral Jewish small-town life represents a kind of romantic realism, different from the realism of Mendele Mocher Sforim and other old Jewish writers—with the exception of Y. L. Perez, the father of Neo-Jewish Romanticism. In 1906, he wrote the lyrical drama "Moshiakh's Teauth," and in 1907, he published "Der Got Fun Nekome," followed by many other plays. These plays were not only performed in Jewish theaters in Europe and America but also on stages in Russia and Poland, and even Reinhardt performed his plays on the Berlin stage. From then on, Jewish literature was recognized by the world. Asch's novels and plays have been translated into Russian, German, Polish, English, and various other languages. His freshness, humor, and warmth are all reasons for his popularity.

When World War I began, Asch began writing novels. He wrote about everything from thieves and basement figures to revolutionary leaders, martyrs, and saints. The characters he writes about are all warriors who struggle internally and seek liberation. For example, "Der Got Fun Nekome" writes about a group of criminals whose souls struggle and finally gain strength from God.

Asch's most abundant novel is the trilogy "Three Cities" (Farn Mabb, 1927-1932). "Salvation" (Der Tilim Yid) puts all the themes of the author's early novels into it. "The Nazarene" (Der Man Fun Nitseres) is a sequel to "Salvation," set in ancient Judea, writing about the legend of the establishment of Christianity. "The Apostle" only has an English translation, which tells the story of the life of Saint Paul.

In 1932, Asch was elected as the honorary chairman of the Jewish Congress. In 1937, the Jewish Theological Seminary of New York awarded him an honorary doctorate in Hebrew Literature.

### Advice to Young Women by Robert Herrick

— Translated by Zhen Qin

Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles to-day,
To-morrow will be dying.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
The higher he’s a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run,
And nearer he’s to setting.

That age is best which is the first,
When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent, the worse, and worst
Times still succeed the former.

Then be not coy, but use your time,
And while ye may go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
You may for ever tarry.

[Robert Herrick, English poet, born in 1591, died in 1674. He was a Royalist lyric poet of the 17th century, exiled for seventeen years during Cromwell's rule until the restoration of the monarchy. This poem was first published in the poet's "Hesperides" in 1647, but as early as 1640 this poem had been published in another form. The original title was "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time." Translator]

In the third line of the last stanza of the Tennyson poem translated by the author and published in this journal on the 8th, "but the sweetness of those days that are dead" should be changed to "but the sweetness of the days that are dead." This correction is attached.

Other works include "America" (Amerile, 1911), etc. "What I Believe" was originally written in German. "Children of Abraham" is a collection of short stories, mostly written in Jewish language, set in America.

### City Sketches

— Yin Pei

Philosopher of the Streets

At the crossroads, there is a philosopher of the streets. He has a very beautiful signboard with the following words: ——Good at observing people's expressions, able to know the past and the future...

So, people believed him and stood in a circle around him, listening to him cleverly answer every question.

Everyone got a solution and left.

But the philosopher of the streets always has a question mark in his heart.

Singing Girl

The song of a girl accompanied by a sanxian floats over from the other side of the wall. It is late at night, and the heat and noise of the day have quietly hidden away. This lewd, but also desolate, song is like the mournful chirping of insects in late autumn, telling countless past, sad stories. I imagine an anemic girl, weakly opening her pale lips, forcing a clumsy smile, selling her soul to earn a meager living.

The girl's voice is sweet, but the girl's youth is bleak.

The singing stopped, and the sanxian sounded lonely in front of my window. There was a faint sound of footsteps, knocking on the loneliness of the night.

The sound of the sanxian faded away.

My reverie was drawn even further.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

As I listened to this explanation, my mind was looping through memories when I suddenly saw Yaoqun raise his hand in a gesture of stopping, meaning to tell me to pay attention. When I saw this gesture, I quickly pricked up my ears to listen, thinking that the whistle was starting again, but after listening carefully, I didn't notice any sound at all. I had just heard a faint sound that seemed like withered leaves falling when I saw a flash of light in the room, and Little Tiger had already leaped into the door like a flash:

"Uncle Shen,... Aunt Ji,..." Little Tiger was breathing slightly.

"Take it easy, child," Yaoqun waved his hand, telling Little Tiger to take a breath.

"Uncle Shen has squeezed that 'Variety Show,' and wants her to arrange a few cars so that we can all walk to Dagu. Do you know...?" As Little Tiger said this, he blinked his big round eyes several times, hoping that we would give him an answer.

"Know what? Who's going to Tianjin?" Yaoqun asked Little Tiger, but without waiting for him to answer, he turned to me and said, "Look at this kid, he's so incoherent, he starts the story from the end, as if we're all gods, omniscient..." Yaoqun said, unable to help but laugh himself. Ding Yuan, who was on the haystack in the corner, was also awake and rubbing his eyes.

"Tell the story from the beginning, child." I looked at Little Tiger, who was a little embarrassed, blinking his eyes constantly. Afraid that he would be shy, I eased the situation for him.

It turned out that when Big Fool returned to the "base camp" just now, he ran into our quartermaster, Monk Du Er's wife, "Fierce Yaksha" Liu on the way. Big Fool asked her what was going on. She said, "They can't spare their hands, one is on guard, and one has to listen to the news." "They" referred to by Liu were Du Er and her nephew Liu Wu. Liu then told Big Fool that Liu Wu had just received an urgent telegram from Beiping, saying that Tsurumi had already arrived outside the customs, and at the latest, in one day and one night, and at the earliest, this afternoon, he would arrive in Tianjin, hoping that our people here would meet in Tianjin. The matter was very urgent and important. Liu Wu was flustered after receiving this urgent telegram. Fortunately, when Big Fool went back to get food for the first time, he inadvertently explained our location, which was in the mountain depression under Shuangyang Bridge. Since Du Er and Liu Wu couldn't leave, Liu had to "grope" her way here.

Because the matter was so urgent and he was afraid that Liu's report was inaccurate, Big Fool turned his army back to the "base camp," first read the telegram, and then talked directly with Beiping. After clarifying everything, he went on his own initiative to Yaoqun's temporary office in Shuangyi Bridge and asked Buyi Sa'fu to arrange a few cars as preparation for everyone's departure. Buyi Sa'fu was not as agreeable as he had hoped and only kept asking Big Fool, "What do you need cars for? Where are you going?" In a hurry, Big Fool took out his pistol and forced Buyi Sa'fu to make a phone call.

Buyi Sa'fu certainly didn't fall for this and used her skills to take away Big Fool's pistol. Fortunately, our heroes from outside the pass, Lao Long and Wu Rui, were also there, so they also brandished their weapons, and only then were they able to force Buyi Sa'fu. However, Buyi Sa'fu repeatedly demanded to hear the "captain's" (i.e., Yaoqun) order before she would obey. The matter had reached a deadlock, and Big Fool didn't dare to leave, so he used a whistle to transmit the sound from a distance—because Buyi Sa'fu was very fierce, and he was afraid that Lao Long and Wu Rui wouldn't be able to restrain her, and an accident would happen. The "Variety Show" that Little Tiger mentioned was the nickname he gave to Buyi Sa'fu because she had some ambiguous tones.
