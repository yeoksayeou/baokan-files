### Jiangnan Divided into Garrison Districts; Wang Maogong Promulgates Eight Points

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 29th] After Jiangnan was divided into garrison districts, Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, solemnly promulgated eight points to public servants and the people of the entire province: Township and village security personnel who collude with bandits, steal from bandits, or harbor bandits will be investigated and punished severely, as if they were bandits themselves. If anyone knows about bandits and does not report them, their joint security neighbors will be punished as if they were harboring bandits. Township and village heads who fail to detect bandits in advance will also be severely punished. In communist bandit cases, no bail will be allowed before the conclusion of the trial, and those who act as guarantors for bandits will be punished. All able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 45 will be organized into civil defense teams, register civilian guns, and use them for self-defense. The first-class civil defense teams will be responsible for patrolling and checking the important passages in the county, urban and rural areas. Those who are negligent in their responsibilities will be punished according to military law. Close joint defense will be established between counties and between villages, with regular sentry duties and joint suppression efforts. Those who are cowardly in the face of battle, or those who fail to cooperate with neighboring villages, will be punished according to military law. Commissioners, county magistrates, and police officers will be jointly responsible for the failure to eliminate bandits in their jurisdictions within the prescribed time limit. From now on, all bandit cases in the counties will be tried by military law.

### Supplementary National Assembly Delegate from Fenghua Not Eligible for Re-election; Decided by the Electoral Commission Yesterday After Discussion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] After Chairman Chiang was nominated as a candidate for National Assembly delegate by people from his hometown, he expressed his intention to withdraw from the election. However, the result of the National Assembly delegate vote in Fenghua showed that the people unanimously supported him as a representative with great enthusiasm, and Wang Zhengting, the candidate originally decided by the party in that county, did not receive a single vote, so he could not be supplemented as a candidate. The Fenghua County Election Office reported this to the Election Commission for instructions on how to resolve the matter. The Election Commission held its 16th meeting on the 29th and discussed the matter. The Fenghua County Election Office reported that Chairman Chiang received 107,271 votes, and a supplementary representative could not be elected. It was proposed that a re-election be held from the 11th to the 13th of next month. Based on this report, the Election Commission believes that since a supplementary representative could not be elected, the election cannot continue to be held. If the Chairman firmly declines, another election can be held. The resolution of the Election Commission is that "supplementary elections are not permitted by law."

### Invading Mongolian Troops Have Withdrawn North

### The Jiangsu High Court Accepts Its First Election Lawsuit

Jiang Guangzhao Sues Zhang Renji, Et Al.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 29th] Disputes have arisen repeatedly in various counties of Jiangsu Province regarding the regional elections for National Assembly delegates. The Jiangsu High Court accepted its first election lawsuit on the 29th. The plaintiff, Jiang Guangzhao, is a lawyer nominated by the Chinese Youth Party as a regional candidate in Jingjiang County. He is suing Chen Jicheng, the Beiping Garrison Commander, and Liu Zhixun, Zhang Renji, and the other three regional candidates nominated by the Kuomintang, for illegal election activities, requesting the court to invalidate the election votes received by the three defendants, and requesting the court to transfer the documents to the Jiangsu Provincial Election Office so that he can be temporarily issued a certificate of election. According to his complaint, the defendant Chen Jicheng, as a government and military official, had submitted an application to relinquish his candidate status, which had been reported by the military. Furthermore, the two defendants, Liu and Zhang, were only announced temporarily on the day of the election, and were not formally and legally produced. Jingjiang is located in northern Jiangsu, and except for the urban area, the whole county has been harassed by communist troops. The heads of the districts and towns are all working in the city. In this general election, except for the urban area where voters actually voted, the district heads and 34 town heads in various rural areas closed the doors and fabricated votes under the direction of Zhang Zhuan, the director of the election office, and Huang, the director of the first district, and Chen Yun, the director of the second district. This is truly fraudulent and illegal.

### Soviet Suggestions Regarding the Peace Conference with Japan; Our Authorities are Currently Considering Them; The Philippines Will Request That It Be Held in Baguio

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed on the 29th that the Soviet Union's reply to our country's preliminary meeting on the peace treaty with Japan had been delivered to the Foreign Ministry by Chargé d'Affaires Federin. The suggestion to hold a special meeting of foreign ministers in China is currently being considered by our authorities. As for the replies from Britain and the United States to our suggestions, they have not yet been received. According to reliable information, our position on the preliminary meeting on the peace treaty with Japan is extremely firm. According to the suggestion made on the 17th of this month, the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should meet to discuss the issue, and adopt a majority voting system including the approval of the four powers. On the one hand, it can take into account the opinions of countries other than the four powers, and on the other hand, it can reserve the veto power of the four powers, so as to maintain the major interests of the major countries. This is the fairest way to deal with the legal issues. The Soviet suggestions did not completely reject our suggestions, but were a very friendly consultation. There is still hope for coordination between the four powers on this issue.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 29th, United Press] The Manila Chronicle said that reliable sources say that the Philippines is now requesting that the future peace conference with Japan be held in Baguio.

[Central News Agency, Sydney, 29th] The Sydney Morning Herald said in an editorial today that Molotov's suggestion to hold a meeting of foreign ministers in January of next year to prepare for a peace treaty with Japan may not receive much support. This is because the other countries in the Foreign Ministers' Conference have accepted the principle that the peace treaty should be drawn up by the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission, not by the five great powers.

### Drafting the Presidential Office Organization Law; The Civil Affairs Office of the National Government is Handling This Carefully; Three Parties Continue to Confer on the Nomination of Legislative Council Members

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The National Assembly is about to open, and constitutional government is imminent. The Civil Affairs Office of the National Government is currently working on drafting the Presidential Office Organization Law. However, because our country has no precedent, there is a lack of blueprints for reference during the drafting process, so those responsible for handling this matter are extremely cautious.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] After the State Council passed the postponement of the Legislative Council election by one month, the impact of this is that it does not comply with the Constitution, because the Constitution stipulates that the Legislative Council must be established within one month after the National Assembly closes. Now the Legislative Council election will have to be held until January 10th, so it will inevitably violate the Constitution. Some people are paying close attention to this. Authoritative sources believe that postponing the National Assembly is also a violation of the Constitution, so it is possible to hold the opening ceremony as scheduled and then hold the congress. At the same time, the results of the current election are still unknown. If less than half of the representatives are elected, then the meeting cannot be held, and it cannot be said to be a violation of the Constitution. Xu Chuanlin of the Democratic Socialist Party said that everything depends on the situation at that time. According to an observer, if the National Assembly is held as scheduled, but the Legislative Council has not been established, then the Premier of the Executive Yuan, even if appointed by the President, cannot be reorganized and established without the consent of the Legislative Council. Therefore, a "caretaker government" may appear to maintain this transition period, but this system can only be implemented under unavoidable circumstances. It is not yet certain whether China must be forced to such a situation and not have a caretaker government.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] On the afternoon of the 29th, Kuomintang members continued to invite members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Chinese Youth Party to discuss the list of candidates nominated by political parties for the Legislative Council. The main purpose was still to coordinate the selection of candidates and regions, but it is reported that no results were obtained. At the same time, the participants also discussed the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Chinese Youth Party participating in local public opinion institutions. After discussion, a solution was reached. It is also learned that Yang Junming of the Democratic Socialist Party visited Gan Naiguang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, on the morning of the 29th, requesting that the list of senators previously submitted by Lei Zhen be submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion as soon as possible, and then submitted to the State Council for filing, so that the election of senators could be handled as soon as possible.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The work of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the Election Guidance Committee in reviewing the lists of Legislative Council candidates of the three parties in groups has come to an end again. Only the third group met on the 29th. It is reported that in the lists of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Chinese Youth Party, it was discovered that they had nominated candidates jointly in some regions. Although meetings were held for several days to try to arrange this, more than 30 people could not be allocated due to the factual organization. The nine-member small group meeting of the three parties was held at the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters on the afternoon of the 29th to discuss ways to seek a solution.

### Electoral Commission Decides on Method for Preserving Ballots

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Regarding the question of how to preserve the National Assembly election ballots after the results have been counted, the General Election Affairs Office has decided on the following method: "For all voting books and vote-counting minutes related to the National Assembly delegate elections, a copy must be made for the purpose of allowing voters or candidates to request to read them. The originals must be preserved for six years. As for the preservation of election ballots, except for those that need to be destroyed after a ruling on an election lawsuit, all other election ballots must be preserved by the competent election authorities for six months after the National Assembly convenes before they can be destroyed."

### The Electoral Commission Seriously Issues National Assembly Delegate Election Certificates

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The National Assembly delegate election certificates will only be issued after the election results from all over the country have been reported to the Electoral Commission, and the Electoral Commission has verified that there are no errors. The Electoral Commission is extremely cautious about this procedure, so it will soon issue a circular to all election offices throughout the country to comply with.

### Supplementary Regulations for the Enforcement Regulations of the Election and Recall of National Assembly Delegates and Legislative Council Members

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Legislative Council today passed an amendment to Article 6 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Election and Recall of National Assembly Delegates and Legislative Council Members, adding an item after the original text, so that people from various occupational groups who participated in the Constituent Assembly last year can participate in this year's general election. These workers include teachers, technicians, and specialized workers. The amended articles of Article 6 of the two regulations are as follows:

Draft Amendment to Article 6 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Election and Recall of National Assembly Delegates: Article 6 Occupational groups and women's groups participating in the election are limited to those who have been legally registered with their competent authorities. However, workers from various industries who participated in the National Assembly delegate elections to formulate the Constitution may have their qualifications reviewed by their competent authorities and compiled into a roster to be approved for participation in the election if their groups have not completed the registration procedures.

### The Current Legislative Council Will End; Regular Meetings Will Be Held Weekly Next Month to Clear Accumulated Cases; Yesterday's Meeting Passed Eleven Important Cases

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Legislative Council held its 340th regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 29th, with Dean Sun serving as the chairman. At the end of the meeting, he announced that although the Legislative Council election had been extended by one month, the current Legislative Council was about to end. Therefore, it is planned to hold a regular meeting once a week next month to clear accumulated cases and complete the closing procedures.

One item was added after the original text of Article 6 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Election and Recall of National Assembly Delegates and Legislative Council Members.

### The Legislative Council Urges the Executive Yuan to Formulate the Special Construction Donation Regulations as Quickly as Possible

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Legislative Council member Zuo Gong and 26 others submitted a temporary motion at today's Legislative Council meeting, suggesting that the Executive Yuan be urged to formulate the Special Construction Donation Regulations as soon as possible and submit them to the Legislative Council for review. The motion pointed out that the decision to collect the Special Construction Donation has been made for a long time. The Legislative Council, the Senate, and other relevant institutions have held symposiums to provide opinions, and the National Economic Commission has also discussed it repeatedly. The regulations should be drafted by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Legislative Council for completion of the legislative process and implementation. However, a long time has passed, and the regulations have not yet been drafted and submitted to the Legislative Council. Proposer Zuo Gong stood up during the discussion and explained two points: Although the government's revenue has increased, its expenditures have also increased, and the revenue and expenditure situation is still very insufficient. Since the Special Construction Donation has been decided to be collected, it should be urged to be handled quickly. According to incomplete news, France, which is included in the American aid to Europe plan, also has a very severe economic situation. France has drafted a method to use the deposits of its citizens in the United States, which is worthy of attention. After Zuo's explanation, most of the Legislative Council members applauded, and the motion was passed. The council decided to ask the Executive Yuan to draft the regulations as soon as possible and submit them to the council for review.

### Two Subcommittees of the Far Eastern Economic Commission Hold Secret Meetings; Jiang Tingfu Will Leave the Meeting Due to Official Business

[Central News Agency, Baguio, 29th] The two subcommittees appointed by the Asian and Far Eastern Economic Commission held secret meetings at the Assembly Hall at 10:30 AM on the 29th, which lasted for one hour. Filipino representative Guadenno was elected as chairman of the first subcommittee, Hong Kong representative Luo Jun was elected as vice-chairman, British representative Stent was elected as secretary, Burmese representative U Ka Si was elected as chairman of the second subcommittee, and French representative Rosenfeld was elected as secretary.

### Amendment to the Regulations for Penalizing Transactions of Gold and Foreign Currency

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 29th] The Legislative Yuan passed this morning the amended Regulations for Penalizing Transactions of Gold and Foreign Currency. The Ministry of Finance, in view of the original regulations stipulating that anyone carrying foreign currency into the country should exchange it for national currency at the local Central Bank or its designated exchange within the day of entry, and those who conceal it without reporting would have it confiscated, recognized that this was tantamount to a prohibition on all foreign currency imports regardless of the amount, causing considerable difficulties in implementation, especially for returning overseas Chinese. Therefore, it was requested that the regulations be amended to allow both Chinese and foreign nationals entering the country to carry up to US$100 or its equivalent in other foreign currencies. Those exceeding this limit should automatically register with customs and exchange the excess for national currency at the local Central Bank or its designated exchange on the day of entry. The proposal was submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan and reviewed by the Criminal Law, Finance, and Economic Committees. They generally agreed that some overseas Chinese returning to the country for business purposes, carrying foreign currency or gold, would be unable to exchange it back when leaving the country if forced to convert it into legal tender. Therefore, it was decided that those entering or transiting the country would be allowed to carry up to ten taels of gold and US$100 in foreign currency per person. For amounts exceeding these limits, those entering the country should exchange them for national currency at the market price with the Central Bank, while those transiting the country could deposit them with customs for safekeeping for a fixed period (originally proposed as two months) and reclaim them upon departure. If unclaimed after the deadline, they would be exchanged for national currency by the Central Bank. During the Legislative Yuan's discussion today, various legislators expressed opinions, with some considering the two-month deadline too short and others finding the regulations too strict. Chen Ruxuan also argued that the imbalance between the black market and official exchange rates would render these restrictions ineffective. Ultimately, the amended regulations as reviewed by the three committees were adopted with slight modifications. The deadline for transit passengers to reclaim foreign currency and gold deposited with customs before departure was extended from two to six months, which was unanimously approved. (The full text of the regulations is printed on the left corner of page two.)

### Implementation Measures for Supplementary Regulations on the Election of National Assembly Representatives and Legislators

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Yesterday, the State Council discussed and approved the implementation measures for the supplementary regulations on the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators, as drafted by the Election Headquarters. The details of the measures are as follows:

The supplementary regulations on the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators were promulgated by the National Government on November 13th and have been in effect since the date of promulgation. All provinces and cities, whether unable to conduct elections entirely or partially, or able to conduct elections according to the original procedures, and provinces, cities, counties, and equivalent administrative units that had elections disrupted by bandits and are resuming them, should follow the provisions of these regulations to ensure uniformity. The following implementation measures are hereby formulated by this headquarters.

Article 1 of the supplementary regulations refers to provinces, regions, counties, cities, and equivalent administrative areas or organizations that are entirely unable to conduct elections. If, on the date of arrival of these measures, elections remain entirely or partially unfeasible, the election offices in the respective provinces, regions, counties, and cities should conduct elections in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the regulations, in neighboring areas or designated locations. The locations should be determined as follows: A. If elections are entirely or partially unfeasible in the entire province or within various regions of the province, they should be temporarily conducted at the location of the provincial or regional election office. B. If elections are entirely or partially unfeasible in counties, cities, and equivalent administrative units, they should be conducted at the location of the county or city election office.

The schedule for the procedures stipulated in Article 1 of the supplementary regulations should be determined by order of the higher-level election authorities. However, the voting date should not be later than December 23rd.

### Urgent Recommendations for Rescuing the Current Grave Crisis

— Du Zuozhou

War is spreading, the people are suffering, the economy is deteriorating daily, and society is being shaken to its roots. If we simply pay attention to the situation in various places, almost everywhere is filled with the phenomenon of "the people unable to make a living, complaints filling the air." How can we mitigate the current grave crisis? How can we reverse this overall situation that is gradually approaching collapse and decay? Everyone has certainly noticed that we need a major reform internally; but where this reform should begin is a major question worthy of our study.

Historical experience tells us that the governance, order, security, and danger of a country are often related to the corruption of its politics and the lives of its people. Looking at the bigger picture, the fundamental reason for the current instability can certainly be said to be a political problem, especially a problem of the people's livelihood. And in terms of future actions, apart from getting politics back on track and the economy back to normal, especially focusing on improving the people's livelihood, there is almost no other effective and simple path.

But let's not even talk about the big issue of improving the people's livelihood; today, not only are the majority of ordinary people unable to survive, but how many civil servants who are implementing national policies can survive? Today, one of the most unreasonable phenomena in politics is the distorted salary and treatment of civil servants. This unreasonable treatment seriously affects politics itself—rampant corruption and declining efficiency. Therefore, to talk about political reform, the first thing to do is to improve the treatment of civil servants. Otherwise, any high-sounding claims of clearing up officialdom and improving political efficiency are a waste of effort; any construction plans and ideals of creating a modern country are even castles in the air.

Some people believe that today is a time of total mobilization, and that as long as the war continues, the country will be unable to build, and the economic situation will be unable to improve. Therefore, the general population, especially civil servants, should suffer more at this time. This argument is specious. We must understand: (1) sound political and economic policies and improvement of the general national livelihood are the only prerequisites for guaranteeing military victory; (2) the people and civil servants tightening their belts and contributing to the country during wartime are one thing, while demanding a guarantee of a minimum standard of living is another, and they must never be confused.

As far as the situation of civil servants is concerned, today's problem is no longer whether or not to endure hardship, but rather the fundamental inability to live. The price index has long soared to eighty or ninety thousand times pre-war levels, while civil servants' salaries, before the adjustment in October, were only four or five thousand times higher; this is tantamount to forcing civil servants across the country to live on a salary that increases a few thousand-fold to meet living costs that are tens of thousands of times higher. Even if everyone adheres to the spirit of "a man of ambition does not forget that he is in danger," tightening their belts and working selflessly, they still cannot bear to see their wives crying and shivering at home. Therefore, good civil servants have no choice but to find part-time jobs to supplement their income; those who are slightly better start businesses and speculate to find a way out; those who are worse engage in embezzlement and malpractice, which is even more common; and the majority sit trapped, at a loss! Therefore, under the pressure of life, we only see the majority of civil servants becoming more and more depressed and dispirited, affecting the reduction of work efficiency; and the few who have not yet been dismissed are corrupt and lawless, unscrupulous, and help to worsen the social atmosphere. In this way, talking about getting politics on track is like a dream!

Furthermore, civil servants can endure hardship without complaint. But there should be consistency from top to bottom, sharing the hardship together, as the saying goes, "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality," so that there is no psychological "complaint when there is injustice." But today's unequal treatment in various agencies can be said to be the epitome of "inequality" and "injustice." Just imagine: the total income of a central senior official is less than that of a bank trainee; a high-ranking general is not as good as a worker in a state-run enterprise; and the income of a university professor is not even comparable to that of a rickshaw puller; what else can be said? And just imagine: while the general civil servants are in the so-called "unable to live, unable to get sick, unable to live, unable to die" miserable situation, what kind of life are the high-ranking officials and dignitaries living? Where does their money come from? The country is so poor, and some people are indulging in extravagance and licentiousness beyond modern enjoyment. With such unequal treatment, such unequal hardship and enjoyment, how can one expect ordinary civil servants to endure hardship and serve the country selflessly? How can one boost the morale of the staff and improve the efficiency of political implementation?

This distorted salary problem cannot be solved by adjusting it once every three months. It is true that the government has repeatedly added to the budget to adjust civil servants' salaries, while other budget increases are not easily approved, and we should deeply understand the government's plight; but the amount of adjustment is obviously far from keeping up with the rate at which prices rise due to stimulation. In fact, it has turned into a situation where each adjustment reduces the actual salary. In the tortoise and hare race, one can still hope that the hare will stop and sleep for a while, and the tortoise will slowly climb up; but with the linear rise in prices, and the long distance between today's salary multiple and the actual cost of living index, even if the three months were changed to adjusting it once a month, it would probably not be a solution. Therefore, civil servants, after experiencing the pain of each nominal increase but actual decrease in salary, not only do not feel interested, but only feel more and more sad! But have the current leaders ever thought about these things?

Looking again at the general social situation, we are facing an economic collapse crisis, and how should the entire country work hard together to overcome the difficulties? In reality, the entire national economic life has fallen into an extremely chaotic and contradictory state; the perfunctory attitude in politics is nowhere more evident than in economic policy. The slogan of the frugality movement is resounding, but it is a fantasy to think that this kind of advisory exhortation will shift the prevailing extravagance and waste in society. Malignant inflation, the evils of corruption, and smuggling and fraudulent business practices have long deepened the unequal distribution of social wealth. Now, it has become such a situation: people with money have too much money, and besides speculating and hoarding, they can only spend it wildly; while people without money have to cry and suffer! The country is crying poor every day, but a look at the surface of the city shows that it is too extravagant. Take Shanghai as an example, in entertainment venues, hotels, and restaurants, which one is not full of guests, with a table costing millions? Which tailor shop doesn't have suits costing hundreds of millions already ordered? Cars are speeding by, filling the streets, not necessarily all for busy official duties; various factories are forced to close down due to power outages and reduced production, but where on Tongshu Road is there not a dazzling display of neon lights? Refugees with no clothes and no food are flocking to the Huangpu River every day, "behind vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie corpses frozen to death," forming a tragic contrast! In short, the various strange phenomena of romantic extravagance and extreme luxury and desire here are probably unimaginable even to people living in New York and London. Today's prosperity in the market is not sustained by sound production, but by an unreasonable distribution and consumption; not by the improvement of national life, but by a very corrupt and decadent life and a luxurious and degenerate atmosphere. "Dancing on a volcano," can this situation really last for long?

We want to solemnly point out that this urban decadent life and luxurious and degenerate atmosphere are the biggest crisis for our country and nation; and the formation of this life and atmosphere, to put it thoroughly, is still a problem of political efficiency and economic system. In other words, precisely because there is a group of corrupt and speculative wealthy people in society, there will naturally be this kind of extravagant and decadent life and atmosphere. The former is the cause, and the latter is the effect. If we want to banish the extravagant and decadent life, we must first eliminate the opportunities for corruption and speculation, and we cannot but take drastic emergency measures in economic policy as soon as possible. Empty appeals to frugality are in vain, and will only be ridiculed by these corrupt elements who are used to extravagant and decadent lives!

Based on the above two major contradictory phenomena in politics and society, which are the root causes of all current crises, the author proposes that the government take the right medicine and immediately implement the following measures:

First, the fundamental solution to political reform should first guarantee the lives of civil servants, improve their treatment, abolish the old method of adjusting it once every three months, and adopt the regulations recently passed by the Legislative Yuan to calculate salaries according to the cost of living index, so that everyone can predict their future income and not be excessively threatened by price fluctuations. There are two major benefits to doing so: 1. "Salary" is intended to "nurture integrity." Since it can "nurture integrity," it will be easier to enforce the law to punish corruption. 2. Civil servants are spared the worry of cold and hunger, and they eliminate the resentment and injustice in their hearts due to unequal treatment, so that they can work with peace of mind and exert efficiency. In short, to achieve political integrity and enhanced efficiency, it is essential to implement index-linked salaries and improve the treatment of civil servants. This is a prerequisite for reforming politics. (Continued on page three)

### Seeking a Solution to the German Peace Treaty The Four Foreign Ministers Have Not Reached an Agreement The Soviet Union Firmly Opposes the Incorporation of the Saar into France The Question of German Unification Will Be the Focus of Future Meetings

[Report from this newspaper] London, 29th Broadcast: The Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference held its fifth meeting today. Secretary of State Acheson decided to find ways to continue the discussion of the relevant agenda, while ignoring the Soviet proposal to establish a German central government as soon as possible. Regarding the Soviet accusation that the United Kingdom and the United States were attempting to establish a government independently in western Germany, it is expected that Marshall will not offer a reply. The German peace treaty issue is still the main focus of today's agenda. It is generally believed that Molotov will continue to obstruct the meeting by claiming that a peace conference cannot be convened until a central government is established in Germany. As for the Austrian treaty, only the issue of German assets in Austria has not been resolved. The United States delegation supports the compromise plan proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault, that is, using assets that clearly belonged to Germans before the war as compensation, and having Austria pay the Soviet Union a sum of US$1, so that the Austrian treaty can be drafted as soon as possible.

[Reuters, London, 28th] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference failed to reach an agreement today on the French proposal to establish two expert committees to review the eastern and western borders of Germany. The Foreign Ministers Conference has now entered the most tense stage of the meeting and has begun to discuss the issue of German unification or division, while Molotov still firmly refuses to recognize the principle of incorporating the Saar region into France. Although the meeting did not reach an agreement on any issue throughout the day, Marshall, Bevin, and Bidault spent a lot of time explaining to Molotov that they still supported Germany having a central government and solemnly declared that they had no plans to establish a separate government in West Germany. Molotov listed the words of Western politicians to prove that there were indeed such plans. He strongly stated that the Soviet government opposed any such plans and believed that the Foreign Ministers Conference should make it clear that it supported the establishment of a German central government. Bevin replied that the United Kingdom had never formally expressed its support for the establishment of a regional government, and the British delegation was prepared to do its best to seek understanding. He also said that the United Kingdom would continue to work to establish a German central government, but a government that was not a dictatorship. Bevin continued, although it had not yet been decided what actions the United Kingdom would take if the Four Powers did not reach an agreement, under the chaotic situation in Western Europe, Molotov could not ignore it. Bevin also strongly stated that the rule of Germany by one power would be enough to cause war, and the theory of balance of power would also cause bad consequences.

### Britain Proposes Four Points on Establishing a Boundary Committee

Bevin then talked about his opinions on the establishment of a boundary committee and put forward four suggestions: 1. The four foreign ministers' representatives form one or several allied committees to review the territorial demands of Germany's neighboring countries on Germany; 2. These committees are composed of representatives of the Four Powers together with allies of Germany's neighboring countries, or allied countries that have sent troops to participate in the war against Germany, and representatives of countries that have a direct interest in the territorial demands; 3. These committees may conduct necessary investigations to determine the impact of the territorial demands on Germany and submit a report to the next Foreign Ministers Conference; 4. This strict construction must be implemented after the basic issues discussed at this Foreign Ministers Conference have reached an agreement. Marshall and Bidault expressed their acceptance of this suggestion, except for a reservation on the fourth statement. Molotov said that the border issue cannot be discussed at present. When talking about the issue of the German central government, Molotov repeatedly stated that without a central government, there could be no peace treaty. If other regions have plans for self-government, it can prove that other countries have no intention of reaching an agreement. Marshall replied that when the British-American zone merged, the Chiang country had suggested common cooperation from other zones, so the path to unification has been opened, and now all that is needed is for the other party to take action. Bidault said that Molotov was unwilling to answer Bidault's Saar issue and also refused to answer Molotov's comparison issue.

### Austria Urgently Needs Recovery Grüber Issues an Appeal

[Reuters, London, 28th] Austrian Foreign Minister Grüber delivered a speech at the lunch meeting of the British-Austrian Chamber of Commerce here today, urging the Foreign Ministers Conference to end the state of occupation of Austria. He said that Austria has been liberated and occupied for three years, like a car with four brakes, and a slight tightening of a military brake is enough to prevent Austria's recovery. He also said that if Austria can recover its oil fields, it can change its economy.

### Allied Reparations Commission Demands Increasing the Number of German Factories for Reparations

[Reuters, Brussels, 29th] The Allied Reparations Commission here passed a resolution yesterday expressing dissatisfaction with the number of German factories allocated for reparations. The commission has ordered its chairman, France's L'Huyer, to submit the resolution to the Foreign Ministers Conference in order to increase the number of German factories allocated for reparations.

### News of Soviet Atomic Bomb Test Returning Japanese Prisoners Prove It Is Not True

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] According to the Yomiuri Shimbun: The news reported earlier by the French newspaper that the Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in Irkutsk on June 15 this year has been denied by two Japanese who recently returned from the area. According to the reporter of the newspaper stationed in Beijing: They were detained in Irkutsk after surrendering, but on June 15 this year, there was no terrible explosion, fire, or vibration as reported by the French newspaper, and they had not heard of any such test being held.

### Italy and Yugoslavia Sign Barter Agreement

[Reuters, Rome, 28th] Italy and Yugoslavia signed a trade agreement in Rome today, under which Italy will import materials worth approximately 16 billion lire from Yugoslavia, mostly raw materials such as lead, copper, iron, and iron ore.

### British Fascist Leader Planning to Form New Political Party

Aims to Resist Threats from International Communist Party

[Reuters, London, 28th] Former British Fascist Union leader Mosley held a press conference in London today to announce that he and his supporters will announce the date of the formation of a new political party early next year. The 51 groups that have asked him to launch this movement have agreed to cease activities and join the new party. Among these 51 groups, there are more than a dozen right-wing groups, such as the Veterans Alliance, the British Freedom Alliance, and the British branch of the Ku Klux Klan. The purpose of the new party is to resist the threat of international communism, abolish party strife, unite national action, serve the people in times of peace, and develop Africa to help solve European problems. When asked whether this new party was a fascist organization, he replied, it is neither fascism nor democracy, as both of them were declared dead in 1939. When asked about his attitude towards treaties, Mosley replied, "I will tell the Soviet Union directly to accept the destruction of atomic weapons, accept international inspections, and withdraw from some parts of Europe that should not be occupied by the Soviet Union."

### Schumann Asks for Special Powers to Suppress Labor Unrest The French Parliament Decides to Support Government Continues to Send Troops to Coalfield Areas

[Report from this newspaper] London, 28th Broadcast: Paris News, the French National Assembly met today to support the Schumann Cabinet, preparing to respond to the call of the French Prime Minister, intending to grant emergency powers in order to take rapid and strong action to deal with the labor unrest instigated by the Communist Party. Communist members of parliament launched fierce attacks on the Schumann Cabinet. It was reported this morning that more troops had been sent to the coalfield area near Arras in the north. Many pro-Communist and Communist newspapers have been confiscated, including those calling on all French workers to do everything possible to "defend the Republic."

[United Press, Paris, 29th] Prime Minister Schumann asked the National Assembly to grant the police emergency privileges as part of the emergency measures to combat the strike of more than two million workers, led by the Communist Party, that is driving France into chaos.

The bill proposed by Schumann stipulates: 1. Temporarily increase police power; 2. Completely revise the strike law, enforce secret strike voting; 3. Dismiss those who are lazy and those who hinder the freedom of work. The government made military preparations at the same time as it made the above request, which shows that the government is deeply afraid of causing a civil war. Schumann said in his speech: "More and more foreigners are participating in destructive and disorderly actions, and we will not tolerate these people at all." Schumann insisted that the emergency measures must be passed today and made effective immediately. The parliament adjourned at this point.

[United Press, Paris, 29th] The French government has begun actual mobilization late on the 28th, preparing for civil war. The Schumann Cabinet has called up 80,000 soldiers.

### US Senate to Vote Tomorrow on Emergency Aid Bill to France, Italy, and Austria Relief Funds Must Not Be Used to Purchase Military Equipment

[US Information Office, Washington, 28th] The Senate adjourned today and will reopen next Monday. There will be no other action except for the final vote on the temporary relief bill. It is generally expected that the House of Representatives will receive the temporary relief bill for France, Italy, and Austria (China may also be included) drafted by the Foreign Affairs Committee within the next week. Aid funds for China are not included in the Senate's $597 million bill.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] US Republican Senator Taft lashed out against the foreign aid bill in the Senate on the 28th, saying: The State Department's attitude toward the foreign aid bill is based on a completely wrong point of view. If we pass the bill, this point of view will cause the complete collapse of the United States. Although Taft criticized the State Department's plan, he also declared: He is willing to vote in favor of the $597 million aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria. He said that he would fight to reduce the long-term Marshall Plan by tens of billions. Taft said: The current situation was caused by Roosevelt and Truman's concessions to the Soviet Union during their tenure, and said that the two should bear all the responsibility for the Soviet Union's current strong position and the need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars for foreign relief. He also said: A self-sufficient and healthy industrial economy in Germany is extremely important for the prosperity of Europe. The dismantling of German factories proves that the Potsdam Agreement is still the basic policy of the United States towards Germany. Socialism in Western European countries is preventing the recovery of these countries, and the massive distribution of dollars is not a solution. The Senate passed two amendments, the first to allow US officials to freely collect information on the distribution of relief supplies; the second is to prohibit the use of relief funds to purchase military equipment.

### US Congressman Advocates Restoring Gold Coin System

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Congressman Buford declared in the House today that the United States must restore the gold standard, which is an effective cure for inflation. I will soon introduce a bill to restore private ownership of gold and adopt a gold coin system. If Congress does not take effective measures to deal with rising prices immediately, the people will no longer save.

### Left-Wingers Once Occupy City Hall Milan Has Returned to Normal Government Allows Left-Wing Mayor to Continue Serving

[United Press, Milan, 29th] More than 10,000 left-wingers, led by wartime guerrillas, occupied Milan City Hall yesterday to protest the government's removal of the left-wing Mayor Trollo from his post. The government side confirmed that the military had ordered Milan to be placed under military control.

Another telegram The left-wingers occupying Milan City Hall have withdrawn voluntarily this morning.

[Reuters, Milan, 29th] Officials announced: The general strike held by Milan workers yesterday ended this morning. The wartime guerrillas who occupied the city hall have also withdrawn. After overnight negotiations between the citizens' committee that organized the strike and the military and political authorities, an understanding has been reached to allow Mr. Trollo to continue serving in the next few days. The city has now returned to normal.

### The Holy Land Partition Plan Vote Postponed Again: Arab States Show Signs of Compromise; Direct Negotiations Possible Between Both Parties

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 29th (Broadcast): Lake Success dispatch - Arab officials held private meetings in their residences today to discuss new compromise proposals, hoping to achieve a resolution on the Holy Land partition issue at the United Nations General Assembly. A spokesperson for the Arab delegation declined to comment, but it is widely believed that the establishment of a joint Jewish-Arab federation is a possible basis for compromise.

[Reuters, Lucerne, 28th] The final decision on the fate of Palestine has been postponed again. The General Assembly passed a French proposal tonight, resolving to postpone the vote on the Palestine partition plan for 24 hours. Before the General Assembly decided to reschedule the meeting, China announced that it would abstain from voting on the Palestine partition plan.

[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 28th] It is reported that the French delegation discussed the possibility of taking last-minute compromise actions with several Arab delegations. Arab delegation leaders held discussions today on compromise actions. Lebanese representative Mr. Jammal visited UN General Assembly President Aranha to discuss this matter. Mr. Jammal stated that even at this last moment, compromise negotiations may still be possible. He believes that if the Arab representatives attending the UN General Assembly, rather than the Palestinian Higher Committee, directly negotiate with Jewish leaders, better results can be expected. Well-informed observers believe that some Arab countries may be seeking to buy time, while others genuinely consider the possibility of bloodshed. In any case, it is highly possible that the Arab countries will put forward a compromise proposal on the 29th. If so, the resolution on Palestine will be delayed for weeks or even months.

### Truman Postpones Presentation of the US Long-Term Aid to Europe Plan

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] President Truman is scheduled to leave Washington for a vacation in Key West, Florida, on December 3rd and return to Washington on the 8th. According to Presidential Press Secretary Ross, the President's message to Congress regarding the long-term European recovery plan will likely not be completed before the President's return. Ross also said that whether the President will recommend the establishment of a new agency to manage the long-term aid plan is still under consideration. The delay in presenting the message is due to the unresolved management issues.

### French World War II General Leclerc Dies in Plane Crash

[United Press, Paris, 28th] The Air Force announced tonight that General Leclerc, the commander of the Free French forces in North Africa and a famous general of World War II, died in a plane crash in North Africa today at the age of 46.

### Prime Minister Katayama Solemnly Denies Rumors of a Japanese Underground Government; Admits that Feudal Forces Still Exist

[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 29th] At today's plenary session of the House of Councillors, Mr. Hani Goro questioned the existence of an underground organization, saying: "Rumors say that there is an underground organization in Japan. Chief Cabinet Secretary Nishio has denied this, but there are indeed violent groups hindering free national elections. If the right-wing forces and violent groups that caused the war are not eradicated promptly, international trust will not be obtained."

### Emergency Recommendations to Save the Current Serious Crisis (Continued from Page 2)

Second, resources must be controlled, and rationing must be universal. The government should make these two tasks the core of its economic policies to enhance its ability to reasonably allocate resources and improve the economic life of the people, thereby eliminating the current state of chaos and contradiction. Regarding resources, the government should select the most important daily necessities, such as food, cotton cloth, cooking oil, soap, and cigarettes, and first implement large-scale and strict control, and implement fair and reasonable rationing, from public school teachers to the general public. With reasonable control of resources, it will be easier to prohibit all hoarding and manipulation, and prices can be expected to stabilize. At the same time, with rational rationing of certain daily necessities, everyone can live according to prescribed standards. Those in power cannot enjoy them casually, and the poor will not suffer from being unable to survive. If so, what is the use of hoarding resources? We see that Britain implemented this system during the war, which enabled them to win the war against Germany, and after the war, due to the dollar panic and severe economic crisis, the government's control of resources was even stricter than during the war. In today's British markets, even pork and eggs are subject to strict rationing. With daily needs subject to certain restrictions, even the king and prime minister cannot enjoy exceptions. The perfection of this British economic system and the spirit of the people's consistent compliance with the law from top to bottom are truly worthy of our reflection and emulation.

When implementing the above two measures, one may also consider that: basing salaries on the price index will sharply increase the burden on the national treasury and will inevitably repeat the cycle of inflation and price increases; China's political organization and social customs are not as advanced as Britain's, and rashly implementing resource control and rationing will inevitably result in more harm than good. These concerns are not without reason. Therefore, I further advocate:

Third, adjusting the treatment of public school teachers based on the cost-of-living index must be carried out simultaneously with streamlining the government and unifying the treatment of various agencies. This is not only to increase the funds available for improving treatment, but also to improve political efficiency. It is undeniable that the current central and local agencies are mostly large and bloated, with overlapping functions. Agencies with duplicate and conflicting business natures should be cut back and merged; unnecessary redundant personnel should be dismissed and transferred to other jobs. In this way, I believe that the money saved will certainly be no small amount, and using it to improve treatment will make a limited difference. Otherwise, overlapping agencies will repeatedly waste national funds and support a large number of officials who are not well-fed or warmly clothed, "chicken ribs to people", which is better to release them as soon as possible. As for the treatment of various agencies, the central government should conduct overall planning and uniform regulations based on the principles of "equal pay for equal rank" and "equal pay for equal work," so that treatment is based only on the nature of the work and the performance of the service, and not on the wealth of the agency, each determining its own level. This is the only way to break the unreasonable phenomenon of uneven labor and unequal treatment.

Fourth, the control and rationing of resources is indeed a complicated and heavy task, and it is inevitable to have malpractices; but we must use this system to learn the spirit of experimentation, to use drastic measures, and to build a progressive foundation for our political and economic system with the determination to break the boat. If Britain can do it, why can't we? China's modernization should catch up and should start with the transformation of politics and economy. The government and the people must cooperate effectively. The people demand security in life. The government should be responsible; since the government wants to severely punish corruption, the people should be sure to report it. As long as there is no problem in principle with a system of cultivation, there is no need to be afraid of not having a method in terms of skill. Especially in the control and rationing of resources, we should regard it as a major key to turning the entire national economy from danger to safety, allowing no success and no failure. We want to take this opportunity to shift the social atmosphere and implement genuine thrift. Under resource control, there must be no act of cunningly plundering and speculative profiteering; under the in-kind rationing system, there must be no special enjoyment of any dignitaries and wealthy classes. Only in this way can we overcome the general social psychological injustice and shift people's perceptions of the government; and only in this way can we cultivate a good atmosphere in which the whole country shares the same work and rest, sharing joys and hardships. The cooperation between the government and the people can only be established in this atmosphere, and there is no reason why any national disaster cannot be overcome.

The way to build a country is multifaceted. In response to the current crisis, we call for efforts to save it. In terms of political economy, the best way to prescribe the right medicine is to prescribe the right medicine. Looking at the overall situation, the military cannot end at this time, and the acceleration of currency inflation and circulation, and the increasingly fierce rise in prices, seem to be inevitable trends. Leading foreign aid is short-lived, not to mention that American loans also have other requirements. Faced with the unprecedented crisis of the country, "poverty leads to change, change leads to success," a clear-minded political effort to stabilize the economy cannot be delayed! We hope that all parties will jointly study and promote its realization! (End)

We would like to know how the Prime Minister will resolve this issue before the summit? Prime Minister Katayama replied: There is no secret government in Japan today, and so-called violent revolution is impossible. Since the end of the war, the grounds for undemocratic behavior that may have occurred have collapsed. However, organizations such as feudal "old men" and "rogues" cannot be said to be absent, but since the government formed its cabinet, it has worked hard to destroy such feudal organizations, and will take decisive measures in the future.

### The First Japanese Parliament Extends its Session for the Fourth Time to Connect with the Second Parliament

Therefore, the first parliament has been extended to December 9th, the day before the second parliament.

### Police Department, City Government, and Central Bank Take Responsibility for Stabilizing Prices; Jointly Form Economic Implementation Agency; Have the Right to Impose the Death Penalty on Profiteering Merchants; General Survey of Bank Notes Began Yesterday

Regarding the issue of rising prices in our city, since Chairman Chiang ordered the Preparatory Department, the Municipal Government, and the Central Bank to be responsible for thoroughly investigating the matter, Mayor Wu, President Zhang, and Commander Xuan have made immediate decisions after days of discussion. As a result, the principle of suppressing and stabilizing prices has been determined, starting with a thorough investigation of the black market for gold and currency. In addition, two measures have been decided: 1. The Four-Bank Joint Office will tighten loans; 2. The Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Central Bank will send representatives to jointly investigate the financial dealings of all banks and businesses in the city, and pursue illegal transactions, speculative manipulations, or merchants who attempt to obtain foreign exchange based on the notes. This measure was submitted to Chairman Chiang for his personal review, and he immediately approved its implementation. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government Preparatory Department and the Central Bank sent officers on the morning of yesterday to fully launch the work of inspecting various bank notes. According to a reporter from the East China News Agency, the initial inspection yesterday has yielded clues, and prices have begun to fall across the board yesterday.

According to a spokesperson for the Garrison Headquarters yesterday, Mayor Wu, President Zhang, Commander Xuan, and others have held several consultations and have concrete measures to suppress and stabilize prices in the city, which have been approved by the highest authorities and will be implemented soon. The city government and the Central Bank jointly launched a full-scale inspection of bank notes, which is only the first part of the measures. The biggest purpose of the price stabilization measures prepared this time is how to permanently stabilize prices in the city. In other words, it is how to prevent prices from fluctuating again. Regarding the implementation of this thorough method, the highest authorities believe that an independent agency must be effectively responsible. Therefore, they have ordered the three parties to jointly form an economic implementation agency, which is now being prepared and is expected to be formally established on December 1st. Future work will start from the root and will never be piecemeal. Finally, he also announced that the Garrison Headquarters will jointly launch effective price stabilization measures with the city government and the Central Bank tomorrow (December 1st), and will further implement them. The highest authorities fear that the implementation of the measures will be obstructed, so they have been given "national rights." The so-called "national rights" mean that the state has the right to impose the death penalty on profiteering merchants who manipulate prices. In other words, the soon-to-be-established economic implementation agency has been granted the power of resolute measures. In the future, profiteering merchants will be punished according to the General Mobilization Order Law, depending on the severity of the circumstances, and will be punished by military law. Those with serious cases will be sentenced to death, he said.

### Two Black Market Gold and Currency Cases Uncovered

Yesterday, all economic police officers in the Municipal Police Department began to intensify their surveillance of various markets and uncovered two cases of gold and currency trading yesterday morning: 1. Yu Linhua Firm at No. 21, Lane 126, North Sichuan Road, was found to be trading gold and currency on the black market. Two gold bars were confiscated, and manager Hong Qianbo and employee He Menglin were arrested and are being interrogated. 2. Linsen Department Store across from the Cathay Grand Theater on Linsen Road was reported to be suspected of buying and selling gold and currency. Yesterday, employee Yuan Xianji, apprentice Feng Xuezheng, and broker Wang Tingfang were arrested. 100 million yuan in cash was found on Wang's body. A gold bar and a gold chain were found on the apprentice's body. A gold bracelet, a gold locket, and a pair of gold earrings were also found in the store.

### Ji He Long Case of Illegally Obtaining Foreign Exchange to be Handed Over to the District Attorney's Office for Prosecution

The Municipal Police Department recently uncovered a case of Ji Hehui Company at No. 27, Lane 110, Jixiang Street, illegally obtaining foreign exchange based on a secret report. The company's business scope is quite large, with the operation of imports, and code books, telegram drafts, and account books were confiscated on the spot and transferred to the liaison specialist sent by the Central Bank to be stationed at the Police Department for review. Manager Wu Chengyi and bookkeeper Chen Bonian were arrested and confessed without denial. The Police Department submitted the case to the Municipal Government for instructions. Yesterday, instructions were received that the case had been approved by the Ministry of Finance, which ordered compliance with Article 33 of the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Management Regulations, which states that those who operate foreign exchange and foreign currency securities without being designated banks shall have their foreign exchange confiscated and be sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years. After receiving the order, the Police Department will hand over the entire case to the District Attorney's Office for prosecution next week.

### Recounting of Regional National Representative Election Tickets to be Completed Tomorrow Night; Supplementary Regulations Supporting Political Parties Have Minimal Impact

(Report from this newspaper) The recounting of votes for the regional elections of the National Assembly in this city will be completed tomorrow night, and the official announcement can be made in major newspapers on the 2nd or 3rd. In addition, the supplementary regulations supporting political party candidates passed by the State Council on Thursday have no impact on the top ten representatives in this city, and have little impact even on professional groups.

### Perspectives of Three Party Representatives on the General Election

(Report from this newspaper) A reporter specifically asked people from the Kuomintang, the China Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party about their views on the general election, and received the following answers: 1. Kuomintang personnel believe that they have the certainty of controlling the overall situation in this election, but they still strive to win over voters in a democratic manner. Taking Shanghai as an example, candidates Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, and Wang Yao have carried out the activities that modern elections should have in an open manner, hoping to establish a good model for China's democratic politics. They have also tried their best to assist the elections of friendly parties and expressed regret for the failure of Jin Houcheng to be elected due to his lack of campaign activities. In addition, many blank and invalid votes were cast by voters in this election, which is related to the educational level of voters. Therefore, they deeply feel that if China wants to achieve democracy, it must popularize education. 2. Zhang Bo, Standing Committee Member of the China Youth Party, said: The National Assembly election in this city was orderly and there were no incidents. In the election process, friendly parties were able to understand the needs of the country today and sincerely assist, which is very satisfactory. However, the situation in other regions of the country is different. The situation in Chongqing is still good, but the situation in other places is not. We sincerely hope that all parties will cooperate to pass this general election and establish a democratic model for our country. 3. The Democratic Socialist Party has suffered a disastrous defeat in this National Assembly election. It is reported that Zhang Junmai has urgently telegraphed Nanjing, requesting the Central Committee of the Kuomintang to fulfill its guarantee of seats. The party pins high hopes on the supplementary regulations for the election of party members and candidates by the State Council the day before yesterday. However, in terms of the rankings of the National Assembly representatives in this city, among the top ten representatives elected, two are social elites and eight are nominated by political parties, which is not inconsistent with the supplementary regulations. Therefore, all parties are very concerned about how the Central Committee intends to resolve this matter.

### Hubei Ship Seized 1 Billion Yuan of Smuggled Goods

On the 27th of this month, the Taikoo Company's Hubei ship sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs of this port learned that the ship was loaded with smuggled goods.

### Many New Clues Obtained in the Case of Corruption by Customs Officials; More Than a Dozen People Listed on the Blacklist

Regarding the case of several Jianghai Customs officials using their authority to collude with merchants and continuously commit corruption, there were important new developments yesterday. The case is serious and complicated, involving a wide range of people. After receiving secret reports and investigation reports, the highest authorities were extremely angry and approved the order of the Ministry of National Defense to strictly handle the case according to law. The Ministry of National Defense sent Director Li Xicheng to take charge of the case. After Mr. Li came to Shanghai, he once returned to Beijing to report and has come to Shanghai again to preside over the new actions to handle the case. It is reported that the case handling authorities obtained many new clues in the confessions of Jianghai Customs assistants Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Baohui, and other importers and exporters who were arrested and interrogated. Based on these confessions, the inspection personnel of the Garrison Headquarters began to arrest the relevant criminals starting on the evening of the 29th. More than a dozen people were listed on the blacklist, some of whom are officials of relevant agencies and some of whom are importers and exporters.

### Preparatory Meeting Held to Discuss the Election of Supervisory Committee Members; Opening Ceremony to be Held as Scheduled if No Clear Order is Received Before the 1st

(Report from this newspaper) The Civil Affairs Bureau and the Secretariat of the Municipal Council held a preparatory meeting yesterday morning to discuss matters related to the election of supervisory committee members. Director Zhang Xiaosong, Secretary-General Xiang, Chief Secretary of the Civil Affairs Bureau Li Xuexun, Chief of the First Section Chen Minshu, Chief Secretary of the Council Bu Shenghua, and Director of General Affairs Zhao Gongwang attended the meeting. The results of the discussion were that although the State Council had passed the extension of the election of supervisory committee members from December 16 to December 21 to allow the Civil Youth Party to participate in the Provincial Council, it did not express anything about participating in the Municipal Council, and the Civil Youth Party requested one-fifth of the seats, while there are only twelve supervisory committee members in this city, and the distribution of the seats is itself a problem. Therefore, it was decided not to extend the election. If there is no order before the voting date of December 7, the votes will still be counted according to the original schedule. At the same time, if no clear order is received before December 1, the opening ceremony of the election meeting will still be held at 9:00 am on the 1st. Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan have agreed to the above measures.

Yesterday, Director Ji of the Social Affairs Bureau told reporters that the reason for the recent rice price fluctuations was that a cement boat sank under a bridge near Huangdu in the Wusong River on the 23rd, blocking the grain ships from coming to Shanghai, which affected rice prices. The ship was towed away on the afternoon of the 27th, and transportation has been restored and supply is abundant.

### Fifty Crates of Lead Sheets Imported Through Fraud: Official-Business Collusion to Alter Bills of Lading; the Import/Export Control Commission Supports Ling Chongren and Three Others; District Attorney's Office Files Public Prosecution on Corruption Charges

[Our Report] Ling Chongren, a staff member of the Provisional Import Management Committee, Chen Ruihao, manager of Shi Lin Import Company, Zou Zichun (i.e. Zhou Zichun), representative of Yuda Company, and Tong Rongsheng, a tobacco merchant, were accused of official-business collusion, altering bills of lading, and obtaining import permits. Yesterday, the District Attorney's Office filed a public prosecution. The facts of the prosecution are as follows: Shi Lin Company, located at 330 North Sichuan Road, is engaged in import and export business. Its manager, Chen Ruihao, applied to the Provisional Import Management Committee on December 6 of last year to import 200 crates of lead sheets from the United States.

The application was rejected. Later, on June 10 of this year, regarding 50 crates of the goods that had already been sold to Zou Zichun (i.e. Zhou Zichun), representative of Yuda Company, he still used the name of the import company to fill out an application for an import permit. The date of shipment in the application was falsely filled in as December 22, 1946, according to the Western calendar. Through the introduction of Hua Rong Sheng, with the help of Ling Chongren, a staff member of the committee, the shipment date was changed to December 22, 1946. On June 30 of this year, they received a notification from the Bank of China and obtained import permit number 000277 for 50 crates and the bill of lading. Zou Zichun and Chen Ruihao agreed to give Ling Chongren

Nine Crates of Lead Sheets as Compensation

On July 2 of this year, Zou Zichun invited Tong Rongsheng, Ling Chongren, and Chen Ruihao to a gathering at Xinghuali on Fourth Horse Road. Ling Chongren requested that the price of nine crates of lead sheets, 14 million yuan, be paid in advance. Tong Rongsheng issued a receipt for the payment, which was received and kept by Zou Zichun. The actual shipment date of these 50 crates of lead sheets was March 20 of this year. The bill of lading currently stored in the Bank of China also records the date as March 20. After Chen Ruihao and Zou Zichun obtained the import permit for these 50 crates, they altered the shipment date on the bill of lading to March 20 of this year and declared the goods at customs. The customs authorities mistakenly used

X-Ray Examination of the Delivery Order

and discovered the alteration. They reported the situation to the Import/Export Control Commission, which transferred the case to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. After investigation by Prosecutor Shen, it was determined that the defendant Ling Chongren was suspected of violating Article 3, Section 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, as well as Article 211 of the Criminal Code. He should be punished according to the more severe provision in Article 55 of the same law. Tong Rongsheng and others were suspected of violating Article 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, as well as Article 30 of the Criminal Code and Article 3, Section 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption. Chen Ruihao and Zou Zichun were suspected of violating Article 30 of the Criminal Code, Article 3, Section 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, and Article 216 of the Criminal Code (applying the punishment of Article 211). They should be punished according to the more severe provision in Article 55 of the same law. In accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a lawsuit was filed.

### Pilot Strike Remains Deadlocked; Copper Sand Association's Chinese Pilots Express Refusal to Cooperate with Customs; Jin Yueshi Explains Demands Are Not Excessive

[Our Report] The pilot strike incident showed no sign of resolution yesterday. The number of White Russian pilots temporarily hired by customs has increased to six, while the Chinese pilots appointed by the Maritime Administration have not reported for duty. There are a total of eighteen Chinese pilots licensed by the Ministry of Communications. Since September of this year, they have formed the Shanghai Copper Sand Pilot Association. They refuse to cooperate and have stated their unwillingness to be managed by customs. Jin Yueshi, Chairman of the Copper Sand Pilot Association, held a reception for reporters yesterday. He believes that the foreign pilots' request to increase pilotage fees is not unreasonable. An income of 60 million yuan per month is not only not "aristocratic" but is actually too low, as the monthly income of an ordinary captain of a small ocean-going vessel is 1,000 US dollars, while the qualifications of a pilot are higher than those of a captain, and the responsibilities are extremely heavy. In terms of their work value, they should receive a compensation of 1,500 US dollars per month. The shipping companies have already expressed their willingness to meet the demands of the foreign pilots, and Jin believes that the reason why customs is firmly refusing is due to political reasons. The key lies in the transfer of pilot management to the Maritime Administration of the Ministry of Communications starting in January of next year.

Ocean-going Vessels Will Not Be Disrupted

In the past, Chinese pilots had requested customs to allow them to work as pilots, but customs repeatedly delayed their requests. Therefore, they are unwilling to be driven by customs at this time of need. Their hopes are: (1) Customs proposes to transfer management authority; (2) The Ministry of Communications allocates funds or provides bank guarantees for loans to organize pilotage services. In this deadlocked situation, two ocean-going vessels, the "Sogretla" and "Hamram," left the port yesterday, both led by White Russian pilots. In addition, some transport ships directly contacted Chinese pilots to serve as pilots, so the transportation is not too hindered.

### Jewelry Store Dismissal Dispute: Employees Post Slogans and Go on Hunger Strike

In addition, the employees of the Jin Tiansai Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road went on a hunger strike from noon yesterday to protest the unresolved dismissal issue. The labor union is currently trying to dissuade them. It is reported that the management has expressed its willingness to accept the issuance of gold as severance pay, and the current dispute is only over the amount.

It is especially hoped that female compatriots will show sympathy and provide more assistance so that the association's planned projects can be implemented and completed.

### Footprint Verification: Xingye Pawnshop Theft Case Solved; Large Amount of Jewelry Found in Hole

(Our Report) At Xingye Pawnshop, 76 Xingye Road, between the 20th and 23rd of this month, a large number of valuable ornaments such as diamond rings, agate, jade bracelets, and gold ornaments, valued at 600 million yuan, were stolen from inside a private room.

They also brought all the staff, apprentices, and old cashiers to the police station for questioning. After verifying the footprints and careful consideration, they discovered that apprentice Liu Songwen (17 years old) was highly suspected. After repeated questioning, he confessed to the theft. He said that there were 85 items, placed in a travel bag, and a hole was dug behind the escalator to bury the bag in the soil. Police were dispatched and recovered all the stolen goods.

### Robbery on Kunming Road: Police and Robbers Engage in Gunfight; One Robber Wounded, Abandons Coat and Flees

(Our Report) At the Yonghe Tobacco and Paper Shop, 892 Kunming Road, at approximately 9:15 PM last night, after business hours, a person suddenly peered into the shop through a window and used the excuse of buying wine to trick the owner into opening the door. Four robbers wearing yellow uniforms and black long gowns entered one after another. Three of them brandished pistols. The shop owner, Zheng Mingquan, knew that he had been robbed and handed over several hundred thousand yuan in cash from a large cigarette box. Neighbors noticed the incident and ran out to sound the alarm and report to the Yulin Road Police Sub-Bureau. Deputy Bureau Chiefs Feng Wenwei and Yin Chunrong, along with Section Chief Shen Zuoluo, supervised Section Member Cheng Wengui, Inspector Yang Shaoxian, Sergeant Yue Mingzhong, and officers Li Zhuyin, Liu Longchao, and Tian Changyuan, rushed to the scene in police cars, surrounding and lying in ambush. Before long, a robber wearing black trousers and a yellow uniform, carrying stolen goods: Great Britain and other brands of cigarettes, opened the door and fled. At that time, the police officers shouted for them to stop. The robbers, realizing they had been discovered, abandoned all the cigarettes and cash and fled. The two robbers behind them also stepped out one after another. The police officers opened fire from a distance. The robbers also drew their guns and fired back. Both sides fought for about ten minutes, exchanging about forty shots. As a result, one robber in the rear was hit twice in the lower body, took off his outer coat, and fled, leaving a few spots of blood. Police officers collected the stolen goods, cash, and the abandoned coat, and summoned the original owner to the police station to investigate the details.

### No Changes in City Government Organization; Personnel Reductions Impossible; City Government Submits Statement to the Executive Yuan Explaining Reasons

(Our Report) Yesterday, a reporter visited Zheng Tianmu, Director of the Personnel Department of the City Government, and asked whether the City Government's staffing could be maintained as it is now that the central government has extended the authorization period for the recovery area by one year. Director Zheng replied, "This is the most basic common sense." During the authorization period, Mayor Wu can handle all municipal affairs with full authority. Director Zheng explained further, because some people still do not understand, by giving an example: If the Executive Yuan decides that the City Government's staffing must be reduced by one-third of the original number, then the Personnel Department will report the two-thirds of the City Government personnel who have been approved to the Ministry of Civil Service for review, and the remaining one-third of the personnel will become extra to the City Government's staffing. The central government will not recognize them, but Mayor Wu has the right to continue to employ them, depending on the needs of the environment. In fact, the city's business is booming; the city government has repeatedly stated that the current staff cannot be reduced, so there is no need to argue that the city government will maintain its current staffing.

To verify the facts, the reporter again visited Mayor Wu and asked whether the central government's order to extend the authorization period for the recovery area would apply to the city government's staffing. Mayor Wu replied, "Of course, of course."

Furthermore, the reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the review committee of the City Government's organizational regulations of the Executive Yuan has completed the preliminary review of the city government's staffing issue in four sessions. Except for a slight reduction in the number of personnel, there are no changes in the organization. The Personnel and News departments will not be changed from departments to offices. Tang Honglie, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, who was responsible for the review work, sent a letter to Zheng Tianmu, Director of the Personnel Department of the City Government, stating that the Ministry of Civil Service has agreed on the establishment standards for personnel agencies: for central government departments and provincial governments with more than 500 city government employees under their jurisdiction, a personnel department should be established.

Regarding a slight reduction in personnel, the city government has submitted a statement to the Executive Yuan explaining the heavy workload of the city government and the need for the current staff. The original letter stated: The city government plans to have 3,576 staff members according to the proposed organizational regulations, with 17,000 affiliated staff members. The number of police, laborers, and technicians, more than 20,000, is not included. The appointment, dismissal, transfer, and evaluation of the staff, and the rewards and punishments of the police, laborers, and technicians, must be submitted to the city government for approval. Based on the above standards, the Personnel Department should have 240 staff members, and the personnel offices of each bureau should have about 50 staff members or more. However, the proposed organization only provides for 60 staff members in the Personnel Department, and only 36 staff members in the A-level personnel offices of each bureau, 35 staff members in the B-level personnel offices, and 17 staff members in the C-level personnel offices. Compared with the regulations, there is a significant discrepancy. It is feared that it will be insufficient to cope with personnel management and should not be reduced further.

### Repatriated Overseas Chinese from Southern Sakhalin Island: Sent to Two Locations Without Accommodation; Authorities Now Negotiating Ways to Send Them Back to Their Hometowns

[Our Report] The 161 repatriated overseas Chinese from Southern Sakhalin Island are still in a state of hardship where they do not know what the next day will bring, although their food and accommodation problems have been temporarily resolved. The day before yesterday afternoon, Wen Songling of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office and Zheng Luyi of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office managed to borrow two trucks and initially sent them to Sacred Heart Hospital, proposing to send them to the former Overseas Chinese Second Reception Center on Longchang Road, but both were refused because there was no room. Finally, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau to request relief, but because the office hours had passed, they did not get any instructions. By this time, it was past dinner time, and Wen had no choice but to ask Chen Guolian, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, who finally agreed to have the refugees temporarily housed at the former Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road (the area is currently being renovated and will be moved into by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office). It was not until midnight that they were able to have some food to fill their stomachs. Currently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office is carefully investigating the original residences of each overseas Chinese and is asking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions while consulting with the municipal authorities to send them back to their hometowns separately.

After verifying that the procedures were in accordance with the contract, the cooperative applied to the General Affairs Office of the City Government for a permit to take out the goods. When the permit was being obtained from the bureau, a few employees of the City Government, not knowing the truth, tried to stop it. The person in charge of the cooperative presented all the documents to the mayor and made a public announcement. The General Affairs Office explained the situation to them, and the misunderstanding was cleared up.

### Taixing Communist Bandit Instructor Sentenced to Imprisonment for Murder

(Our Report) Song Zijiang, a Communist bandit instructor and district committee member in Taixing County, Northern Jiangsu, forced fellow villagers Song Guanghua and Song Qitian to join the Fourth Army in the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year in Liujiadai, ten li outside the south gate of the county. When they refused, he stabbed Song Guanghua 27 times, killing him and leaving the body on display for three days, forbidding anyone to collect it. In September of this year, Song Zijiang secretly came to Shanghai from Northern Jiangsu. On the afternoon of the 28th, Song Shilin, the younger brother of Song Qitian, spotted him at a teahouse in Xiaodongmen and reported him to the police, who arrested him and sent him to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. It was discovered that in addition to the murder in this case, Song was also guilty of destroying highways, demolishing houses, slaughtering innocent people, and robbery. The Taixing County Government had issued an arrest warrant for him. He was prosecuted for murder. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Xianda of the Second Criminal Division of the District Court presided over the trial. Witness Song Shilin testified that in the tenth month of the 35th year of the Republic, when Song Guanghua passed through Taixing County, Song Zijiang stopped him, confiscated the pass issued by the Taixing County Government, robbed him of his personal belongings, and took him to Liujiadai, where he stabbed him 27 times all over his body with a rifle bayonet.

(Our Report) The giant generator of the Zhabei Power Company in this city suddenly broke down the other day, causing a power outage in Nanshi.

### Young Woman in Pudong Accuses Grand-Uncle of Rape: Defendant Claims He is the Clan Head and Could Not Possibly Commit Such a Bestial Act

(Our Report) The case in which Sun Xiaomei, a young woman from Pudong, accused Tao Hezhong, her grand-uncle four generations removed, of rape was heard yesterday in the Fourth Criminal Division of the District Court by Judge Wu Shaochang. Sun Xiaomei testified first: She is 26 years old, lives at No. 8 Lujia Lane, Pudong, and is married to Tao Chengdao, who works in a company in Shanghai. Tao Hezhong is my grand-uncle. One night in March of this year, I was coaxing my child to sleep when my grand-uncle suddenly entered, pushed the door shut with one hand, and held a gun with the other, forbidding me to make any noise. I was then raped. Afterwards, because I was afraid of his power, I did not dare to tell my husband. At noon on October 14, I was washing dishes in the kitchen when Tao broke in again, wanting to commit indecent acts. I shouted for help, and Yang Rudao, a neighbor and relative by marriage, came to rescue me. Unexpectedly, Tao instead accused Yang of having an affair with me. A scuffle broke out, and Yang reported it to the Baochang Tao Bingrong, which is how my husband found out. He said that I was unchaste and left home. Now I cannot maintain my livelihood, so I am accusing him of violating public morals. The defendant Tao Hezhong testified that he is 38 years old, lives at No. 113 Lujia Lane, Pudong. I am the clan head, how could I possibly commit such a bestial act? What Sun said is all fabricated. It is because she is unchaste, and I often lectured her, that she holds a grudge and is falsely accusing me. After Tao Bingrong and Xu Xiqi testified, the court adjourned the trial of the case and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the sixth of next month.

### The Northeast Fifty Days Under the Shadow

An international shadow, solely on the Northeast, people internationally focused on the Northeast, but unfortunately unable to break the stalemate formed by this shadow.

In this shadow, the communist bandits, united with the Korean communists, and bribing the armed Mongolian brethren, constantly launched offensives, once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, turning the factories, mines, and transportation built by the Japanese and the Northeast compatriots into broken, suffocated, and unmanageable states.

Each offensive was more ferocious than the last, and each offensive caused more devastating destruction. The six offensives had already made transportation impossible, and the industrial and mining sectors changed color because of it. The goal of the communist bandits was: "To seize resources outside the customs, to fund disturbances inside the customs!"

The six offensives of the communist bandits had just ended, and the seventh offensive was about to come. Now, sketching a simple picture of the six offensives, it is judged that the upcoming seventh offensive may be similar to the six actions.

(Our reporter from Pan Yang on the 22nd, by airmail) It is a well-known and unspoken fact that the current four army corps of the Nationalist army in the Northeast are not enough for ideal distribution. The communist bandits know this even more clearly, so each offensive focuses on this point.

The prelude to the six offensives was the 8th and 9th columns of Li Yunchang's "Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region" of the bandits, who suddenly appeared in western Liaoning in early September, beginning to destroy the traffic from Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan, and threatening Huludao.

From September 6th to the 26th, for half a month, battles continued. As a result, the communist bandits suffocated several industrial and mining units in Jinxi, cut off the supply line between inside and outside the customs, Huludao was under great threat, and at the same time, the Nationalist army Wang Tiehan's troops also suffered a loss.

On September 28th, the sixth offensive of the bandits officially kicked off. The bandits launched a large-scale offensive between Kaiyuan and Tieling, attempting to seize the north gate of Pan Yang. Faku, sixty kilometers north of Shenyang, fell first on September 30th. The bandits further used the main force of the 7th Column to quickly besiege the west gate -- Xinmin. At the same time, Liaoyang at the south gate and Fushun at the east gate were all sending alarms.

At this point, the communist bandits' intention to launch a large-scale attack on Pan Yang had been formed. Coincidentally, Pan Yang was also

Surrounded and Attacked

was performing "empty city trick". The situation was indeed quite severe, because at that time, the mobile force of the Liao Yaoxiang Corps was rescuing Jinzhou. Many people sweated for this.

However, the mobile force was, after all, a mobile force. The Liao Corps rushed back overnight and won a victory in the darkness at Gaoshan between Xinmin Juluhe, preserving the West Gate and defending Yang.

According to the military负责人 of the Xing Yuan, although the battle was not big, the relationship was too big, because the battle near Xinmin changed the war situation. This was the first phase of the war from September 28th to Double Ten Festival.

The second phase started on October 11th. On the 21st, the communist bandits attempted to threaten Pan Yang with local troops and launched large-scale attacks on Dongqian and western Liaoning. After the bandits retreated from Xinmin, they changed to take the railway hub Xinlitun, Dahu Mountain on the Da Zheng Line, and Yixian on the Jin Gu Line. As a result, they failed to achieve complete success. At the same time, in the battles of Yingpan, Nan Zamu, and Jiguanshan outside the east gate of Fushun, the Nationalist army gained an advantage, and the bandit's 10th and 11th columns, as well as the Korean communist Li Hongguang detachment, were defeated.

In addition, the Nationalist army worked hard to harass Goubangzi and Dahu Mountain westward along the road by the bandit army entrenched in Yingkou Port, and achieved great success.

The northern road smashed the commando troops sent by the bandit's 1st Column to disrupt and destroy the joint attack between Tieling and Shenyang, which contributed to turning the tide of the battle. That was the Battle of Tieling South Guannangmi, which strategically won a great harvest in a small battle.

October 16th to November 18th was the third phase of the offensive. This was also the

Last Phase

Except for Hou Jingru's troops who suffered some losses in the northwest area of Yixian due to poor intelligence in order to save Beipiao, the Nationalist army won favorable results in other aspects.

In this phase, the bandit's plan was to continue to destroy the Bei Ning Road, but focusing on besieging Yongji and the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station. The siege began on the 16th, on a large scale, and the offensive was also fierce.

General Zeng Zesheng, who led his team to support bitterly, and Liang Huasheng's security team were also able to cooperate with the Nationalist army in combat. With the power of the air force, as a result, the bandits had to retreat. At the same time, the Jilin military and civilians also gained the honor of defending Jilin.

In the third phase, there was a new force that won a great victory, that was Fu Zuoyi's troops, which recovered Shenyang's northwest and south Zhangwu. In the triangular area west of Zhangwu, the bandit's 7th Column was beaten to pieces, with 7,000 killed or wounded, 800 captured, and military supplies sufficient to equip a division were obtained.

The success of the Chuan Department lies in

Military Secret

After receiving orders, officers and soldiers carried pancakes, were not restricted by diet, did not show their colors, marched urgently while gagging, and arrived at Zhangwu, just like divine soldiers descending from the sky, achieving success in one fell swoop, winning cheers from the people. Military officials were also saying: "This battle, in the sixth offensive, was the most successful battle for the Nationalist army and the most failed battle for the communist bandits." In mid-November, the entire frozen east fell into temperature, with the temperature dropping to five to several degrees below zero. The bandit's sixth offensive also pulled down the "end" curtain.

Li Shuzheng, Director of the U Office of the Northeast Xing Yuan, stated to reporters about the sixth offensive: "The war started on September 28th and ended on November 18th, about fifty days. The bandits used eleven columns, and there were Korean bandits, Mongolian bandits, and local troops, claiming to be 300,000 strong. The bandits died and injured 105,000, and the Nationalist army suffered 28,000 casualties. As a result, the communist bandits' offensive failed."

Director Li's final conclusion was: "Chief Chen's judgment was correct, and his command was decisive. He always followed the established plan of ensuring industrial and mining areas and strategic locations, fighting in reliance on cities, capturing and提 the main force of the bandit army, and concentrating superior forces to defeat the bandits one by one. As a result, the bandits were attacked and defeated and retreated!" (Special Correspondent Han Qing)

It is said that the thief has superb skills of flying over eaves and walking on walls, similar to the "Swallow Li San" in Peiping. Therefore, they are all called flying thieves, and for a time, the city was in turmoil and unable to sleep peacefully.

On the afternoon of the 27th of this month, Wang Yiming, the leader of the first group of the criminal police team, was bathing in the Yudeci in Da Shi Qiao, when he found the "flying thief" posing as a bather, lying on the bed and sleeping soundly, with a bag of clothes next to him. Because he looked like a soldier, he was inconvenient to ask. When he entered the pool to bathe, he opened the bag of clothes and inspected it. Inside were flashlights, keys, and other miscellaneous items. Group leader Wang immediately dispatched several group members, including Shen Chuyan, to secretly tail him. Soon, he took out a jade ring from Zhu Saichang Jewelry Store behind the park and sold it, asking for one million yuan, but the store only agreed to sell it for 700,000 yuan. The thief was in a hurry. Sometimes he went to the railway station, sometimes to the city, sometimes to the cinema, and sometimes outside the city. He was very active. When Group Leader Wang and others followed him to the Daguangming Theater, the "flying thief" realized that something was wrong. In a hurry, he ran away, intending to escape, but the area around the theater was already densely guarded by voluntary police. The flying thief Qin Shijing was taken to the team for questioning. He claimed: "Because my old mother's family is in difficult living conditions and has no way to support her, I took the risk." That night, Group Leader Wang accompanied the "flying thief" to Wang Zhengqing's home in Huai Shu Xiang to identify his appearance. It was indeed the principal offender. The criminal also demonstrated his superb skills of stealing and flying away at the scene. First, he grabbed the electric pole wood and jumped up, light as a swallow.

### Relics of Ji Zi's Tomb All Ancient Objects Disappeared

(Our reporter from Jiangyin on the 27th) There is Ji Zi's Tomb in Shengang Town, 30 miles outside the West Gate of Jiangyin. There was a shrine in front of it, which was later changed to a shrine. It was destroyed in the tenth year of Xianfeng in Qing Dynasty. During the Tongzhi period of Qing Dynasty, Lin Daquan from He County and the Wu family donated money to rebuild it. There were five rooms in the front gate, five rooms in the Xiangtang, and three rooms in the boat. In front was a cross stele pavilion. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by fire when the Japanese invaders captured it in 1938. The cross stele was also shattered. Now, only a pile of wasteland remains. It is Ji Zi's tomb. The cross stele was originally 7 feet 7 inches high and 3 feet 2 inches wide. There were two ancient columns. It is said to be Confucius's handwriting, writing "The Tomb of Lord Yanling, a Gentleman of Birds Call." There are traces of firewood across the waist of the stele, like a belt. It is said that at the turn of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, the stele suddenly broke in the middle. One night, there were wind, thunder, and rain, and the broken part reunited, and the purple mark was there. On the side of the stele, Peng Yuyu wrote a couplet: "The stars are cold at night in the gentleman's tomb, the wind and thunder protect the sage's book." This stele has a long history. During the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty, Yuanzong ordered it to be written. In the fourteenth year of Dali, Xiao Ding, the governor of Runzhou, re-inscribed the stone. The stele that exists today was erected by Zhu Yan, the governor of the state, in the second year of Chongning in the Song Dynasty. From the Spring and Autumn Period to the Song Dynasty, thousands of years of ancient objects have been lost since then, and the critics regret it. He has always been loved by Shan Nan's faithful women. Since then, Taiwanese compatriots have come to the South Bank to worship, and then they bought a Guanyin statue and respectfully transported it back to Taiwan for worship.

### Northern Great "College of Engineering" (Continued)

— Binbin

Demonstrated by Forty Years of History. Will Find Its Final Resting Place in Cultural City

Second Affiliation with Peking University

During the period of occupation, the puppet government hoisted the five-colored flag and greatly copied Zhang Zuolin's established system for education, unifying all schools under Peking University. "Peiping University College of Engineering" thus became the "College of Engineering of the Puppet Peking University," which can be considered the second affiliation with Peking University.

Thus it continued for eight years (from 1938 to 1945). When the Japanese invaders surrendered and China was restored, the former capital in Cultural City, all schools resumed operations. First, a "Temporary University" was established, and the various colleges were used as branches for reorganization. "Peiping University" no longer existed. Peking University was the center, overseeing all the colleges, and the affiliation of this College of Engineering suddenly became a question.

Peking University originally wanted to create its own College of Engineering and was unwilling to accept it. Someone suggested that "Peking University" and "Tsinghua" jointly run it, but "Tsinghua" had its own College of Engineering and refused. As a result, it belonged to "Beiyang" and continued to operate at the original site of Prince Duan's Mansion, renamed "Beiyang University College of Engineering." This was the second connection with "Beiyang," but while eighteen years before they were "brothers shoulder to shoulder," this time Beiyang was the elder.

Finally Still Belonging to Peking University

Last summer, enrollment and classes began in both Peiping and Tianjin, professors were newly hired, and the lineup was strengthened. Students from the mainland returned one after another, and old students from the north and new students who took the entrance exam came eagerly. "Mountains and valleys flock to Jingmen," it was quite a grand occasion for a time. The first semester passed smoothly, but this spring it was suddenly rumored that enrollment would no longer be accepted, and then it was announced that it would be moved to Tianjin in stages. Later, because the factory equipment was difficult to move and the faculty and students were attached to their homes, there were many objections. Therefore, the proposal to move to Tianjin was immediately canceled and changed to affiliation with Peking University. After many twists and turns, the Ministry of Education finally ordered acceptance on August 1st, and it was restored to the "College of Engineering of Peking University," which was the third affiliation with Peking University and also its final resting place.

The above forty-four years of separation and reunion, joys and sorrows, are clearly explained and vividly remembered. Those who want to know the allusions of industrial education in Cultural City, and young people who want to study at the College of Engineering of this city and Peking University should all keep this for reference, which can save many visits and inquiries.

### China Textile Corporation Holds Joint Board Meeting Decides to Strengthen Purchase of Domestic Cotton Minister Chen Plans to Contact Government for Supply of Funds

(Our Agency Report) China Textile Construction Company held a joint meeting of supervisors and directors starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The following items were discussed: The Qingdao Yarn Factory of Textile Construction Company is facing a coal shortage, which has reached a critical stage. Some work has been suspended since the day before yesterday, and a supply is urgently needed. It was resolved that Minister Chen should telegraph the Fuel Management Committee to quickly allocate 5,000 tons of coal for transportation and supply. In addition, the Fuel Management Committee's Tianjin branch currently has coal in storage. Minister Chen was also instructed to quickly allocate 2,000 tons for transportation and supply. The above coal will be partially returned after the contract for the monthly supply of 5,000 tons of coal signed by China Textile Construction Company and the Taiwan Provincial Government is implemented next month. Furthermore, if the coal from the Taiwan Provincial Government can be supplied according to the contract, then the coal needed by China Textile Construction Company in the future will certainly not be in short supply.

Regarding the purchase of domestic cotton, as of now, less than 500,000 tons have been purchased. It is necessary to strengthen the purchase, but there is a shortage of funds. Minister Chen plans to contact the government to supply funds. At the same time, it is suggested to the government that, in order to enrich the supply of cash, the relevant financial authorities should consider issuing large-denomination banknotes.

Regarding the year-end bonus issue, if the method of last year is followed, it will be difficult to bear the burden. This is because China Textile Construction Company has been selling cotton yarn at a fixed price according to government regulations this year, and the fixed price is even within the cost. Therefore, the profit is limited. It was resolved that Minister Chen should ask the government authorities to find a flexible solution. The following are reported matters: China Textile Construction Company has limited inventory of yarn and cloth. Most of what is currently being spun and woven is cotton yarn spun on commission, and the supply of military yarn and cloth is huge, which is difficult to meet. The loss of 20,000 bales of cotton in Shijiazhuang this time also affected the company's supply of raw cotton. Regarding the additional allocation of cotton yarn, the government's intention is to suppress the yarn and cloth market prices, which has already been effective the day before yesterday. It is decided that the market situation will be monitored in the future, and the principle of suppressing market prices will be followed. Additional allocations and sales will be made at any time when necessary.

### Lackluster Performance, Limited Trading of Chinese Stocks

Major investors are buying to cover losses off-market, but young investors have already emerged, but it's uncertain how much they can do.

At the opening in the morning, water yarn was as low as 395 yuan for immediate delivery and 404 yuan for forward delivery. After the opening, prices immediately fell. No. 223 and others sold, and No. 143 and others sold for immediate delivery and retreated to 383 yuan and 392 yuan. No. 148 and others bought to cover losses, and the off-market interest rate was still 2.4 and 2.85 fen. Prices once recovered to around 388 yuan and 398 yuan. No. 143 sold immediately, and off-market incentives were weak. No. 32 and others sold for forward delivery again, and prices fell to a low of 379 yuan for immediate delivery and 390 yuan for forward delivery. However, a powerful group off-market supported the prices, and No. 157 and others in the market maintained them. Prices rose slightly to 385 yuan and 395 yuan near noon. Young investors came to close out positions, and No. 45 and others sold. Prices retreated to 379 yuan and 391 yuan at the close.

Yongsheng, Zhabei, Huahsin, Xinho, Meyer, Wah Fung, Sing Kwong, Zhongfa, Qin Hsing, Nei Yi, National Goods Matches, China Silk, and China Textile each fell by 5%. Xinhua and Zhongxing were flat. Yonggong, Tongyi, and Rongfeng fell slightly. Wah Fung forward delivery stocks fell by slightly less than 10%, and the remaining stocks generally fell by 5%. Old stocks and bank stocks off-market also fell back, while the remaining stocks remained stable.

### Government Bonds Rebound Slightly, Foreign Stocks Turn Down

Government bonds also rebounded slightly yesterday due to the tight monetary situation. Unified Class C opened at 25,500 yuan and retreated from 25,700 yuan to 23,600 yuan before turning sideways. Room 360 entered, and Room 550 entered first and then exited. As a result, Unified Class C fell by 700 yuan compared to the previous closing, and Classes A, B, D, and E each fell by 400 yuan. The turnover was only 4 million.

Foreign stocks turned down yesterday due to reduced off-market incentives. The Guangdong group sold, and the foreign firm group, bank group, and securities group all sold. Ewo Yarns opened at 368,000 yuan and retreated to 348,000 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, Ewo Yarns, British Union, Deutz, Wheelock, British American Tobacco, Ewo Brewery, and Steel Industry each fell by 5%. Lane Crawford fell by 10%. Shanghai Ice & Cold Storage was flat, and the rest fell slightly.

### Internal Exchange Rates Adjusted by Banks

Chinese stocks weakened gradually in a mediocre state yesterday, with a tight monetary situation and off-market black markets all retreating. There were very few rallies during the process, and trading was limited.

### Continued Tight Monetary Situation

(Our Newspaper Report) The monetary situation in Shanghai continued to be tight yesterday. National banks had a large settlement of cotton yarn, resulting in a shortage of 73.2 billion yuan.

The remaining coarse and fine yarns also fell across the board by 780,000 to 1.23 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market was sluggish yesterday, with actual sales not moving. Selling pressure was quite strong in the market, and prices trended downward. As a result, 12-pound Longtou and other grades of fine cloth continued to plummet by 56,000 to 89,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The overall trend was that only Shilin cloth was popular, while the markets for other cloths were sluggish.

(Our Newspaper Report) China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 13,660 pieces of cloth, equivalent to 14,380 pieces of single cloth, and 2,910 bedsheets. There were a total of 321 applications. The current cotton market was not very active yesterday because national banks stopped lending, and cotton mortgage loans that were due also had to be recovered. Furthermore, due to the end of the month and the weekend, there was mutual settlement of funds, and merchants were short of funds, so transactions were stranded.

### Customs Brokers Cease Operations Customs Urges Collection of Security Deposits

Please instruct them to temporarily postpone the urging. It is heard that Deputy Minister Li believes that the tax rate in the first point was passed by the Legislative Yuan and cannot be changed. However, he agreed to convey the second point to the Minister of Finance for consideration.

### Self-Provided Foreign Exchange for Goods Arriving at Port: Review Committee Meeting Discussed Procurement and Allocation Issues Yesterday

*   Methods for allocating procured goods.
*   Priority purchase issues for importers/exporters or factories.

It is said that the above points will be studied and decided at next week's meeting.

Even though goods have generally fallen back in price, people's hearts are still often weak and the market can be described as having virtually no transactions. The "Rising Sun" brand, 120 number, grade A, opened in the morning with a technical drop in the selling price to 10 million yuan, but lacked any buyers. In the afternoon, the original offer was still shouted out. Finally, someone was willing to sell at 9 million yuan, but no one inquired, and the transaction did not go through.

The allocation quota for this period has not been reduced. Because this period has uniformly switched to large bags containing 180 catties, it is equivalent to a 70% allocation compared to the small bags containing 120 catties allocated in the previous period. However, the total weight allocated is still similar to that of each period. For example, the 41st period was 2076 tons, the 42nd period was 2313 tons, and the 43rd period was 2205 tons, and it has not decreased in recent weeks.

Spring and Autumn

### Farewell to Spring and Autumn

— Editor

Recently, this newspaper has revised its supplement plan. Starting next month, this publication will be temporarily merged into "Free Talk," and the space will be used to publish seven other weekly publications. Although this publication will, in essence, still exist, in form, we must express our regret to our readers. This publication was founded in December of the 21st year of the Republic of China and has now been in existence for a full fifteen years. During this period, it has, of course, received the support and love of many writers and readers and has also consumed the hard work of many past editors. However, unexpectedly, just fourteen months after I took over as editor, I will be saying goodbye to the readers. This is certainly a personal regret for the editor; however, looking back at the publication's founding, the content and nature have been continuously improving and innovating. It is undeniable that reform means progress. Human ancestors may have dragged tails, and primitive horses had five toes on their hooves, but you cannot say that the loss of a tail was a loss to humanity, and a single-toed hoof certainly allows for more free galloping. The merging of this publication into "Free Talk" is, in the overall editorial policy of this newspaper, no different.

Those who believe in fate will even believe that there is no banquet in this world that does not end. This publication is named "Spring and Autumn," and the content also occasionally includes the wind and moon poems of men of letters. The Southern Tang Emperor Li Yu had already asked, "When will the spring breeze and autumn moon end?" And spring plowing and summer weeding, autumn harvest and winter storage, the approaching winter is not also the most appropriate time for this publication to say goodbye to its readers? Moreover, the harvest of fifteen years of cultivation has already been scattered in the hearts of readers at home and abroad. The nurturing and growth of these seeds is the real responsibility that the readers of this publication have always taken care of. For example, due to the fifteen years of enlightenment and advocacy by this publication, readers in various places have either strengthened their aspirations to engage in literature and art or established the foundation for literary and artistic endeavors. Even general publications have increased the amount of space dedicated to content similar to the style of this publication. These are precisely the expectations of this publication. So, with expectations gradually being fulfilled, what does the temporary existence or non-existence of the publication in form matter?

Although the editor personally has not been able to do as well as the readers had hoped during this past year or so, and often delayed the manuscripts of writers, today, I can only feel remorse and ask for forgiveness. As the saying goes, "That which dims the soul is parting alone!" is the norm of human emotion, so the words of farewell inevitably carry some sadness. However, based on the two points mentioned above, this publication's temporary farewell to readers today should also be pleasant and optimistic.

As for the accumulated manuscripts of this publication, except for a portion of pure literature manuscripts that will be transferred to the Literature Weekly, the remaining manuscripts with return envelopes, sufficient postage, and clear addresses will be returned by the editor one by one.

There are also a small number of manuscript fee notification slips for this publication with unknown addresses that cannot be delivered. If any manuscripts have been published but the authors have not yet received the notification, please inform us of the detailed address as soon as possible so that we can send it out.

All communications related to this publication should still be sent to the Weekly Editorial Office of the Newspaper Editorial Department.

### National Music and National Musical Instruments

— Xi Ting

After reading "Rebuilding Chinese Music" in this publication, I have the following opinions:

First of all, "musical instruments are not a synonym for music," this point must be clearly recognized. Some people believe that Chinese music must be played by Chinese musical instruments. In fact, musical instruments are originally tools for expressing music and should not have nationality. For example, the same piano and violin can play the Spanish-style "Serenade" or the Russian folk songs full of strong national character. If Chinese "national music" has its own characteristic character, then we can compose music according to this characteristic and express it with advanced and complete musical instruments. Ma Sicong's several violin "suites" are based on the tunes of Suiyuan folk songs, and He Luting's piano piece "The Cowherd's Flute" is also full of oriental flavor.

Perhaps some people say: if Chinese musical instruments are not used, half of the color of Chinese music will be lost. In fact, what is lost is not Chinese color but primitive color. Because authentic national music refers to ancient court music, which is characterized by simplicity and primitiveness. This simple and primitive ancient music is similar to the primitive music of any country. European music, which has progressed to such a degree today, did not have harmony or counterpoint in its early stages hundreds of years ago, and its musical instruments were also extremely simple and immature. The ancestor of the piano was the monochord, and the ancestor of the violin was the Lery, similar to our pipa. If they had always been obsessed with antiquity, they would not have such complete instruments as the piano and violin today.

As for the issue of improving musical instruments, it has been shouted for a long time, and it has also been partially implemented, but because our music has been stagnant for too long, even if we can cover up several centuries in one fell swoop, the result of the improvement will only be similar to advanced musical instruments.

Why are Western musical instruments advanced and complete? Because it can use "harmony" without restriction, and modulation is completely free (the pipa in national music only has a few harmonies). It can express melancholy and contemplative tunes. It can also play extremely rapid melodies, showing the heroic spirit of ten thousand horses galloping. It can solo folk songs, perform chamber music, but it can also be arranged into such a huge organization as an orchestra. Due to the seriousness and precision of the materials and structure used in Western musical instruments, their range, volume, and timbre are indeed incomparable to those of national musical instruments. Based on the above reasons, the so-called Western musical instruments of today have become the world's common musical instruments.

Secondly, it should be mentioned that our ancestors' understanding of music theory was not inferior to later generations. Zhu Zaiyu of the Ming Dynasty advocated the use of "twelve-tone equal temperament" (dividing the octave into twelve equal parts) "scale system," which is still commonly used worldwide. This is admired by Western musicians. Therefore, I feel that if we can use Western principles in "harmony," "counterpoint," "form," and "instrumentation," and pay attention to expressing the spirit of our national music, then the future of Chinese music will no longer be as primitive and simple as it is today.

### Self-Inscription on a Southern Travel Picture

— Zhang Yiqu

In the autumn of the 14th year of the Republic, I traveled south to the Malay Peninsula, where there are many coconut trees, which can reach the sky. In the Kuala Lumpur area, tens of millions of swallows form flocks and sweep across the shore from time to time, shaking the world with their sound. More than ten years have passed, and I still remember the scenery. Therefore, I made a picture of my southern travels and inscribed it with a poem.

Ten thousand miles of waves, autumn in the sea country,
For ten years the sails recall the previous journey:
Flocks of swallows sweep across the shore with a sound like thunder,
Coconut leaves reach for the sky, emerald and flowing;
King Zhao's tax, laid out like chess pieces,
Zheng He's boat, urged on by drums and lit by lamps,
Middle-aged sorrows and joys are worth savoring,
And now I, with white hair, try to recreate my southern journey.

### After Viewing Mr. Fang's Painting Exhibition

— Dui

Having undergone formal training, accumulated rich experience, and cultivated noble refinement, the achievements of contemporary painters like Mr. Fang Jian can be said to be worthy of the author. From her recent works, each piece expresses pure and skilled technique, but everywhere reveals the meaning of Chinese cultural characteristics, not only in terms of subject matter but also in the artistic conception and spirit, showing the wonderfulness of tranquility and transcendence. It is definitely not the form of Western painting that slavishly imitates, nor is it simply a mixing of some Chinese painting elements in a local way. Even in terms of form, such as her "After Bathing" piece, the half-round gauze window depicted reflects the dense green bamboo; in the "Facing the Stream" piece, the lakeside rocks and willows, and the lotus emerging from the water, clearly integrate the beauty of heaven and man. The paintings wash away vulgarity with elegance and leave a weighty impression in people's minds. Even laymen should feel that they are different from the vulgar. The various pieces she wrote while traveling, the majesty of the northern lands, and the excellence of the southern states, are all captured in her brushstrokes. Each kind of police affair is only presented with its characteristics on the outer appearance, giving people a refreshing feeling. It avoids the disease of repeating the same old routines. What is most fascinating is the landscape, figures, flowers, and fruits drawn on Chinese paper, purely with vigorous brushstrokes, bold dyeing, and development of vivid interest. These are the advantages that Chinese literati have exhausted and can completely grasp. It can be seen that the realm of painting can be innovated and constantly emerge.

### Literary Commentary on "Spring and Autumn" Supplement

— Binzhi

The earliest newspapers were very simple. Not only was there no term for "supplement," but also literary texts with an artistic air were nowhere to be found. This newspaper was the first to publish this kind of soft text. In the founding regulations of this newspaper, it was said: "If there are poets and writers who are willing to teach us with short or long articles, such as local folk songs and long poems about events from famous areas around the world, no fees will be charged." This was a call for submissions. However, at that time, no fees were given for submissions and no advertising fees were charged, which was considered a special favor.

The call for submissions was very effective. Many literati sent in poems and small essays, mostly folk songs, poems about immortals, and poems about climbing high places, which can be called the era of folk songs. In the recent five years (the commemorative book of the 50th anniversary of this newspaper), Lei Jinwen described the situation at that time, saying: "They sang and echoed each other, chattering endlessly, either depicting emotions or lingering on scenery. They mutually recited elegance and occupied the literary world, and countless prominent scholars all took it as an honor to have their names appended to the end of the newspaper." The newspaper's space could not accommodate it, so another "Trivial Records of Bamboo Branches" was published to accommodate it. This type of text could very well match the stuffy mood of the literati at that time and was very helpful for the newspaper's business. Although supplementary text was published immediately after the founding of this newspaper, it was not given a fixed place and did not have the form of a supplement. This can be said to be the gestation period of the supplement.

Since the supplementary text was welcomed by readers, the space was increased and the scope was expanded. At that time, the themes of novels, notes, etc. had replaced the status of poems in the past, so it can be called the "era of novels." In 1911, the founding of "Free Talk" further defined the form of the supplement, facing the society from start to finish, becoming the standard form of the newspaper.

The early supplementary text was mostly games and sketches. Although it had the form of literature, it lacked the value of literature. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, "Free Talk" once became a place for members of the Nanshe Society to publish their poems and articles.

In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, "Free Talk" underwent a sudden change, turning to the path of new literature. "Free Talk" changed at any time, but the original style of "Free Talk" was not affected, but only transferred its position. This publication "Spring and Autumn" was the new garden that was opened up at that time. Some people divide supplements into two factions, North and South. The Southern faction admires leisure and mostly talks about wind and moon; the Northern faction values literature and likes to talk about social events. In this way, "Free Talk" at that time should be the Northern faction, and "Spring and Autumn" belonged to the Southern faction.

After the restoration, "Spring and Autumn" and "Free Talk" have changed places. "Free Talk" has restored the style of miscellaneous talk in name and in fact, and "Spring and Autumn" has become a purely literary supplement.

Literature has no boundaries of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. The text of newspapers is also different from that of magazines. It must take into account the preferences of most readers. Although literature is a part of art, it can be expanded to the whole of art. The literature in newspapers should be this kind of broad literature, which can meet the interests of many readers. Therefore, general commentators believe that "the development of the Northern faction of supplements must tend to spiritual appreciation, with works of literature, music, calligraphy, painting, bronze inscriptions, archaeology, sculpture, art, etc. as the main content." This is exactly the style of the current Spring and Autumn.

This kind of broad and comprehensive literature, from the slanting of beauty in many aspects, tempers the spirit of life, increases the interest in life, and creates new vitality in life. This pure literature is more powerful, because pure literary works seem to be refined and rare, and there is bound to be a feeling of few people being able to sing in tune.

### Quatrains on West Mountain, Lake Dongting

— Shou Juan

This summer, on June 27th, at the invitation of my friend Wen Da, a monk, I traveled to West Mountain in Dongting with my two brothers, Yan Qiao and Xiao Qing. I took a leisurely trip for three days, extensively viewing the summer resorts of Linwu Cave and the scenic spots of Shigong Mountain. Wherever I went, worldly concerns were abandoned, and I casually composed poems, briefly recording the traces of my journey.

Gathering in the Zen hall is particularly quiet,
On cool nights, cutting candles and talking about life;
On the banana leaves, the pattering rain,
In my dreams, I seem to hear the sound of broken jade.

Stumbling from tea to wine,
Clear words emerge like a spring;
Just because I greedily listened to the banana rain,
I mistakenly slept half the night in the empty hall.

Lodged in Baoshan Temple, talking with the monk Wen Da and my two brothers, Qiao and Qing, in the Da Yun Hall at night. It rained both nights, and the sound of the rain hitting the banana leaves sounded like broken jade, which I listened to without fatigue.

Strange rocks split the air, like the work of ghosts and gods,
Heaven opens a line, sighing at the wonder of nature;
First ascend to Fengnong Peak, then
Climb up to the top of the cliff and knock on the blue dome.

Each step is difficult, each step is sad,
But you must still muster courage and not hesitate;
My old man's waist and feet are still as before,
I want to go to the very top of Emei Rock.

Fengnong is one of the famous scenic spots of Shigong Mountain. The dangerous cliff is split, more than a fathom high, and only about two feet wide, allowing only one person to climb up; the monk Wen Da mustered courage to ascend first, followed by my two brothers, Xiao Qing and I, while my brother Yan Qiao looked at it and retreated.

In the quiet, I only hear the sound of oars,
The light boat seems to be traveling in a book;
May this heart be like the bright moon,
Not waiting for the moon to be bright in front of Yuelu Slope.

At the foot of Shigong Mountain, there is a flat slope extending into the water, which can accommodate hundreds of people sitting on it. Singing on it on a moonlit night must be a beautiful experience.

The rising sun of Yanggu spits out light,
The setting sun of Yuyuan is dim again;
In this age of mutual torment and harm,
I sing and cry under the desolate mountains and lakes.

The rivers and mountains are truly beautiful, but human plans are not hidden, the beans are boiled with their stalks, and I don't know where it all ends? After climbing, I wept profusely.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"Chief Hekken, the vehicle is ready."

Hekken had just received a break order and was about to borrow the telephone to say a few words to his subordinates when someone behind him greeted Hekken. "A self-propelled army? It's more like a prisoner transport!" Hekken thought to himself, turned around, and saw a young man dressed as a lower-ranking duty officer, wearing a duty armband on his arm, raising his hand to his brow in a salute.

"Oh, is Ueno Park very far from here?" Hekken was in plain clothes, so he didn't raise his hand, but just nodded, deliberately asking this.

"It's only a few blocks away, not very far." The duty officer stood straight, very respectful, because Hekken's official position was several levels higher than his, and he was also a high-ranking official on special assignment.

"I haven't been back to Tokyo for many days. I want to admire the night view of Ueno Park and the surrounding streets - unless there is a special order, I have to take the vehicle." Hekken's attitude contained a bit of anger, a bit of stubbornness, and a bit of arrogance. The tone of his voice seemed to say that even if there was an order from his superiors, he would still prefer to walk.

"There was a phone call from number twelve, ordering subordinates to send the chief to the Shin-bashi Building by vehicle; for fear..." The young duty officer changed his tone.

"Hmm?" Hekken was a little surprised because he saw that this young duty officer actually accepted the order from "zero twelve," so he was naturally "one of us."

"The situation is more tense than it was a few days ago; each sect and faction is probably going to concentrate the situation of fighting each other on the chief so as to shift the focus of the other side...!" The duty officer stated this very sincerely, but his words were stopped by Hekken's gesture.

"Ha... a joke! That's absolutely impossible. What is a small telecommunications director? Is it worth it for those big shots to move?" These two sentences of Hekken expressed the infinite grievances hidden in his chest.

"Chief!" The young duty officer intensified the tension in his tone; "The situation is like this: The senior figures of each party and faction have been mobilized because of the expedition to the mainland, and there is no problem with the destruction of China; the time will be very short, there will be no great sacrifices, let alone great dangers, so they are all in the country, fighting for power and profit, and very busy. They may not necessarily pay attention to the chief. At most, there is just some jealousy because the chief's sect is different..."

"That's right, it can be seen that I am not in any danger and there is no need to send someone to protect me!" Hekken interrupted the duty officer's words.

Hekken, in the position of the head of a secret group and as a senior officer, originally did not need to be so verbose when talking to his subordinates. But Hekken's style was somewhat different from others; he paid close attention to his trusted subordinates, even if they were of a lower rank; moreover, this young man was mostly a newcomer, so of course he had to take the opportunity to say a few more words to examine the young man.

Free Talk

### Humorous Talk About Beards

— Sun Yuehan

Looking in the mirror, I suddenly saw several strands of beard sprouting above and below my mouth. Am I getting old?

According to the dictionary: The mustache above the mouth is called "zi," and the beard below is called "xu." The cheek hair is called "ran," and the jaw hair is called "shao." They are collectively called beards. Zi means facial hair.

Side whiskers, whiskers beside the neck, are indeed signs of getting old. As the saying goes: "A person without hair on his mouth is unreliable." Young people often write a few years older on their resumes when applying for jobs. Otherwise, it seems difficult to appear experienced, stable in handling affairs, and gain people's trust.

Usually, a man's beauty lies in his eyebrows. However, today, most people hate beards. Some even apply hair removal cream to make them fall out. Or even pluck them out one by one with small tweezers. Looking at it from a distance, it looks like a bare mountain, smooth and shiny; looking at it closely, it is rugged and uneven, with holes and scars. Han Yu's poem: "Like picking whiskers from the bottom of a locked box." Li Yishan's poem: "Ashamed to see silk in the mirror." Chen Shidao's poem: "Lying down and picking whiskers with a blue steel sword." Wang Yu's poem: "The old farmer has nothing to do, pluck his whiskers in the mirror." It can be seen that the custom of plucking whiskers has existed since ancient times, but it is even more intense today. However, after all, it is "wildfire cannot burn it all, the spring breeze blows and it grows again." "The fragrant grass in front of the steps grows again."

Beards are the contours of age. Sima Guang's poem: "Black whiskers grow like parasitic white whiskers, every autumn and autumn worry?" People are old and near eccentricity, most of them are not hit, the words say: "Teach my brother to plant whiskers, pierce holes everywhere with a cone, and insert horsehair." There are ways to plant whiskers, but it is an inevitable joke.

Zuo Zhuan: "As for King Ling, he was born with whiskers." Tang painting Li Guangbi Biography: "Guangbi's mother had a long beard of ten, about five inches long, opposite the Korean lady." I think these are "hooked whiskers and egg hair," absurd and untenable. Xunzi said: "Hooks have barbs, eggs have hair, these are difficult to hold."

Yu Si's appearance is very beardy, commonly known as connected beard Yu. The story says, "Yu Si, Yu Si, abandon the armor and come again." Once, I taught at a school and said to the students: "Yu Si, Yu Si, what does he look like?" One of them blurted out: "Not as good as..." At this point, everyone burst into laughter. I also laughed. It can be said to be a wonderful metaphor for Yu Si.

I remember that two poets, A and B, met on the road. A had a connected beard, and B was nearsighted. In order to show off each other's talents, A recited a poem in front of B: "Your eyes are so strange, you ask who is by your side? Sunlight leaks through the paper, you always see ducks, the moon moves the flower shadow, you pick up firewood branches. You wear out your nose looking at the murals, you get your eyebrows caught in the locked bookcase, and there is something even more ridiculous: you burn off the skin of your mouth blowing out the lamp!" B listened and was not willing to show weakness. Seeing that A was a beardy man, he followed the original rhyme and recited a poem: "Why is your beard so strange? Not like a sheep, but like who? After the rain, you throw jade dew in your chest; when the wind comes, you dance flower branches all over your face. To distinguish between high and low, you respect the hair, if you talk about density, how can it be compared to the eyebrows? You are not afraid of fists coming to your cheeks, relying on it to cover the skin next to the rain." Hearing this, someone "angered and hair could move the crown, and would tooth whiskers not allow not to翘?"

In terms of ethnicity, Chinese people have fewer beards. Eight or nine out of ten of the short slaves in the East are with hooked noses. I have never seen a Western man with a connected beard. It is said that Mussolini shaved at least once a day. All blades that have been shaved cannot be used, so their hardness can be known!

When I was young, I liked to watch my father pluck his whiskers. In the study, he would read books and pluck his whiskers, almost every day. Since the July 7th Incident, I have sometimes found that my father's mouth and head are full of whiskers. And the color is dark yellow, as if about to turn white. One day, I ventured to ask him why he didn't do the "cleaning" as he used to? He sighed and said, "Only after having enough food and clothing can one know honor and disgrace. In this year, whiskers and such, I can't afford to take care of them." In today's society, I believe that many people would agree with these words.

### Orange Talk

— Zhu Xiang

As autumn turns to winter nights, oranges dominate the fruit market!

Regarding the meaning of "orange," Li Shizhen stated: "The character '橘' (ju, orange) comes from '　' (qing), generally meaning five colors for celebration, two colors for 　, 　meaning red outside and yellow inside, not smoke nor mist, but a lush and abundant image. The orange fruit is red outside and yellow inside, and when sliced, a misty and fragrant aroma arises, resembling 　clouds. The '橘' character's derivation from '　' probably takes this meaning."

As early as the Xia Dynasty under Yu the Great, oranges were already well-known. The "Book of Documents: Yu Gong" records: "Yangzhou's 　, wrapped oranges, pomelos, and tin are tributes." At that time, oranges were already wrapped like Flag oranges. Some say that the "Book of Documents" was forged by Han Confucians, but during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, Jiaozhi already had an orange official with a rank of 200 shi, in charge of providing imperial oranges. Oranges gained their fame in China very early.

Speaking of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area, during the Qing Dynasty, Tiaozhou, Taicang, Jiaxing, Yuyao, Shangyu, and Jinhua were all known for orange production. But now, only Huangyan and Quzhou remain. Produce changes with the times. Chinese historical records are detailed, but they neglect economic aspects. Planting oranges is suitable for saline-alkali land near rivers and seas. If the soil is fertile, the fruits will be sweet and abundant. Huangyan oranges are famous because of good seeds and suitable soil. Whether Quzhou oranges or Fuzhou oranges, their quality is surpassed by Huangyan oranges.

Oranges are divided into yellow oranges, flat oranges, cotton oranges, oil oranges, frozen oranges, etc. Flat oranges probably refer to today's mandarin oranges. Oil oranges have a skin that resembles an oily finish, a hard center and a black exterior. When sliced, they are not fragrant and tasteless, making them the worst among oranges. Huangyan oranges begin to bloom white flowers in August, when other oranges have finished. Frozen oranges bear fruit in ice and snow and are harvested in February or March of the following year. Although the fruits are small, they are very sweet. Eating oranges is best avoided with crabs. Eating them together easily makes ten guests feel weak and paralyzed.

The ancients often mistakenly identified citrus fruits, confusing green oranges with sweet citrus fruits. Mei Yaochen had this kind of joke. He wrote a poem saying: "In the past, I mistakenly identified them in Jingzhou, now I am confused by the Yue old man, yellow citrus and green oranges, like jasper and jade." It is said that Zeng Zigu was not good at poetry, but in his poem about oranges, there is also one:

"Slicing reveals a Sui pearl, drunk and joyful, cinnabar green hands falling dust, who has the strength like Huang 　, picking all the stars down."

Judging by diplomatic skill, during the Warring States period, Qi State's Yan Zi was a capable envoy. "Yan Zi was sent to Chu. The King of Chu gave Yan Zi wine. As the wine warmed, two officials bound a man and brought him before the King. The King said: 'What does the bound one do?' They replied: 'He is a Qi man, imprisoned for theft.' The King looked at Yan Zi and smiled, saying: 'Qi people are inherently good at stealing!' Yan Zi left his seat and replied: 'I have heard that oranges grown in Huainan are oranges, but across the Huai River, they become trifoliate oranges. Now, this man grew up in Qi and did not steal, but entering Chu, he steals. Could it be that the water and soil of Chu make people good at stealing?' The King of Chu was ashamed and submitted!" Twin fruits are still visible now, but the same plant bearing oranges and trifoliate oranges no longer exists. But in the Liang and Song Dynasties, one fruit bearing thirty or twelve fruits was often recorded. In the imperial era, this was an auspicious sign for the country. Now that botany is developed, if such an event occurs, it can be rewarded. It is not very difficult for botanists to cultivate them diligently.

### The Music of Nature

— Lu Shixiong

In the early summer of last year, I temporarily 　桓at a church university in Yangshupu. 　　At that time, although there were many broken 　walls and ruins everywhere, it was still a higher education institution, and those I met day and night were all people who "read the books of sages," so there was a clear distinction between elegance and vulgarity compared to the city 　life.

I lived in a dormitory for single male teachers, surrounded by lush flowers and trees, with a small garden-like atmosphere. However, since all the residents were single, it was cool and lonely. Considering the scenery and emotions, it is not difficult to understand. Next to the dormitory lawn, there was a sunken basin of about ten feet in circumference. After the rain, it accumulated water to a foot deep, forming a pool. There were countless frogs in the pool, swimming in and jumping out, 　naturally treating the pool as a paradise. The scene was even more lively when the lights came on. Thousands of frogs, led by a louder old frog, resonated in unison, noisy and loud, never stopping all night. They sang with great enthusiasm and even ran and jumped, as if singing and dancing, one can imagine their joy. This not only broke the loneliness of the single occupants in the dormitory but also, at first, they disliked the 　noise too much, making it a major threat to people's sleep, turning good dreams into a mixed mess. Later, they gradually got used to it and treated it as a natural 　　concert, sometimes even using it as a lullaby.

At that time, I remembered the roaring of tigers in the mountains and forests, and the bird language on Flower 　Island. In general, all living beings in the world can sing, not just the croaking of frogs. The Greek scholar Anaximander had an even deeper insight into this. He said: "All the sounds in the universe are in rhythm. The crashing of waves, the blowing of rapid wind, the circulation of blood, 　　virtue moves, the sounds produced by these, although subtle and indistinguishable, all have 　rhythm. Even when two sexes 　love, the passion boils, the blood rushes 　beyond the ordinary, and the rhythm produced is also unique." Based on the above,

I would carefully listen and distinguish: the croaking of frogs in the water, the 　　on the branches, the birds 　in between, the 　sound of the Huangpu River, 　each has its own rhythmic tones. That was my intersection with various pleasant sounds on campus, which I could not name, so I named it the music of nature, which still leaves me with 　pleasant memories.

### Random Notes Under the Lamp

— Feng Ren

Praise in the Morning, Curse in the Evening

Criticism is often difficult to be fair. It is either praise or curse. Qing Dynasty person Yuan Mingzi wrote in "Miscellaneous Records of the Scholars" about Yuan Mei: "Zicai's poems and prose are quick-witted and always new, especially 　praising the younger generation. Short chapters and fragments are praised endlessly. For a time, many literati followed him, and officials 　were fortunate to meet him. Korea and Ryukyu competed to buy his poems. However, his reputation declined sharply after his death, and scholars criticized him, but could not abandon him. One of his students privately engraved a seal that said: 'Student under the Gate of Suiyuan'. After Yuan died, the critics rose day by day, so he re-engraved the seal and said: 'Regretting being a student under the Gate of Suiyuan'." Zhang Wentao (Chuanshan) initially named his poems "Collection of Yuan," but later changed the name. The difference in 　praise before and after for the same person is like this. Even Pan Pan Dafang like Chuanshan could not avoid being vulgar, so others are even more imaginable.

Today's literary world also emphasizes fame over works, so the object of criticism often involves the person and their origin, age, and even physical shortcomings, while the work is secondary, or even forgotten. For various reasons, the phenomenon of praise in the morning and curse in the evening often occurs. It can be seen that ancient and modern literati are the same!

### The Malady of Legal Tender for Thirteen Years

— Ding Rongguan

Thirteen years ago! That is, on November 3, 1935, the financial reform order of the Chinese government during the era of writing was promulgated, and from then on, the coins and banknotes that varied in form and governance in each province tended to be uniform. This move opened up an unprecedented and brilliant record of unification in the history of our country's currency. Due to the outstanding credit, the eight-year War of Resistance: the unification of government orders, the stability of the economy, and the supply of military funds were all able to proceed without hindrance. Some say: without the currency reform thirteen years ago, the long-term decision for the War of Resistance, which was suddenly faced one and a half years later after the reform, could not have been made; and the victory of the War of Resistance was no less than a bloody battle between the legal tender against the Japanese yen and the puppet reserve coupons. The achievements of the legal 　are so great that it is not an exaggeration for us to attribute the fruits of victory to the success of the pre-war currency reform. The contribution of the legal tender to the nation and the country can even be described as benevolent and righteous!

It is a pity that after the victory of the War of Resistance, the legal tender did not retire with the victory. For two years, the supply and demand of recovery, the continuation of the suppression of chaos, and even the pushing of waves and assistance of bureaucratic capital inflation; the reputation of the legal tender has been declining like a river, once it starts, it cannot be stopped. The heroes who were once praised by the whole country and unanimously praised by everyone have now become criminals who are seen as unforgivable by all. The price index has been soaring, and the devaluation of the legal tender has been falling to the bottom. At first, it was a mathematical progression, then a geometric progression, and finally an astronomical figure! Before the war, the legal tender was stable at a ratio of 30 US dollars per 100 legal tenders. Now the US exchange benchmark is adjusted at any time, and recently it has reached a shocking distance of 73,000 yuan. The great disaster of the coming days is just beginning: before the war, large bills of 50 yuan and 100 yuan were called large, but now 10,000 yuan and the rumored 50,000 yuan are not considered large. The changes in the legal tender are so drastic that it is impossible not to feel the vicissitudes of the past and present!

However, the legal tender is innocent! This is not its fault, everything is due to human causes. The legal tender currently still alleviates the government's difficulties in balancing revenue and expenditure, and its malignant expansion has not yet reached the stage of the "mark" in the first post-war or the "kopeck" in this post-war era. Even if the consequences are not difficult to imagine, now, the lessons of the past can be learned, and the same mistakes should not be repeated. Reining in the horse at the edge of the cliff can save the situation from collapsing. Facing the thirteenth anniversary of the creation of the legal tender, we 　think of the past and plan for the future, learning from the past and preventing future mistakes. It is not without meaning to put forward the appeal of "Save the Legal Tender!" and "Rescue the Legal Tender!"

### Streets of Boston

— Zhang Qi

Boston is located in the northeast corner of the United States, on the Atlantic coast, a bustling commercial center, like an important port city like Shanghai. The city of Boston is made up of many towns. Each town has its own center. The streets run in different directions, spreading out like a spider web. The street names are taken from past well-known figures, unlike New York where it is easy to identify First Street and Second Street. When I asked for directions on the road, an old man told me that there was a saying in Boston that the paving of all city streets followed the direction of the trampling of oxen, so it was not easy to find. Sometimes after walking some distance, the rumor really seems believable. In Boston, there is Washington Street, and in 　Lin City, Niutou City, and Somowei City, etc., there are also Washington Streets. In the same city, there are even complex street names such as Harvard Street, Harvard Avenue, and Harvard Place. This is definitely a headache for outsiders who come here for the first time. There are buses, streetcars, and subways in the city. Paying a dime can get on any car, and you can transfer to another car midway until you reach your destination without paying extra, so transportation is quite convenient, but the streets are winding and complex, making it difficult to identify.

### Heavy Frost

— Shu Xiang

Once White Dew has passed, frost and snow are even closer. Liu Xi in "Explanations of Terms" says: "Frost is loss." This definitely has this kind of power over plants. Only Yang Wanli's poem "Frost at Dawn" describes it with great charm. He says: "The desolate sun searches for autumn light, the slight clamor breaks the dawn mist, only the Jiang maple is particularly pleased, kneading the frost water at night to dye its red clothes." Most poets lament autumn, but Yang Wanli's poem is an exception.

It is said that there is no frost or dew on high mountains. I verified this on Tianmu Mountain in western Zhejiang and it is true. Tianmu Mountain is 1,547 feet above sea level. When getting up in the morning and walking through the woods, there is no frost or dew. The reason is probably that the altitude is too high, the air is clear and the wind is strong. Although there is a slight mist, it is blown away by the mountain wind, so there is no frost or dew. However, high mountains are the first to suffer when it snows.

June Snow is the name of a play about wrongful imprisonment, but June Frost is the same. Huainanzi says: "Zou Yan served King Hui of Liang with loyalty. Those around him slandered him, and the king imprisoned him. Yan looked up to the sky and cried, and in the fifth month of summer, frost fell from the sky." In ancient books, the correspondence between heaven and man is like this. Wrongful imprisonment cannot be said to be non-existent now, but I don't know if crying is effective anymore.

In erotic poetry, such as Nen Zhenzi's poem about Jinling, it says: "At the end of the year, 　officials barely protect themselves, and in the high sun, Qing Nu still continues to display." Cang Guan speaks of pine, Qing Nu speaks of frost. This kind of imagination can be called amazing.

When dew is about to fall, the partridge birds in the water village first fly in groups and cry loudly. Animals fear the cold so much. People like partridges are probably not in short supply!

### One Week in Film

— Li Zhen

Cuckoos Sing Everywhere

The heroine of "Cuckoos Sing Everywhere," Lin Chuqing, was seduced by the businessman Song 　Yu and became his jealous wife. When she could not bear the bullying of Song's wife, she resolutely left and remarried the "Women's Issues" expert Zhang Weiqing. As a result, she committed suicide by poison because she could not obtain Zhang's understanding. Overall, the author attempts to portray the experiences of an unfortunate woman who has taken the wrong path. There are indeed many such stories in real society, but the author only presents the story without critically analyzing and pointing out the 　knot of the problem. He even describes Song Shiyu as so kind, as if all the blame should be borne by Song's wife. But he forgot that Song's wife is also a pitiful deceived person. She and Lin Chuqing are only fifty steps and a hundred steps apart, and the real culprit, Song Shiyu, is lightly let off, and even receives sympathy instead. Furthermore, the so-called "Women's Issues" expert Zhang Weiqing is even more of a quack, and one of the murderers who forced Du Chuqing to kill herself. Because these problems have not been answered correctly, the theme of this play is also blurred.

In terms of performance, Ouyang Shafei, Xu Li, and Zhang Wan are all quite competent. 　Yan 　is superficial and excessive. Tu Guangqi's directing is like keeping a running account—he understands best how to cater to the tastes of petty bourgeois audiences.

Atomic Bomb Secret

This scientific documentary depicts the research, manufacture, testing, and dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. It also brought about the victory of World War II. But today, this film is somewhat demonstrative. High scientific achievements must serve human happiness, otherwise, what is exchanged is bound to be destruction and devastation.

The director handles the film with rigor, and the actors' acting skills are all above par. The whole film is very smooth.

She's a Great Gal

A comedy starring Gene Tierney and Tyrone Power, depicting the story of a female swindler. There are many plot points in the play that do not fit the current situation, and the script is also mediocre. Although the performance is lighthearted, it is not in the style of a superior comedy, but rather an exaggerated technique to cater to the public.

Gene Tierney's performance is better than Tyrone Power's. It is another comedy film, depicting a beggar who becomes a noblewoman, but in the end, the author sends the heroine Kitty into the arms of a prodigal duke.

The scene where the old duke dies after rejoicing at the birth of his son is well done. 　　Paulette Goddard's Kitty is quite good, while Ray Milland's performance is lacking.

The Fighting Seabees

A war film produced by Republic Pictures, narrating the great feats of the engineering team of the United States Marine Corps in the war of resistance against Japan during this Great War. Although the whole film has many tense scenes, it appears scattered and loose due to the director's poor handling.

Among the actors, Susan Hayward's female reporter has mediocre acting skills, and John Wayne is only competent. However, Dennis O'Keefe's performance is relatively satisfactory.
