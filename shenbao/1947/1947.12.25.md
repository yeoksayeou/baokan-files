### Wang Chonghui Discusses Constitutional Governance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Renowned political figure Dr. Wang Chonghui stated when meeting with reporters on the morning of the 24th: "The Christmas season marks the beginning of constitutional governance in our country. This move will be a genuine challenge by the National Government to the Chinese Communists' slogan of a 'democratic government,' because the facts prove that the Chinese Communists' slogan is actually a pretext for their rebellious nature, confusing domestic and international audiences. The only path towards democracy lies in the drafting and implementation of a new constitution, but the Chinese Communists refuse to participate in both of these tasks. They constantly clamor for a democratic government, but in reality, what they are pursuing is the establishment of a communist dictatorship." Dr. Wang, an authority in Chinese law who has shouldered important tasks in the constitutional democracy movement for the past two or three decades, recently arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai. Dr. Wang stated: "This new era will guarantee to all citizens the freedoms under the constitution. The people will enjoy these freedoms in accordance with the constitution and within the scope of the law." Wang stated that the current provisional government will be reorganized in accordance with the constitution, and in the future, the two most important departments of the government—the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan—will be entirely elected by the people, so that these two bodies are based on the will of the people. Dr. Wang also pointed out that the future Premier of the Executive Yuan will be responsible to the legislative body, which is the mouthpiece of the people, and that all administrative measures will be guided by the chapter on basic national policies in the constitution. Wang stated: "The most important administrative policy of our country's new constitutional government is to develop local autonomy based on the constitution and relevant laws." After learning about the number of elected National Assembly representatives, Wang expressed deep satisfaction with the results of this election. He said: "On the whole, this election is indeed a success, as this is the first time that our people have used the right to vote to participate in elections."

### Guangzhou City Circulating Hong Kong Dollars - Ministry of Finance Orders Suppression

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] Recently, a most absurd trend has become popular in Guangzhou, namely, citizens disregarding domestic currency and favoring foreign currency.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Director of the Northeast Headquarters, recently arrived in Nanjing to report on defense matters to the authorities and request instructions. He has now completed his official duties and left Nanjing by special plane at 10 AM on the 24th to fly to Beiping and then to Pan. Before leaving, Zheng told reporters about the war in the Northeast, saying: "The establishment of the North China Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters will greatly help the war effort within the passes. If the communists can be eliminated first, then the National Army can concentrate on the Northeast, and eliminating the bandits in the Northeast will be as easy as turning one's hand." Zheng also said about the current situation of the bandits in the Northeast: "There are approximately 500,000 to 600,000 communists in the Northeast, with approximately one hundred aircraft. However, they have never used aircraft in combat. In addition, the recent seventh communist raid was only to damage the North Manchuria Railway and seize materials and cannot be called an offensive." However, Zheng stated that the Northeast needs more troops and ammunition and that the National Army will strive to take the initiative to attack the communists.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] Zheng Dongguo arrived in Beiping by plane from Nanjing at 2 PM on the 24th. He is scheduled to fly to Pan on the 25th. Zheng visited Li Zongren at 3 PM this afternoon. When he met reporters at the headquarters, he said: "The purpose of going to Nanjing was solely to report on military affairs in the Northeast and to listen to instructions. Chairman Jiang understands the situation in the Northeast in great detail. There is definitely no problem in the Northeast. The communists launching an offensive in the severe winter will benefit them in no way." Zheng then answered two questions from reporters: The Northeast needs troops from within the passes to reinforce it, and the central government is prepared to do so. However, from a military point of view, Jilin and Changchun are not that important. Even if they are abandoned, it will not affect the overall situation, and even if they are abandoned today, they can be recovered tomorrow, but there is no need to abandon them now. Zheng finally said: "The situation in the Northeast is developing in a new way. It is only a matter of time. There will be no shortage of food, and coal can be obtained locally."

It is estimated that the Red Army can provide 500,000 to 1 million in assistance to the Communist Party. The Third World War will be decided in the Northeast. The first step is for the Soviet army to hide within the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, launching an offensive in the Northeast to defeat the U.S., while simultaneously dispatching troops from Xinjiang and rapidly controlling the entire area north of the Yangtze River. The Communist army crossing south of the Yangtze River will be controlled by the Soviet army. If the situation deteriorates, it will completely control all manpower and materials south of the Yangtze River, implementing a scorched earth policy, making the entire area north of the Yangtze River desolate, even if the U.S. military lands and occupies it, it will make it extremely difficult. We must thoroughly overthrow landlords, rich peasants, and intellectuals.

### Business Tax Halved for National Defense and Livelihood Manufacturing Industries

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Business Tax and Implementation Rules stipulate that the business tax for manufacturing industries is halved, but only for those related to national defense or people's livelihood. The Ministry of Finance has now listed the manufacturing industries eligible for this halving separately: Those related to national defense include factories for coking coal, petroleum, diesel, spirits, smelting, power, machinery, cement, rubber, chemical products, acids, alkalis, salts, and scientific instruments. Those related to people's livelihood include factories for wheat, flour, cotton, silk, textiles, sugar, leather, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, shipbuilding operations, toolmaking, papermaking, fertilizer, cooking oil, and motor vehicles. The above-mentioned factories should not pay factory exit tax or production tax according to regulations, but if they wholesale their manufactured goods on the factory premises, the wholesale portion of the business tax is still subject to the full tax because it is the same as the retail nature of the manufacturers. In addition, the taxation of cotton yarn was originally based on a unit of 100 kilograms. Now, because the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulates that the packaging unit is one large package weighing 400 pounds, equivalent to 181.44 kilograms, the Ministry of Finance, in order to facilitate tax verification, has re-stipulated that from the first period of tax assessment in the 37th year, the taxation of cotton yarn will be uniformly changed to a unit of each large package. In special circumstances where the prescribed packaging is exceeded or falls short, those weighing four hundred pounds at the end of the seven-year period must have the exceeded or insufficient portion increased or decreased proportionally according to the tax rate set for each large package. They are still ordered to pack according to the prescribed weight to ensure uniformity within a limited time.

### Editorial: The Glorious Beginning of Constitutional Government

The Constitution of the Republic of China will be implemented starting today. The Constitutional National Assembly of last year has already made a resolution, and the National Government has also issued a clear order. From now on, the country will enter the normal track of constitutional government. The Kuomintang will be able to realize its long-cherished wish of returning power to the people, and the people will be able to fulfill their eager hope for governance. Therefore, December 25, 1947, is an important watershed in the history of the Chinese nation. On the occasion of the beginning of constitutional government, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, there is a sincere desire to express a few points to congratulate:

First of all, what we cannot fail to point out here is that the beginning of China's constitutional government coincides with the Christmas of the year 1947. The significance of this is extremely profound. In his broadcast speech on the eve of Christmas, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has clearly pointed out, he said: "When I think of Christmas this year, I think of the fact that we Chinese are going to start implementing a new democratic constitution on this festive day. I think this commemoration is very valuable. The 36th year of the Republic of China, that is, the Christmas of 1947, the year of the birth of Jesus, will be the day when our Republic of China and all the people will have a new opportunity for unity, independence, equality, and freedom. The characteristic of our new constitution is that it guarantees to give all our compatriots the basic elements of Christian doctrine, namely, personal respect and freedom." The day we begin to implement constitutional government coincides with Christmas, which is of great significance. It is not only an epoch-making event in our country's history, but also in human history. There is no more appropriate day for China to begin implementing constitutional government than December 25th: This is Christmas and the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. This is truly a glorious beginning for our country's constitutional government.

China is not a country that takes Christianity as its state religion, and we have no state religion; but the beginning of our constitutional government is on Christmas. For a non-Christian country to choose Christmas Day as the day to begin implementing constitutional government is epoch-making in human history. The birth of Jesus Christ brought new life to mankind. Since his birth, mankind can look forward to reaching the realm of eternal life. Because of the precious blood of Jesus, mankind can be cleansed of sins: hope arises from faith, and love arises from faith. Mankind has entered a new realm because of the birth of Jesus, gaining transcendence and liberation. The beginning of China's constitutional government on Christmas Day also signifies that the beginning of constitutional government can liberate China, transcend it, and enter a new realm. What is the new realm of transcendence and liberation for our country? It is the Kuomintang returning power to the people. From then on, the Republic of China has truly reached the realm of national politics by the people, of the people, and for the people; the fundamental law of the country has been implemented, and the implementation of the "rule of constitution" can be expected from now on. Just as the birth of Jesus strengthened our faith and gave rise to hope and love, the beginning of our country's constitutional government should also strengthen our confidence in the nation, the country, and even the entire world, and generate new hope from this confidence. What is this confidence? That is, no matter how bleak the current situation is, how chaotic the order is, and how turbulent the situation is, the future of the Chinese nation is still hopeful, and the future of the world is still bright.

What we should further point out is that China's constitution contains a rich Christian spirit. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek pointed out in his broadcast address: "The characteristic of our new constitution is that it guarantees to give all our compatriots the basic elements of Christian doctrine, namely, personal dignity and freedom." It can be seen that our country's constitution has many Christian elements and is a code that conforms to Christian doctrine and is sufficient to reflect the Christian spirit. It is a blessing for our nation to have such a fundamental law in a non-Christian country. This must be attributed to the spiritual inspiration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. As we weigh up the overall situation of the world, if the world is truly divided, then this division is definitely not a division between the East and the West, but will be a division between the Christian world and the non-Christian world. Non-Christian forces may be able to dominate for a while, but the result will inevitably be failure. Although the proportion of Christian believers in our country's total population is not high, this constitution with Christian spirit clearly indicates the direction we should take in the future. Although we are in the East, we do not recognize the division between East and West. Due to the implementation of this constitution, we have almost Christianized in terms of the fundamental law of the nation. Could there be a better day than Christmas for the implementation of this great law?

As we recall the painful experiences of the past 30 years, on the occasion of this constitutional government, as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, this is the price we must pay. "If there were no painful and dark sides, there would be no happiness and light in life. We know that the country and the people have been truly refined in such painful suffering. Our pain has given us new vitality and experience, which will enable our country and nation to overcome all the current difficulties and must reach the end of victory. With this understanding and this belief, we can see Jesus Christ, who has gone through all kinds of hardships and finally achieved victory, standing in front of us, acting as a guiding light for our country and encouraging our new life." With Jesus Christ as our guiding light, we will not worry about darkness or hardships from now on. This is truly a glorious beginning for our constitutional government!

### Civil Aviation Over the Past Year - Li Jinglu Issues Statement

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Li Jinglu, Director of the Air Transport Administration of the Ministry of Communications, recently met with reporters and talked about the improvements in civil aviation over the past year, stating briefly: This day last year was the most tragic day in the history of our country's civil aviation. Within five hours, three civil aviation planes crashed near Shanghai, killing 71 people. The Ministry of Communications was deeply saddened and decided to establish the Civil Aviation Administration to actively improve: 1. Unify flight navigation and command; 2. Improve equipment at airports across the country; 3. Improve aircraft radio equipment; 4. Increase weather observation equipment; 5. Stipulate airworthiness standards; 6. Add night navigation and landing equipment at important airports; 7. Strictly inspect aircraft parts; 8. Implement air traffic control for foreign aircraft entering the country; 9. Establish close ties with military airports; 10. Thoroughly reorganize personnel; 11. Train flight personnel and improve flight technology; 12. Increase the amount of passenger compensation and pensions and handle passenger safety insurance. In the future, it is hoped that civil aviation colleagues will continue to work hard to maintain a perfect safety record so that the painful lessons of this day last year will become a thing of the past forever.

### Dispute Between Shanghai Western Newspaper and Guild Unrelated to Freedom of the Press - Dong Xian Guang Explains at Press Conference

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Dong Xian Guang stated at a press conference on the 24th: Regarding the dispute between a Western newspaper in Shanghai and the Newspaper Guild over the allocation of paper quotas, some commentators abroad who do not understand the truth have made judgments that violate the facts, which is quite regrettable. I have now learned that an editorial in a New York newspaper stated that "The Chinese authorities are restricting the paper quota of newspapers that criticize the government as a way to restrict freedom of the press," and also stated that "If the Shanghai Evening Post is forced to stop publishing, then there will be no minimum amount of freedom of publication in China." Hong Kong newspapers also criticized this matter with the same tone. This kind of commentary is completely based on misunderstanding. The dispute over the allocation of paper arose from a resolution of the Shanghai Newspaper Guild. The Chinese government's problem with freedom of the press has nothing to do with the above-mentioned dispute. According to the current system, the government approves the paper quota for major cities, and then the local newspaper guilds decide on the quota for each newspaper. The guilds are free organizations of newspaper companies and are not subject to government control or influence. If member newspapers have disputes over guild resolutions, they can apply to the quota allocation office of the Import and Export Control Commission for a final decision. The dispute in Shanghai is the first incident since the implementation of the paper allocation system. After the government learned of this dispute, Minister Zhang Jia of the Import and Export Control Commission clearly informed the two Western newspapers and ordered the quota allocation office of the commission to conduct an investigation to seek a fair resolution of the incident. The occurrence of the incident is definitely not the result of the government suppressing freedom of the press. The Shanghai Evening Post knows this best. I would now like to quote an editorial from that newspaper, "Rash Judgments," to support my point. The newspaper stated: "When we were in dispute with the Newspaper Guild, we expressed our deep gratitude for the good intentions of the Hong Kong newspaper industry to support our position. At the same time, we must point out that the Hong Kong newspaper industry's belief that the Chinese government is ill-intentioned is probably wrong. We have both attacked the Chinese government, but we must also pay attention to the fact that the Chinese government has a considerable capacity to accept criticism and has no intention of controlling speech." The Shanghai Evening Post bravely corrected the erroneous concepts caused by this dispute overseas, and I am quite pleased!

### Personnel Choices for Three Post-Relief Institutions of the Executive Yuan Officially Announced

### Reports of Liu's Bandits Fleeing to Sichuan are Inaccurate. The National Defense Ministry's News Bureau Releases Weekly War Situation.

[Dispatch from Nanjing, this Newspaper, 24th] The spokesperson of the National Defense Ministry's News Bureau stated at a press conference on the 24th that the rumor about a faction of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops fleeing from western Hubei into Sichuan is inaccurate. This is because the number of Liu's bandits fleeing to western Hubei is less than 8,000. With the close cooperation of the national army and local civilian forces, it would be extremely difficult for them to realize their dream of crossing the dangerous Daba Mountains stealthily.

[Another Dispatch] The National Defense Ministry's News Bureau released a statement on the 24th regarding the war situation for the week from December 17th to 23rd:

### Communist Bandit Raids in the Northeast Do Not Impede Anti-Bandit Military Operations

In order to manipulate the deployment of the national army's forces and coordinate the flight of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's bandit troops in the Central Plains, the Northeast bandit army rashly launched raids before completing their reorganization and replenishment. Their main purpose was to destroy transportation and coal mines, and to obstruct the country's efforts to replenish and train troops. Since December 13th, the bandit army first used the 8th and 9th Columns of Li Qianlu's forces to destroy the Beining Railway and threaten Jinzhou. At the same time, the 2nd and 7th Columns of Huang Kecheng's forces in western Liaoning approached the area north of Kangping and Zhangwu. By the 16th, they were everywhere, attacking the weak points and exploiting gaps to launch raids. After the 17th, the bandit army on both sides of the Changchun Railway and the Beining Railway successively raided Heishan, Baiqibao, Xinlitun, Zhangwu, Faku, and the vicinity of Kanfosi north of Shenyang. The bandit army's 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 8th Columns on the east side of the Changchun Railway, and the 6th Column fleeing south from the Jichang Line, successively captured Changtu, the Yantai Coal Mine, and Dashiqiao, besieged the national army positions in Xinkaiyuan, Tiebei's Zhonggu, and Huagoufu northeast of Liaoyang. They also crossed the railway west through gaps near Changguo, Kaiyuan, and Yantai north of Liaoyang, attempting to capture Faku and Xinmin first, destroy transportation, and isolate Shenyang with the foreign troops northwest of Shenyang. Regarding the Communist bandits' risky raiding actions, in addition to giving them a head-on blow at Sanjiazi and Shahousuo south of Faku and Dashiqiao in southern Liaoning, killing and wounding about 6,000 officers and soldiers of the 2nd and 8th bandit columns, the national army also counterattacked from Siping, Liaoyang, Kaiyuan, Jinzhou, Zhangwu, and Kangping. By the 20th, the national army had recovered Shishan in western Liaoning, Beizhen, Yantai in Liaoyang, and Shifosi in northern Guan. The important locations of Jinzhou, Yixian, Beipiao, Zhangwu, Kangping, Kaiyuan, and Tieling are still under the control of the national army. Although the bandit army used more than 100,000 men to attack and disrupt Faku and Xinmin, and even repeatedly attacked, it was not enough to affect the national anti-bandit military operations, apart from destroying transportation, disrupting the lives and security of the people, and hindering the national army's reorganization and training.

### Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's Bandit Factions are Defeated and Retreat

In the Central Plains: The 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns of Chen Yi's bandit troops launched a full-scale raid on the Zhengzhou-Xuchang triangle area last week. Under the national army's three-sided encirclement attack, they were forced to flee southeast from Xinzheng, Weishi, Tongxu, Chenliu, Qixian, and Lanfeng from the 15th onwards to avoid the national army's encirclement and suppression. Currently, the 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns have fled to the Liuhe and Minquan areas north of Ningling. The 6th Column fled to the northeast of Taiyuan, and the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Columns fled to the area between Fugou and Ningling. The national army is pursuing them in separate routes. Liu Bocheng's bandit troops in the Henan-Anhui-Hubei border area, because they are reluctant to leave their new nest in the Dabie Mountains, although they have suffered heavy losses under the national army's fierce attacks, they are still milling around and unwilling to leave the Dabie Mountains area easily. Therefore, after the 20th, they were attacked from the east and west by the national army. Their 2nd and 3rd Columns have retreated to the Lihuang and Yuexi areas. A part of the 6th Column retreated through the Popi River north of Fubei, while the main force climbed over the mountains and retreated to Yingshan. The 2nd Column was relentlessly pursued by the national army and could not return to the Dabie Mountains, so it is still lingering near Runanpu north of Xixian. As for the remnants of their 10th and 12th Columns, after suffering heavy losses, they fled westward in a hurry and retreated to the Dahong Mountains north of Jingshan and Xinye in Henan, wanting to establish the Jianghan Military Region and asking the poor farmers for food and clothing and implementing "liquidation" and "struggle."

### Chen Geng's Bandits in Western Henan are Being Encircled and Suppressed by the Military and Civilians, and Their Collapse is Accelerating

The main force of Chen Geng's 9th Column in western Henan made a show of force last week to support Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi, wanting to flee from Minggang to Zhengyang. On the 18th, they stole into Queshan, plundered special resources, and kidnapped strong men. On the 20th, they fled west again. Their 4th Column and the 26th Brigade of the 9th Column raided Xuchang and Luohe on the 26th of this month. By the 20th, the national army from Zhengzhou moved south, the national army from southern Shaanxi moved east, and the national army from Luoyang encircled and suppressed them. The bandits had to retreat to their lair in the Funiu Mountains and echo the main force of the 38th Army near Luo, Chuandong, Jiuxian, and Checun. The national army has consolidated its foothold in the mountainous area. It is expected that under the joint encirclement and suppression of the military and civilians in that area, the bandits will inevitably collapse more rapidly.

### US-Iran Conclude New Agreement to Assist in Improving the Effectiveness of the Iranian Army. Agreement is Valid for One Year and Six Months.

Iran is Not Allowed to Employ Military Advisors from Other Countries During this Period.

[Dispatch from Reuters, New York, 23rd] According to its "open diplomacy policy," the United States has reported to the United Nations that it concluded an agreement with the Iranian government in Tehran in October of this year, stipulating that a US military team will assist in improving the effectiveness of the Iranian army. The agreement includes a clause stipulating that military experts from other foreign countries may not advise the Iranian army's affairs without the consent of the United States. The agreement is effective from October 6, 1947, to March 20, 1949, but the Iranian government may extend the agreement, and either of the signatory countries may terminate the validity of the agreement by notifying the other party in writing if necessary due to the development of the domestic and foreign situation. The mission of the US military team is to assist or provide opinions to the Iranian Isthmus Military Department and the Iranian General Staff Department on organization, management, and training methods. Strategic planning or combat planning against any foreign country is not within the scope of the mission of that country. US military team members may not hold command or staff positions in the Iranian army, but may, under the guidance of the head of the military team and with the consent of the Iranian Army Department, carry out inspection and investigation missions when necessary. The head of the military team and its members have the right to inspect any part of the Iranian military facilities, and the head of the department should provide inspection facilities and provide its records, plans, and communications. Military team members may not advise on confidential matters without the consent of the Iranian Army Department, and military team members may not disclose the secrets of the Iranian army to any other foreign government. The last clause of the agreement also states that during the validity of this agreement, the Iranian government may not employ personnel from any other foreign government to hold positions related to the Iranian army, unless with the consent of the US-Iranian government.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 23rd] State Department officials said that the agreement between the United States and Iran, which stipulates that the US military team will improve the effectiveness of the Iranian army, is only a continuation of the measures that have been in effect since 1942. The content of the new agreement is not much different from the original measures, and the number of US military personnel stationed in Iran will not increase.

### Agreement on Coal Production and Export Quotas in the Ruhr Area Reached by Britain, the United States, and France. France Obtains Half of the Amount Needed for its Steel Industry.

[Dispatch from United Press, Paris, 23rd] The French Foreign Ministry announced that the four allied nations have concluded a three-nation coal agreement, which will increase the amount of Ruhr coal France receives in 1948. The agreement was reached by Britain, the United States, and France in Berlin after the breakdown of the four foreign ministers' conference.

The agreement stipulates that the export of West German coal will continue to be based on the sliding scale method. According to the plan established by the Western powers at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in April of this year, the amount of coal Germany delivers to France and other European industries is directly linked to the daily output of the Ruhr. The French Foreign Ministry's communiqué stated that the sliding scale for German coal exports will continue to be implemented until the end of 1948, but will be modified to increase the proportion of coking coal in the export quota. Official French figures show that France's quota in 1947 was slightly more than 3 million tons, in other words, about half of the amount that French experts say is needed to fully operate the French steel industry. The communiqué also stated that the representatives of the three countries plan to jointly participate in the investigation of the critical situation of Ruhr coal production in the future, so that coal can be exported at 30% of production, instead of the current sliding scale, which at its maximum is only 35%.

### Panama Refuses to Lease Military Bases. US Troops Withdraw from Panamanian Territory. US and Nicaragua Plan to Dig New Canal.

[News from this Newspaper] Broadcast from New York, 24th: Washington News, the US Caribbean Commission announced that the US military has begun withdrawing from its military bases in Panama this morning. The garrison on Saint Choros Island, which was previously used as a chemical warfare test base, was the first to withdraw. According to an army spokesperson, this withdrawal plan was drafted long ago, because the United States has no right to station troops there.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The State Department announced that the United States will withdraw as quickly as possible from the 14 bases in the Republic of Panama that refused to lease to the United States. Earlier, the Panamanian Parliament had unanimously rejected an agreement that would have allowed the United States to lease these areas for five to ten years. In the future, the United States can only deploy defenses for the Panama Canal within the Panama Canal Zone.

The State Department's statement said: "Based on the verbal statement made during negotiations with the Panamanian government, the US military will immediately take the necessary steps to withdraw from the cities of the Republic of Panama outside the Canal Zone. This withdrawal will be completed as quickly as possible depending on the number of people stationed and the amount of equipment. The State Department also said that the United States believes that these bases are necessary for the canal's defenses, but the United States also does not want to have an agreement that cannot be accepted by the Panamanian people." It is reported that there are about 2,000 US troops stationed at the 14 bases in Panama, among which the B-29 bomber base in Rio Hato is the most important. The Canal Zone is ten miles wide and is leased indefinitely to the United States by Panama for an annual rent of 400,000 yuan, which is not within the scope of the dispute.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 23rd] After the Panamanian Congress refused to ratify the agreement to lease bases to the United States, Angel, chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Committee, said that his committee would immediately begin investigating the possibility of building a new canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The US government recently recommended to Congress to allocate 2 billion yuan to make the existing Panama Canal a canal that is level with the sea surface and does not require locks, in order to reduce the effectiveness of atomic bombs on the canal. As for the war to open a canal in Central America, it has often become a topic of discussion here. Nicaragua north of Panama is considered the most likely location.

[Dispatch from United Press, Panama City, 24th] Panamanian Foreign Minister Ford told United Press that he believes that although Panama has rejected the US base agreement, Panama and the United States can still cooperate on defending the Panama Canal.

Attendees included Liu Gongyun from the Central Bank, Li Lixia from the Financial Management Bureau, Yi Li and Liu Tianchu from the Textile Adjustment Conference, Sun Jice from the Fuel Management Committee, Shen Zonglian and Wang Guanqing from the Municipal Government, Wang Shiwei from the Supervisory Commissioner's Office, Zhang Yamin from the Garrison Command, Liu Bingyi from the Jianghai Customs, Ge Jiachen and Qian Yuzhong from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wu Kaixian from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Cao Maoliang from the Police Bureau. They conducted a comprehensive review of recent commodity prices in the city and discussed methods for improvement, striving to stabilize prices and ensure a peaceful end to the year. Furthermore, in compliance with the Executive Yuan's order, it was decided to establish the Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Distribution of American Relief Supplies, effective immediately. Mayor Wu will serve concurrently as the chairman. According to regulations, the chairman will appoint one member each from the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Food, the Municipal Council, and the Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies, as well as two members from local voluntary organizations. Until all members are appointed, the operations will be temporarily entrusted to the Civil Food Allocation Committee.

Principles of Handling

The following are excerpts from the Executive Yuan's principles for handling American relief supplies and the measures for distributing American relief supplies in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou for reference. Excerpts from the Principles for Handling American Relief Supplies: Both China and the United States will regularly send personnel to various regions to supervise the progress of the distribution. The first batch of American relief supplies, including approximately 20,000 tons of grain, will arrive soon. The distribution committees in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou will, based on the measures passed by the Executive Yuan's executive meeting, expand the scope of distribution, determine the target recipients and prices, and conduct detailed research on how to continue the distribution work in the future, submitting proposals for a decision. After the American relief supplies arrive in China, the overall receiving, storage, and transportation will be the responsibility of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies. Local receiving, storage, and transportation will be the responsibility of the local committees.

Distribution Measures

The measures for distributing American relief supplies in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou are as follows: The distribution of American relief supplies in each city shall be handled in accordance with the Sino-American Relief Agreement signed by the Chinese and American governments on February 27, 1947, and the handling measures for relief supplies in the third item of the working guidelines of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies (hereinafter referred to as the Yuan Committee). The materials referred to in these measures for distribution are limited to grain supplied by the American government, specifically rice and flour. To implement the distribution plan and supervise existing local organizations in distributing American relief supplies, the Executive Yuan, through the Yuan Committee, will entrust each municipal government to organize a Municipal Committee for the Distribution of American Relief Supplies (hereinafter referred to as the Municipal Committee) to handle the matter. The members of each Municipal Committee shall be appointed by the mayor of each city, including one representative from the Yuan Committee, one representative from the Ministry of Food, one representative from the Ministry of Social Affairs, one representative from the Municipal Council, and one to two members from local voluntary organizations.

The organizational structure, operational plan, and delegation to existing local organizations for handling distribution, as well as the administrative operation budget of each Municipal Committee, shall be drafted by the concurrent chairman and submitted to the Yuan Committee for submission to the Executive Yuan.

### Detailed Legislative Election Measures Differ Slightly, According to Chen Minshu

[Our Report] According to Chen Minshu, section chief of the Regional Election Section of the Election Affairs Office, the details of the legislative elections in this city differ slightly from what has been reported: Regarding the legislative elections, the Election Affairs Office's previously proposed improvement plan advocated for abolishing the voter registration certificate and replacing it with the national identification card. However, after reporting, the election headquarters instructed that the voter registration certificate is mandated by law and cannot be abolished, ordering that both be used concurrently. The Election Affairs Office has decided to comply. That is, during the legislative elections, regional voters must bring both their voter registration certificate and national identification card to vote. Failure to provide either will absolutely disqualify them from voting. The municipal government has already announced that all citizens should apply for national identification cards from their respective district heads. With the election still far off, the district heads can certainly process applications before the election, and there should be no situation where processing is delayed. If voters have not obtained their identification cards before the election, they will be considered to have voluntarily forfeited their right to vote. The intention of using national identification cards in the election is to easily verify the authenticity of voters. Therefore, it has been decided that the identification card is a necessary condition for voting. Receipts issued by district heads for national identification card applications will not be accepted as substitutes under any circumstances. The report stating that "receipts issued by district heads can be used as substitutes" is inaccurate. Voter registration certificates are, according to regulations, no longer issued during legislative elections. However, considering that many voters lost their voter registration certificates after the National Assembly elections, the Election Affairs Office has decided to reissue them to regional voters for the sake of expediency. However, the color will be slightly different from the previous ones to prevent abuse. The issuance of voter registration certificates and national identification cards is the responsibility of the election officials. If any district head withholds them during the legislative elections, strict disciplinary action will be taken. Voters must also personally collect and sign for their identification cards and voter registration certificates from the district head to show due diligence. The names of candidates will be printed on the legislative election ballots, and voters only need to circle one. Illiterate voters can still have someone mark the ballot for them, as in the National Assembly elections. The number of regional polling stations has been reduced from 200 to 126. The Election Affairs Office has decided to assign one guide to each polling station, and the personnel selection process has already begun.

### Compensation Materials to be Loaded, Two Vessels "Ming Zheng" Bound for Japan

[Our Report] The Liaison Meeting of the Committee for Supervising the Transportation of Japanese Compensation Materials was held yesterday at the China Merchants Bureau. It was decided that the Hai Kang轮 will depart on January 5th of next year, and the first batch of compensation materials is expected to be transported back around January 25th. The Hai Zhe轮 is scheduled to depart around January 15th. However, according to reporters, although the Hai Zhe轮 was repaired at the Keelung Shipyard and completed earlier, it has been grounded at the entrance of the shipyard by the Dingzhou轮 of the Zhoushan Company. Therefore, it must wait for the Dingzhou to be towed away before it can leave the dock. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether the Hai Zhe can sail to Japan as scheduled. In addition, the committee recently received a letter from the Tokyo Liaison Committee personnel, stating that due to various restrictions by the Allied Headquarters, the labels for the first batch of materials could not be properly affixed, and the material reception between departments will be chaotic. After receiving the letter, the relevant Chinese authorities have sent a telegram to negotiate. At yesterday's meeting, it was also agreed that at the next meeting, each unit should submit a report on the preparation for the receiving work. The Supervision Committee will also issue a weekly newsletter to inform the work situation. In addition, the receiving warehouse of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has been found to be the seventh terminal of the China Merchants Bureau in Pudong, and the warehouse has a large capacity to meet the needs.

[Also reported] More than 100 Japanese residents in the city will return to their country on the Hai Chen or Hai Zhe vessels.

### A Terrifying Memory: Yesterday Last Year, Wang Xiaodidi, Who Survived a Great Disaster, Celebrates a Memorable Christmas

[Our Report] On Christmas Eve last year, three passenger planes of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation crashed in the sky above the city. Among the more than 80 passengers who were almost all killed or injured, three-year-old Wang Xiaodidi miraculously survived without any injuries, which was widely regarded as a miracle. This lucky child who was rescued from the disaster on Christmas Day has been healthy and active, and extraordinarily intelligent in the past year, and can already recognize more than 300 characters. He says he never wants to fly again, and often describes to people the tragic scene of the plane crashing to the ground with a loud noise. In his innocent mind, it seems that many terrifying memories still remain. He is quite averse to seeing doctors. Whenever a doctor carrying a medical kit appears, he bows repeatedly and avoids him in every way, fearing that he will be subjected to the painful injections and treatments he received during the emergency rescue after the plane crash last year. His only protector in Shanghai is Ms. Tang Yijun, the sister of his deceased mother. Tang loves him more than anything else. To reduce his terrifying associations with the past, she has specially made several sets of large-scale airplane toys, which are beautiful and clean, for him to ponder and think about, hoping to gradually親 near them and restore his normal psychology. His parents and younger sister, who have said goodbye to him forever, are no longer clearly remembered in his impression. Today, he is getting ready in new clothes, preparing to celebrate the fourth Christmas in his life, which is worthy of memorial. (The attached photo shows Wang Xiaodidi, playing with a model airplane on Christmas Day, taken by our newspaper)

### Posing as a Judge, Lawyer Extorted Money, Court Investigates Thoroughly

A lawyer named Yang Bopeng was previously entrusted by his friend Mao Qi to purchase a house for his wife, Wang Caiwen. Yang filed a lawsuit against Zhang Ouguo regarding the price increase.

[Report from Our Newspaper] A thief broke into the storage room of the wine cellar at the residence of the British Consul General, Mr. Oakden, at No. 33 The Bund, the night before last, stealing six large cases of expensive foreign liquor, valued at over 100 million yuan. Given the strict security at the premises, making external entry difficult, the incident was considered suspicious. The Huangpu Branch Bureau was notified to investigate. Branch Chief Zhang ordered section chief Li Yinmin to dispatch Section Members Sergeant George and Shi Xueshan to the scene. They learned that Li Yansheng, a close friend of old steward Xu Jiufeng, had been seen loitering inside and spent a long time in the lavatory before leaving. The police officers inspected the lavatory and discovered a note left behind by Li, which read: "Second Brother Gengsheng, it's been a long time since we communicated." Based on this lead, they apprehended the suspect and recovered the stolen goods within 24 hours. This led them to discover that Li was an idle person who cohabited with Pan Yuying, a Shaoxing opera actress at the Tongle Theater, at No. 275 Tongbei Road. They dispatched additional police officers Zhang Hongxiang and Yao Hongzhang, who arrived yesterday afternoon and arrested Li while he was dining with his mistress. He confessed immediately after being taken to the station for questioning. Li confessed to damaging the door lock and stealing the expensive foreign liquor from the wine cellar, which he then hid at the home of Hu Yufang, owner of Fumin Candy Factory on Zha Pu Road. Section Chief Li then sent officers to recover the stolen goods, but eleven bottles were missing. They were returned to British Vice Consul Mr. Miller, who took possession of them. The criminals will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for trial today.

### Merry Christmas Celebrations: Some Rejoice, Some Grieve; The Wealthy Indulge, the Poor Can Barely Breathe

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Christmas, a day of dancing and celebration for many! The cold wave has temporarily left the earth, but soaring rice prices have created a divide in this city. The wealthy revel in joy, while the poor struggle to breathe under the weight of rice prices. In the large display window of the Ford Motor Company on Zhongzheng West Road, two deer pull a new model "Ford," and Santa Claus in the car carries a sack full of banknotes. Passersby are drawn to this beautiful scene, gathering in groups, but to what end? It's just an advertisement!

What will Santa Claus bring us this year? Tens of thousands of refugees inside and outside the shelter dream distant dreams every night. From street corners to bridge piers, from the ends of alleys, they hope that a collection vehicle will take them to the shelter. On the eve of Christmas, the shelter found that one of the newly admitted refugees was carrying nine pawn tickets; another, unable to bear the hunger, ate sixteen pieces of dried tofu from a street vendor without money to pay, and was grabbed by the vendor; and another, named Zhang Yushu, claimed to have been a reporter for the Nanjing Dazhong Daily, who, after being unemployed for a long time, came to Shanghai to visit friends but failed to find them. He was mistakenly identified as a refugee by the police and forcibly admitted. With tears in his eyes, he said to others, "The outside world must be celebrating wildly, right?"

Precious Warmth, a Huddled Group

Isn't wild celebration a fact? The dance hall orchestra plays the most stimulating melodies, tea costs 200,000 yuan a cup, and a Christmas dinner costs 500,000 yuan per person. In every dance floor, you only see paper hats turning excitedly, high and low. At eleven o'clock, how can the dance floor's business hours limit the desire to seek pleasure, find bars, find friends, change places to dance. Where there are Christmas trees, turkeys, silver bells, and balloons, there is warmth, this precious warmth! A waning crescent moon in the sky shines coldly all night on a group huddled by the roadside!

The Aftermath of the Accident Guarantees Safety

With bright stars and a clear moon in the vast sky, Christmas night travelers should be the luckiest. The lingering fear of the simultaneous crash of three passenger planes on this day last year still remains, but this year, the large runway and runway lights at the Sanhua Airport have ensured that this misfortune will not happen again. May God bless these poor people who are busy traveling thousands of miles? No fog, no wind, what a bright Christmas Eve! Wang Xiaodi, a young boy who survived last year's plane crash, has happily passed the anniversary of his ordeal.

Listening to the Blessing Bells Celebrate National Revival

The Xinjiang song and dance troupe, who have been guests in this foreign land for nearly a month, are also welcoming this holiday, which does not belong to their religion, with joy. On October 23, they had already celebrated the "Sacrifice Festival" in Nanjing, which is also the Islamic New Year. When they first arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing, the first thing that surprised them was the "density of people." They wondered, if it was a grand festival, to what extent would this density of people develop? Christmas has finally arrived, and they have decided to take this opportunity to visit various places carefully. This passionate day will be even more astonishing in the eyes of the compatriots in the border area, right?

When the blessing bells ring in the church, will you know that today, besides Christmas, is also our own National Revival Day, the day the Constitution goes into effect!

### "White Tiger Reigns, Disaster is Certain": A Marvelous Confession in a Kidnapping Case; A Diviner Knowingly Committed a Crime

[Report from Our Newspaper] Tailor Jin Wenbin, Cao Rendang, and Tian Shengde conspired on October 15 to kidnap Tang Xiaoming, the young child of Tang Guyun. However, Jin and the other two were illiterate, so they asked fortune teller Jiang Zhigao to write a threatening letter demanding 50 million yuan, promising to give Jiang 2 million yuan as a reward after the matter was completed. Before writing the letter, they also had a character analyzed and obtained the character "慮" (worry). After the case was discovered, the police arrested Jin and others and transferred them to the District Court for handling. According to Jiang's confession: when analyzing the character "慮", he knew that this matter was ominous, because the character "慮" has a "white tiger" on top, and disaster is certain, but because the income from fortune telling and character analysis was meager, he coveted the 3 million yuan reward and unknowingly fell into the net of the law, requesting the court to be lenient in sentencing. After the trial, the court decided to hold the trial on the 31st of this month.

### Adjusting County Education Funding to Align with Constitutional Implementation: The Ministry of Education is Drafting a Plan and Consulting with the Ministry of Finance

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Ministry of Education, due to the fact that the education funding in various provinces and counties after the restoration is far from the standard stipulated in the Constitution for the constitutional period (the Constitution stipulates that education and cultural funding in counties should account for 35% of the total county funding, while the education funding in a very small number of provinces is only about 10%, and the rest are even lower), in order to remedy this situation and align local education in various provinces with the Constitution, the relevant departments and personnel have held repeated meetings to discuss and draft a plan, which is currently being consulted with the Ministry of Finance. After joint consultation and determination of the plan, it can be implemented in accordance with the procedures.

### University Entrance Qualifications: Including Equivalent Academic Ability; Liu Yingshi Expresses His Opinion

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] On the 22nd of this month, the Legislative Yuan passed the University Law. Regarding the clause on entrance qualifications, the original draft of the Ministry of Education was limited to graduates of secondary schools and equivalent schools.

However, universities debated fiercely on this matter, and finally equivalent academic ability was re-added. Recently, Liu Yingshi, a counselor of the Ministry of Education, made a statement explaining that allowing those with equivalent academic ability to apply for the exam can only be regarded as a flexible measure for a small number of talented and hardworking self-learners.

### Peking University and Tsinghua University Graduate Students Request Improved Treatment; Entrusting Central University Students to Petition the Ministry of Education

[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping Airmail] Graduate students from Peking University and Tsinghua University recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education requesting improved treatment. The original telegram is as follows: "To Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing: The treatment of graduate students in various universities is meager and has long been difficult to maintain. Recently, prices have skyrocketed everywhere, especially in North China. The monthly income of students is not enough to maintain three meals a day. Reading with an empty stomach is beyond our ability, and our work has stagnated, which is contrary to our wishes. Moreover, most of the graduate students currently in school completed their middle school and university studies in the midst of war. After ten years of displacement, their studies have been greatly damaged. If they cannot even get enough to eat or buy a book while they are engaged in research today, what will be the consequences? Your Excellency must be able to see clearly. I believe that the way to build a nation is to first emphasize academic independence. The nature and importance of the work of students engaged in research in domestic universities is no different from that of students studying abroad or teaching assistants in various schools. The government can provide the former with sufficient foreign exchange and the latter with appropriate new salaries, but the treatment of the latter is particularly meager, which seems inappropriate in terms of both reason and emotion. After checking, the number of graduate students in each school is not too large. Even if the treatment is improved, the increase in the burden on the national treasury will be very limited. Central University and other schools previously requested an increase in graduate student stipends to three-quarters of the total income of teaching assistants, which is the minimum standard. Your Excellency is wise and will surely grant our request so that we can concentrate on our work. We are located in North China, and the situation is special, and we are particularly eager. In addition to entrusting Central University students to petition in person, we hereby submit this telegram and respectfully request that you grant it as soon as possible to comfort our hopes and avoid dropping out of school. We await your orders with utmost anticipation! Graduate Student Association of National Tsinghua University, Graduate Student Association of National Peking University."

### After the Passage of the Flower and Cotton Yarn Management Regulations, Chairman Yuan Returns to Shanghai to Prepare; Management Committee Decides to Be Established Next Year

[Reported by our newspaper] The National Flower and Cotton Yarn Management Regulations have been passed by the Executive Yuan's 35th regular meeting on the 23rd, the full text of which appeared in yesterday's newspaper. Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Flower and Cotton Yarn Management Committee, took the passed management regulations back to Shanghai at 2:45 pm yesterday. He immediately drove to the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee and summoned the heads of the various departments of the Cotton Yarn Management Committee (including the six departments of Secretariat, Procurement and Transportation, Manufacturing, Distribution, Finance, and Accounting, and the three offices of Personnel, Supervision, and Auditing). They discussed various detailed rules for handling affairs and the printing of all kinds of documents. He also conducted a final review of all personnel of the original Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee to determine who would stay and who would leave, in order to facilitate the transition.

Mr. Yuan met with reporters at the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee at 5:00 pm yesterday. He stated that the implementation of the comprehensive control policy for flower and cotton yarn was based on a handwritten instruction from the highest central authority. The central authorities, in view of the recent price fluctuations in various regions, believed that the primary task to stabilize people's livelihoods was to control materials and manage floating capital. Therefore, the comprehensive control of flower and cotton yarn was the first step, with the overall goal of managing national finance.

After the new management regulations are passed, the original Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee will be closed down before the end of this year. The Cotton Yarn Management Committee will be formally established on January 2nd next year.

After the establishment of the Cotton Yarn Management Committee, the first step will be to carry out a general registration. This includes: registering the amount of cotton in stock at yarn factories, the daily output of yarn, the current amount of yarn in stock, and the amount of cotton to be consumed in the future; registering the amount of yarn in stock at weaving factories to facilitate yarn-for-cloth transactions; and registering the amount of cotton in stock at cotton merchants, which will be purchased at a fixed price. The registration period will be from January 2nd next year to January 10th for this city, and to January 15th for other cities. Orders will be issued and announcements will be made simultaneously. Those who fail to register within the deadline will be subject to appropriate penalties.

Regarding the purchase of domestic cotton, Mr. Yuan stated that in this time of war and chaos, military transportation is heavy and traffic conditions are often unpredictable, so it is impossible to guarantee certainty. However, an appropriate amount of foreign cotton will be imported to facilitate allocation, depending on the actual supply and demand of raw cotton.

Mr. Yuan then showed a table compiled by the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee comparing the price increases of 25 major commodities in the city, comparing the market prices on January 5th of this year with those on December 11th of this year. American cotton rose by 2030%, ranking 11th; Shashi cotton rose by 1998%, ranking 12th; 20-count Shuangma yarn rose by 1210%, ranking 19th; Longtou fine cloth rose by 1129%, ranking 21st; and 42-count double-strand Lanfeng yarn rose by 837%, ranking 25th. This shows that the price increase of flower and cotton yarn is still relatively stable. The fact that raw materials have risen more than finished products also indicates a decrease in general purchasing power.

Currently, the national cotton spinning industry has a total of 4.5 million spindles, but only over 3.6 million spindles are actually in operation. He hopes that all spindles can be fully operational within one and a half years to increase cotton yarn production and promote export sales.

Mr. Yuan concluded by saying that he deeply hopes that the people and the government will achieve thorough cooperation in the implementation of this flower and cotton yarn management policy, and sweep away the previous wait-and-see attitude. He cited registration as an example, saying that those who truthfully declare their registration figures will definitely benefit in the future. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that officials and the people can cooperate sincerely so that the flower and cotton yarn management policy can发挥最大功能.

[Reported by our newspaper] After the National Flower and Cotton Yarn Management Regulations were passed by the Executive Yuan, reporters specifically sought the opinion of Mr. Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District. Mr. Wang stated that he was unwilling to express any opinion and would only wait for the implementation of the regulations. However, he personally had one suggestion, namely that the personnel implementing the regulations, from the heads of the various departments to the personnel actually carrying out the work in various regions, must have complete and skilled experience in all relevant departments of flower and cotton yarn. In other words, they must be experts in all departments of flower and cotton yarn so that many unnecessary losses and delays can be avoided when implementing the regulations.

### "Historian and Science"

— Yang Shi

(Original by Gaetano Salvemini, translated by Professor Zhou Qianchong, published by Commercial Press.)

Before introducing this book, let us first introduce the original author, Professor Gaetano Salvemini, to the readers. He is the greatest contemporary Italian historian, with a unique understanding of the history of Italian civilization. In 1925, when the demon Mussolini and his Fascist henchmen began their cries, this great master of history did not sit idly by and watch these villains who demeaned the people run rampant. He first exposed the dictatorship and danger of this group to the people of Italy and the world in his lectures at the University of Florence, and was arrested as a result. After being released from prison, he fled to England, and then to the United States. On this new continent, he lectured at Yale University and Harvard University, and tried his best to expose the dictatorial crimes of the demon, echoing the great composer Toscanini (also an Italian) in the United States at the same time, encouraging the Italian people to rise up against Fascism.

This book is a collection of lectures by Mr. Salvemini at the University of Chicago, so the language is light and maintains the style of conversation, making it more intimate to read. Moreover, there are very few technical terms, and it goes from the shallow to the deep. In addition, the translator, Professor Zhou Qianchong's, pleasant writing style ensures that this masterpiece does not have the bitter taste of a moralist preaching and reciting scriptures with a solemn face. Therefore, we especially recommend it to readers: This is a very rare book that has been published recently.

In the past one or two decades, people in any country have blindly believed in the political, economic, and cultural opinions of some natural scientists, which has made Professor Salvemini very angry. He used his extensive knowledge to refute the arguments that "history is common sense" or "history is art." History itself is a science, and historians are also scientists, but not natural scientists (Mr. Salvemini calls natural science "the science of the physical world" and human science "the science of the human world"). For history and physics, science is not a difference between "yes" and "no," but a difference between "more" and "less," because all conclusions and arguments in history cannot have 100% authenticity like physics. Therefore, historians "lose many believers." The facts studied by historians must be unique and complex. He cannot use objective standards to measure the objects he studies. He cannot repeat history that has passed for two or three hundred years to seek causality like physicists after countless experiments. Therefore, historians' conclusions are allowed to have biases and errors, and they need to be revised from time to time. But this does not mean that historians are not scientists; if so, we can declare that Pasteur is not a scientist because he believes that all diseases are caused by germs, but today the medical community has proven that diseases are caused by a lack of certain vitamins or organ dysfunction. Can it be justified to say that Pasteur is not a scientist because he made mistakes? The same can be applied to human science. There are also many relatively simple departments in the history field, such as paleography and numismatics, whose authenticity and systematicness are no less than any natural science. This means that the simpler the phenomenon, the closer it is to the category of science. Conversely, in chemistry, the more complex the changes, the less close they are to authenticity, and there are still many hypotheses that cannot be proven true or false.

After many discussions, the original author believes that historians and even social scientists are not completely error-free and are allowed to have biases. His use of biases to seek the cause and effect of a historical phenomenon is like a natural scientist using hypotheses to try to explain a physical phenomenon. "In solving social problems, since no one is error-free, then the only way to solve social problems is to try various solutions... We are not sure that we possess absolute truth in social problems. Therefore, we must not despise the various viewpoints that stand in opposition to us; we have no right to use violent means to eliminate the opinions of others." This is the essence of Mr. Salvemini's book, which is also the theoretical basis of his free and democratic thought. As he said, "Only fascists say 'Mussolini is always right,' Catholics obey 'one God, one truth, one Church of Jesus,' and those stubborn communists believe that 'Marx's Capital is always error-free.'" Liberals should have "humility and forgiveness" and have an attitude of trying and possibly making mistakes in solving social problems—just like the British say "Muddling the rough"; not respecting the opinions and speaking rights of the enemy is an unscientific spirit, and we do not recognize that kind of historian as a true historian, let alone a scientist.

When discussing the relationship between philosophy and history, we dare not completely agree with Mr. Salvemini's opinion. He said, "The writings of philosophers seem to be factories for manufacturing clouds, which will confuse my ideas... I have no philosophy of history." But the author forgot why he praised democracy and freedom and opposed fascist dictatorship. Isn't that his philosophy of history? Maybe he is being too humble.

At the end of this book, there is an extremely valuable essay "What is Culture?" It generally says that it is not very coherent with the previous content. In the article, Professor Salvemini has a pertinent criticism of the modern education system. "Many teachers believe that reading and studying must be about broad knowledge and strong memory, and having the knowledge of an encyclopedia; this disease is 'stuck in the past.' It damages the mental health of both teachers and students." "Schools cannot impart knowledge that is necessary for life, useful, or enjoyable. What schools can provide are a few clear, well-organized facts and concepts that can serve as a structure to place more life experiences in the future." The author's argument has many similarities with Shaw's argument, so this last essay may be even more valuable for teachers and students in schools.

After reading the whole book, I also believe that a sound historian should also have a good foundation in natural science. Looking at Mr. Salvemini's many citations to physics, astronomy, and medicine, we know that he has not relaxed his knowledge of "the science of the material world," and has a very deep understanding, which is very different from those historians who only look at old paper scraps.

### Lecture Notes on New Trigonometry

— Suo Yi

(Edited by Zhu Fenghao, published by Nengmen United Bookstore.)

The adoption of secondary school textbooks is most troublesome for science textbooks. Those compiled by Chinese people are often considered crude and simple, while completely adopting original books is impractical. Therefore, most students feel inconvenienced. As far as I know, Mr. Zhu's Lecture Notes on New Trigonometry is actually the most complete and practical mathematics textbook currently available.

Mr. Zhu relied on decades of teaching experience, combined the essence of European and American mathematicians, and completed this book after dozens of on-site teaching sessions. Although the author modestly claims that "there are still many omissions and errors," as far as I know, except for the omission of "known X is an acute angle" in Question 2 of Exercise 4 on page 22 and the correction of "one" to "ten" in Item 2 of Question 1 of Exercise 13 on page 127, it is simply impossible to find errors. It can be said that it is one of the textbooks with the fewest errors.

What I want to praise most is that this book has several characteristics: First, identities (Chapters 3 and 7), equations, measurement problems (Chapters 4 and 11), inverse trigonometric functions (Chapter 8), and elimination methods (Chapter 12) are listed as special chapters, and each chapter is classified and fully discussed. Detailed explanations are given for various methods of solving problems, especially "the substitution method of one." Second, all the important example problems in the book are listed with multiple different solutions, which can improve readers' interest in research. Third, a square frame is drawn next to the example problems in this book, indicating the characteristics of the solution to the problem, in order to wake up the eyebrows and deepen the impression of learners. Fourth, there are also many examples selected for the application of trigonometry in analytic geometry, which can enable readers to integrate trigonometric solutions into geometry and benefit from analogies.

In particular, the miscellaneous examples of proof problems in Chapter 7 are most welcomed by readers. It lists various proof methods, such as the application of Demcivre, the transformation method of special angle functions, the solution of finite product and finite series problems, and the problems of arithmetic series, geometric series, etc. It also lists one hundred exercises with various solution methods. Readers chew on them as if chewing olives, and the more they do, the more interested they become. Regarding the elimination method (Eliminaion), the author himself believes that it is not complete enough and plans to add more. Then, this book can be said to be perfect.

Finally, I would like to quote the author's motto as the conclusion: "One more proofreading, less misleading readers." I hope that writers across the country will work hard to proofread their works, which is the most sacred work!

### A Reference Book for Studying Japan

— Bin Zhi

"Research Materials on Japan," edited by the China Academic Society, Dacheng Edition

The war has ended for two years, and the peace treaty with Germany is still under negotiation. The peace conference with Japan is yet to be resolved. Japan can be considered the main culprit of World War II, but due to international conflicts, defeated Japan has been able to calmly engage in post-war reconstruction. Although under Allied control, its spirit of perseverance and hard work reveals its vigorous ambition, showing a strong tendency to rise again. On the other hand, our victorious country is still plagued by war, and the people cannot yet enjoy peace.

We have suffered enough from Japan in the past, and seeing the current situation in Japan, we cannot help but feel deep concern. Before the peace treaty with Japan is resolved, we must eliminate the elements of war in Japan. This is not only for China's sake but also related to peace in the Far East and security in the world. To eliminate Japan's war-making elements, we must first understand the situation in Japan.

The China Academic Society has compiled a "Research Materials on Japan," which is the latest systematic research book on Japanese issues after the war. It describes Japan's post-war situation and current issues separately. The entire book consists of ten volumes, each volume discussing a single issue. "Post-War Japan and the Allied Powers," "An Overview of the Control of Japan," "Post-War Japan's Finance and Economy," "The State of Japanese Industry After the War," and "Post-War Japan's Culture and Education" have already been published. "Japan's Political Situation Before and After Surrender," "Post-War Japan's Political Parties and Parliament," "Post-War Japan's Constitution and the Imperial Family," "Post-War Japanese Society," and "Post-War Japanese Literature and Art" are currently being printed. Judging from its topics, it already includes the Japanese situation that we need to know.

Furthermore, in terms of the content of the five published volumes: "Post-War Japan and the Allied Powers" and "An Overview of the Control of Japan" report on how the United States has been condoning Japan for the past two years. To what extent has it been condoning Japan? An answer can be found here. It can also serve as a reference for how Japan should be handled in the peace treaty in the future.

In the peace treaty, one important issue is how to stipulate the future industrial level of Japan. Due to the different circumstances of each country and different views, there are different opinions. The two books, "Post-War Japan's Finance and Economy" and "The State of Japanese Industry After the War," describe in detail the current economic situation in Japan. From here, we can know which factories should be dismantled and which production should be restricted. How to determine reparations, to what extent the dissolution of financial cliques is implemented, and what kind of policy should be adopted for foreign trade can all be answered.

To eliminate the elements of war in Japan, the most important thing is to transform the thinking of the Japanese people. The militaristic democracy that Japan promoted in the past and the Bushido education that was implemented are the biggest obstacles to Japan moving towards democracy in the future. Therefore, to eliminate the threat of war from Japan and to ensure lasting peace in the Far East and the world, Japan's education must be transformed. "Post-War Japan's Culture and Education" describes the current state of Japanese education, as well as religion, thought, science, and so on. We can find out what the consequences of Japan's re-education have been in the past two years.

### Words on the Psychology of Learning

— Nian Hong

Written by Fu Binran, published by Kaiming Bookstore, priced at one yuan and ninety cents.

This book does not talk about learning methods but only about the direction of learning. If we use a ship as an analogy, this is not the paddle that propels the ship forward but the rudder that determines the direction of the ship.

The entire book consists of twelve chapters, which are not continuous or connected. Each chapter has its own independence, but generally, there is still a system to be found. There are many new insights on mental hygiene. The author uses simple and common examples to introduce them, and then refers to reliable experiments, drawing on various sources to clearly outline a distinct contour, so that readers can deeply remember it.

"Learning is an activity in which an individual makes appropriate responses to stimuli from the environment," the author explains this most popular explanation of learning twice in the first chapter. Therefore, in the following chapters, he repeatedly emphasizes the impact of the environment on learning. Based on the conclusions drawn from the theory of heredity and the theory of environment, the author believes that "what heredity gives us is only various specific abilities, not content; and ability is only a possible tendency, a starting point of plasticity." Therefore, from the perspective of education, since whether the hereditary ability can be fully developed depends on the quality of the environment, the impact of the environment on individual development is much more important than heredity. Because of this, except for the 2% of geniuses and idiots, the fate of ordinary people depends on the degree of personal effort. The so-called genius can only be developed through society and the masses. Otherwise, "cleverness is often ruined by cleverness." How many geniuses who were brilliant in their lives ended up in a tragic situation, becoming a laughing stock for the world? This is the best lesson.

However, an individual's success or failure depends on the degree of their own efforts, but effort must also have the direction and method of effort. The learning of skills and knowledge focuses on application and understanding. We should seek genuine knowledge and living knowledge that are realistic, scientific, and democratic; not empty, metaphysical, and monopolized by a few. We should eliminate dead things that are indigestible and useless. This is the reason why we want to overthrow the former imperial examination system and improve the current education system. Once the direction of learning is determined, the method must also be accurate. "As long as you put in enough effort, you can grind an iron pestle into a needle. However, if you can think of a way to divide the iron pestle into many iron coins first, and then grind the needle, wouldn't it be more efficient?" (Page 23) From this, we can see that learning requires hard work, but also requires the use of skills. In the last paragraph of the last chapter of the book, the author synthesizes the essence of "learning methodology" and "learning theory," which is quite thought-provoking:

"...Learning methods are originally experiences gained by predecessors through hard work. This kind of experience... can increase our learning efficiency... Learning is "practice," and learning methods are "theory." Theory is produced through practice, and then it turns around to guide practice... Learning is the main thing, and learning methods are secondary; learning comes first, and learning methods come later. Therefore... everyone must use the best methods to make the best efforts. But "it is better to retreat and weave a net than to envy the fish in the abyss." If you only talk about methods and are unwilling to put in the effort to learn, it is better to learn first and put the methods aside!"

These are really a few excellent proverbs for friends who are walking on the road of learning.

Driven by human selfishness, many bad psychologies are produced. These bad psychologies are often moths that eat away at learning. In the sixth chapter, "Sour Grapes and Sweet Lemons," the author lists several of the most common ones: In addition to the strong arguments or excuses of shirking responsibility and deceiving oneself, there are also the "substitution" of Ah Q being beaten by Zhao Gongzi and seeking out Wang Hu, beating Wang You being nothing more than joking with a nun; the "compensation" of a dwarf walking with his chest out and a protruding belly, and an ugly woman applying makeup; the "regression" of clearly being behind in material civilization but boasting about the spiritual civilization of ancestors, etc., which are all very common and extremely undesirable psychologies. To avoid these bad psychologies, we need to maintain an optimistic mood, an objective attitude, and a good environment, which are the three elements of mental hygiene.

The book fully elaborates on the fallacies of learning curves, the saying that understanding one thing leads to understanding everything, and the harmful effects of rote learning. It also corrects the common misconception of despising the learning ability of adults - believing that once people pass childhood and adolescence, they lose their curiosity, brainpower, assimilation ability, and no longer have the ability to learn. Of course, from the sighs of "the world is deteriorating" and "people's hearts are not as good as they used to be" from the mouths of elderly people in the upper class, it can be seen that this group of old gentlemen no longer continue to learn new things and are obsessed with the bones of the past. However, this view is only an accumulation of mistakes, a view that is habitually overlooked. According to modern psychological experiments, people's learning interest does not decrease between the ages of twenty and fifty. The saying "you can never stop learning," Lenin's "learn, learn, and learn again," and the many great men who "bloom late" further demonstrate that the ability of adults to learn does not decline. In society, we often hear people who are not yet forty years old saying that they are old and useless. This bad phenomenon must be eliminated. In this book, the author tells us that this bad phenomenon is unreliable and has found a scientific basis.

In short, this book is indeed a good book that is beneficial to the mind. However, although the book cites many simple examples, there are still too many specialized terms in education and psychology. Since Kaiming Bookstore has compiled it as a type of youth series, ordinary middle school students will feel a slight headache for these and thus reduce their interest in reading the book. I hope the author can improve it in the fifth edition.

### Talking about the General in "The Front Line"

— Ruo Fei

"The Front Line" is a script that I have heard of for a long time. I remember it was two years ago when Mr. Shao Lizi was sent back to China from the Soviet Union and brought this book to General He Yingqin. The former was entrusted by the latter. At that time, the war was still spreading across the country, and the enemy was gathering heavy troops in various places, attempting to open up the Asian continent. "The Front Line" should have had some educational effect in China at that time, right? Unfortunately, we could not see the translated version at that time.

Korneichuk is a famous Soviet playwright. His debut play was "Ukrainian Steppe," a comedy depicting the pastoral love of young men and women in the Ukrainian countryside. "The Front Line" is his fourth play. The theme is to expose the self-willedness of the old-fashioned warlords in the Soviet Union and the bravery of some low-level combatants and commanders.

This is a contrast; on the one hand, the fighters bravely overcome the fear of death, the spirit of comradeship and harmony shrouded in a strong group, and how the new general Ognev fought his way up, finally replacing the fallen one; on the other hand, the commander of the front line who does not know how to grasp the times, does not know how to learn, is conservative and selfish, and has a strong exaggeration habit - Ivan, Gorlov - his "talkativeness" does not help the battle, and even causes various mistakes and sacrifices. The ending is that he is ordered to be dismissed and the command seal is handed over to Ognev, whom he despises the most and who was promoted out of turn.

What Korneichuk wrote is a typical character. He did not take a specific person or a specific situation as the object of description. His models are numerous, but after his deletion, emphasis, and sorting, he created several typical characters: such as the fallen old-fashioned general Gorlov, such as the alert and intelligent military commissar Gaidar, such as the new generation character Ognev, such as the cowardly and negligent reconnaissance minister Wu Qivielida, such as the boastful journalist Klikun, etc.

The publication of "The Front Line" also caused a stir in the Soviet Union, because it greatly criticized the old-fashioned generals, who were figures who had been in battle for a long time in the past and had made great achievements. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, views on "The Front Line" were also divided into two factions. One faction agreed with the author's view, believing that reasonable criticism is better than concealment and selective silence. Lunacharsky said, "Those who can criticize themselves will never be doomed to destruction due to criticism," which is the truth they agree with; the other faction accused the author of exaggeration, as if he exaggerated the ignorance and cowardice of the negative characters too much. This situation is probably the same in all countries. The question is just one: "Should darkness be exposed?" Some people object, believing that family scandals should not be publicized, while others agree, believing that without exposure, there is no way to reform. From the perspective of literary workers, no matter what position he takes, he should agree with the latter. Lao She said, "As soon as you pick up a pen, you have to look around like a thief." Under such writing circumstances, it is simply impossible to produce works like "The Front Line."

The story is like this:

Gorlov is a hero of the old era. During the founding era of the Soviet Union, he made some great contributions. When the German-Soviet war broke out, he naturally took on the important task as before, serving as the commander of the front line. However, there is no doubt that there is something wrong with the old man's head. He likes to recall the past and often says to young people: "What do you think? You don't even know two times two in military affairs. When we were fighting all over the place, you were still sucking your mother's milk... " and so on.

Gorlov is an old hero, we admit. But "old" is not a weapon to repel the enemy. Only by constantly striving to improve ourselves, constantly advancing, and learning, can we repel the enemy. Gorlov's failure is that he is too self-willed. Knowing that his son was killed in battle, he did not cry, which is a manifestation of his heroic character; but when he knew that Ognev had won because he did not invite him to keep his order, he flew into a rage, which is also a phenomenon that personal heroes must have.

When discussing strategies and tactics, Gorlov likes to make big speeches and empty talk. Whenever he is refuted by Ognev and others, his only way is to maintain the dignity of his front-line commander, regardless of everything, and resolutely issue some inexplicable orders.

Gorlov finally said a truthful sentence at the end of the play: "I want to correct the heads of the Ognevs." Yes, "correcting heads" is the foundation of all creation. However, what should be transformed is not Ognev, but Gorlov himself, who is conservative, selfish, and likes to talk big.

The whole play uses the technique of satirical comedy. The impression after the continuation is very deep. It may be even more touching to perform it.

### Christmas and the State of Society

— Jiu Tang

The end of the year is approaching, Christmas has arrived, turkeys are on the market, gifts are in the windows, dazzling silver glitter and stars, and price tags of tens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions, are enough to startle and frighten people. The joy is really overwhelmed by the sigh of hardship. The fact that the Christmas invoices of large companies cannot be sold to 1,500 sheets, and thus there is a little dissatisfaction, is still secondary.

Why must we celebrate Christmas? The birthday of Confucius, Qu Yuan's martyrdom, and even the birthday of Guanyin Bodhisattva do not seem to be so lively. Then, the center of the ten-mile foreign market can be said to be everywhere foreign. Even friends who burn incense and recite the Great Compassion Mantra in front of Guanyin Bodhisattva will definitely stroll around the three major companies to buy Christmas gifts for friends or superiors whom they cannot but respect, as long as they have the desire and the strength is not insufficient. The sayings of Jesus' hell and the theory that it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven are probably not worth considering at all. That is to say, the meaning of Christmas in China is no different from the Mid-Autumn Festival and the New Year. Businessmen make money, and wealthy officials spend money, and there are two targets: their own stomachs and the flattery they want to pay.

I am not against Christmas. Those who are against it even think that Santa Claus is a snobbish villain. The result of war is bound to be economic hardship, which leads to a general decline in morality, creating a phenomenon where everything is abnormal. This is also a common occurrence in China, but using the saying from "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," "It has always been like this since ancient times, but it is even more so now." This degree is truly unprecedented. Zhang Duanyi's "Valuable Collection of Ears" says:

"In ancient and modern times, there are many things that rulers of the world valued. Tang and Yu valued virtue, Xia valued merit, Shang valued old age, Zhou valued kinship, Qin valued criminal law, Han valued talent and strategy, the Eastern Han valued integrity, Wei valued rhetoric, Jin valued purity and tranquility, Zhou and Sui valued clan prestige, Tang valued institutions and culture, and this dynasty valued laws and arguments."

Although some of what is said here is illogical, it is not bad to say that it is a characteristic of the Qin and Han dynasties. Wu Hanjun quoted this article in his essay on "Social Customs," and then said that what has been valued since the Republic of China is "reform," and in the last ten years, what has been valued is "profit." Naturally, this is very emotional, but it is also a fact. However, in my opinion, "reform" is only a matter for a few people, while profit has been a prevailing trend since the Qing Dynasty, and it is incurable. It's just that the word "profit" is not specific enough because it can also include pragmatism and altruism. China is completely selfish and self-interested. Instead of saying "profit," it is better to change it to the word "private."

In fairy tales, Santa Claus rewards good and punishes evil, and does not only look for those with fireplaces and warm chimneys to come down slowly. For so many evildoers in China, they should have two frogs or mice in their socks. As for the second generation of children, they are often tainted with the smell of money and power as soon as they leave their families. It is better for Santa Claus not to come. Don't let the wind and snow only hit the little girl selling matches, the young masters should also taste it.

### The Origin of Santa Claus

— Wei Wo

On the afternoon of December 24, 1822, Dr. Clement Clarke Moore happily hurried home. He had left the New York Theological Seminary, where he taught, early that day because he was going to write a "Christmas Fantasy Poem" for the children. At that time, the white snow was flying.

He said to himself happily: "Today it really looks like a Christmas scene. I will ask Katherine and the children to let me think quietly for an hour to complete that fantasy poem."

So an hour later, the poem was written.

Everyone finished praying, followed by a sumptuous dinner. After the meal, Moore sat in a leather chair by the fireplace, and the children climbed onto his knees. His wife, Katherine, sat in a reclining chair nearby - it was a perfect Christmas Eve!

"I brought you a little toy - a Christmas story." Moore said to the children:

"It was the night before Christmas, and there was not a sound in the whole house. At that time, many stockings were hung by the chimney,

Waiting for the arrival of Saint Nicholas.……

The children held their breath and listened to their father's loud and heavy voice. He said:

"- This is the story told by a child who was awakened from his sleep; he jumped out of bed and stretched his eyes to look out of the window where the moon was bright and the snow was white:

A little old man vaguely appeared in his eyes.

He drove a sleigh pulled by eight little reindeer,

And came in quickly and lively.

I know, this is Saint Nicholas!

He is really an amazing friend! He can fly over the roof with many toys and come down from the narrow chimney.

"There is a round face and a bulging belly,

When he laughs, his belly stirs like pulp in a mortar."

The children asked Moore to repeat it to them again and again; they seemed to be fascinated by this "A Visit from St. Nicholas."

However, the next day, the respectable professor stuffed it into the drawer, mixed it with old manuscripts, and had long forgotten about it. But his wife secretly copied it and sent it to the editor of the Troy Sentinel. On December 23 of the following year, the poem was published.

Newspapers and magazines all over the world competed to publish this poem. Children's books and school textbooks also selected it. This kind of reader reaction shocked Moore. What was even more moving was that it had become a custom of Christmas celebrations.

Little reindeer, Saint Nicholas, stockings... these well-known Christmas features are all found in Moore's wonderful poem. He seems to have given the world a happy picture, he made thousands of children dream and evoked their childhood memories.

Until now, publishers consider "A Visit from St. Nicholas" to be an immortal work.

Moore thought it was not a moral poem, but it has been praised by children for the past 125 years. Although he has never received any reward for this, that happy Santa Claus will be immortal with the world and will always be a friend of children!

### Three Commemorations

— Xu Pu

There are many historical events worth commemorating today. In addition to the international Christmas holiday, there are also three major events in China worth commemorating: the Yunnan Uprising; Chairman Mao's escape from danger in Xi'an; and the completion of the National Assembly's constitution-making. Now, I have specially written three commemorative poems to express my sincere joy.

The Yunnan Uprising

The banner to fight the thieves rises from the clouds of Lingnan, The red sun falls in the New China Palace; The theory of national rejuvenation continues, Everyone praises General Cai of Shaoyang.

Chairman Mao's Escape from Danger

The escape from danger in Xi'an is remembered today, The magpies reported the good news in the sound of firecrackers, Never has there been such a day of joy, Even now, the memory is still pleasant.

The Completion of the National Assembly's Constitution-Making

Dignified officials gathered in one hall, The three-chapter covenant was discussed at length; The grand plan for a century is not easy to talk about, This is the beginning of setting the country and stabilizing the nation.

### The Value of a Husband

— Yi

In Missouri, USA, a woman hit her family's dog with a baseball bat and was arrested by the police. As a result, the court sentenced her to a fine of one hundred dollars.

A few days later, she hit her husband with the same baseball bat and was arrested by the police again. As a result, the court sentenced her to a fine of twenty-five dollars. (Translated from the New York Herald Tribune)

### Opening Up a Path to Survival

— Wang Pingling

The 1947 calendar is quickly coming to an end. This year, the world has been full of disturbances, both startling and soul-stirring. I am exhausted from dealing with it all, and have lost the leisure for contemplation. Not only can I not remember trivial matters that don't concern me, but I am also vaguely aware of what I have done myself. In the course of my life, it can be regarded as leaving another blank page.

In moments of leisure, I often flip through the Annals of Qin. I see that after Ying Zheng extinguished the six states and unified the world, he built the extravagant and peerless Afang Palace. When he was still in his prime, he announced his future tomb on Mount Li. He also fabricated the myth of the alchemist Lu Sheng: "Qin will be destroyed by Hu," spreading the rumor that the northern barbarians would come to destroy China. Immediately, he issued a decree to recruit strong men from all over the world, implementing an unprecedented national defense plan - building the Great Wall for thousands of miles. Why did he start such massive construction so soon after the six states were pacified, without giving the people a chance to rest? It was really because he couldn't manage the armies of the six states. Although the six states were destroyed, the strong men mobilized for the wars of the six states had reached a saturation point. The same was true for the Qin state, and they had to think of a solution. Therefore, the only method was to engage in large-scale construction.

From this historical fact, it can be seen that the politicians of the pre-Qin period were indeed clever. They knew the importance of the unemployment problem after the war, and they knew that if these discharged soldiers had nothing to do and no place to use their strength, they could be used by a few ambitious people as tools for fighting for power and profit. Unfortunately, they should not have engaged in massive construction, building palaces and tombs. Even though those adult men were exhausted and would not rebel, the depletion of the national treasury and the waste of people's labor, which led to the unprecedented poverty of the world, was also the main cause of the demise. If they could have driven these discharged soldiers to the front lines of production, stationed them in villages, planted trees, cultivated mulberry trees, and raised silkworms, and instead of building the Great Wall, they had focused on repairing the Yellow River, which had been a problem since the Qin Dynasty, and instead of building the Afang Palace and the tombs on Mount Li, they had focused on using the strong men of the seven states to open up wasteland, then, it can be asserted that even if Ying Qin's national treasure could not be passed down for ten thousand generations, it would not have perished in the second generation.

Learning from the past is a guide for the future. Starting next year, I hope everyone will do more work that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and broaden the path of life so that everyone can find resources to survive based on their own abilities. As long as people with a skill or art can develop their strengths, do their best, and exchange for the deserved price, they can support the minimum standard of living, and not run into walls everywhere, have no way out, or be forced to take risks and run to their deaths.

Starting next year, I hope that every Chinese person can do a productive job to fill in their own life history. If we cannot open mines and build roads, then if everyone plants a tree on Arbor Day next year, there will be 470 million trees. In the future, the lush trees will be spectacular and a great national wealth. Isn't that better than being idle and saying empty words? Without production, there is no way to survive, and production is more important than everything else. We must not endlessly waste manpower and material resources on non-productive work such as repairing guard doors, building gardens, beautifying city appearances, expanding meeting places, entertainment venues, and hosting grand banquets for domestic and foreign dignitaries... Although it can make a few people busy with these non-urgent tasks and fill their own stomachs, the country and the people will inevitably become more and more impoverished.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Five: Unexpected Disaster (24)

As soon as Mrs. Lin entered the room, she viciously reached out and slapped her in the face. Seeing that Mrs. Lin started hitting her as soon as she entered the room, Futian quickly put down his things and hugged Mrs. Lin around the waist, shouting, "Qiwan, run! Run!" Having suffered a loss, Qiwan saw that Mrs. Lin was unreasonable and knew she couldn't win. There were also many people surrounding the door, and she was afraid she couldn't escape, so she quickly slipped out through the small door of the bathroom. Seeing Qiwan run away, Mrs. Lin refused to give up. For a moment, she was held tightly by Futian and couldn't break free. In a hurry, she opened her mouth wide and bit Futian's arm three times. Futian felt a pain like being bitten by a dog, and his hands loosened. Mrs. Lin struggled free and picked up a feather duster, chasing after her, shouting, "Where are you running? Block the gate!" Seeing that she couldn't get out of the main gate, Qiwan quickly escaped through the side door. Mrs. Lin led the crowd and followed her out, forcing Qiwan to have no way to go and wanting to drown herself. At this critical moment, she happened to meet Zhuzhai, who relieved the siege. At that time, Zhuzhai repeatedly asked Qiwan, "What's the matter?" She only cried and refused to say, only shouting, "Let me go! Let me go!" Zhuzhai said very sincerely, "Don't say it's you, even a stranger on the road, if I encounter this situation, I will help." Qiwan said, "I don't need help, my life is not good, it's better to die!" Zhuzhai said, "This kind of dark society, there's no reason to talk, don't be sad, I'll send you..." Zhuzhai hadn't finished speaking when Qiwan shouted, "I'm not going back, I have no face to go back!" Zhuzhai saw that her forehead and arms were constantly oozing blood, and quickly changed his words, "Of course you can't go back, I'll send you to the hospital." Qiwan said, "I'm not going either! If I'm beaten and the doctor knows, it's too embarrassing!" Zhuzhai said, "There's no need to tell him, just say you fell off the car and were injured, okay?" Zhuzhai said as he pulled her up the earthen slope. The old coachman, because Zhuzhai jumped off the car halfway and didn't pay the fare, was still guarding the earthen slope. Seeing Zhuzhai helping someone up, he quickly pulled the car closer. Zhuzhai helped Qiwan into the car and instructed the coachman to pull her to Renmin Hospital and give him more fare. Hearing that he would get more money, the coachman excitedly picked up the handlebars and trotted a few steps, but eventually walked slowly because of his old age and weakness. Zhuzhai supported her beside the car, following along, and told Qiwan that there was a Dr. Wei in Renmin Hospital who was a friend of his and lived in the hospital. He would ask him to take a look first. This Renmin Hospital was not far from Shichahai. After a while, Zhuzhai saw a small red brick building with a white lychee-style light bulb at the door, with a red cross painted on it. It was shining brightly in this secluded place. In the silence of the world, this white red cross lamp was very dazzling. Zhuzhai told the coachman to pull the car to the small building with the light. When they arrived at the door, Zhuzhai took out his business card and handed it to the errand boy who opened the door, while helping Qiwan out of the car and into the waiting room.

### Better to Forget Each Other in the Rivers and Lakes

— Bai Wuwu, Dragon's Birth Painting

Have you been to Jixu Street? There are so few telephones, so many slopes and ridges, and the public buses are so crowded. The people crowded at the bus door are usually pushed into the crowd by the station staff to close the bus door, like a fat, soft book cover being stuffed into a narrow bottle mouth.

Therefore, friends in cultural circles regard visiting friends as a major event, like a country woman with bound feet going to the city to burn incense, requiring courage and spirit.

If it is a friend six or seven miles away, then it is only for the sake of borrowing money to buy rice. People in large cities outside of Chongqing cannot imagine the difficulties of Chongqing's poor people, and they do not understand cultural people walking more than ten miles back and forth to beg for a liter of rice.

More than ten years ago, the writer Li Jinming wrote a short story, which is still an excellent masterpiece today, although the title cannot be remembered. The general idea is: a person living in the same house comes to talk to him at night, chatting about many irrelevant things. He leaves, and then comes back after a while, still talking nonsense. He leaves again; only when dawn breaks and he hears the sound of crying from the neighboring room does he realize that the person's child has died. He became seriously ill last night, but had no money to see a doctor, and wanted to borrow money, but he could never bring himself to ask!

Isn't the situation of cultural people in Chongqing the same?

Zhuangzi said: "It is better to forget each other in the rivers and lakes than to moisten each other with saliva." However, friends in Chongqing's cultural circles sometimes cannot even use saliva to moisten their companions, because they are already dry-tongued and their gastric juices are exhausted!

### Joint Words

— Baili

When Mr. Min Zhiting of Gui'an was nine years old, his maternal uncle, Minister Mao, held a banquet for guests at the Yuan Ridge. Mr. Min participated because of his old family connection. Minister Mao composed a couplet and asked the guests to match it, saying: "No moon on the Lantern Festival, how many black lamps, to add color to the rivers and mountains." That day happened to be the day of the Awakening of Insects, and Mr. Min immediately replied: "No thunder heard on the Awakening of Insects, strike several drums, to proclaim authority on behalf of heaven and earth." Minister Mao greatly praised him and married his daughter to him. Xiong Tingbi, the Grand Minister of the Ming Dynasty, first won the first place in the Huguang martial arts examination in the Wanli period, and then abandoned martial arts for literature, and won the first place in the Huguang provincial examination in the Dingyou year of the Wanli period. Therefore, he inscribed on his hall: "Three champions are available in the world, but two top graduates are unique in the world." (Seen in Qing people's notes)

Mr. Yang Gexin: The China Merchants Bureau does not have a Jiangsheng wheel. There is no "trade office" on any of the China Merchants Bureau's ships. After inquiries, there is no such person named Mao. This matter may be a scam, please do not be deceived!
