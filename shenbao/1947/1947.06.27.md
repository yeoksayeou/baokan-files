### The Siping Battle Nears Its End: National Army Could Converge on Two Routes; Communist Troops Outside Jilin Fleeing South

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 26th Dispatch] The National Army, advancing on Siping from the north and south between Shenyang and Changchun, is making favorable deployments and striving for the initiative. The southern route is clearing out and intercepting Communist troops north of Changtu. The northern route is facing off outside Gongzhuling. A major battle is expected between Gongzhuling and the Dongliao River banks south to Guojiadian. From the 25th to the 26th, fierce fighting in Siping has not ceased. Communist troops are taking turns attacking the eastern district. Furthermore, the Communist 7th Brigade reinforced Siping on the 25th to participate in the battle. Due to unfamiliar terrain, casualties were quite heavy. It is learned that the Communist troops are also unable to reinforce further, and the Siping battle may end soon.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] The Shenbei National Army's Advance Corps crossed Changtu and advanced northward. The Communist 2nd Column concentrated on the Quantou line, attempting to resist stubbornly. Quantou, directly below Siping, has no defensible terrain. The Siping battle is nearing its end. Yesterday was surprisingly quiet, with only sporadic Communist artillery fire heard. The Air Force continued to carry out powerful attacks on the surrounding Communist troops. On the morning of the 26th, the Communist troops on the Quantou-Erbushibao line showed clear signs of weakness and retreated in two directions, one towards Dongfeng and the other towards Bamiancheng. Director Du has telegraphed General Chen Mingren, stating that they will converge in Siping within two days.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] According to intelligence obtained by the military, the majority of the Communist troops in Siping have withdrawn. Only a few regiments are confronting the Siping garrison. Yesterday, the Siping garrison recovered a stronghold west of the railway. However, according to military observers, the Communist troops seem to be concentrating on the north and south sides of Siping, attempting to prevent the powerful National Army corps from attacking on two fronts. Although the dangerous situation in Siping is easing, the Communist troops still have the ambition for a final desperate attack. The outcome of the battle within the week will be revealed. Our concerns are twofold: (1) that the Communist troops are deliberately creating a false impression to protect their main force's safe escape; (2) that the Communist troops, humiliated in defeat, may angrily turn back and attack Changchun. While this is concerning, it is not a major worry.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] A large number of Communist troops, fleeing back from Siping, have gathered on the Gongzhuling line, obviously wanting to prevent the southward National Army from crossing Dujiagou and pressing on Gongzhuling. The National Army encountered more than 2,000 Communist troops attempting to attack northward at Yujiawopeng. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Communist troops were routed. The majority of the Communist troops are blocking the National Army on the right side of the railway from the west and southwest.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] Pan Yukun, commander of the New First Army, along with Yang Wen, commander of the 50th Division, and many staff members, inspected the Changnan area along the highway on the morning of the 26th, giving many instructions to the generals of the Advance Corps. Pan and his party returned to Changchun that evening. Furthermore, the National Army advancing southward along the Chang-Shen road bypassed Gongzhuling on the 25th and continued to send powerful forces to advance rapidly southward.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] The strong forces of the National Army advancing on Siping from Changchun and Shenyang are now only a hundred kilometers apart, destroying the Communist troops' obstruction efforts, and will soon press on Siping. Also, according to a telegram from Kaiyuan, Director Zheng Tu arrived in Kaiyuan from Tieling at noon on the 26th to command the northbound reinforcement troops. After the National Army cleared out the remaining Communist troops in the vicinity, it went straight for Siping in the afternoon.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, a small group of Communist troops raided Xinlitun on the Changchun-Yitong highway and were routed by the mopping-up troops. On the Ji-Chang line, the National Army is mopping up the area near Quanpichang after crossing Tumenling.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] The Communist troops in eastern Jilin's feigned attacks and feint offensives on the south bank of the Songhua River last week have completely failed. Wula Street and Jiangmifeng, former Communist outposts, are now almost military vacuum zones. The Communist troops in that area have fled south. The area around Jilin has been quiet for days. The Communist troops are only staging feigned attacks with small units in the Kouqian area in the southwest to prevent the Jilin National Army from crossing the river to pursue them. Furthermore, at noon on the 26th, the National Army's leading rapid advance troops had reached Chalucha. Part of the Communist troops' Independent Division entrenched there had retreated to the Yinma River, Guandi, and Shaoguojie areas (all north of Chalucha).

### Commemorating the Signing of the United Nations Charter Chairman Chiang's Broadcast to the World Reaffirms China's Ideal of Collective Security

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] To commemorate the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, Chairman Chiang delivered a broadcast to the world from 4:30 PM to 5:45 PM (Nanjing summer time) on the 26th. The original text is as follows: Today is the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, and I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words from the capital of China to peace-loving people around the world. In the past two years, the various important institutions stipulated in the United Nations Charter have been established one after another. The Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and its various committees and affiliated institutions have seen their responsibilities and activities gradually increase, indicating that the world's trust in the United Nations institutions is also growing rapidly.

I say this not to predict that permanent world peace is currently at hand. On the contrary, I am very aware that the arduous task of "building peace" is still ahead, and there are still many world issues that need to be handled fairly by the United Nations. However, if the member states of the United Nations are willing to put the interests of their own countries secondary for the happiness of the whole world, then these difficulties can still be overcome. In the past, during the San Francisco Conference, China boldly announced to the world that we were prepared to entrust part of our sovereignty to the new international organization for the sake of collective security. We also said that in order to achieve our common goals, we must be prepared to make some sacrifices. Today, I would like to declare to the world again that we still hold this ideal, and we believe that the realization of this ideal is the key to the success of the United Nations. Regarding this point, people around the world may be pleased to know that the Chinese Constitution, passed by the Chinese National Assembly in November of last year, specifically stipulates the upholding of the United Nations Charter in its chapter on foreign policy. I believe that among the member states of the United Nations, China is still the only country that has explicitly stipulated the upholding of the United Nations Charter in its constitution. But this is not a fundamental change in China's national policy. The ideal of "universal harmony" is China's inherent thought.

Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, also re-emphasized it as the ultimate goal of human civilization.

Today, I cannot but very sincerely commemorate my late friend President Roosevelt. His noble ideals were deeply moving and advanced the组 of the United Nations. President Roosevelt's contribution to serving humanity is worthy of our commemoration. I think the best way to commemorate him is for everyone to work together to make our United Nations an ever-existing, ever-growing institution.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Central Broadcasting Station recently received Chairman Chiang's speech, broadcasted during a special program commemorating the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in New York. The voice was very clear, with the original text followed by an English translation. According to the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, a film of the Chairman's speech was respectfully requested on the 15th and sent to the United States by airmail. The Bureau also cooperated with the Ministry of Communications to wirelessly transmit the English translation to the Dula recording station in California, USA, where it was recorded and sent to the New York Broadcasting Station. Therefore, the broadcast to the world was very fast and satisfactory.

### Wang Chong-Hui's Opinion on Current Situation

[Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch] National Government Committee member Dr. Wang Chonghui stated to reporters regarding his opinion on current situation: Vice Chairman Sun's remarks the other day can quite represent the thoughts of the nation's citizens. China and the Soviet Union, as neighbors, should be friendly. Moreover, the diplomatic policies of both countries both view world peace as their goal. However, the enhancement of the relations between the two countries must come from the joint effort of both sides and must not come from only one party's responsibility. Regarding the Sino-Soviet Treaty, our country signed this treaty with the greatest resolution and with the greatest sacrifices, and the aim was nothing more than hoping that the two countries would be permanently friendly. To this day, our country has complied with this treaty without any violations and has the right to ask the Soviet Union to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the treaty with the same spirit. Regarding America's Far East policy, at the very least, it should be as proactive as its Europe policy and should give China continuous aid. America and Britain must understand that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty was based on the Yalta Secret Agreement between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. The reason why our country endured sacrifices was to maintain peace in the Far East. America and Britain must know where their responsibilities lie and should not stand by and watch the situation in China. Otherwise, it is morally inexcusable. Therefore, our country should immediately ask America and Britain to participate in jointly seeking fair and reasonable resolutions to all problems between China and the Soviet Union.

### Zhang Junmai's Talk That The Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty Is Accepted Is Is Also Sincerely Wished To Be Fully Fulfilled

[Reported] The Democratic Socialist Party held a special central committee meeting at its headquarters on Yuyuan Road yesterday afternoon from 3 PM, attended by ten committee members, chaired by Chairman Zhang Junmai, which adjourned at around 6 PM. The content of the discussion is unclear. After the meeting, Zhang Junmai entertained reporters. Asked for his thoughts on Vice Chairman Sun's recent remarks, Zhang said: "I was also one of those in favor when the Sino-Soviet Treaty was signed. Today, I hope this agreement can be faithfully fulfilled. Regarding Sino-Soviet questions, I hope that the government follows diplomatic channels and resolves them through open and honest negotiations with the Soviet Union." Regarding the American loan, Zhang believes that the 500 million US dollars will likely succeed and are currently being negotiated. "As long as our country improves its politics, increases production, and eliminates corruption, American aid to China will not be a problem." He also said: "The government has accepted the Political Consultative Council's peace proposal, and practical methods are being studied. At this time, there will be no order to suppress the Chinese Communists. If the government orders suppression, the Democratic Socialist Party will express a clear stance." Zhang also stated: He hopes that internal Can can be stopped as soon as possible. At present, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration requires both sides on the Yellow River to cease fire in order to build embankments, which concerns millions of lives and should be accepted. Asked whether he accepted the recent demands of overseas party members, Zhang said: "The Organization Committee convened last month was completely legal. The absence of overseas representatives has nothing to do with the quorum of the meeting. Therefore, the suggestion to reopen the Organization Committee cannot be accepted."

[Another News Report] Key members of the Democratic League have returned to Shanghai from Nanjing one after another and are scheduled to convene a central committee meeting at 9 AM today to study the current situation. According to a spokesman, it has not yet been decided whether to formally issue a statement after the meeting.

### Outer Mongolia Issued a Reply in an Attempt to Conceal its Border Violation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Relevant sources have learned that the Outer Mongolian government, through its minister to Moscow, submitted a reply to our government's previous protest to Ambassador Fu Bingchang on the 22nd of this month. The content of the reply was telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by our embassy in the Soviet Union on the 24th. It is understood that the main points of its content are that the Outer Mongolian government believes that the Beitashan incident was caused by a border dispute and that the Outer Mongolian government believes that Beitashan is "within Outer Mongolian territory" and that Chinese troops had "invaded" the Outer Mongolian border, thus causing the conflict. Observers here believe that Outer Mongolia's statement, which distorts the facts and makes strong words to conceal its border violations, will make it more difficult to resolve the Beitashan incident. Furthermore, after the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia's replies to our protest were delivered to Nanjing one after another, the Foreign Affairs Authority is carefully studying and considering the situation.

[Another Telegram] Regarding the Shanghai Journalists Association's resolution to request the two departments of Internal Affairs and Social Affairs to increase the number of representatives to be elected by journalism groups as much as possible within the total number of National Assembly representatives from vocational groups, this reporter visited a person in charge of the Department of Social Affairs.

### Ambassador Koo and Secretary Marshall Confer on China's Economic Situation, $500 Million Loan Awaiting Final Decision

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi-kyuin, met with Secretary of State Marshall for an hour on the afternoon of the 25th. According to Koo, the topic of the meeting was "various aspects of China's economic situation." Koo told reporters after the meeting that he and Secretary Marshall had reviewed various possibilities for future U.S. aid to China, but Koo did not mention the $500 million loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which will expire on June 30th. Koo also stated that China needs two types of loans: one is a long-term loan to promote China's economic recovery and construction, and the other is a short-term loan to stabilize China's current economic situation.范宣德, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Department of the U.S. State Department, was also present at today's meeting.

[Another dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall stated today that the State Department is currently paying close attention to the entire situation in China on a daily basis, but he expressed doubt as to whether any action would be taken to extend the deadline (which expires on June 30th) for the $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank earmarked for China. (Note that this earmarked loan must be used before the deadline). Secretary Marshall made these remarks in response to a reporter's question at a routine press conference this morning. The reporter reminded Secretary Marshall that the loan designated but not used for China would expire next Monday, so would any action be taken? Secretary Marshall then made the above simple comments, but did not provide details or reveal what details he was discussing with his advisors on a daily basis. He stated that any new action to extend the deadline for the loan to China must be handled by the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems, but after checking with the Treasury Department, it was learned that the issue of extending the deadline for the loan to China had not yet been submitted to the Advisory Council for consideration. Based on the general perception here, the loan to China will be allowed to expire under the U.S. government's stipulated deadline. That is, if China needs U.S. financial assistance, it must restart negotiations for a new loan. The U.S. National Advisory Council is the highest expert organization and has the final say on foreign loans allocated by the government. The Chairman of the Advisory Council is Secretary of the Treasury Snyder, with Secretary Marshall representing the State Department, Harriman representing the Department of Commerce, Martin representing the Export-Import Bank, and Ecoles representing the Federal Reserve. Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi-kyuin, held consultations with Secretary Marshall at 3:00 p.m. on the 25th. The Export-Import Bank's allocated loans are based on individual projects and may provide other credit loans to various government agencies and private enterprises in China.

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Secretary of the Treasury Snyder stated at a press conference here on the 25th that the reservation period for the $500 million loan designated by the Export-Import Bank for China will expire on June 30th, and there is no consideration to extend it or lend it to China before the expiration. Note that Snyder is the chairman of the National Advisory Council, which determines the U.S. government's foreign lending policy, and its decisions must be finalized by the President.

### Important Resolutions of the National Economic Council: Economic Reform Plan to be Submitted for Review First; Valuation of State-Owned Enterprises Limited to Completion Next Month

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The National Economic Council held its fifth meeting on the afternoon of the 26th, spending most of the time discussing the economic reform plan proposed by Premier Zhang. After Premier Zhang reported on the process of proposing the plan, Chen Lifu explained the main points, especially emphasizing that although it is an extraordinary period, we cannot fail to fundamentally plan for it because it is an extraordinary period. This plan is not a stopgap measure, but a fundamental plan. Under the current circumstances, if we do not do so, I am afraid it will be difficult to achieve anything. Chen pointed out that in the past, there was a bad trend in the financial world, namely, "not caring about agriculture, neglecting industry, and helping commerce," which led to the failure of the three to develop smoothly. This bad trend should be corrected so that industry and agriculture can flourish through financial regulation. After the report, the committee members spoke one after another, some in favor, some skeptical, and some advocating for modifications. It was generally acknowledged that the principles of this plan are very good, but where to start implementing it needs to be considered. It is also questionable whether it will be effective after implementation when the currency system is unstable. Some committee members believed that it is advisable to advance both fundamental and stopgap measures simultaneously during the current transitional period. In the end, it was decided that Chen Lifu and Xu Kan would be the conveners to hold a full review meeting within days to conduct further in-depth research on this plan. It is expected that at least three or four meetings will be held before submitting it to the general assembly or group deliberations.

In today's meeting, in addition to discussing the above issues, the valuation standards for state-owned enterprises were also decided. The main points are: in the future, valuation will be based on current prices, referring to the following four points as standards: (1) raw material supply, (2) location of the unit, (3) business development, (4) market demand, and it was decided to "speed up valuation and complete it within July."

The meeting also discussed the free buying and selling of gold. The National Goldsmiths Association's proposal to amend the management measures for the goldsmiths industry in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, which was submitted by the Executive Yuan for discussion, was unanimously considered to be (1) unnecessary under the current circumstances, (2) that the goldsmiths industry should primarily engage in the gold business as its name suggests, and (3) therefore, the number of unemployed people is not as high as rumored. It was resolved that the original measures would not be changed.

Regarding the simplification of tax collection, Xu Baiyuan made a report, and Premier Zhang believed that it could be handled temporarily if it did not affect tax revenue.

Today's meeting was chaired by Premier Zhang, with committee members Sun Longji, Li Jingzhai, Huang Yuanbin, Wang Xiaolai, Lou Tongsun, Pan Xulun, Xue Dubi, Zuo Shunsheng, Weng Wenhao, Jian Guansan, Wu Yunjie, Liu Jianqun, Xu Kan, Wang Yunwu, Liu Zhendong, Chen Lifu, Deng Feihuang, Chen Fang, Xiao Zheng, and Gu Zhenggang attending. The meeting started at 3:00 p.m. and ended at 7:30 p.m. The next meeting is scheduled for July 3rd.

### Legislative Yuan's Legal and Economic Committees Review Postal and Telecommunications Price Increase Proposal; Ministry of Communications Hopes for a Fivefold Increase in Postage

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The issue of postal and telecommunications price increases was given a preliminary review by the Legislative Yuan's Legal and Economic Committees on the 26th. Representatives from the Ministry of Communications, Tao Fengshan, Xue Pinwen, and Qian Qichen, attended to explain, hoping for a 500% increase in postage and 1,000 yuan per word for telegrams. During the discussion, some committee members believed that this matter was far from being an economic emergency measure plan. Some committee members had many complaints about telephones. Finally, Sun Jiulu proposed that this postal and telecommunications price increase is based on the "Revised Measures for Subsidizing State-Operated and State-Run Enterprises," and this case is part of the overall fiscal policy, involving increasing the people's burden and affecting price increases. It is proposed to invite Premier Zhang and Minister Yu Dawei to the Legislative Yuan to explain the process of changing the entire policy and the implementation of the budget in the past six months. Sun's proposal has been approved by the review committee. It is rumored that the postal and telecommunications price increase case may be difficult to present at the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the 27th.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Speaks on the Issue of Opening Trade with Japan, China's Various Trade Regulations Still Apply

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Since the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan announced that it plans to open private trade with Japan in the short term, people in the country have been very concerned. A spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently made a statement on this matter, saying that the rumor that this matter may be realized in July is probably just speculation from various parties. The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers has stipulated that relevant countries must be notified some time in advance before opening private trade with Japan. At least until now, our country has not received such a notification. Therefore, the statement in a few newspapers that 36 merchants have been designated to specialize in trade with Japan and that registration has already been carried out is not true. As for whether there will still be some restrictions on import and export merchants after the opening of trade, according to what the Ministry knows, it may not be absolutely free. China's current effective import and export trade regulations seem to still apply as usual.

### The Zhen'an County Massacre in Shaanxi: Chang'an District Court Holds Public Trial

[This Newspaper, Xi'an, 25th] The shocking massacre in Zhen'an County, southern Shaanxi, where the County Council Speaker was shot and killed by the County Magistrate leading the county government's armed forces, was publicly tried for the first time in the Chang'an District Court yesterday at 8:00 AM. Despite the expansion of the gallery, it was still overcrowded. The judge and the main figure in the massacre, Sun Junbo, the former County Magistrate, were both sweating profusely. The investigation hearing was held all day yesterday. All fifteen lawyers attended, and Sun and the accused, as well as witnesses, were examined one after another. There were loopholes in the testimonies of all parties, and the trial will continue in the next few days. The charges brought by the prosecutor include: First, Sun's crime of forcing female teacher Wang Huimin to cohabitate, violating public morals and freedom. Wang died of poisoning in April, but her father accused Sun of poisoning her, a point the prosecutor has not yet acknowledged. Second, the crime of shooting and killing four people. Because the County Council repeatedly reported Sun's corruption and illegal activities, and the Wang case was exposed, Sun suspected that the Council was instigating it. Therefore, on May 2nd, he falsely reported that communists had infiltrated, declared martial law, and then led a team to shoot and kill Council Speaker Li Weihan and three other staff members at Li's residence. He then deployed police to pursue and kill a witness outside the city. Third, the crime of detaining a telegraph office employee for more than ten days for sending a telegram to Li's residence, obstructing freedom. The prosecutor believes that the first two charges involve abuse of power and strongly advocates for a heavier sentence. However, some speculate that Sun has favorable evidence, coupled with other reasons, so he may not be sentenced to death. The councils of more than ten counties in Shaanxi have sent telegrams urging strict punishment, and the Shaanxi Inspector has also reported the case.

Editorial

### Decisions the United States Must Make

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury published an editorial on the 21st titled "Who Abandoned Whom?" The gist of the entire article is: "China has not been abandoned by the United States, but China has failed to obtain American aid through sound business principles, and instead abandoned the United States. Taking the US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan as an example, the bank has been holding the funds for months, and the reason is that, from all perspectives, it can be seen that China would rather obtain a 'political loan' without the borrower controlling the use of the funds, than to carefully calculate what the country truly needs and formulate a sound and beneficial plan." This editorial can be seen as a suggestion from others that could help one improve themselves: the Chinese government authorities may also use it to reflect on their own actions. However, the newspaper also said: "If they acknowledge that foreign aid cannot be blindly given in the future, if they believe that the Chinese people cannot produce good results from foreign political loans and feel hopeless, then there is still hope; but if they act like crying babies and beggars, the result will only be failure and will be despised by those of their own countrymen who do not want to act in this way." This passage not only sees China's request for assistance from the United States as purely driven by selfish motives but also misunderstands the current political situation in China. Therefore, this newspaper's editorial on the 22nd, "The United States Should Make Wise Decisions Sooner Rather Than Later," in addition to pointing out that the development of the Far Eastern situation to this degree has forced the United States to make a wise choice between fully assisting or completely abandoning China in its future China policy; at the same time, it also corrected the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury's incorrect views on Chinese politics. Unexpectedly, the newspaper published another editorial on the 25th titled "Must the United States Assist or Withdraw?" There are many misunderstandings and distortions of this newspaper's editorial, so we cannot remain silent and must reiterate our explanation:

First, our request that the United States government make a wise decision regarding the Far East is not out of a threatening attitude. We are not telling the United States: If you do not fully assist China, then we want the United States to withdraw completely. The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury misunderstood this point from the start, perhaps due to an error by the translator. Therefore, the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury asked: Does China, because of its emphasis on commerce over righteousness, have a movement demanding that the United States withdraw from China? We believe that this question is unnecessary, at least for the moment, there is not the slightest anti-American sentiment in the minds of the Chinese people; the relations between China and the United States have always been very friendly and close; before the War of Resistance, China was oppressed and invaded by imperialism and fell into a semi-colonial status. Only the United States had no political or territorial ambitions towards China, not only sympathizing with China but also treating us on an equal footing everywhere. The balance of power of the great powers in China also relied entirely on the United States' firm implementation of its so-called "Open Door," "China's Territorial and Sovereign Integrity" policies. When the War of Resistance broke out, the United States was the first to condemn Japan's aggression and brutality and insisted on its "Non-Recognition Doctrine." Later, the Pacific War broke out, and China and the United States became allies with common destiny. After this baptism of blood, the two countries became friends in need, and the relationship between the two countries naturally became closer. Therefore, after the end of the war, China encountered great obstacles due to the Communist Party's problems in receiving, repatriating, and sending back enemy prisoners. The United States still upheld its friendly spirit, assisting China in repatriation and sending back Japanese prisoners. At the same time, General Marshall, for the peaceful unification of China, did not hesitate to travel to China to serve as a mediator. Within a year, he traveled for peace, without rest, and climbed Mount Lu eight times in the scorching summer. Although he failed to turn conflict into amity, General Marshall's hard work was deeply imprinted in the hearts of every Chinese person and can never be forgotten. Although the Communist Party has repeatedly attempted to incite the people against the United States, the result has always been failure, which shows that the bond of friendship between the people of China and the United States cannot be destroyed by any force. This newspaper's editorial has also consistently promoted Sino-US cooperation to promote the political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries. Second, the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury has always believed that the United States is unwilling to grant loans to China due to China's internal maladministration. The newspaper once stated: "Some believe that the United States has adopted the Truman Doctrine for European countries and a 'cold' attitude towards continuing to assist China. This view is nothing short of insulting to the United States. In fact, the United States is deeply concerned about China, but not limited to communism. Moreover, it is even more concerned that the government recognized by the United States not only cannot effectively oppose communism but also sometimes inevitably adopts the Communist Party's centralization and exclusion policies. China should consider the second chapter of the Truman Doctrine, which is Secretary of State Marshall's European Economic Recovery Plan. This step is also what Americans want to implement in China. The US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan has been debated a lot. What significance can be said to exist? But as of now, China has not been able to obtain this loan." The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury has a long history of publication in Shanghai, and its hosts have also been in China for many years and are known as "China problem experts" in the United States. The editorials they publish daily on Sino-US relations have always been valued by the Chinese government and public. However, after reading them, we cannot help but feel that "foreigners have different views." The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury should face reality squarely regarding China's current political situation, especially understand the environment in which the Chinese government is in, and cannot ignore the feelings and wishes of the majority of our people. There is no absolute standard for the merits of politics. In any case, we resolutely do not admit that China's current politics is inferior to that of Greece and other countries. The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury's misjudgment of Chinese politics makes us unable to avoid regret.

Third, in terms of Sino-US relations, after the war, the relationship between China and the United States has become increasingly close, and the cultural exchanges between the two countries have become smoother. In theory, there should be no more gaps and misunderstandings between China and the United States, especially for American newspapers that have been in Shanghai for many years. We have repeatedly pointed out in editorials that China's request for assistance from the United States is by no means out of selfish motives, but China's need for American assistance is formed by the objective conditions of the global situation. Secretary of State Marshall announced yesterday that the deadline for the $500 million loan will expire at the end of this month and will not be extended. China is determined not to accept "charity" from the United States and will have other "ways to regenerate itself." However, the consequences of the United States not assisting China are worth the attention and consideration of the American government and public. Although we will not demand or force the United States to withdraw completely, the end result of the United States' implementation of its current policies, regardless of whether it is willing or not, will eventually be that it has to withdraw completely one day. As Vice Chairman Sun said: "The United States' cold response is equivalent to abandoning China." Therefore, we believe that if there are far-sighted politicians in the United States who do not haggle over the petty calculations of merchants, they will be able to make new decisions regarding the Far Eastern situation, which is on the verge of crisis. American journalists who are in the Far East and personally witness the increasingly serious situation in the Far East should adopt a detached attitude, be impartial, report the real situation and the feelings of the local people to the American people, and make timely appeals to arouse the attention of the American people. This is the only way to fulfill the responsibilities of a journalist!

### Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to Confer on Marshall Plan; Foreign Ministers' Conference Opens Today; Bevin and Molotov Arrive in Paris; Snyder Says Dollar Economic Aid to Europe a Definite Obligation

[United Press, Paris, 26th] British Foreign Minister Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived here today one after another from their respective countries and will confer with French Foreign Minister Bidault tomorrow on US Secretary of State Marshall's plan to aid European recovery. Accompanying Mr. Bevin was Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov. British and French figures alike believe that the Soviet Union's agreement to discuss the Marshall Plan is an encouraging sign, but the harsh criticism in yesterday's Pravda in Moscow has slightly discouraged those who were optimistic in the past. Poland's expression of concern about the Marshall Plan is also quite important, as Polish coal is a major factor in any European recovery plan. At the same time, on the eve of the tripartite foreign ministers' conference, the United States further assured Europe that it would back the Marshall Plan.

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Treasury Secretary and Chairman of the National Advisory Council Snyder stated at a press conference today that the Marshall Plan does not place a definite obligation on the United States to provide financial assistance to Europe or any other part of the world. Answering a reporter's question, Mr. Snyder said: The National Advisory Council (the President's advisory body that decides on plans for foreign loans) has not drafted and does not plan to implement Marshall's aid plan. When asked if Marshall wanted to invite European countries to apply for this assistance when necessary, he replied, "That is not the intention." Snyder's words have caused general surprise. Secretary Marshall's speech at Harvard University did not mention dollar aid, only stating that the US's mission was to "help draft a European plan in a friendly manner, and then see what is actually needed and submit this plan." If a strict interpretation is given to Marshall's words, Snyder's words are reasonable. However, based on the subsequent remarks of other State Department officials, such as State Department Legal Counsel Cohen's statement that the US may have to approve loans of 30 billion yuan in the next four years, both American and European figures believe that Marshall's original proposal was a definite obligation, albeit with conditions attached. Mr. Snyder further stated at today's press conference: "My interpretation of Marshall's plan is that Marshall is inviting European countries to engage in self-reliance and observe what they can do for themselves." The reporter then asked Snyder: "Then does Your Excellency believe that in Marshall's words, the United States did not suggest engaging in any assistance?" Mr. Snyder replied: "We have no other evidence to prove that this suggestion was made other than what we already know."

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Treasury Secretary Snyder, in order to clarify his remarks made at the morning press conference, met with reporters again in the afternoon and explained: My view of the Marshall Plan is that it does not invite other countries to seek American economic assistance. This statement does not mean that I disagree with Marshall's suggestion to revive Europe. What Secretary of State Marshall said at Harvard University was that the United States could help Europe to get on the road to recovery, but first, European countries need to coordinate their basic needs and set a suitable foundation before applying for assistance to the United States. I believe that this means that Europe should first check its inventory and develop itself. What I said at the press conference was to state this explanation, indicating that reviving Europe may require American assistance.

### Three Countries Hold Preliminary Discussions; Other Countries Do Not Participate for the Time Being

[French News Agency, Paris, 25th] Well-informed sources here have recently said that the foreign ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France will begin a meeting on the 27th to discuss the Marshall Aid Plan for Europe. It is not yet possible for representatives of other countries to participate in the meeting. However, after the three foreign ministers' conference has drafted a work plan, it may first consult the opinions of other countries, and then a final decision can be made on the European economic recovery plan.

[French News Agency, Paris, 25th] The Polish Ambassador to France, Traman, visited French Deputy Foreign Minister Mouville today and told him that he would soon be ordered to be responsible for arranging everything for Poland's participation in the tripartite foreign ministers' conference. Poland is very concerned about the Marshall Aid Plan for Europe.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Czech diplomatic sources here said that Haas, the counselor of the Czech Embassy, visited Sampr, the economic assistant of the State Department, today and told him that Czechoslovakia was interested in the Marshall Plan. At that time, Sampr strongly stated: (1) This plan does not reject any country; (2) The first step is that European countries should be responsible for achieving coordination, which is a necessary condition for the success of this plan. However, Hahn did not inform Sampr of Czechoslovakia's intention to join this plan, only expressing that the Czech Republic was interested. Regarding the Polish ambassador's expression of willingness to join, this is probably because Poland has suffered more war damage than the Czech Republic, so it urgently needs assistance.

[French News Agency, Paris, 25th] Well-informed sources here have recently said that if Italy can approve the treaty with Italy as soon as possible, France is willing to support Italy's participation in future negotiations on the Marshall Aid Plan for Europe.

[French News Agency, Frankfurt, Germany, 25th] The mayor of Frankfurt, Scharde, hosted a banquet today for the members of the newly established German Economic Council in the British and American occupation zones. During the banquet, Mayor Scharde said: Germany hopes to participate in the discussions on the Marshall Aid Plan for Europe, and hopes that the establishment of the German Economic Council will be the first step towards German unification. Without foreign assistance, it would be difficult to realize Germany's economic recovery.

### Pravda Comments on the Marshall Plan

[United Press, London, 25th] A Moscow broadcast of an article carried in "Pravda" stated that if the Marshall Plan is a anti-communist lasso, it will inevitably be rejected by all "self-respecting" countries in Europe, but Britain is now symbolizing its readiness to proceed even without the participation of the Soviet Union. If the Marshall Plan is based on the principle of American aid to the Greek and Turkish plan, it is destined to fail. The general nature of the Marshall Plan is unknown, so the Soviet Union cannot judge whether it is intended to solve European problems or to arrange an ideological war between capitalism and communism. The main task of the Paris Conference is to determine the degree of Soviet cooperation. If the Marshall Plan is still the same as the aid to the Greek and Turkish plan and is anti-communist in nature, then this assistance is an interference in the internal affairs and sovereignty of European countries, so all European countries with self-respect should reject it.

### French Reaction to Snyder's Remarks

[United Press, Paris, 25th] According to a Washington dispatch, US Treasury Secretary Snyder said during a press conference that the Marshall Plan does not mean that the United States will give more assistance to Europe. The diplomatic community here is very puzzled and incredulous about this. The diplomatic community here believes that Snyder's intention is to appease American public opinion before calculating the cost of the plan. However, according to an official here, "If Snyder's words are true, it may cause the tripartite conference and the entire plan to die before they are implemented."

### US Will Not Send Observers to Attend Paris Conference

### Romanian Government Deprives People of Freedom; US Lodges Serious Protest; Condemns This Act as a Violation of Treaty Obligations

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The US government has, through its political representative in the Romanian capital, Melbourne, lodged a strongly worded note with Romanian Foreign Minister Tatarescu, protesting the deprivation of civil liberties of the Romanian people, and stating that the US government is deeply concerned about these developments. It further pointed out that these developments are sufficient to undermine the fulfillment of the responsibilities stipulated in the Romanian Treaty. The note stated, "I am fully instructed by my government to declare to Your Excellency that the United States government expresses serious concern over the deprivation of civil liberties of the Romanian people, especially regarding the arbitrary arrest of hundreds of opposition party and non-partisan figures without arrest warrants or charges, as well as the indefinite imprisonment of these arrested persons in prisons and concentration camps in harsh conditions." The note then refuted the statement made by the Romanian Minister of Interior last month, claiming that "in a situation of provocative or secret activities, these measures are necessary to maintain internal security," pointing out that it was a deliberate act to suppress or intimidate democratic elements who oppose the current regime in Romania. The note further pointed out that this deprivation of the most basic human rights and freedoms is in violation of Article 3 of the treaty signed by the Romanian government.

[Reuters, London, 25th] Representative Hall, who will soon protest to the Romanian government against the arrest of Romanian opposition figures, said that the nature of the protest is similar to the US protest to Romania.

Mr. Lehmann, leader of the German Communist Party in the British zone, called for an emergency economic plan based on increased production of grain and coal, and demanded land reform to eliminate industrialists who were also war criminals. He also strongly argued that the Allied military government should only have supervisory power over the Economic Committee and not the power of final decision. Among the members of the Economic Committee, the Christian Democratic Party holds 22 seats, the Social Democratic Party holds 20 seats, the Democratic Party holds 5 seats, the Communist Party holds 3 seats, and others hold 4 seats. The chairmanship is held by Mr. Lai, a representative of the Christian Democratic Party from the North Rhine-Westphalia province.

### Eisenhower Expresses Full Support for Western Hemisphere Defense Plan; Emphasizes the Importance of Pan-American Cooperation

[Central News Agency Washington, 25th Special Dispatch] U.S. Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower warned today that in another world war, the primary target of attack may be the vast North American industrial area around the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River Valley of the United States. Eisenhower made this statement in Congress in support of President Truman's proposal for close military cooperation in the Western Hemisphere, including the unified deployment and training of troops. He stated that unless the United States assists other American countries in developing their military construction, these countries will eventually lean towards other foreign countries. Eisenhower also stated that he does not believe South America will be a battlefield in any future war, as no country in the world can land troops on the coasts of South America by force under the strong defense of the Americas. He recommended that Congress maintain the Western Hemisphere Defense Plan until the United States trusts the United Nations. Navy Secretary Forrestal informed Congress that the Navy Department is prepared to transfer the remaining new-style warships to Latin American countries after the Western Hemisphere Joint Defense Act is enacted, so that the latter can assist in the Western Hemisphere joint defense and protect the Panama Canal in the event of an aggression crisis.

[Reuters Paris, 25th] After the French National Assembly passed the new fiscal plan yesterday, the Senate also passed the plan today with a vote of 140 to 103. During the Senate debate on the plan, Prime Minister Ramadier emphasized that this plan has only one goal, which is to combat inflation. The National Assembly began debating economic policies today. The Radical Party seems to have decided to oppose the expansion of state control over industry and is unwilling to support the government.

U.S. President's Speech

[Agence France-Presse Lake Success, 26th] In a broadcast to the world commemorating the second anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations Charter, President Truman pledged that the United States will do its utmost to ensure the success of the United Nations. He also stated that "the strength of the United Nations organization lies in the recognition by all member states of the fact that, regardless of all disputes, they have a common goal of maintaining international peace and promoting international security. However, the United Nations organization is still in its infancy, and there are many difficulties. Various international issues cannot be easily resolved at once. The effectiveness of the United Nations organization lies in the member states complying with the Charter, not only should they implement the decisions of the organization, but their foreign relations should also be based on the principles of freedom and justice stipulated in the Charter."

British Prime Minister's Speech

British Prime Minister Attlee said in his speech, "The governments and peoples of all countries must work together to make the United Nations organization work. The Charter is not perfect, but if it is applied well, it is the most reliable way to establish lasting peace internationally. The disputes in the Security Council do not need to be given excessive attention. If we can maintain the unity of wartime in peacetime, then everything can be solved easily."

French Prime Minister's Speech

[United Press Lake Success, 26th] French Prime Minister Ramadier said in his broadcast speech that the Charter Day is "the national day of the world." He stated that although Europe and Asia are still deeply scarred after a huge war, and although various difficulties have arisen due to the different viewpoints and direct interests between countries, the mission of the United Nations has been increasing daily. The United Nations Charter is the modern church of rights and international justice.

Soviet Representative's Speech

[United Press Lake Success, 26th] Soviet Representative Gromyko said in his speech that one of the most important principles of the United Nations is the principle of great power unanimity in dealing with important issues of maintaining peace.

This principle is related to the fundamental interests of all countries, large and small, and has been fully tested by the Allied countries in resisting the common enemy. We have reason to believe that this principle can also withstand the test of establishing lasting peace conditions after the war. The period of two years is extremely short. At present, we cannot conclude the success or failure of the United Nations. It is best for us to look forward more and not look back. We should pay more attention to the important issues that have not yet been resolved. He hopes that the United Nations will eventually overcome all difficulties and become a truly effective weapon for people all over the world to strive for peace and security.

Marshall's Message

### MacArthur Takes Another Unilateral Action; Japan to Mine on Palau Islands; First Overseas Colonization by Japanese After the War

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that the Japanese government will be responsible for managing the phosphate mines on Angaur Island from July 1st. The island is located 300 miles east of Mindanao Island and was occupied by the U.S. military after a bloody battle in 1944. According to a representative here, the permission for the Japanese to return to Angaur Island was not discussed with other countries and seems to be a unilateral action by MacArthur or the U.S. government. There are already 354 Japanese people on the island, and another 193 people will continue to go there, bringing the total number to exceed all Americans. The island's phosphate mines are mined by the Bamiro Company of San Francisco and supervised by the U.S. Navy. After the Japanese government takes over, it may lease the mines to Japanese private companies.

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] Phosphate production on Angaur Island in the former Japanese-mandated Palau Islands is now entrusted to Japan under the supervision of the Allied Headquarters. This is the first time that Japanese people have gone abroad to colonize after the war. Angaur Island produces 191,000 tons of phosphate annually, which is a major source of fertilizer for Japan.

### Japanese Scholar's Wild Delusions; Actually Claims That China Expects Japan to Lead

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 26th] Dr. Komiya Yoshihiko, a former member of the Shanghai Scientific Research Association, recently wrote an article in the current issue of "New China" magazine, advocating that the United States will assist Japan's economic recovery, and Japan will assist China's economic recovery. It is said that Japan's aid to China is based on three reasons: (1) Japan is more advanced than China in applied science. (2) China has historically sent students to Japan, sometimes up to 30,000 people, most of whom study law, politics, economics, and practical sciences such as medicine. Chinese students go to Japan because they cannot afford to go to Europe, and they believe that Japan is the base of Western science and culture in the Far East. (3) Japan has not only invested huge amounts of capital in China, building railways, factories, mines, and shipping companies, but has also sent a large number of experts to carry out these projects. The most important investment is

China has fully recognized the major role of Japanese science in the development and progress of Chinese culture. Japan's defeat in the Pacific War has not stopped the Chinese from expecting Japan's leadership. In the future, when China rebuilds its economy and finds that it urgently needs technical assistance, it will inevitably call on Japanese experts to assist.

### McNutt Warns the United States Not to Hastily Rebuild Japan; Merchant Decides to Allow Japanese Antarctic Whaling

[Central News Agency New York, 25th] Former U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt recently warned: "Do not rebuild Japan before other Eastern countries that fought side by side with the United States have restored their independence." He said in a speech to the Chicago Midwest Branch of the Far East and American Industrial and Commercial Association: "No matter how much we promote the implementation of democracy by the Japanese, if we do not solve the problems of the entire Eastern countries, we will recreate a military aggressive machine that conflicts with our interests." He reiterated his warning: "If we leave Japan when its economic power is very strong, making it the center of the economically weak nations of the Far East, then we must prepare for World War III as soon as possible."

[United Press Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall told the press today that the United States will still allow Japanese whaling ships to go to the Antarctic Ocean, despite the opposition of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway. Marshall said that one of the reasons for the opposition of the four countries is that Japan disregards international whaling rules, but the Japanese whaling team for the 1947-48 season will be ordered to strictly abide by all rules. Britain protested and said that the Japanese whaling team could become the core of the country's rebuilding navy. Marshall pointed out that the ships driven by the Japanese carried Japanese soldiers back to their country all over the world, and they stopped in many ports of the United Nations along the way, and no incidents occurred. The second Japanese whaling can directly save the United States more than 13 million U.S. dollars in occupation fees, and the proceeds from the sale of whale oil can subsidize approximately 6 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange. Marshall expressed his approval for the statement issued by MacArthur's headquarters approving the second Japanese whaling.

### Former Disturbance at the Social Affairs Bureau; Two Groups of Workers in Vicious Fight; Petition of Hand-Operated Group Workers in the Knitting Industry in the Second District Has Twists and Turns; Many Injured and Eleven Arrested

[Our Report] More than 10,000 male and female workers in the hand-operated knitting machine group in the city's 1st, 2nd, and 3rd districts previously had disputes over index issues and had disputes with the employers. Workers in the 1st and 3rd districts reached an agreement with the employers, but the 2nd district has not yet resolved the issue, and the workers have been on strike for many days. Yesterday, workers in the 2nd district learned that Zheng Fangxiong, chairman of the district union, had suddenly disappeared the night before. They formed a team to petition the General Labor Union, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Government. Along the way, they clashed with Wang Sibin, chairman of the 1st District Labor Union, and director Pan Lindi, and both sides were injured.

Last year, due to the shallow business of the knitting industry, the labor and management parties agreed that the wages for the current month would be issued at 85% of the index for the previous month. Later, the index was unfrozen from May. The labor and management parties in the 1st and 3rd districts agreed to issue May's wages in accordance with the agreement, based on the frozen index of 794, plus 5 times, plus a difference of 117,000 yuan and one dou of rice. Workers in the 2nd district demanded that the wages be issued in accordance with the approval of the Social Affairs Bureau, based on the assumed index of 14,800 times 85% in April. The employers in the 2nd district stated that they could not accept this and applied for arbitration. May's wages were delayed, and the workers went on strike. The workers in the 1st and 3rd districts had already reached an agreement and continued to work as usual, which caused discord among the three unions.

At 11:00 am yesterday, the Second District Labor Union gathered more than 1,000 people to petition the General Labor Union, distributing a declaration stating that the chairman of the association, Jia Fangxiong, was resented by the employers. At 9:00 pm on the 25th, Feng Hua, who claimed to be a reporter for the Southeast Daily, and Xu Yongjie, a reporter for the China News Agency, invited him to room 419 of the Xiangsheng Hotel. He disappeared after going there. Later, it was found that there was no such room number in the Xiangsheng Hotel, and the Southeast Daily and other newspapers did not have these two reporters. It was obvious that they were impersonating people to deceive and secretly arrest him, so they demanded that the authorities thoroughly investigate. When they arrived at the General Labor Union, the person in charge happened to be absent, so they turned to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. On the way through the Changrong Hosiery Factory, they met Pan Lindi, director of the First District Labor Union. The two sides had a verbal conflict, and then started fighting. Pan was injured in his hands, chest, and other places. Later, they met Wang Sibin, chairman of the First District Labor Union, on Zhonghua Road, and another conflict broke out. Wang usually carries a handgun. When the two sides argued, Wang accused the petitioners of robbing his handgun, while the workers accused Wang of threatening them with a gun. Wang was eventually outnumbered and held hostage by the petitioning crowd and went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition together. More than 20 of Wang's friends rushed to rescue him, and the two sides fought again in front of the Social Affairs Bureau. On the First District side, Wang Sibin, Pan Lindi, and others were injured. According to the Second District Labor Union, seven people were stabbed with knives and were seriously injured, and several others were slightly injured. The Songshan Police Station heard the news and sent police to the scene to suppress the fighting, and at the same time sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. At that time, the person in charge of the Labor Section of the Social Affairs Bureau was absent and promised to reply the next day. The workers then turned to the Municipal Government to petition. Mayor Wu was out on business and was received by Secretary-General Shen, who instructed him to send a representative to meet with the mayor this morning.

Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, expressed suspicion about Zheng Fangxiong's disappearance. He also said that he would report to Mayor Wu about the Second District's holding of workers in the First District for a strike and leading the beatings, and that he would severely punish those who caused the incident.

[Additional News] Those detained at the Songshan Police Station at that time included Wang Sibin, Hu Yuanle, Tao Wenlong, Xu Xiting, Xu Hongsheng, Zhang Huiming, Shen Guorong, Wang Xinbao, Xue Ruhua, Liu Xiulan, and Chen Futai, a total of eleven people.

### This Month's Rice Allocation for Impoverished Households Determined at 60,400 "Shi" (石, a unit of dry measure) – Exact Amounts for Each District to be Announced Today

[Our Report] The Civil Food Allocation Committee held its second meeting yesterday morning at the Bar Association's premises, presided over by Chairman Wu Kai-sien. Several important cases were discussed and resolved: (1) Rice Allocation for Impoverished Households: The Social Affairs Bureau had previously instructed district public offices to investigate and report the exact number of impoverished households and submit a register. As of the 25th, only the Huangpu district had submitted theirs. In order to expedite the process, it was decided that this month's rice allocation for impoverished households would be 60,400 "shi," with the principle of one "dou" (斗, another unit of dry measure, smaller than "shi") for a large family and five "sheng" (升, smaller than "dou") for a small family. It is estimated that one-seventh of the city's population will benefit from this allocation. The Allocation Committee has already drafted the figures for rice to be distributed to each district, which will be based on the population ratio of each district, with adjustments made according to the level of poverty in the area. After receiving notification of the allocated amounts from the Allocation Committee, each district should exclude impoverished households who have already received rice from factories, schools, or public educators during the investigation. The detailed figures for the rice allocated to each district will be announced today after Chairman Wu approves them. This rice will be sold by the district public offices through designated public sales points in the future.

Professional Workers – 120,000 "Shi"

(2) Rice allocation for professional workers will begin in July. It is estimated that there are approximately 600,000 workers in the city, requiring 120,000 "shi" of rice. The distribution method will be divided into two types: (A) Professional workers without fixed employers, such as dockworkers, rickshaw pullers, and carpenters, can apply to the Allocation Committee through their respective trade unions without having to create a register. The Allocation Committee will issue rice purchase certificates based on the existing union registers from the Social Affairs Bureau. (B) Professional workers with fixed employers, such as those who provide their own meals, can have their respective industry associations apply to the Allocation Committee on their behalf. Those whose meals are provided by the employer will not be eligible for allocation. (3) Approximately five or six thousand small handicraft factories throughout the city will also be included as eligible recipients. Workers belonging to factories with the "factory" designation on their "Guan Shang" (管商, 'managed business') business registration certificates or temporary receipts of business registration applications issued by the Social Affairs Bureau can apply through the industrial unions they belong to. After the unions verify the applications, they will be responsible for creating a register to be submitted to the Allocation Committee for review and rice allocation. If there is no union organization, the factory owner can apply for allocation.

Deadline for Payment at the End of the Month

According to Secretary Zhang Chude of the committee, the Ministry of Food has allocated a total of 187,000 "shi" of rice to the city for June. Currently, approximately 80,000 "shi" have been approved for rice allocation to factories and schools. After deducting 60,400 "shi" for impoverished households, the remaining 40,000 "shi" will be used to supplement the insufficient allocation for professional workers in July. All applicant units that have been approved to receive payment orders this month will have their applications invalidated if they do not pay and receive the rice before the end of the month. In order to simplify the payment procedures, the Allocation Committee has also arranged for cashiers from the City Bank to be stationed at the committee from the 26th to accept cash in addition to bank drafts. Other City Bank branches will not accept payments.

### Mayor Wu Concerned About Prices – Makes Remarks to Reporters – Determined to Eradicate Black Market for Gold and Currency – Further Investigates Warehouse Cotton Stock – Retail Price of Fresh Meat May Be Agreed Upon Today

[Our Report] Recently, there have been signs of price fluctuations in the city. Mayor Wu is very concerned and met with reporters from various newspapers in the city government conference room at 4:30 PM yesterday to report on specific measures to crack down on the black market for gold and currency, thoroughly investigate warehouse cotton stocks, increase rice allocation as much as possible, and suppress fresh meat prices, as follows:

Since the Economic Investigation Team announced its dissolution recently, transferring its work to the city government, many speculators believe that the city government may relax its investigation and crackdown efforts, so they have been secretly engaging in transactions, causing the black market to rise sharply. In fact, the city government is determined to carry out the crackdown on the black market with all its strength, mobilizing all senior officials from the city government's police bureau and social affairs bureau, and working with the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank to find ways to completely eradicate the black market for gold and currency. Two measures have now been decided: (1) It is hoped that citizens will report as much as possible. The city government will strictly keep the names of informants confidential. (2) The informant's reward will be issued quickly to encourage them.

Strictly Punish Cotton Yarn Speculation and Increase Rice Allocation

The cotton yarn issue is also very important. The city government will maintain close contact with the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee at all times. In order to curb speculation, a second warehouse investigation will be conducted. If there is collusion with hoarding, severe punishment will be imposed.

Since the establishment of the City's Civil Food Allocation Committee, the amount of rice allocated has increased every month. The amount for next month will be slightly higher than this month, and after August, 300,000 "zu" (租, a unit) of rice can be allocated each month, so there is absolutely no need to panic about the rice supply.

The price of vegetables in the city rose sharply near the Dragon Boat Festival, and now it has fallen back slightly. The city government is paying close attention to this and is striving to control market prices. The wholesale price of pork in the city is 7,000 yuan per "jin" (斤, a unit of weight), while the retail price has reached 11,000 yuan, which is unreasonable. Mayor Wu met with the person in charge of the fresh meat industry and the meat industry association yesterday, ordering the fresh meat industry association to convene a meeting of members today to agree on a retail price and strictly abide by it. In the future, fresh meat should be sold immediately after arriving in Shanghai, and violators will be severely punished.

Reports of an 80% Increase in Prices Are Absolutely Untrue

After Mr. Wu finished his report, reporters asked several questions, which Mr. Wu answered as follows:

(1) The English-language North China Daily News reported that the price increase in the city this month has reached 80%. Is this true? Mr. Wu replied: Absolutely not true. Rice and cotton can be taken as examples. (2) After the dissolution of the Economic Investigation Team, will the city government establish another organization to specialize in its duties? Mr. Wu said: There is no need for this. Senior officials such as city government counselors and experts will participate in the work. The allocation of work will be discussed at today's municipal meeting. (5) The Civil Food Allocation Committee's start-up costs were 80 million yuan and its operating expenses were 200 million yuan, but it has only allocated 20,000 "shi" of rice, which does not seem very economical. Are there any plans to improve this? Mr. Wu replied: The Allocation Committee has actually allocated 40,000 "dan" (担, a unit of weight) of rice, and will continue to increase it in the future. Because the committee is newly established, there have been delays in the procedures, and those who receive rice often delay the time of picking up the rice. He has now instructed Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to order the rice merchants to pick up the rice within three days, and those who fail to do so will be automatically forfeited, in order to expedite the process.

### Collection of National Construction Donation – More Reasonable in Large Cities

Xi Yushu Expresses His Opinion

[Our Report] Mr. Xi Yushu recently expressed his opinion on the proposed collection of the National Construction Donation: It is very reasonable to collect the National Construction Donation in large cities, because there are not many properties in small cities whose value reaches the tax threshold. However, it is very difficult to make the collection fair and reasonable. First of all, China has no property registration in the past, and it is difficult to perfect it in a hurry now. Wealth such as gold bars and securities can be hidden to evade taxes, so if only real estate is targeted, it is unfair, and the income from this type of property may not be enough to pay the existing taxes, so it is problematic to make them bear the National Construction Donation again. As for the list of those who should pay the National Construction Donation submitted by the public opinion organs, it is also not easy to implement. Because it is difficult to determine whether a person is wealthy, except in a few special cases.

### Song Park Road Murder Case Solved: Killer on the Run, Concubine Apprehended

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Songsan, who was shot and killed on Song Park Road on May 24th, was reportedly originally named Zhang Si and specialized in drug trafficking in the Subei area during the enemy occupation. A fellow villager, Xu Baoxiang, a former puppet army company commander, once extorted money from him, causing Zhang to harbor resentment. This spring, after Zhang came to Shanghai, he joined forces with Xu Shuwang and Wang Buqing, who were originally bandits, and committed numerous crimes. A month ago, Xu Baozhou came to Shanghai, and Zhang plotted revenge. Because Xu and Wang were both former subordinates of Xu Baoxiang, he pretended to mediate and secretly plotted to kill Zhang Si. On May 24th, as a heavy rain poured down at dusk, the four men rode in two rickshaws, tricking Zhang into going to Song Park Road under the pretext of discussing important matters, where they shot and killed him.

After the Zhabei Police Precinct took on this case, they conducted investigations and learned that one of the murderers, Wang Buqing, lived at No. 12 Yongshengli, Tianbao Road. They went to arrest him, but he had already fled.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Clarifications

(1) Rental Disputes

(1) Long Xingde asks: Before the war, I rented a small attic room from landlord Lu. In January of the 32nd year of the Republic, Lu suddenly transferred the entire house to a Mr. Liu. After this new landlord moved in, he immediately wanted to take back the room for his own use, citing reasons such as too many people coming and going and gatherings for mahjong games. He insisted that I move out, promising to pay removal expenses or help find a new house. However, he refused to accept rent from January of that year. Because I don't understand the law, I did not deposit the rent with the court. Now I hear that Mr. Liu intends to sue in court. In the above circumstances, please advise: (1) Are his stated reasons sufficient? (2) Can I demand continued tenancy rights? (3) Is it legal to not recognize his status as a sub-landlord? (4) How should the unpaid rent issue be resolved?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] (1) Both points raised by Mr. Liu are claims that comply with legal regulations, with the second point being particularly strong. (2) If the judgment results in the house being taken back, continued tenancy is not possible. Otherwise, the tenancy relationship continues to exist. (3) If you don't recognize the sub-landlord's status, what is the status of the third tenant? (4) If the reason for non-payment of rent is due to refusal of acceptance, there should be definite proof.

(2) Foster Daughter-in-Law Refuses Marriage

Li Rongzhang asks: My friend, Ms. So-and-so, is currently 19 years old. At the age of 14, according to her parents' arrangement, she was betrothed to a Mr. Zhang as a foster daughter-in-law. At that time, Mr. Zhang's family paid a bride price of 200 yuan in counterfeit currency. Now Ms. So-and-so is dissatisfied with this marriage contract and ran away a few days ago, seeking refuge at a friend's house. Please advise: (1) Does the system of foster daughter-in-law exist in current law? (2) Are Ms. So-and-so's parents legally responsible for her running away? (3) Can the Zhang family force Ms. So-and-so to return home and marry? Is there a legal basis for this? (4) If Ms. So-and-so leaves the Zhang family on her own, are there any legal consequences? What is the proper course of action? (5) Should the 200 yuan in counterfeit currency received in the past be refunded now? How should it be calculated?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] (1) There is no provision for foster daughter-in-law in the law. (2) Running away on one's own has nothing to do with the parents. (3) Marriage cannot be forced. (4) If it is to prevent infringement, it is not illegal. However, if there are other circumstances, it is another matter. However, at 19 years old, she is still a minor, and the proper course of action is to return to parental custody. (5) The bride price received by the parents should be repaid by the parents.

To Chen Jijun: We have read your letter and deeply sympathize with you. At a time when there are more people than jobs, introducing employment is indeed not easy. You can go to the Shanghai Employment Agency of the Ministry of Social Affairs at No. 856 North Sichuan Road and the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute of the Chinese Vocational Education Society at No. 80 Beilong Road to register. There may be suitable opportunities. If you show us your resume, our column will publish a brief message to help you find a job.

To Wang Qinghua: We have received your letter. Regarding the identification of a biological child, we usually use the genetic principles of blood type (divided into four types OABAl) to infer it, but there are many restrictions, and sometimes we cannot protect a certain result. At present, the identification of a biological child should be applied to the court, and then transferred to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for identification. Ordinary hospitals cannot accept this identification, because this is purely a judicial issue. For the sake of your family's happiness and your couple's love, there is no need to go this way. How can you believe the rumors outside?

Zhang Yi's Speech

President Zhang Yi, as chairman, led the ceremony and delivered a speech, briefly reporting on the university's administrative and financial situation for the year. He stated that the university had been established for 42 years and has always taken service, cooperation, and sacrifice as its motto, contributing to society. During the war of resistance against Japan, it moved to Chongqing, leaving only a preparatory department in Shanghai, which was steadfastly supported by former President Li. In 1942, the government changed it to a national university to encourage well-run private universities and schools.

The relationship between China and the United States has always been close. General education in the United States is under the Education Committee, and university education is based on the Board of Trustees, which can be used as a reference for China. The Chinese government is unable to establish many universities and should encourage private schooling.

The committee believes that in accordance with the new plan of emergency economic measures, hoarding and speculation in yarn and cloth should be banned. Therefore, in terms of yarn and cloth regulation policies, a plan to ban hoarding and speculation is being planned. It will be implemented as soon as it is submitted to and approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

[Another News] After the candidates for the four group committees of the committee were selected, it has been decided that they will hold separate meetings at 10:00 AM today to discuss methods for promoting the work of each group. It is said that the letter from the Yarn Merchants Association requesting the cancellation of controls yesterday will be submitted to the Finished Product Sales and Transportation Group Committee for discussion. After a plan is made, it will be submitted to the entire committee for discussion. In addition, after the group committees meet in the morning, if Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs can arrive in Shanghai today, an emergency committee will be convened tonight at 8:00 PM. Otherwise, a discussion meeting will be held to quickly decide on a method to ban the sharp increase in yarn and cloth prices.

### Yarn Merchants Request Cancellation of Controls

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Jiasheng, Shen Boqin, Xi Shaosun, and other executive directors of the Shanghai Yarn Merchants Association, yesterday brought the association's submission and visited Zou Bingwen, chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee. Zou was busy with official business, so Yuan Zhongda, director of the secretariat of the committee, received them on his behalf. Yuan promised to forward the submission, and Zhou and others then took their leave. It is said that the content of the submission includes four points: (1) Cancel all control measures and restore free sales. (2) Cancel the price limit negotiation system and restore free trading. (3) The cotton yarn sold by China Textile Construction Corporation should be sold at market prices. (4) The Yarn Merchants Association hopes to send representatives to attend future discussions of cases related to yarn and cloth sales by the Textile Adjustment Committee to provide advice and contribute opinions.

### Cotton Yarn Continues to Rise

Yesterday's cotton yarn market, at the beginning of the market, non-industry people's intentions were still strong. The dyeing and weaving factories in this street and the Changjiang gang's demand was not deserted, and the market continued to rise. 42 count blue phoenix yarn soared to between 20 million yuan. Near the close, it was heard that stock prices had fallen back, and those with multiple floating profits sold off, and the price immediately fell back slightly, resulting in 19.5 million yuan, which was still 900,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The remaining 32 count, 20 count, 16 count, and other coarse and fine yarns also uniformly pulled up 300,000 to 400,000 to 1 million yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Trade is Busy

Yesterday's cotton cloth market, the Textile Construction Corporation opened cloth as usual. 12-pound colored ball yanghe fine cloth was still 356,000 yuan (limited to factory applications) and Jinlian Miaowu yuan billie price was 400,000 yuan. The market was quite lively, and the leading fine cloth was very expensive at the close, reaching 440,000 yuan, an increase of 6,500 yuan from the previous day. The remaining five-fortune colored balls yanghe and other grades of fine cloth also rose 7,000 to 8,000 to 10,000 yuan. Shilin cloth, blue cloth, bleached cloth, yuan cloth, twill zhigong, etc., all continued to rise by 10,000 to 230,000 yuan.

### Cotton Market Stable - Transactions Slightly Lower Than Yesterday

Yesterday's spot cotton market, in the morning, because yarn prices rose rapidly and the Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraphic transfer shrunk again, people's hearts were extremely high, and asking prices were chaotic. Buyers, because the market price has been tending to a high point for several days, their appetite was slightly lax, and there were very few transactions. In the afternoon, because the closing price of cotton yarn was slightly weak and the black market exchange rate was heard to have fallen back slightly, people's hearts were relaxed. Sellers no longer raised prices, yarn factories had a slight appetite, and there were mutual entries and exits among peers. However, the market price was still difficult to fall back, and the footing trend was stable. The market situation was the same as the previous day, and prices seemed to be slightly better. The number of transactions was slightly lower than the previous day. The delivery price to factories for each grade was estimated at 2.15 million to 2.2 million yuan for Lingbao, 1.79 million yuan for Hanxi, and the price was estimated at 1.75 million to 1.82 million yuan for Hanxi, 1.77 million yuan for Chongsha, 1.46 million to 1.48 million yuan for Fire Machine, and 1.48 million yuan for South Taicang.

### Sugar Market Trends are Chaotic

Peruvian Sugar Stops Warehouse Receipt Trading

Yesterday, the sugar market trends were chaotic, and it still did not break away from the firm trend. Because there was a "piqiu" (speculative) transaction, the market stopped warehouse receipt entry and exit to avoid fueling the rising trend. Spot goods were about 660,000 to 670,000 yuan, 24 coarse white warehouse receipts were 625,000 yuan, spot goods were 660,000 to 670,000 yuan, and 20 medium sugar white was 575,000 yuan to 567,000 yuan. Four and a half car white was 620,000 yuan to 657,000 yuan. Three and a half car white was 600,000 yuan, Hechi was 490,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan to 510,000 yuan. Local sugar Xinghua was 540,000 yuan at the highest, and 520,000 to 530,000 yuan at the lowest. Xingchi was 420,000 to 430,000 yuan, accounting for 4500 bundles. Shantou green was 380,000 to 390,000 yuan, accounting for dozens of packages. Diaozhou green white was 340,000 to 350,000 yuan per package, and ordinary was 330,000 yuan, accounting for one to two hundred packages. Hainan white was 500,000 yuan for 40 packages.

### Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise - Consolidated Bonds Stable

Yesterday, public bonds were slightly stable, and transactions were still small, only about 1 million. Unified Bing opened at 7900 yuan in the morning, 503 room 604 room rose to 8400 yuan, 360 room 230 room 555 room were sold and then flattened slightly. As a result, compared with the previous closing, A, B, and Ding each rose 200 yuan, Unified Bing rose 400 yuan, and Unified Wu was flat alone.

Yesterday, foreign stocks were severely reduced to about 9 and a half yuan due to the tragic shrinking of Hong Kong-Shanghai electricity. Banks helped with money exchange, and the Westerners who gathered in the Public Concession alone bought a lot of Yisha. Guangbang and securities both had supply. Yisha opened in the morning at a high price of 84,000 yuan, reaching the 100,000 yuan mark, and then slightly returned, hovering at 93,000 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yisha, Huizhong, Yeyinglian each rose by about 10%, Julong, Telephone, Aviation each rose by half a percent, Yeguang rose by 20%, and Paper Yizhou each rose by 20% and zero.

### The Tea Market's Transactions are Still Good Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market, due to the Wu Chang Tea Company importing "Needle Eyebrow" green tea, the transactions were quite good. Other grades like the 35th year "Precious Eyebrow" tea were also being absorbed by the Yongxing and Tongfu foreign firms, thus opening the market. Because the buyers' prices were not loose, the sellers lacked the power to raise prices, so the situation continued to show a state of hesitation. As for the domestic sales tea, the buyers still followed each other continuously, with flower tea and "Flag Grab" being particularly popular. According to industry insiders, the demand for Qimen black tea has recently been relatively sluggish, but those who hold it still plan to stand firm, and the situation can still be supported.

Coal Ash Soars
The coal market continues to see more buyers, and the upward trend continues unabated. In particular, the inventory of high-quality coal ash on the market is very low, so once purchased, the market price rises rapidly. The price of Kaiping No. 1 ash has reached as high as 1.3 million yuan. The price increases for medium-quality coal ash such as Chenxi ash and Pole ash are slower due to the arrival of goods. Although the arrival of white coal blocks and coke is still large, the buying interest is strong due to the cost relationship, and the demand has increased sharply. The transaction price of old screened blocks has risen to 1.65 million yuan, and Pingxiang coke is 1.2 million yuan. The sales of old pit "Xiaozi" were the most sluggish before due to the impact of the American "Na Xiaozi" dispatching goods, but yesterday there were also transactions at around 1.3 million yuan.

Wood Prices Surge
Yesterday, the wood market saw further chaos. Due to the sharp rise in the prices of all goods on the market, the market price of foreign pine rose, and the market price of fir also increased.

The Market is Silent and the Transaction of Human Silk is Not High

The Factory Price is About One Million Higher than Yesterday

Because it was rumored that a lot of artificial silk had arrived in Hong Kong, people's hearts were inevitably soft, so the market was firm at the beginning yesterday, but eventually became tired and fell. The opening price of 120-count "Golden Three Horses" in the morning was 26 million yuan, but it was abandoned because there were few people to ask about it. Ten packages were traded for 5.5 million yuan. The market was even more silent in the afternoon, and those who wanted to sell had to lower the price, which gradually declined, and the final price was sold for 5 million yuan, which was 500,000 yuan lower than the previous day. 75-count "Chicken Gold" semi-gloss still called 34 million yuan, but scattered packages did not reach this price.

The transaction in the factory market was still rare yesterday. Because the price has risen too much in recent days, there are occasional onlookers, and the buyers are preparing to open the customs silver, so most of them cannot be traded. The asking prices of all levels have increased by 1 million to 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. The asking price for CD grades reached 32 million yuan, and there were some transactions in retail. The price for medium grades was 30 million yuan, and the price for high grades was 31.5 million yuan. There were orders for 25-fen dry warp, with an asking price of around 24 million yuan, and the selling price for retail upper body goods was 21.1 million yuan.

Because of the high price of raw materials, silk goods in the silk market rose in unison yesterday. The asking price for Maya quilt surface was 12.6 million yuan, and the opening price for Huaqiang quilt surface was 12.2 million yuan. A transaction of 2 million yuan was made. Dacheng checkered cloth The maximum price was 34,670 yuan, and then it fell slightly, closing at 3,300 yuan, with an additional 200 yuan per day. Due to the increasing cost, the market price of Sheng goods also rose by 230,000 yuan yesterday. The asking price for Luo spinning rose by 500 yuan yesterday, and the price of Huajin crepe remained the same as the previous day due to the softening of raw materials.

Mexico Declares Stop to the Sale of Gold Coins

[United Press Mexico City, 25th] The Mexican representative of the International Monetary Fund announced yesterday at the request of the group that the country has stopped selling gold coins in order to stop gold and currency speculation. At the same time, the Mexican Bank continues to ship gold to the governments of Portugal and Argentina. Last year, the Mexican Bank sold gold coins and obtained huge profits, preventing speculators from smuggling gold out of the country. The bank sold 50-peso gold coins at US$47.57, which is equivalent to US$39.53 per ounce, while the US market price is US$35 per ounce.

[United Press Manila, 25th] The International Monetary Fund notified 43 member states yesterday that the price of gold should not exceed US$35 per ounce. The Philippines is one of the member states, and the fund's notification has a considerable impact on the Philippine gold mining industry. President Roxas has not yet formally announced the policy, but gold mining companies have used special licenses to ship gold bars to London for sale in the international market. Philippine Finance Minister Cuatero believes that newly mined Philippine gold can be sold outside the production area, but the price has not been set.

New Doctors and New Drugs Pay Attention to Summer Hygiene Yu Zhengxing

Spring has quietly slipped away, and the scorching sun shines on the world again. The burning sunlight heralds the arrival of the scorching heat. The sudden change in climate enhances the opportunity for bacteria to flourish, and terrible diseases will strike again.

Shanghai may launch an annual summer hygiene campaign. Inspecting the production of cold foods, banning the sale of plum juice, cold noodles, etc., and advising citizens to get vaccinated. Today, the digestive diseases that are prevalent in summer have not yet been discovered. It is fortunate for the citizens if they can plan to prevent them!

Millions of people have died in the past year, not because of war, nor because of floods and famines, but because of ignorance and negligence. Without hygiene knowledge, without paying attention to hygiene, diseases are rampant, and excess deaths occur. A tragic page of history has been read, but perhaps, the most tragic lesson has yet to be learned. That is the time when death is rampant and corpses are like mountains. Please see, the city is surrounded by garbage, accumulating a lot of feces, and the rivers and ponds are completely stinking. People urinate and defecate everywhere in the streets and alleys, as if it is a common occurrence. I don't know that these are dangerous objects, and they are breeding grounds and distribution centers for pathogens. The climate has also brought flies and mosquitoes. Who says that the threat of disease and death is not approaching day by day.

The inability to collect waste in time is the most unfortunate thing. We travel around the streets and see garbage like mountains and stench. Ordinary people dump garbage from their homes outdoors and pour sewage into ditches, as if they have fulfilled their responsibility of cleaning. There is no garbage can setting, and the original garbage that has been piled up is dug out by children who pick up old things, and they spread what they don't want on the sidewalk. The cleaners who are responsible for cleaning the streets do not have a scheduled time for processing garbage, and they raise dust at any time. This fully shows that the Health Bureau has not provided health training, and has not noticed that this is also a measure that endangers the health of citizens. The garbage collected is piled up in the city's squares without proper disposal, which is extremely dangerous.

The living environment of ordinary poor citizens is originally bad, and they are also close to rivers and ponds, and they dump garbage and sewage at will. Sometimes they also go to wash clothes, wash vegetables, and even wash rice. They do not think that they will pollute the water and affect public health when they brush the toilet. When using this water, they do not think that this will cause themselves to be attacked by germs, and the result is often unfortunate. Not all people in Shanghai have the opportunity to use tap water. The emergency project of tap water in West Shanghai is a clear indication that safe drinking water is still a serious problem in Shanghai. Unfortunately, people who drink tap water do not see the severity of the drinking water problem, and people who drink unclean water do not think about improving it, and the crisis is deepening.

Small food vendors are everywhere, and obstructing traffic is a small matter, and endangering health is a big matter. Especially in summer, this is even more dangerous. Although cooked hot food is less dangerous, it is also unreliable if it is exposed for a long time before eating and contaminated by coughs and sneezes. As for the spiced beef, Nanjing pressed duck, Zhenjiang肴肉, and Wuhu dried tofu and other foods placed on the side of the road, that is even more dangerous. Fruits and raw vegetables are always rinsed with unclean cold water over and over again to make them moist and keep them fresh, which are all dangerous. Plum juice, shaved ice, and jelly are naturally unnecessary to say.

"Beware of illness entering through the mouth" can be used as a warning for summer life. Several common infectious diseases in summer, such as typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery, are all transmitted through the mouth. Therefore, the theme of summer hygiene is to be careful about "drinking" and "eating". But this small matter can be said to be impossible to do in any place in the current Chinese society, which is regrettable!

Hygiene is a means of protecting human health and enabling the full development of human physical and mental health. Therefore, whether it is personal life, family life, or group life, it must be based on hygienic conditions as a principle. From this inference, it can be known that hygiene is actually a matter that anyone must pay attention to at any time and at any place, and it is not limited to a specific time or place. However, due to the different seasons and the different climates, different environments are formed. In a particular season, certain diseases are often easily discovered or prevalent. In temperate countries, the most common epidemic in summer is digestive infectious diseases, and respiratory infectious diseases are more likely to be prevalent in winter. Therefore, we have many hygiene problems that should be paid special attention to in different seasons.

Since summer is the season when digestive infectious diseases are prone to be prevalent, summer hygiene campaigns can also be said to be digestive infectious disease prevention campaigns. In summer hygiene, naturally, how to avoid the transmission of digestive infectious diseases is the center. There are three main types of digestive infectious diseases, namely typhoid fever, dysentery, and cholera. The prevention of these three diseases is not too difficult. In European and American countries with developed public health, it is impossible for medical students to get a case for practice. It can be known that there are really ways to prevent and control it, but it depends on whether it is done or not.

There are two aspects to the development of summer hygiene: one is public health and the other is personal hygiene. Thorough public health can achieve excellent preventive effects. For example, the supply of drinking water is safe and clean, and all citizens may be able to enjoy it. Feces and pollutants are properly treated, and there are no flies. The control of substandard food is effective, and the source of pathogens is blocked. In this way, it is naturally not easy to find gastrointestinal patients. Even if it is found, there is a reasonable disposal, isolation, disinfection, and treatment are effective, and naturally it will not spread widely. However, public health is still in a dormant state, and it is not possible to reach the ideal standard in a short period of time.

Now, I hope that we can pay close attention to personal hygiene. The primary condition is to automatically not harm public health. For example, no longer dumping garbage and sewage indiscriminately, or urinating and defecating everywhere. Secondly, I hope you pay attention to a few points;

(1) Get cholera vaccination or typhoid cholera mixed vaccination as soon as possible, (2) Do not drink unboiled water, (3) Do not eat food sold by street vendors, (3) Do not eat retail fruits, (5) Do not eat raw vegetables, (6) Do not eat food manufactured by shops with poor hygiene facilities, (7) Do not eat fermented or spoiled food, (8) Do not wash vegetables, wash dishes, or wash rice in ponds or rivers, (9) Eat fresh fruits and remove the skin, (10) Food made should be avoided. Mosquitoes pollute, and do not eat any food that mosquitoes can pass through.

Naturally, efforts in public health cannot be slackened either. I hope that the health authorities will do their best to find ways to make public health facilities in the city reasonable as soon as possible. In addition to the efforts to improve personal hygiene, there will definitely be good results in the future. The people who died in the past due to illness are the price of obtaining lessons today. We cannot forget this painful and tragic lesson!

At present, it is the time for the Shanghai government and citizens to jointly take effective actions to prevent the epidemic of summer infectious diseases. The era of holding meetings, making resolutions, shouting slogans, and issuing slogans has passed. We must strive for future success with action, replace empty words with action, and pay close attention to

Shanghai, which is in chaos, Shanghai, which is dirty, and Shanghai, which is prone to plague, will inevitably cause more deaths and injuries when diseases enter the city. The metropolis of more than 5 million people in Shanghai must not allow diseases to run rampant.

Eradicating Infectious Diseases is the Current Urgent Task of Doctors Fan Shouyuan

Since medicine has embarked on the track of science, or it can be said that it has become a department of science, its function has also been expanded invisibly: from the therapeutic effect of individuals, it has gradually tended to the preventive aspect of groups or society.

China has always had the saying of "the best doctor treats the disease before it occurs."

The meaning of this sentence "the best doctor treats the disease before it occurs" is very similar to today's scientific medical "prevention": However, the word "prevention" in current scientific medicine is more inclined to infectious diseases. The reason is that everyone has already understood the origin and whereabouts of this infectious disease, and also knows its fierce danger; but it must be in an unhygienic environment to be able to show its strength and prestige, and to be able to transmit each other to form an epidemic, so it can be prevented and stopped by human power. In other words: if the living environment is in line with hygienic rules, and the prevention work is very thorough and strict, then it is very possible to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases and stop the activity of infectious diseases. Therefore, we can know the importance of "prevention" in modern medicine, especially the importance of it for infectious diseases.

In the past, the only task of doctors was to treat diseases; today's doctors have followed the advancement of the tide and the needs of the times. In addition to treating diseases, they also have a major responsibility, which is to prevent diseases, which is also the so-called prevention work. What is the main target of prevention work? Needless to say, it is this infectious disease that can be transmitted to each other to form an epidemic. Therefore, preventing infectious diseases is the central work of prevention; at the same time, it can also be said to be the central task of today's doctors.

Ordinary diseases, only the patient's own individual or a small number of people suffer, and cannot affect others because of their own pain and suffering; infectious diseases are different: they can transmit the disease they suffer to others, from their own pain to other people. The number of people affected can be transmitted from one person to tens of thousands of people; therefore, the speed of onset and the severity of the damage are not comparable to ordinary diseases.

It is said that the average life expectancy of Chinese people is only 30 years old; there are many reasons, of course, but the growth of infection, I think must be the main reason.

Originally, you could be disease-free, but because of poor "prevention" and lack of attention to hygiene, you got sick; originally, you could not die after getting sick, but because the handling was improper, you ended up dying without rescue. This is a fact that can be seen everywhere in China, and it is the only reason that causes the decline in the average life expectancy and the increase in the mortality rate of the Chinese people.

For example, typhoid fever, an infectious disease, is rare in European and American countries. If one or two infectious patients are found in the hospital, it is very rare. It is not easy for Chinese people who study medicine in Europe and the United States to see typhoid fever in clinical practice; it is not certain that they will see a real typhoid patient after studying medicine for three to five years. In China, however, it can be seen everywhere; in the statistics of patients in hospitals, especially in the field of internal medicine, typhoid patients account for a large number. Other infectious diseases, such as dysentery, cholera, diphtheria, scarlet fever, meningitis, etc., are of course the same example. As for the increase in the mortality rate after getting sick, it is also expected. Because on the one hand, Chinese science is immature and not popular, and on the other hand, old doctors do not understand infectious diseases, and the treatment cannot be reasonable.

How to stop the occurrence of infectious diseases and eradicate the spread of infection, the responsibility undoubtedly falls on the shoulders of each of our doctors.

A Brief Discussion on Typhoid Fever Zhu Jinsheng

As the saying goes: "Illness enters through the mouth." Typhoid fever is a good example of "illness entering through the mouth" among infectious diseases.

Typhoid fever is a type of acute systemic infectious disease. The cause of the disease is a rod-shaped bacterium with flagella, which is very active, and is called typhoid bacteria.

The source of infection is mostly from water, milk, food, or contact with patients contaminated with typhoid bacteria. After the typhoid bacteria enter the mouth, they first reach the stomach. Countless bacteria are destroyed by stomach acid. However, there are also bacteria that have not been destroyed by stomach acid, escape the stomach barrier, and enter the duodenum and small intestine, reaching the lymph nodes not far from the end of the small intestine, and grow and reproduce. Some of the typhoid bacteria pass through the lymphatic glands through the lymphatic vessels and enter the blood, bringing them to the whole body. At this time, it is most reliable to take blood for bacterial culture. After the bacteria enter the blood, the patient's body temperature gradually increases, rose-colored rashes appear on the chest and abdomen, coughs, sometimes nosebleeds, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea or constipation, etc. After two weeks, the blood bacterial culture usually has no bacteria; however, the Widal's Test becomes positive, which is because immune bodies have been produced in the patient's blood after two weeks. Therefore, to diagnose typhoid fever in the first and second weeks, bacterial culture of blood is the most reliable, and after the second week, Widal's reaction is more accurate. Although immune bodies have been produced in the blood at this time, it does not mean that the patient has recovered; on the contrary, the patient's condition continues to develop and there is no sign of decline.

This is because the intestinal mucosa at the end of the small intestine two to four feet away has ulcerative changes. At this time, the patient's danger is the greatest, because intestinal mucosal ulceration can have two complications that can occur. The first type is the so-called intestinal bleeding; this is because blood vessels rupture in the intestinal ulceration area, causing unstoppable bleeding, resulting in blood in the stool. It usually occurs in the third stage of typhoid fever. Its danger depends on the amount of bleeding. The usual treatment method is to use blood transfusion to catch the loss of blood from the patient. However, sometimes blood transfusion is ineffective due to excessive bleeding. A small amount of intestinal bleeding can often stop automatically. The second type is also the most dangerous complication, which is intestinal perforation or intestinal rupture; this is the result of intestinal mucosal ulceration. This causes the intestinal wall to rupture, and the contents of the intestine flow from the rupture into the abdominal cavity, resulting in peritonitis. At this time, most of them are hopeless except for early detection and implementation of surgical operations to sew up the intestinal rupture. However, it is usually not that the discovery is too late and it is impossible to perform surgery, or the patient's resistance is too weak to withstand surgery. Therefore, the mortality rate of this complication is the highest. This disease also occurs in the third stage of typhoid fever.

The above two complications are not determined by the severity of the first two weeks of the patient. In other words: in the first two weeks, the patient's chills and fever may not be too high, and the symptoms may not be too serious, but in the third week, it suddenly becomes serious, and changes in intestinal perforation occur. Therefore, people with typhoid fever must not think that the condition is not very serious in the first two weeks, and ignore the sudden changes in the third week; on the contrary, people with typhoid fever should not despair, thinking that their condition is very serious in the first two weeks, and predicting that there must be complications of intestinal perforation or intestinal bleeding in the third week. People with typhoid fever must wait patiently for the past of the third week. If there are no above-mentioned two complications after the fourth week, it is probably that the difficult time has passed, the condition will gradually decrease, and the cold and heat will gradually decrease until the normal body temperature is reached. In terms of treatment: the general concept is that if you have typhoid fever, food is absolutely not suitable for entering the mouth. The reason is that diet often aggravates the disease (this is the general view of ordinary people). But if we think about it carefully, the patient's chills and fever are very high every day, and the metabolism in the body is accelerated and the decomposition effect is doubled; assuming that the daily energy consumption of ordinary people is 2,000 calories, then the consumption of typhoid patients must be 4,000 calories. If you do not take food, how can you balance the consumption of a large amount of heat energy? Therefore, I think that nutritious liquid food must be supplied to the patient as much as possible. Nutritious liquid food, such as milk, chicken juice, beef juice, fresh orange juice, etc., can be supplied to the patient as much as possible. Because these liquids are all residue-free foods, most of them are quickly absorbed after entering the intestine, and will never affect the typhoid ulceration at the end of the small intestine; on the contrary, the patient's condition can often recover faster due to sufficient nutrition. Even complications such as intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation seem to be less likely to occur. Of course, what I need to state is that when the patient has symptoms such as intestinal perforation and intestinal bleeding, then food should absolutely not be taken. We know that there is no specific medicine for typhoid fever; the new medicines currently invented, such as penicillin and streptomycin, do not have a definite effect. Therefore, nursing and dietary treatment are the most important. Finally, if the patient is well, we need to pay attention to the fact that typhoid bacteria often exist in the patient's stool. Forced-type patients are often "bacteria carriers" of typhoid fever. We must isolate bacteria carriers unless the stool examination proves that there are no typhoid bacteria. This also needs to be paid attention to.

Confusion and Pity Zhao Ji

The Chinese have never paid much attention to numbers. Even the number of the national population, from the beginning of the Republic of China to the present, has not yet been accurately counted, which is really pitiful to say. But there are also many confused things. The number of "doctors" who are responsible for public health can also be said casually, which is ridiculous. And what was said at the Seventh Congress of the Chinese Medical Association is even more "confused and pitiful"! The Chinese population is 400 million (inaccurate remainders, let alone mention them). I think the health authorities should probably know; then the number of doctors in the country (excluding traditional Chinese medicine) has been registered by the Ministry of Health, and naturally there are also numbers that can be counted (it is said to be more than 13,000 people). Why is it said that according to the national population ratio, there is already one doctor (referring to officially registered Western doctors) for every 10,000 people, which is too far off. I don't know if the population of our country has suddenly decreased due to years of internal and external turmoil? Or has the number of Western doctors suddenly increased several times like "Taishang Laojun transforming three Purities with one breath"? He also said: There is one doctor for every 7,000 people in European and American countries, and later corrected it and said: There is one doctor for every 70 people (the above were all heard by the author, but the speech of someone published in "Shanghai Medical News" has been modified this number without authorization). As far as I know, this number is also incorrect. However, for a large country with a population of over 400 million, there are only more than 13,000 official doctors, which is really "pitifully" poor! A few days later, I saw a piece of news in the "Medical News" column at the back of the 16th issue of the "Red Cross Monthly" published on April 30 of this year:

"The medical expert Ai Luosuo of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, after examining China for a year and a half, returned to San Francisco, USA, and said: About three-quarters of the deaths in China can be saved with very little cost; the remedies are nothing more than promoting hygiene, improving nutrition, and increasing the number of doctors. Ai believes that the medical situation in China is extremely terrible; on average, there is only one doctor for every 80,000 people, while in the United States, there is one doctor for every 1,500 people; the difference between the two countries is really too far." Such a statement is even more different when compared with the words in this Congress of the Chinese Medical Association; who is right and who is wrong? It is really like a "two-zhang monk", making people feel even more clueless! But according to what I think, Ai's statement about the ratio of the US population to the number of doctors is probably more correct. However, he still said that there is only one doctor for every 80,000 people in China after examining China for a year and a half, which also shows his negligence and confusion. In fact, this ratio is a number from more than ten years ago (before the war, there were only about 7,000 official Western doctors in the country, which is correct). I am afraid that someone was extremely confused during Ai's inspection in China and mistakenly provided him with the physician registration statistics figures before the war, which harmed Ai and made this joke. Is this the case? I have no way to predict it! In fact, the current number of doctors and the total population average out to be less than 40,000 people, but there is one official doctor (Western medicine); although this is an approximate number, it is not very different. Just imagine that the number of doctors in our country is so small, it is not only "pitiful", but as Ai said, "extremely terrible"! Although there are many methods and ways to "increase the number of doctors", why not one of the methods is to find ways to identify unlicensed doctors, relax the standards, and give them the opportunity to register legally. I hope that our highest authorities for examination and hygiene should plan for this as soon as possible and strive for remedies; take the suffering of the public and the life of the nation as the most important thing, and don't continue to be "confused" any longer!

According to the national population ratio, there is one doctor for every 40,000 people

The Physiological Hygiene of the Five Senses (Part 1) Bai Ding

The five senses are the five organs on the surface of the human body: ears, eyes, nose, tongue and skin. These five organs all have the function of sensing various stimuli from the outside world, so they are also collectively called sensory organs.

Now, let's talk about these five sensory organs one by one in the order listed above: first, say a few words about the physiological concepts of each sensory organ, and then talk about their respective maintenance and hygiene.

First, let's talk about the ear: the ear is the organ of hearing in the human body; all sounds from the outside world are managed by it. How does it manage it? It's a long story. In short: when the sound-producing body vibrates, it first makes the air vibrate, producing a kind of sound wave, and a part of this sound wave in the air is transmitted to the ear, moving the ends of the auditory nerve, causing them to be excited, and the end nerves then report this excitation of the sound wave to the brain, and then the sensation of sound is produced. This is a simple principle of "hearing". Next, let's talk about the eyes: the eyes are the eyes of the human body that are responsible for seeing things. How does it see things? Because the light from the outside world is reflected from the substance and reflected into the eyes, at this time, the ends of the optic nerves distributed in the eyes are stimulated and immediately report to the brain, so that a sensation of seeing things is produced. This sensation of seeing things is called "vision". Then let's talk about the nose and tongue: the nose is the organ for smelling, and the tongue? It is a tool for tasting, which everyone will know. So, how does the nose smell things? And how does the tongue taste? It has to be said. All substances have their own inherent odor. What is an odor? It is the tiny molecules of the substance, mixed in the air, touching the olfactory nerves distributed in the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity, and causing a kind of stimulating odor, and the olfactory nerves immediately notify the brain without simplification, so that a so-called "sense of smell" is produced. The tongue that is responsible for taste is the same principle: when the substance arrives in the mouth and waits to be dissolved and touches the taste nerves on the surface of the tongue, it produces the sensation of "taste". Finally, let's talk about the skin as "touch": for example, I am now holding a pen and shaking it on paper to write, and I clearly feel that my fingers are holding a pen for writing; if I put the pen down and place it on the quilt, my fingers will immediately lose the feeling of contact between the pen and the fingers. At the same time, during the time of touching things, you will be able to perceive the pressure, warmth and coldness, and the position of this thing, and this feeling of the skin reporting external stimuli is called "touch".

The above has briefly explained the physiological concepts, or definitions, of the five senses, which are called sensory organs; below, let's talk about their hygiene.

(1) Hygiene of the ears: As mentioned above, the ear is the auditory organ responsible for hearing, so the so-called ear hygiene is the hygiene of the auditory organ. If we want to pay attention to the ear hygiene of this auditory organ, first of all, it goes without saying that we must try to protect the safety and soundness of the ear and not let it be harmed by external objects. What kind of protection method can make it safe and not cause harm? Such as one, when trimming 理, do not let it shave the ear hair, because the ear hair is actually a safety protector for protecting the ear, and many things that enter from the outside, especially small animals, can be blocked by the ear hair and cannot penetrate deeply. Otherwise, if foreign objects enter, of course, especially small animals that can move, such as insects, after invading, there will be no obstacles, and it will be like entering a doorless place, penetrating deeply into the ear and causing various ear diseases. Second, earwax is the secretion of the ear. It is harmful to take it too much and play with it, which will damage the eardrum; however, if it accumulates too much, it can also hinder hearing and easily cause tinnitus and other phenomena, so it should also be taken out. However, when taking it, be sure not to use hard metal equipment to avoid injury. Third, when swimming in summer, cotton and other things should be used to tightly plug the ears, because water flowing into the ears often causes ear inflammation and other diseases, which affects the safety of the ears. Fourth, our old-fashioned theaters have particularly strong music, which also greatly hinders the nerves inside the ears, that is, it affects the physiological function of the ears for hearing. Fifth, whenever there is a thunderstorm or the opening of large cannons and other sounds that are too high, it is advisable to open the mouth wide to balance the air pressure inside and outside the eardrum in the ears, so as to avoid the danger of being shattered. The above are all hygienic methods to protect the ears.

Spring and Autumn: An Old-Fashioned Love Story by William Saroyan, translated by Lin Fengzao

My cousin Arak was a year and a half younger than me, with a round face, dark complexion, and a particularly good attitude. He wasn't forced at all. His attitude was natural from birth, and mine was bad from birth. When he ran into trouble at school, Arak was always able to dodge it. He smiled politely, revealing sparse front teeth, softening the iron heart of teacher Tefini. As for me, I always drilled into the core of the trouble, arguing and making noise, always saying that I was not wrong, and that Miss Tefini or someone else was wrong. And if necessary, I would take the case to the Supreme Court to prove my innocence.

I was often called to the office. Sometimes, I debated with Principal Dai Renjie in the office. Mr. Dai was not good at arguing, and in the end, I always got a beating. When I debated him to the point where he had nothing to say, he would take out the leather whip.

Arak was different from me; he didn't uphold justice. He was far less intelligent than me; but although he was a year and a half younger than me, he was in the same class as me. This was of course nothing, if our class wasn't the fifth grade. I always won my debates with the teachers, but they wouldn't let me go and wouldn't let me advance to the next grade. I think the only reason was that they hoped to refute me in the next semester so that they could be content. Therefore, I was the oldest student in the fifth grade.

One day, there was a poem written on the blackboard saying that Miss Tefini and Mr. Dai Renjie were in love, and also saying that Miss Tai was ugly. Miss Tai wanted to tell everyone that I wrote the poem. In fact, the author of the poem was not me, but my cousin Arak. When I write poems, I never write about Miss Tefini, but something more valuable. Miss Tai walked to my desk with a ruler in her hand, and without mentioning anyone's name, she said, "I'm going to find the person who wrote that terrible thing on the blackboard and punish him."

""He"!" I said. ""How do you know the author is a boy and not a girl!""

Miss Tai hit my right knuckle. I jumped up from my seat and said, ""You can't hit my knuckles for nothing, I'm going to report it.""

""Sit down,"" Miss Tai said.

I sat down. She pulled my right ear. This ear had been pulled back and forth by Miss Tai and other teachers and had changed its shape.

I sat there and said softly, so softly that it was almost inaudible: ""Just you wait.""

""Shut your tongue and don't talk again,"" Miss Tai said. Although I was in pain like a ghost, I really stuck out my tongue and shut it up. The boys and girls in the class from Mexico, Japan, Armenia, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and ordinary America laughed at me acting in a farce. Miss Tefini picked up the ruler and wanted to hit my hand, but the ruler brushed my nose. This was a special insult to me, because then, as now, my nose was big. If my nose was a little smaller, it wouldn't have brushed it. I believe Miss Tai's blow was a subtle lesson for my big nose.

I covered my nose with my bruised hand and stood up again.

""It was you who told me to shut my tongue,"" I said. I also said that I was only following her orders, and I didn't do anything wrong or break any rules. She shouldn't attack my hand or brush my nose.

""You have to obey the rules,"" Miss Tai said, ""I can't stand your nonsense anymore. You have to obey the rules.""

I took my hand off my nose and started to obey the rules. I smiled, as if I was a child giving her a red apple. My audience laughed for a while. Miss Tai dropped the ruler, stretched out her body to grab me, rolled off the table, immediately got up, and ran around the room chasing me.

""I'm making trouble again,"" I said to myself. Miss Tai was still running around the room chasing me. ""I'm making trouble again, and in the end, it will turn into a homicide. Cousin Arak is the culprit, and he's sitting there laughing. There's no justice anywhere.""

Later, Miss Tai caught me. I knew she would always catch

### Large Investors Remain Eager Buyers; Shanghai Stock Market Conditions Confused; Di Yong Yarn Once Broke the 10,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday on the Shanghai stock market, large investors maintained their appetite for buying, so despite the initial blow of the Securities Exchange requiring a 50% cash deposit on forward contracts, which caused weakness at the opening, the Yong Yarn still managed to reach new highs mid-session due to the stimulation of the soaring black market exchange rate. Yong Gong even reached the limit for price increases, and the same was true for Zhong Si. However, there was too much floating stock, and the off-market interest rate rose again to 45 cents, with arbitrage reaching 720 yuan in the market. Prices fell back quickly near the close. The overall trend is becoming increasingly confusing, and the future is likely to be uncertain.

Initially this morning, due to reports that the Securities Exchange had extended the deadline for forward deliveries by three months, but that a 50% cash deposit was still required, people were apprehensive and the market opened lower. After the opening, Forward Yong Yarn rose from 224, 22, 179, 129, and 197 to 9680 yuan. 235, 89, 158, and 61 sold, and 14 and 76 even sold spot Yong Yarn, once pushing the price down to within 9400 yuan. 154, 76, and 212 still had a healthy appetite for buying, and 97 also accepted spot Yong Yarn, raising the price to above 9600 yuan. 155, 76, 186, 83, and 24 sold off, and 32 and 94 sold spot Yong Yarn, again lowering forward deliveries to 9400 yuan. 228, 54, 36, and 171 rose to above 9600 yuan, while 185, 24, and 134 sold spot Yong Yarn, and 106 also closed out positions, causing another drop to 9480 yuan. The black market for gold banknotes soared. 157, 197, 61, 83, 36, 212, 122, 56, 12, and 224 were desperately trying to buy, and 97 bought back spot Yong Yarn. At the same time, there was talk of a progressive system for depositing security money from the 1.5 billion deposit account, and Forward Yong Yarn finally broke through the 10,000 yuan mark. Yong Gong was acquired by Nong Bang 162, etc., and forward deliveries hit the price increase limit. The same was true for Zhong Si. Forward Yong Yarn rose from 76, 36, 163, 61, and 32 to 10,100 yuan, a new high price of 9,500 yuan for spot. 140, 234, 94, 83, and 197 sold within 9,800 yuan, and 12, 123, and 36 continued to buy. 180 and 97 continued to buy spot Yong Yarn, again pushing towards the 10,000 yuan mark. The off-market interest rate opened high at 40.5 cents and 45 cents, and also reached a high price of 720 yuan in the market. 218, 224, 157, 160, 155, 183, 235, 89, 65, 117, and 217 sold in unison, and prices fell slightly back to 9,600 yuan. Although 157 and 32 advanced to above 9,700 yuan, the Hong Kong Shanghai Electric rose from 9.4 yuan to 9.8 yuan, and yarn prices fell sharply. 89, 94, 36, 155, 83, 223, and 112, etc., cut back on long positions, and forward deliveries fell to 9,400 yuan, a low price of 8,750 yuan for immediate delivery. 171, 196, and 61 advanced to 9,750 yuan, and 22, 47, and 31 were still selling, closing at 9,650 yuan. After the close, Forward Yong Yarn was bought by 224, and the price was called up to 9,800 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn, Jingfu, and Hui stocks fell, Yong Gong rose by a strong 50%, Meiya, Xinhe, Xinguang, Zhongfa, and Dongxing each fell by a strong 50%, Xinfei fell by about 10%, Zhongsi rose to the limit and then retreated, rising by 10% along with Cement, Tongyi, Huorong, and Lian each rose by a strong 50%, Xinya was flat, Jinglun Hui fell, Guohuo fell by a strong 50%, and the rest rose slightly. In terms of forward deliveries, Yong Gong rose to the limit, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing rose slightly, and Huafeng fell slightly. In terms of off-market older stocks, Nanyang, Zhabei, and Dasheng all fell, Wuzhou rose slightly, and the rest were flat.

Arbitrage Trading

For spot and forward arbitrage trading, the interest rate ranged from 13 cents to over 30 cents, and finally around 26 cents. Yong Yarn ranged from 390 yuan to 720 yuan, and finally 650 yuan. 151, 83, 224, 117, 104, 94, 157, 171, 85, 152, 95, 212, and 232 all posted bids, and 177, 220, 56, 159, etc., posted [bids]. Xinguang ranged from 9.5 yuan to 13 yuan, and finally 11 yuan. Xinhe ranged from 165 yuan to 270 yuan, and Huafeng ranged from 6.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan.

### Most Banks in Nanchang Experience Losses in the First Half of the Year

[Our Nanchang correspondent reports on the 26th] The preliminary results of the bank settlements in this city are complete, and most banks have experienced losses. The Bank of China lost as much as 400 million, and the Bank of Communications and the Agricultural Bank also lost 100 to 200 million each. Few other commercial banks and finance shops made a profit. However, the Provincial Bank alone made a profit of over 1 billion in the past six months.

Another report: Prices in this city are rising again, especially for cotton cloth. Foreign yarn is also rising by more than one million per day, with 21-count Sanshan yarn at 10.4 million.

### Raw Peanuts and Tea Shipped to Europe

[Report from our publication] The French postal ship "Andre Lebon" left Shanghai yesterday morning to return to France. It carried 5,000 boxes of tea, 2,240 packages of raw peanuts, 25 pieces of pork, 7 pieces of sausage casings, and over 900 packages of luggage and mail from Shanghai to France. In addition, 70 pieces of tobacco leaves were shipped to Bose.

### Wu Kaixian States Determination to Prevent Further Rise in Rice Prices; 65,000 Shí of Rice Sold at Fair Prices in Each District Monthly

In recent days, prices in this city have suddenly risen again, and the authorities are paying close attention to this. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, gave a speech yesterday on the recent food problem and the general price trends. He said: The recent rise in rice prices is extremely unreasonable, and I have been paying close attention to it. The main reason for the rise in rice prices is nothing more than the severe storms and heavy rains before the Dragon Boat Festival, which reduced the source of rice, creating an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to manipulate the market. However, the city's rice reserves are extremely abundant, and the sources from various places are also very large, so there is no fear of shortage. In order to prevent rice prices from rising again, we have decided to strengthen the food regulation work. He also said that the work of the Food Regulation Committee is quite active, and at the meeting yesterday afternoon, it was decided to supply 65,000 shí of fair-priced rice to each district in the city every month.

### Statistics on Production Equipment in Shanghai's Cotton Textile Industry; Total of Over Two Million Spindles

[Report from our publication] According to statistics from the Industry and Commerce Assistance Office: Shanghai's cotton textile industry has a total of 2,082,102 spindles. Among them, the Textile Construction Company accounts for 887,364 spindles, and the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association accounts for 1,194,738 spindles. If operating day and night for 20 hours, and operating for 26 days per month, 105,144 pieces of 20-count yarn can be spun. However, the actual output is only 84,000 pieces due to insufficient power and machine repairs.

The total number of thread spindles in each factory in this city is 395,304 pieces. The Textile Construction Company accounts for 235,540 spindles, and the factories in the Sixth District Association account for 123,764 spindles. The maximum possible production is 19,760 pieces of 42-count yarn per month, but due to insufficient power and machine repairs, the actual output is 13,000 pieces.

According to statistics on looms in this city, the Textile Construction Company, the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association, and the Shanghai Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association together own 64,298 looms. The maximum possible monthly output is 3,344,000 pieces of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth (calculated at 40 yards per piece), requiring 105,376 pieces of yarn. But the actual output is: 650,000 pieces from the Textile Construction Company, 474,500 pieces from private factories, and 888,966 pieces of local cloth from factories in the Fourth District Association; totaling a monthly cloth production of 2,013,466 pieces, requiring 63,424 pieces of yarn.

The supply and demand situation for yarn and thread in this city is as follows: Yarn – the maximum monthly supply is 105,144 pieces, the demand is 129,336 pieces, a shortage of 24,196 pieces; The maximum production of thread is 13,000 pieces, the demand is 18,000 pieces, a shortage of 5,000 pieces.

### Rice Prices Increase Sharply; Japonica and Indica Both Rise

Yesterday, a total of over 6,100 shí of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market conditions were affected by price fluctuations outside the market, and prices increased accordingly. Japonica and indica rice both saw a rebound of over 10,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan also increased by 10,000 yuan. The market slightly stabilized around noon.

Due to frequent price increases in the interior, flour remained nominally stable but effectively firm. Miscellaneous brand flour and foreign flour rose by 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran sales were normal, but the price still tended to soften, retreating slightly by 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes were inconsistently firm and weak. Factory bean cakes rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while Yingkou cakes were transacted lightly, weakening slightly by 1,000 yuan.

Due to the China Trust Bureau's large-scale supply of soybeans, the sales market for each oil factory suddenly became sluggish, and prices fell sharply by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. The oil market, however, saw the continued activity of the Guangdong gang, and raw soybean oil continued to rise by over 20,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and sesame oil also followed suit, rising by 20,000 yuan, and clear oil also increased by over 20,000 yuan.

Tea beans from Nanyang continued to be processed, with prices rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red beans from Guangdong still had an appetite for buying, and prices continued to rise by 10,000 yuan. Corn was being processed by alcohol factories, and there were inquiries from the north, with prices soaring by over 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum was fixed at a high price but transactions were sluggish. Sesame prices rose steadily, with demand exceeding supply. Foreign merchants were active, and prices continued to rise by 11,000 yuan, remaining firm despite the high price. Raw peanuts from South China continued to be absorbed strongly, with prices rising wildly and endlessly, and another surge of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan was seen.

### Silk Export Issues for the Year; Guidance Association Decides to Form a Design Committee to Study the Matter

Regarding the silk export issues for this year, the Silk Guidance Association has decided to form a separate design committee to study the matter. The committee is waiting for relevant parties to nominate representatives and hire experts, and the first meeting will be held soon. It is understood that prices have been rising steadily this year, and costs have gradually increased. The current cost is estimated to be close to 30 million yuan. The US market price, however, is only about 4.40 yuan, which translates to just over 7 million in national currency per dan, a difference of over 23 million. Merchants are unable to export, and even if the government buys it, the losses incurred would be too great, and the national treasury would not be able to bear the burden. Therefore, relevant parties generally advocate exporting in order to exchange for foreign materials.
