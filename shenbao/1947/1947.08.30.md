### Chairman's Instruction on Self-Reliance, Central and Local Governments Encouraged to Govern with Diligence, State Council Passes Banking Law for Promulgation and Implementation, Indonesia Investigation Team, Our Country Decides to Participate

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Chairman Jiang personally presided over the State Council meeting on the 29th. After various reports, he gave instructions on current officialdom governance and thrift. The Chairman emphasized the importance of self-reliance, saying that at this time, everyone should work together, govern with diligence, from the central to the local levels. The thrift movement should be thoroughly implemented. Ministers Wang Yunwu, Shao Lizi, Hui Qi, etc., also spoke, offering opinions on local politics. After about an hour, the proposals were discussed.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Foreign Minister Wang's report at the State Council meeting on the 29th was roughly divided into two points: one was the study of the Wei Envoy's statement on leaving China, and the other was the handling of the Indonesian issue. It is said that the United States suggested that the consuls of various countries in Indonesia form an investigation team, while the Soviet Union believed that it should be organized by the United Nations. After deliberation, it was decided to establish an investigation country based on the US proposal, which will be organized soon, and our country has decided to participate.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Banking Law has been formulated for a long time, and it was only passed by the State Council on the 29th and promulgated and implemented based on the review opinions of the Economic Review Committee of the National Government Committee. The law has completed the legislative procedures, and the Legislative Yuan has urged its promulgation. The last State Council meeting decided to submit it to the Economic Review Committee for review. According to the committee's reply, the law does not differ much from the central policy and current methods, so there is no need to re-establish legislative principles and redraft the articles. This law can be promulgated and implemented. However, during the period of implementing emergency economic measures, the measures for strengthening financial business control in the emergency economic measures plan remain effective. In addition, Article 6 of the Outline for the Implementation of Political Power for Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion also stipulates that financial businesses may be restricted or managed. Therefore, the provisions of Article 46 of the law may differ slightly from the provisions of Article 9 of the control measures, and it seems that the provisions of the control measures should still be followed temporarily. Article 46 of the Banking Law states: "If a bank violates laws and regulations, its business license shall be revoked, or its responsible person shall be subject to a fine or more severe punishment, the competent authority shall transfer it to the court for adjudication." Article 9 of the Measures for Strengthening the Control of Financial Business states: "The competent financial authority shall send personnel to various places at any time to conduct spot checks on the accounts of banks and money houses. If it is found that there is a situation that promotes speculation and hoarding, emergency measures may be taken to order the suspension of business or to transfer its manager to the court for punishment."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] At 10:00 a.m. on the 29th, the National Government Committee held the tenth State Council meeting in the National Government Conference. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting. The committee members Zhang Qun, Yi Qiqiao, Desi, Wang Yunwu, Xu Fulin and other seventeen people attended. The reporting items were read out: (1) The case of revising the foreign exchange management and import and export trade methods; (2) The case of the thirty-sixth year's in-kind collection of land tax and borrowing grain in-kind. Next, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on the recent diplomatic situation, and then discussed the proposals: (1) The Legislative Yuan formulated the Banking Law and submitted it for promulgation and implementation, which was resolved and passed; (2) The draft method for compiling and reviewing the annual work plans of various agencies for the thirty-seventh year, which was resolved and passed; (3) The appointment of Zheng Yanye as a member of the Legislative Yuan to fill the vacancy of Yi Yuanning, which was resolved and passed. Other cases related to the financial budget were also passed.

### Registration Exemptions Approved for Persons with Illness in Mongolian and Tibetan Electoral Units

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The State Council discussed two proposals related to election affairs on the morning of the 29th: (1) The Chairman submitted a proposal from the Election Headquarters requesting that electoral units with fewer than 5,000 voters be exempted from the candidate registration procedure, and that voters directly vote for the candidate with the most votes to be elected, and the next most votes to be alternate candidates, which was passed. The case was because, according to regulations, candidates for the National Assembly representative must be signed by more than 500 voters, and candidates for the Legislative Yuan must be signed by more than 3,000 voters before they can register. Without the above registration, they cannot be elected. However, the table of allocations for the National Assembly seats and the table of allocations for the Legislative Yuan seats state that the Ejin Banner of Mongolia should elect one representative to the National Assembly and one member of the Legislative Yuan. According to statistics, the population of the banner is only 942, and those with the right to vote according to law are estimated to be less than three-quarters, that is, only about 700 people. Furthermore, in Tibet, 11 representatives to the National Assembly and 5 members of the Legislative Yuan should be elected by Tibetans temporarily living in the interior. However, the number of Tibetans temporarily living in the interior is also small, and the number of signatories cannot reach the standard. There are many similar situations in various Mongolian banners, so the above-mentioned accommodating regulations are made. (2) The Chairman submitted a proposal from the Election Headquarters asking whether the XIngzhong, Mai, and Nongxiang three administrative bureaus in Sichuan have not been established and the areas have not been delimited, can they be incorporated into nearby counties and cities to handle the election. It was decided to incorporate them into nearby counties and cities to handle the election.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The election committee of the national vocational groups and women's groups election offices held its second meeting at the Ministry of Social Affairs at 4:00 p.m. on the 29th, presided over by Director Gu Zhenggang. More than ten members attended. The meeting passed the important points that should be followed in the elections of national assembly representatives and legislative members from vocational groups and women's groups, and resolved the following important cases: (1) How to deal with cases where the number of signatories for the registration of candidates from vocational groups and women's groups is insufficient to meet the legal requirements? It was decided to ask the general office to remedy it quickly, and to ask the Judicial Yuan to interpret it quickly. (2) Should additional ballot boxes be added or polling stations be set up at the centralized locations of vocational groups and women's groups? It was decided to send telegrams to the election offices of various provinces and cities to handle it according to their needs, and report to the general office for record. (3) The Ministry of Social Affairs forwarded a report from the National Women's Groups Liaison Association, requesting the transfer of the request to revoke the regulations that national women's groups must have more than five branches and that their membership lists must be reported to the Ministry of Social Affairs for record. It was decided to send a letter to the Legislative Yuan to cancel it.

### The General Chamber of Commerce Provides Opinions on Dealing with Japanese Economic Threats, We Should Seek Compensation from Japan for Spindles

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] After the decision to open Sino-Japanese trade, the economic development between China and Japan has attracted the attention of the national business community, especially the textile industry. In view of this, the National Federation of Commerce and Industry has provided three opinions on opening trade with Japan and submitted them to the government for attention: (1) The greatest threat to China's industrial circles is the import of Japanese cotton and woolen textiles. (2) Japan currently has a population of 70 million. If it has 1 million spindles, it will be enough for its needs, and the Allied Headquarters allows the standard of 6 million spindles, which will help boost the power of its economic aggression. On the contrary, China has a population of 450 million and needs 10 million spindles, but it currently only has one-third of that number. It should immediately seek compensation from Japan to remedy this. (3) Strengthen anti-smuggling work at sea and land ports to prevent the smuggling of re-equipped Japanese goods into the country in advance.

### Wang Xiaolai Talks About Construction Donations, Those Who Applied for Official Exchange Rates During the War, Are the Main Target of the Donation

[Report from this newspaper] Wang Xiaolai, the person in charge of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry, said: "The decision on the starting point for the National Construction Special Donation, 5 billion, is actually a compromise figure. In the past, some people proposed 50 billion as the starting point, which is too high. There are not many such wealthy people in Shanghai. The implementation of the National Construction Donation will inevitably have many difficulties, but it cannot be abandoned just because there is resistance. When I attended the meeting of the National Economic Commission, I suggested that the government announce the names of those who applied for official exchange rates during the war and the amount they requested, and use this as the standard for the donation. Those who made the most profit during the war were nothing more than those who saved gold and applied for foreign exchange. The former has already been discounted when it was cashed in, so the latter is actually the class that benefited the most. The collection of the National Construction Donation emphasizes fairness, and attention should be paid to this. My opinion has been recorded in detail in the meeting minutes."

### US Troops Searching for Missing Aircraft Attacked by Communist Troops in Communist Area, Pilot Returns Safely to Qingdao

[United Press, Qingdao, 29th] The US Navy telegraphed from Qingdao on the 29th that a US Marine Corps aircraft crashed in the Shandong Cape area while practicing flying on Wednesday. A small team of US Marines was ordered to land to find the missing pilot and was attacked by guerrillas at E-Jiao Cape on the afternoon of the 28th. The Navy telegram did not specify the identity of the guerrillas who ambushed them. However, it is believed that they belong to the Communist troops who are active in the area. Fortunately, there were no casualties among the US personnel. The telegram also stated: "It is not known whether the guerrillas were injured." It can be seen that the US troops returned fire on the other side. The US troops inquired from Chinese civilians at the crash site about the whereabouts of the missing pilot, but to no avail. After destroying the fighter jet, the US troops retreated to the beach and sought the assistance of Chinese people in the E-Jiao area. The pilots of the missing 113 aircraft and two other aircraft were all safe. One person was rescued by the US destroyer Isber. The other person returned to the team safely on the evening of the 28th.

### Another Corner of Red Poland, Parliament and Political Parties

— Special Correspondent of this newspaper Mao Shuqing

Poland's new parliament was re-elected on January 9 this year. They call it the first parliament since the restoration of the country. The parliament adopts a unicameral system with a total of 444 seats. According to Poland's new constitution, this is the highest legislative body in the country. In fact, through the use of party politics under the cover of arms, what manipulates the lifeline of Poland today is not so much the parliament, but the Communist Party of Poland. The Communist Party of Poland is now renamed the "Labor Party," and it is one of the majority parties in the parliament.

Among the 444 seats, the Communist Party occupies 117 seats, the Social Party occupies 117 seats, the Peasant Party occupies 113 seats, the Democratic Party occupies 41 seats, the Polish Peasant Party occupies 25 seats, the Christian Labor Party occupies 17 seats, the New Liberal American Party occupies 7 seats, and in addition, there are 3 Catholics who are independent and do not belong to any party, and 4 "social directors" who do not belong to any party or group. Among the seven political parties, except for the Polish Peasant Party, which did not participate in the government, the rest belong to the "ruling" parties. Therefore, purely from a theoretical point of view, the legislative and administrative institutions cannot play the role of "separation of powers."

What is more important than theory is reality. During my few days in Poland, I discussed with many Polish friends who had political interests. I don't know if it was because of the language that caused such a deep gulf. Nine out of ten of my Polish friends who could speak English sympathized with the "Polish Peasant Party" in the opposition, which Poles call PSL. They said: The Polish Peasant Party only sold 25 seats, entirely because the Communists controlled the election and even as a result of election fraud. They said: Most of the peasants in Poland, the residents of small cities, and even the wealthy so-called capitalists, all agree with the propositions of the "Polish Peasant Party." They even regard the chairman of the "Polish Peasant Party," Mikolajczyk, as today's "saint."

What interests me are those "legendary" folk tales that are circulating in every corner of Polish society. It is said that one day, the mayor of a small city in eastern Poland received a phone call from the central government in Warsaw early in the morning, saying that the Polish Minister of Industry would be returning from a meeting in Moscow at 12:00 noon that afternoon, and he was to summon the local people, holding small flags, to gather at the station to cheer and pay tribute. The mayor was taken aback when he heard the phone call: "It's so sudden, the people are all working. How can I summon them?" The order from Warsaw was: "There is no way, you have to find a way. The expedient measure lies with the mayor."

The clever mayor immediately issued an order: "All first-grade students in elementary schools will be given a half-day holiday. At 2:00 p.m., the teachers will lead them to the station to welcome them!" As soon as the order was issued, the phone from the Warsaw government rang again: "In addition to the Minister of Industry, the Prime Minister will also be returning from Moscow at the same time. It is not enough to mobilize only first-grade students." The mayor frowned and thought, this is easy, so he issued another order: All second-grade students will also participate in the railway station.

Five minutes later, Warsaw called again, saying that the President and the Prime Minister were also returning from Moscow on the same train, and the number of people welcoming them had to be increased, and the cheers had to be louder. The mayor replied very quickly: "Simply stop all elementary school students from class, and gather them all at the station at 2:00 p.m."

Five minutes later, Warsaw called again, saying that in addition to those Polish dignitaries, the Soviet ambassador was also coming together. It was not enough to just send out elementary school students, and it was not enthusiastic enough. We had to find another way! That clever mayor asked: "I don't have a way to summon the people in a short period of time, unless you give me the greatest power to take any measures!" The Warsaw telephone asked him: "In order to summon the masses in the shortest period of time, we can give you all expediency, but what method can create such a miracle?"

The mayor calmly replied: "I am preparing to issue a large notice saying that the chairman of the Polish Peasant Party, Mikolajczyk, will give a speech at the city's railway station at 2:00 p.m. today. In this way, I guarantee that half of the city's residents will automatically come to the railway station... If you want me to summon more people to the railway station, I am prepared to beat the gong and announce to the city's residents: the secretary-general of the Communist Party, Gomulka, will be executed at the city's railway station at 2:00 p.m. today. Then, even the old, weak, women and children will excitedly run to the railway station!"

This is a very popular legendary folk tale. I also don't need to investigate which city? Which mayor? But, as far as I know from my Polish friends in Warsaw who speak English, they have an indescribable "affection" for Mikolajczyk. (The following article turns to the second page)

[Li Bao, Shenyang, 29th dispatch] After the announcement of Chen Cheng's concurrent appointment as Director of the Northeast Executive Headquarters, Xiong Shihui sent a telegram to Chen on the 29th, urging him to come to Shenyang to take office, and ordered all departments of the Executive Headquarters to complete the handover work within two days, from the 29th to the 30th. All parties welcomed the arrival of Chief of Staff Chen Cheng to preside over the Northeast, believing that it would not only deal a major blow to the Communist bandits but also surely have a way to rectify military discipline and promote political and economic affairs. Furthermore, the heads of the various provinces and cities in the Northeast gathered at the Executive Headquarters on the morning of the 29th to pay their respects to Xiong Shihui, make requests and inquiries, and express their farewell sentiments.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] According to the military news agency: Director of the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense, Liu Muzeng, will fly to Peiping within days and then proceed to Shenyang to inspect military law affairs in the Northeast. It is also heard that Liu will assume an important position in the Northeast Executive Headquarters.

[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 29th dispatch] Random Talk: The sixth offensive promoted by the Communist bandits has not yet matured, and the Nationalist army's proactive offensive has not yet materialized. Both sides may be hampered by rain, making action and replenishment difficult. Currently, most of the bandits are concentrated in the areas of Meihekou and Xi'an. Although there are many bandits in the Jinan and Rehe areas, their strength is limited.

[Our newspaper, Changchun, 29th dispatch] After the announcement of Chen Cheng's concurrent appointment as Director of the Northeast Executive Headquarters, morale was boosted. After the Communist bandits in the Northeast were destroyed in the fifth offensive, the sixth offensive has not yet been launched. However, news is constantly coming from northern Songliao, saying that they are actively preparing and that a large number of military supplies are being transported from a certain direction for reorganization and expansion. More than 100,000 bandits are stationed on both sides of the China Changchun Railway in Siping, with Meihekou as the focus. In terms of the overall situation, it is possible for the bandits to act at any time. With Chen Cheng concurrently presiding over the military and political affairs of the Northeast, there will surely be active measures to control the bandits in the future.

### Minister of the Embassy in Italy, Xue Guangqian, Returns Home to Report on His Work

Arrived in Shanghai yesterday from New York by plane

[Our newspaper] Minister Xue Guangqian of the Embassy in Italy arrived in Shanghai yesterday (29th) on a Pan American aircraft from New York. Dozens of Xue's relatives and friends went to Longhua Airport to welcome him. Minister Xue represented China in the United Nations Greek Border Dispute Investigation Team in January this year, traveling to various Balkan countries for three months. He recently went to the United States from Europe to attend the Security Council to discuss the Greek issue. After it came to an end, he was ordered to return to the country to report on his work. Minister Xue was dispatched to serve as the Chargé d'affaires in Italy in the autumn of 1945, before the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, and made many contributions to Sino-Italian relations. He successively participated in the London Five-Power Foreign Ministers Conference and the Paris Peace Conference last year to handle the issue of the Italian peace treaty. According to Minister Xue at the airport, the situation in the Balkans is becoming increasingly tense. This issue has been discussed by the Security Council 60 times, but due to the Soviet Union's exercise of its veto power four times, the international community has been unable to reach an agreement. This matter is now prepared to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, which will open on September 16, for discussion, and it is hoped that a reasonable solution can be found. Otherwise, the trend of a small spark starting a great fire is truly worrisome, he said.

### American Brethren Service Team to Leave Shanghai and Return Home Soon

[Our newspaper] Fifteen Americans who volunteered to work in China for nearly a year will leave China and return home this month. Their mission for the past year was to teach Chinese farmers how to use and maintain the agricultural machinery supplied by UNRRA. These young volunteers (with an average age of less than 25) belong to the Brethren Service Team organized by 49 members of the Brethren Church in Elgin, Illinois, USA. In addition to being provided with miscellaneous expenses by the government, they only receive US$25 per month. Their footprints have spread across 12 provinces, assigned to UNRRA's agricultural rehabilitation activities to help Chinese farmers increase production. Most of the volunteers are young American farmers who have received special training in tractors before coming to China. When the tractor training activities in the Yellow River flood area of Henan were at their peak, 14 members of the volunteer team worked separately, teaching a total of 347 Chinese students in 12 units how to use and maintain the 261 tractors supplied by UNRRA. Henan has flat and fertile terrain, making it an ideal place for farming. The first automatic harvester in the area was installed there to demonstrate how to harvest and thresh wheat simultaneously.

### Beijing Tiananmen Square Scenic Area: Police Dispatch Late at Night to Forcibly Evict Vendors; Surprise Attack in the Midst of Sleep Successful Without Incident

[Our newspaper, Peiping, 29th dispatch] The long-brewing campaign to rectify street vendors in Peiping began today, with the vendors in the Tiananmen Square Qianbu Corridor scenic area bearing the brunt of the eviction. Since the beginning of summer, vendors have flocked to the area, and some larger food merchants have also set up stalls there for retail sales, with thriving business that has even affected similar regular stores. The municipal authorities have long intended to rectify the situation and have repeatedly issued orders, but without effect. The vendors have also visited the authorities several times to appeal, stating that they are willing to pay taxes but will never move, and are prepared to kneel and cry at the municipal government. In order to prevent the situation from worsening, the Municipal Police Bureau dispatched more than 100 armed and unarmed police officers at midnight this morning, temporarily imposing martial law in the area, waking up the vendors from their sleep, and forcibly dismantling their stalls. At the same time, more than 100 rickshaws were hired to transport their belongings. The vendors, caught off guard, finally followed the instructions and were transported away, fortunately without incident. The municipal authorities have prepared to designate several suitable areas as mobile markets for the vendors.

### UNRRA Allocates 17 Billion to Purchase Agricultural Tools for Distribution in the Henan Flood Area

[Our newspaper] UNRRA has recently allocated 17 billion yuan to purchase basic agricultural tools commonly used by farmers in northern China for the people in the Yellow River flood area of Henan. In early this month, when the Director of UNRRA and the Director of UNRRA's China Office flew to Kaifeng for inspection, they discussed various practical issues related to the restoration of the flood area. Upon returning to Shanghai, they brought back samples of agricultural tools commonly used by the people of Henan for mass production in Shanghai. The recent decision of 17 billion yuan, of which 5 billion yuan is allocated to the UNRRA Henan Branch for local purchase, and 12 billion yuan is purchased in Shanghai. UNRRA is currently signing a contract with the China Agricultural Machinery Company, requiring the company to deliver the goods as much as possible before the end of October, and to use the designated funds to purchase materials worth 3 billion to 5 billion yuan, entrusting various factories in the city to rush production. The agricultural tools most needed by the farmers in the flood area are hammers, hoes, shovels, sickles, and hand hoes. The UNRRA authorities have ordered the above five types of hand tools to be manufactured in a short period of time, transported to the flood area, and distributed to farmers for free. The UNRRA Henan Branch is now concentrating its efforts on the restoration work in the Henan flood area. The branch was originally in Kaifeng and recently moved to Xuchang to promote the work in the flood area nearby. The branch has recently added an agricultural group, headed by UNRRA agricultural expert Huang Yisheng, who is responsible for all matters related to agricultural construction in the flood area. Huang is scheduled to go to Henan to take office within days.

### Local Instability and Lack of Electricity: Many Difficulties for Industry and Mining in the Northeast; Resources Commission Will Try Its Best to Overcome Them

[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 29th dispatch] The industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast are in a depressed state in the midst of their recovery. There are many problems that are most difficult at present. The first is the instability of security, which has a great impact on the productivity of various mines. The second is the lack of electricity and funds. Since the destruction of the Xiaofengman transmission line in mid-June, the 200,000 kilowatts of electricity used by industry in southern Liaoning has been suspended. The 60,000 kilowatts of electricity distributed by the thermal power plants in Fushun and Anshan is only a little more than one-third of the original power. In terms of coal mines, production has been reduced by one-third, which is worthy of attention. The conclusion reached by Sun Yueqi, Deputy Director of the Resources Commission, after inspecting the industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast, is that the conditions for the development of industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast are stability and funds. Sun will make his best efforts to solve these difficulties. Regarding the security issue, he has discussed it with Director Xiong Shihui several times, who promised to ensure it. The funding issue can only be decided after Sun returns to Nanjing. In addition, a unified plan will also be agreed upon to deal with the shortage of food and materials.

### Most of the Flood Area Has Been Cultivated, But the Weather Is Not Good and There Is a Poor Harvest; The Returning Refugees Are Suffering Greatly

Ma Jie, Director of the UNRRA Henan Branch, recently came to Shanghai to report on his work. He said that the returning refugees in the flood area are enduring great hardships. The land, which was originally a barren wasteland, has now been mostly cultivated. Initially, experts estimated that the flood area could harvest 20,000 tons of food this year. Unfortunately, the weather was not good, and only 5,000 tons can be harvested this year, which cannot be maintained until the autumn harvest next year. Since the successful damming of the Huayuankou breach, the returning refugees have relied on relief food while cultivating the land themselves, waiting for the harvest. Now that the hope of harvest is not great, UNRRA must still release 5,000 tons of various types of food in the flood area every month to maintain it. Since the start of the work in the flood area, up to the 7th of this month, UNRRA has distributed a total of 14,700 tons of food and 3.8 million catties of seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools, medicines, etc. The various materials distributed this month can reach 4,000 tons.

Editorial

### Promoting International Cultural and Educational Cooperation

The China Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) held its inaugural meeting in Beijing on the 28th. In recent days, subcommittees on science, culture, and education have been meeting to discuss how to promote international cultural and educational cooperation. More than one hundred prominent figures from the national cultural, educational, and scientific communities gathered together to discuss various cultural and educational issues, with great enthusiasm. This was truly a grand gathering for China's cultural, educational, and scientific circles. The purpose of this grand gathering, as Examination Yuan President Dai said, is to "cultivate ambition through simplicity, achieve far-reaching goals through tranquility, promote the advancement of humankind, and realize universal harmony." However, the most noteworthy suggestion was that of Peking University President Dr. Hu Shih, who proposed requesting UNESCO to hold a conference in China in 1950 to commemorate the 2,500th birthday of China's sage and teacher, Confucius. He also hoped that the government would designate an organization to prepare for the grand commemoration of Confucius's 2,500th birthday, with the joint participation of national cultural, educational, and scientific figures, to make it an unprecedented event in China's academic and cultural world. We, in principle, fully agree with Dr. Hu's suggestion.

According to the UNESCO Charter, passed at a conference held in London in November 1945, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization was officially established in Paris in November of the following year. China also sent representatives to participate. After the meeting, work began, and in accordance with Article 7, all member states should, taking into account their own circumstances, find ways to closely link their most important educational, scientific, and cultural organizations with the work of UNESCO. Committees in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have already been established one after another, but it was only now that China has realized this. The birth of this organization, which aims to strive for mutual understanding between nations in terms of thought and culture and education, cannot be said to be a major progress for mankind.

During World War II, the world suffered the devastation of war, and everyone hoped that this war would be the last war for mankind. However, in order to achieve this noble ideal, everyone believed that it was essential to start by eliminating misunderstandings between nations. The relationship between countries is just like the relationship between people. Without frequent contact, misunderstandings easily arise. Therefore, if we want to eliminate the recurrence of war in the future, we should strive for international cultural and educational cooperation, thereby promoting international understanding. In particular, the differences between Eastern and Western cultures and education, and the differences in customs, are most likely to cause international misunderstandings. For example, a century ago, China, because it did not understand Western civilization, developed a psychology of blindly rejecting foreigners; and in Western countries, because they did not understand Chinese civilization, they revealed a sense of superiority everywhere. The disputes of the past century have largely originated from a failure to understand each other. Looking around, the reason for the outbreak of World War II was that the irreconcilable conflict between democracy and Nazism or Fascism was the biggest cause. Today's unstable international situation and ideological conflicts are still important factors. Why can't the United States and the Soviet Union continue to cooperate as they did during the war? The American people cannot understand Soviet communism, and the Soviet people cannot understand American-style democracy. As a result, misunderstandings and suspicions arise, which not only cannot be eliminated but are also becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, in order to clarify the international situation, international cultural and educational cooperation seems particularly necessary under the current circumstances. It is regrettable that although the Soviet Union is a member of the United Nations, it still remains outside the door of UNESCO. It seems that this northern "bear" only believes in its own strength and does not need to consider how to coexist with the outside world.

As for the Chinese government and people, in recent years, they have made great efforts to promote international cultural exchange. However, the world's understanding of China still inevitably has some gaps. Even today's United States may not fully understand the essence of Chinese culture and the actual political situation. Because of this, with the enthusiasm of the Americans and the sincerity of the Chinese, misunderstandings can still often occur between China and the United States. This is not to blame anyone, but to mutually recognize that the work of promoting mutual understanding has not been done enough. Taking General Wedemeyer's recent visit to China [to investigate the facts] as an example, he traveled in China for a month, believing that he had understood everything, but after reading his statement, we do not know what he actually understood and what "new" discoveries he had.

In short, for the sake of the progress of human civilization, we must strive to promote international cultural and educational cooperation. In order to maintain world peace, we must also find ways to connect with various countries and promote mutual understanding between nations. Now that the China Committee has been established in Beijing, it should immediately move towards the great goal of "the advancement of humankind and universal harmony"!

### Cultural Circles' Work of Suppressing the Rebellion

The cultural circles of Shanghai, in support of the National Government's call for a general mobilization to suppress the bandits, initiated the organization of the Shanghai Cultural Circles' General Mobilization Association for Suppressing the Rebellion and Saving the Nation, which held its inaugural meeting today. The establishment of this association, a consensus among the elite of Shanghai, to mobilize culture and spirit under the banner of general mobilization to assist the government in suppressing the rebellion, is of great significance. We congratulate the establishment of the Cultural Circles' General Mobilization Association for Suppressing the Rebellion and Saving the Nation, and hope that the development of cultural mobilization in Shanghai will soon achieve the expected results.

What the Chinese Communist Party holds is the weapon of internal strife. In the process of the National Revolution, it harmed China's unity; during the eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, it hindered the victory of the resistance; and in the stage of victorious restoration, it tried to undermine the realization of national democracy and constitutionalism. The Communist Party initially concealed its sinister intentions, occupying territory and claiming hegemony; then it harbored ulterior motives, secretly colluding with foreign aid, and did not hesitate to harm the people to show off its power. Its crimes and ambitions are truly countless. Its actions can no longer be considered a political party, but rather a band of outlaws in Chinese history! The National Government, feeling that there was no hope for peace and unity, announced on July 18 the Outline for Assisting in Suppressing the Rebellion, Completing Constitutional Government, and Calling on the Entire People to Mobilize Together to Suppress the Internal Rebellion. Since the promulgation of the general mobilization order, the military and civilians across the country have known that the central government has the determination to sever a limb to save the body, and there is no need to worry about nurturing paralysis and causing future trouble. As a result, they have changed their hesitant and wait-and-see attitude and actively contributed their manpower, material resources, and financial resources to the general mobilization, so that the government can complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation as soon as possible. People in the cultural and educational circles have always advocated justice. This time, the cultural and educational circles in Shanghai have been mobilized with enthusiasm, which has added new strength to the general mobilization. However, cultural mobilization includes ideological mobilization and spiritual mobilization, which is a major matter with arduous tasks. Only by strengthening efforts, expanding the lineup, and doing it in an organized and planned way, persistently, can we achieve the expected results. On the occasion of the establishment of the conference, I would like to express my thoughts for the reference of people in the cultural circles.

First, the general mobilization of cultural circles must shoulder the responsibility of mobilizing culture. Shanghai is a gathering place of talent. The most urgent task of the mobilization association should be to gather people from all cultural positions to participate in the mobilization association organization and participate in the mobilization work of suppressing the rebellion and saving the nation. Loyalty and treachery cannot coexist, and hesitation leads to nowhere. Those who are two-faced are especially despised by those who understand righteousness. It is hoped that all people in the cultural circles will recognize that "the Communist bandits will not be eliminated, and the rebellion will not be suppressed," stand on the front line of cultural mobilization, and cooperate with the General Mobilization Association to "condemn them with words and pens, so that the national traitors have nowhere to hide." Then, the strength of Shanghai's cultural mobilization will be extremely great.

Second, mobilizing culture must mobilize thought. The most urgent task of the mobilization association should be to clarify the confusion in cultural and ideological aspects. There is no shortage of patriots among the elite of Shanghai. However, some people disregard the country and the nation, superficially innovating but actually forgetting their ancestors, and worshiping Marxism-Leninism as the supreme truth. A considerable number of them are still lurking in the cultural and educational circles, secretly growing and directly or indirectly hindering the thoughts and actions of mobilization. This is not only true in Shanghai and even China, but also in the United States. The "Trojan horse policy" of the American Communist Party refers to this. Therefore, the general mobilization of cultural circles today must, on the one hand, strengthen the cultural mobilization work, and on the other hand, must eliminate the bad trends in cultural and ideological aspects, so that all demons and monsters cannot transform and charm people in broad daylight.

Third, cultural mobilization must coordinate with military mobilization. Soldiers are fighting in the border areas and mobilizing on the front lines. The cultural circles should encourage morale and improve their combat effectiveness in terms of thought and spirit. Handling cultural comfort activities, providing spiritual food, and participating in military tasks are all urgent tasks. Therefore, it is said that cultural mobilization should not only achieve the effect of ideological mobilization on the cultural front, but also stand on the military front to strive for the effect of spiritual mobilization.

Today, the Shanghai Cultural Circles' General Mobilization Association for Suppressing the Rebellion and Saving the Nation has been established, and it should earnestly shoulder the responsibility of mobilizing culture from today onwards. Although the rise of the cultural circles in Shanghai is behind the capital, because of its important position, its influence will spread, and all localities will work together to make joint efforts. It is hoped that the Shanghai Cultural Circles' General Mobilization Association for Suppressing the Rebellion and Saving the Nation must be organized, planned, and move forward in a unified manner, which is a good guarantee for suppressing the rebellion and saving the nation.

### Poland's Parliament and Political Parties – Reading the First Edition

Mikolajczyk was an important figure in the London government-in-exile, a short, 45-year-old middle-aged man, an idealist democrat, and a believer in traditional democracy. During World War I, he was the head of Polish peasant organizations and associations of self-cultivating farmers. After Poland's independence, he retired to the countryside due to disagreements with then-founding father Józef Piłsudski. From 1930 to 1935, he was a member of parliament. After the Nazi invasion of Poland, he fled to Hungary, then to France, and finally to London, where he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior in the London government-in-exile. Later, after the death of the Prime Minister of the government-in-exile, General Sikorski, Mikolajczyk became Prime Minister and personally went to Moscow to negotiate cooperation with the leading figures of the Polish National Committee. In June 1945, during the era of the first united government, Mikolajczyk served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, but was soon ostracized from the cabinet.

Unfortunately, during my few days in Warsaw, I did not meet Mikolajczyk, who was called the main pro-British and American figure in Poland. He had gone to the nearby mountains to "escape the heat." His secretary told me: "The Chairman would certainly be very willing to meet the first Chinese reporter to come to Poland, but unfortunately, he has gone to the mountains to escape the heat and is expected to return to the city before mid-August." His secretary also told me that the Polish Peasant Party is the only legal opposition party. They have consistently opposed Nazi fascism since before the war. At the current stage, their opinions are very similar to those of the government. They agree with the land reform that the government is currently implementing. As for the nationalization of factories, they advocate the nationalization of basic industries and heavy steel industries, while light industry and small industries should still maintain a free enterprise system, which is quite different from the government's opinion.

He especially emphasized that the Polish Peasant Party's foreign policy is to strive for friendship with all countries and with the five major powers, and to promote the unity and friendship of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China, so as not to give German Nazi fascism a chance to revive. He said: The Soviet Union is Poland's ally, but not the only ally. The Soviet Union helped Poland obtain land in the Oder River region in eastern Germany, which was to compensate Poland for the land it lost in the east. These views are also different from those of the current government.

This secretary of the Polish Peasant Party also told me a lot about the current situation and many feelings. He said that the basic reason why they cannot get along with the Communist Party is the different interpretations of the two words "democracy" and "fascism." Anyone who supports the Communist Party is a democrat, and anyone who opposes them with even half a word is a fascist. This is the most intolerable insult for the comrades of the "Polish Peasant Party." He said that democratic politics should have the opportunity for free criticism and free review. Monopoly and arbitrariness are definitely not democracy. Therefore, when the general election was held this year in January, the Polish Peasant Party decided not to participate in the "homogeneous" left-wing alliance, but was willing to stand on its own outside the alliance in opposition.

Through the introduction of this secretary, I met many figures from the "Polish Peasant Party." Some of the younger and more radical ones expressed extreme indignation at the Communist Party's terror and even explosive means. A friend whose name I forgot handed me a complaint about the Communist Party's control of the election and election fraud, which contained so-called "six major alterations," "thirteen fabrications," and twenty-five new ways to monopolize the election. Because I did not understand Polish, I could not understand it fully. Presumably, these complaints are the "blueprint" for the protests made by the United Kingdom and the United States to the Soviet Union in January this year.

The Polish people have now forgotten that not-very-upright election, and having become a fait accompli for more than half a year, they are gradually getting used to it. According to senior officials of the Polish Peasant Party, they are no longer willing to pursue the rights and wrongs of that election. What they need now is full freedom, the full freedom that an opposition party must have, especially in terms of speech and publication.

In Warsaw, the Polish Peasant Party has a four-page newspaper called "Ludowa," which translates into English as "People's Daily." It is the only public opinion center in red Poland today that "sings a different tune." The printing is simple, there are no pictures or photos, and the pages are full of opinions or propaganda materials. If judged from the perspective of pure journalism, the news techniques of "Ludowa" are very problematic, but the Polish people still like to read it. It is said that the censorship bureau's inspection of "Ludowa" is unexpectedly severe. Often five or six pages of news have seven or eight "windows" (blank spaces). The Ludowa published the combined Associated Press and United Press dispatch about the escape of the Hungarian Prime Minister, which was also deleted. Any sentences that touched on the Palestinian issue and were unfavorable to "Jews" were also deleted. The most wonderful thing is that one day, Ludowa published a news item that "Berlin is preparing to build a Stalin marble palace, and the raw materials are obtained from the former residence of Prime Minister Hitler," which was also blanked out. Another young Polish Peasant Party cadre believed that the Polish censorship bureau's prohibition or alteration of speeches made by their party leader Mikolajczyk in the parliament was an intolerable act of tyranny.

I told him: Young friend, please be calm and peaceful in everything, because this is "behind the Iron Curtain, no longer the Warsaw of pre-war." They told me that the former editor-in-chief of "Ludowa" has been in prison for nine months and has not yet been released.

I heard too much, and as a foreign reporter, I felt that I could not participate in their sympathy or rebuttal in the slightest. I finally asked them: "Can you honestly tell me that you are so angry, and the Anglo-American style of democracy that you expect cannot be realized immediately. Under this circumstance, just from your own intuition, do you have a life crisis in Warsaw?" The young man shrank his neck and his face sank. The older man replied to me: "The Polish Peasant Party is a legally existing opposition party. The Polish Peasant Party will not do any underground work or acts of murder. Therefore, there will be no accidental danger to life, but if another war breaks out, we will all have to take office!"

Democracy, terror, indignation, accusation, this is another corner of red Poland that I have come into contact with! (August 5th, Amrest Hotel, Warsaw)

### Dutch Government Officially Announces Acceptance of Security Council Mediation Van Mook to Return Home Tomorrow to Report on His Work

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 29th Broadcast: The Dutch government has announced that it has accepted the "general principles" of the United Nations Security Council's resolution on Indonesia. The Security Council passed a resolution on Tuesday to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute and establish a committee to investigate the clashes between the Dutch and Indonesians. The Dutch government will provide the consulates of various countries in Batavia with all kinds of conveniences to investigate and report to the Security Council on the situation in the East Indies since the United Nations ceasefire order took effect on the afternoon of August 4. According to the resolution, the Netherlands and Indonesia will each send a special commissioner, and the Netherlands and Indonesia will jointly send a special commissioner, to form a conciliation committee. However, the Dutch government stated that it does not recognize the Security Council's right to interfere in this matter, because this matter is purely an internal matter. The Dutch government also stated that it should bear the ultimate responsibility for maintaining law and order in the East Indies.

[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 29th Broadcast: Dutch-Indonesian Governor-General Van Mook announced that he is scheduled to depart for the Netherlands this Sunday to submit a report to the government on the Dutch-Indonesian situation. It is reported that Van Mook will deliver a radio address at Batavia Radio on Saturday evening, but the topic has not yet been announced. Sources familiar with the matter said that whether the Netherlands will continue to take military action against Yogyakarta, the capital of Indonesia, can be decided during Van Mook's return to the country to report on his work. Most Dutch officials hope to continue to take "security action" because they all believe that the ceasefire order of August 5 has obviously not taken effect.

[United Press Batavia, 29th] The Chinese Consulate General published a communiqué in the Chinese newspaper Sin Po regarding Jiang Jia-zhen's recent visit to Yogyakarta, stating that the Republican government seems to have recognized the seriousness of the alleged atrocities against overseas Chinese for future Sino-Indonesian relations, and has allowed preventive measures to be taken and victims to be rescued. Chinese citizens who have fled into the Yogyakarta area from various districts are now being cared for by the Chinese General Association. Food is still sufficient, but there is a shortage of textiles and medicines. The Republican government has allocated 5 million rupiah (the name of the Indonesian currency) for relief. The Republican government will no longer force overseas Chinese to evacuate and will allow refugees to return home. The Red Cross will assist the Chinese Consulate in handling the procedures for refugees to return to the Dutch-occupied areas.

[United Press Batavia, 29th] The Chinese General Association, which represents 31 cities under Dutch control, decided to send a three-person delegation to Singapore to report on the situation of overseas Chinese being harmed by Indonesians in Java and Sumatra, and to raise relief funds.

[Central News Agency Chenggong Lake, 29th] United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi recently predicted that the upcoming United Nations General Assembly will be a lengthy meeting, and he expects the session to last for three months. Lai Yi's opinion may not be based on the items on the agenda. The items listed in the provisional agenda are 43, plus another eight new supplementary items, and based on the fact that the political issues are indeed controversial.

### Anglo-Egyptian Dispute Worsens, Security Council Continues Debate Brazilian Proposal Rejected, Colombian Representative Proposes New Suggestion

[United Press Lake Success, 28th] The United Nations Security Council today rejected the Brazilian proposal to resume direct negotiations between Britain and Egypt by a margin of one vote.

[United Press Lake Success, 28th] Colombian representative López abstained when casting the decisive vote, causing the Brazilian proposal to be rejected, but then proposed a new suggestion, requesting that Britain and Egypt resume direct negotiations on the withdrawal of British troops, conclude a mutual assistance treaty on the defense of the Suez Canal, and terminate the joint British-Egyptian rule on the Sudan issue. López's actions threw the council into a state of confusion, and most diplomats were very indignant at this move, as it further delayed the meeting. The vacation scheduled to begin after the meeting on the 28th was also cancelled. The chairman immediately announced the adjournment of the meeting and postponed the debate to 7 pm on the 29th.

### Joint Announcement by US and UK Military Governors in Germany: Increased German Steel Production Approved for Annual Output of 10,020,000 Tons

[United Press Berlin, 29th] US Military Governor for the American Zone in Germany, General Clay, and UK Military Governor for the British Zone in Germany, General Douglas, today jointly signed and announced a new industrial plan for the British and American occupied zones, approving an annual steel production of 10,020,000 tons.

### Mutual Assurances Between the Pope and the US President: Determined to Rebuild Peace According to Christian Doctrine, Firmly Believing that God is the Source of Human Rights

[United Press Vatican City, 28th] Pope Pius XII and President Truman exchanged letters, mutually assuring each other of using joint means to create a world moral order and to rebuild peace based on Christian principles. President Truman's letter, dated August 5, was delivered by the US Special Envoy to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor, stating: "I am willing to do everything possible to create a moral world."

The Pope's reply, dated August 26, stated that he felt that "the vast people of the world, even in countries where speech is suppressed, also express agreement to establish lasting peace based on Christian tradition." President Truman stated: "The task we face is truly daunting, and the conditions for dealing with major post-war problems and new problems have not yet been resolved, and with them come many disappointments. Unless all moral forces now cooperate, disappointment will inevitably deepen and strengthen, and moral forces will inevitably lose their effectiveness, and the loss of moral forces will mean that the forces against and destroying this force will prevail, and the hopes and ideals of mankind are often threatened by violence. Under today's circumstances, the division of the world's moral forces, or the division of the forces of all human hopes and ideals, is often enough to hinder the world's progress." The Pope declared: "Secular society also originates from God and is an expression of nature, so secular society is a later phenomenon for mankind, and its purpose is to protect mankind and help it to properly exercise its God-given rights. When a country rejects God and does not regard it as the source of human rights, mankind immediately lowers its status and becomes some kind of slave to secular society, solely for the selfish purposes of a group that accidentally holds great power. Therefore, the task for peace-loving and friendly people today is obvious and does not need to be stated."

### British Production Increase Plan to be Announced in Mid-September

[Reuters London, 28th] The British government's plan to restrict imports to save US dollars has drawn criticism from the press and financial circles. The press believes that measures such as reducing meat rations, banning the use of private cars, and prohibiting overseas tourist travel are psychologically wrong and insufficient to guarantee that the trade deficit can be made up for. At the same time, it is understood that following the announcement of the import restriction plan, the cabinet will announce the third step of the economic emergency plan in the second week of September, which is the plan to increase exports. The Minister of Commerce, Mr. Cripps, has returned to London after his vacation and is conducting final research on the production reorganization plan. According to the government's estimates, import restrictions may only save approximately £228 million in foreign exchange annually, but the shortfall is as large as £600 million, with a remaining deficit of approximately £400 million, which can only be made up for by increasing exports. Observers generally believe that British economic policy largely relies on the support of the Empire. In the short term, Britain will purchase existing food from its dominions and colonies, and in the long term, it also relies on raising production standards in other parts of the Empire.

### Power Shortage Endangers Production: Factories Face Shutdown, Original Power Allocation Reduced by Four-Fifths, Municipal Government to Summon Businesses for Countermeasures the Day After Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper] The surge in electricity consumption in our city recently is truly alarming. According to sources from the Public Utilities Bureau: The Shanghai Electric Power Company originally allocated 54,000 kilowatts of electricity to various factories. However, due to the increasing electricity consumption of users, it has had to reduce the electricity supply to factories. In the past two days, users' electricity consumption suddenly surged, resulting in the electricity supply to factories being reduced by four-fifths, reaching 42,000 kilowatts. Only 12,000 kilowatts of electricity remained for factories in the area, causing various factories to suddenly enter a state of shutdown and unable to produce. In order to maintain production, the heads of various factories will collectively petition Mayor Wu in the coming days. The Public Utilities Bureau was extremely anxious after learning of this situation, believing that the power shortage has reached its most serious stage. If this continues, the consequences will be unimaginable in the future. The only way to solve the problem is through conservation. The bureau is now actively drafting specific measures for saving electricity. Mayor Wu has also scheduled a meeting for 4:00 PM on September 1st, gathering representatives from various power companies, industrial associations, the Sixth District Textile Industry Association, the China Textile Company, the Fuel Management Committee, the Industry and Commerce Supervision Office, and the Social Affairs Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, and other relevant agencies to mutually discuss specific methods for increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, so that they can cooperate with each other and overcome the difficulties safely.

### Mutual Aid Association of Administrative Yuan Colleagues Sends Letter to City Council Supplementing Insider Information on Group Corruption

[Our Newspaper] The City Council received a letter yesterday signed by the Mutual Aid Association of Administrative Yuan Colleagues, stating that since the exposure of the corruption case involving the directors of the Administrative Yuan and their groups, Administrative Yuan employees have become targets of attack and abuse. They are extremely indignant and hope that various law enforcement agencies will thoroughly investigate the inside story of this major corruption case, so that the few special classes who wield power and amass wealth through corruption can appreciate the dignity of the law. They are unwilling to conceal or protect the dark secrets of their own agencies. Based on their conscience, they will supplement one or two relevant pieces of inside information:

Arbitrary Appointment of Private Individuals

(1) Regarding personnel matters: Li Rongguang, the director of the Personnel Office of the Administrative Yuan, is a confidant of Li Zhuomin. The appointment of employees has no standards. If approved by Li Zhuomin, there is no need to have a university degree, and one can be appointed as a specialist, such as Liu Dingbang in the Deputy Director's office. Another example is a female temporary employee of the Finance Department, who was hired with a base salary of 400 yuan due to nepotism.

Distributing Materials for Personal Gain

(2) Distribution of Materials: According to regulations, after receiving materials shipped from abroad, the Distribution Department and various responsible units should reasonably distribute them according to the needs of various places. However, in reality, it is often the case that those near the water tower and those with power receive materials out of turn and distribute them based on personal relationships. (3) Motor Vehicle Management Office of the Administrative Yuan: The current deputy director, Fang Longzhang, is a confidant of Chen Guangyuan. He was previously reported for corruption and transferred by Chen to the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau. Now he has returned and is driving around the entire city every night with his girlfriend in a Jeep.

Renting Out Employee Dormitories

(4) Employee Welfare: All power is controlled by Pang Yuanlong, the chief of the Welfare Section, who is a confidant of Xu Shichang. During his tenure, he rented out the space in the employee dormitory in Hongkou Rui Li for two shi of white rice per room per month, and pocketed all the proceeds. (5) Medical Office: The current director of the office, Liu Debo, is the wife of Xu Shichang and has no medical knowledge. She sells the Western medicines she receives on the market and then buys domestic products to replace them. (6) Regarding the previously exposed case of the Administrative Yuan's barge being handed over to merchants for management and deducting commissions:

Although a representative of the Administrative Yuan spoke, claiming that the fee for these ships was collected at a 25% discount, which was a preferential measure for transporting UN relief supplies, what they were referring to was not the 25% discount itself, but the fact that there were commissions in addition to the 25% discount.

Fabricating False Accounts for Electric Fans

(7) Electric Fans: In the case of the sale of 20,000 electric fans, the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau only collected payments for 14,000 fans. It is difficult to understand where the remaining 6,000 fans came from. The bureau is currently rushing to fabricate false accounts to prevent inquiries from various parties.

The truth about the above points will inevitably come to light one day. In addition to our deep sorrow and indignation, we have briefly listed them and respectfully hope that members of society will supervise them.

### Someone Willing to Provide Evidence of Electric Fan Malpractice

[Our Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office received a confidential letter yesterday from the High Prosecutor's Office, stating that it could provide conclusive evidence regarding the electric fan malpractice. The letter has been handed over by Prosecutor Huang Shouguang to Prosecutor He Huimin for reference. According to Prosecutor He, the case was originally intended to be concluded in the short term. However, due to the discovery of new evidence, the investigation time cannot be extended.

### Seven Tax Officials Interrogated: Deny Corruption and Malpractice

[Our Newspaper] Fourteen tax auditors from the Direct Tax Bureau were ordered to audit the accounts of seven lumber companies, including Guan Zhang Wanli, and are suspected of corruption and dereliction of duty. The Ministry of Finance has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter. The director of the bureau found that seven people were heavily suspected, including Wang Yunlu, Gao Shijie, Xie Siyu, Yu Maojie, Zhang Baoping, Yang Renzheng, and Zhang Daqiao, and sent them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation with a letter on the evening of the 28th. The contents of the official letter were extremely brief, and the facts and evidence of corruption will be sent later after they are collected. After receiving the case, the District Prosecutor's Office assigned the suspect, Wang Yunlu, a clerk in the sixth section of the bureau, to Prosecutor Huang Daping, and the remaining six people, including Gao Shijie, to Prosecutor Zhu Xijun. After a round of interrogation, all seven denied extortion and malpractice. Because the suspects are heavily suspected, they were detained according to the law. It is reported that after the evidence from the Direct Tax Bureau is sent, the informant will be summoned to the court to confront the suspects and actively launch an investigation.

### City Council Receives Another Letter Reporting Malpractice by Tax Officials Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The City Council received two more letters from citizens yesterday reporting malpractice by personnel of the Direct Tax Bureau of this city. According to a telegram from Nanjing, the information on the clerk extortion case collected by Political Commissar Lei Zhendong was presented to the Minister for reference on the 28th.

### Speculation Fails: Impersonating Officials to Defraud Goods, Case Involves Others, Heavenly Conscience Discovered and Surrendered

[Our Newspaper] Zhou Mengbai, who once served as the chief clerk of the Guizhou Finance Department and a cashier at the Farmers Bank, recently suffered a setback in speculation. He impersonated an official of the Land Administration Bureau and ordered 93 large and small iron pipes worth 79.15 million yuan from Zhengan Hardware Company at 507 Beijing Road. On the 30th of last month, he fraudulently obtained the bill of lading and extracted the iron pipes from the Maigen Road Station. He then transported them by truck to Renyu Dyeing Factory, intending to sell them. The owner of Renyu Factory, He Mouxin, refused to accept them, so he transported them by collapsed car to Cao Boyin's home for storage. At this time, Zhengan Hardware had already discovered the fraud and notified the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration. The Police Department of the Administration immediately stepped up its investigation and obtained Zhou's cousin, Zhou Jiyao, and the receiver of stolen goods, Cao Boyin, who were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for detention. Zhou Mengbai discovered his heavenly conscience and surrendered to the District Prosecutor's Office. The District Prosecutor's Office released Zhou Jiyao and Cao Boyin. Zhou Mengbai directly confessed to the fraud, claiming that he resorted to this tactic because of his failure in speculation. He was detained by the District Prosecutor's Office and will be prosecuted for fraud.

[Another Dispatch] Today is Mr. Du's sixtieth birthday celebration. Because the current situation is difficult, Mr. Du is unwilling to be extravagant.

Only cash gifts will be accepted from Mr. Du's relatives and friends, and all theatrical performances and banquets have been canceled. Today, the Heng Society will only prepare vegetarian noodles at the Lido to entertain guests.

### Temporary Economic Inspection Meeting Resolves to Thoroughly Investigate Cotton Yarn Transactions and Study Unified Vegetable Prices

[Our Newspaper] Prices have recently fluctuated again. The municipal government held a temporary economic inspection meeting yesterday. After the meeting, the mayor reported the following resolutions: (1) Cotton Yarn: Immediately establish a yarn and cloth group to strictly investigate the transaction of cotton yarn. The emergence of the black market for cotton yarn is actually due to the illegal transactions between yarn factories and yarn shops. It was decided to thoroughly investigate the details of their revolving transactions. (2) Rice: Rice prices have risen slightly in recent days. The Social Affairs Bureau has been asked to distribute as much as possible. In addition, new grain will be available in two weeks, so it is firmly believed that rice prices can be stabilized. (3) Cooking Oil: Please assist the Customs to strictly prohibit smuggling of oil-containing goods to the south. At the same time, the Central Trust Bureau has prepared to ship a large amount of raw oil to Shanghai from Qingdao, so there is absolutely no need to panic.

(4) Pork Problem: The most difficult problem is that the weather is hot, the mortality rate is high, and there are frequent wars in the Jiangbei production area, making transportation inconvenient. The Central Bank has been asked to provide special loans to the pork industry. In addition, the city has recently discovered pork scalpers, and the relevant authorities have been ordered to thoroughly investigate. (5) Vegetables: The wholesale price of vegetables has only increased slightly. The reason for the high prices is due to the resale and price gouging by vendors. The authorities are studying how to crack down on this and how to unify prices.

### "Shen Bao" Scholarship Fund: Hoping for Support from All Sectors; Heartfelt Letter from a Middle School Student: Facing the Imminent Misfortune of Dropping Out

Yesterday, our newspaper received a letter from "A Middle School Student, Shen Wenhua," recounting the plight of civil servants' children, each word filled with tears, evoking deep sympathy. The original letter is recorded below:

"I am the eldest son of a father with six children, only seventeen years old this year, and a high school sophomore at a 'renowned' middle school. My father is a law-abiding civil servant. Of course, the income of an average civil servant is not enough to even achieve basic 'sustenance.' Now that school is about to start again, we six siblings—one in junior high, three in elementary school, and the youngest sister still in infancy—require a total of over four million yuan for tuition. How can a 'law-abiding' civil servant possibly afford such exorbitant educational expenses for his children? Because of this problem, my father is constantly worried, seeing that five of his older children will soon face the misfortune of dropping out of school. How can he not be saddened?

Since learning about your newspaper's continued operation of the 'Reader Scholarship Fund,' a new hope has been rekindled in my disheartened soul, and the 'dawn of life' has reappeared in my future. Every day when the newspaper arrives, the first thing I do is read about the scholarship fund. Now, with a sincere heart, I earnestly request the benevolent people of society to give us greater assistance and more relief, so that we, these pitiful students, may have the opportunity to study and advance."

Yesterday, our newspaper received the following donation report:

### Remains of American Air Force Martyr Discovered; Buried in Huangcun; Seven Died Bombing Japan; Body of Last Member Transported

[Report from our newspaper] On May 19, 1942, General Doolittle led a flight squadron to bomb the Japanese mainland for the first time. A total of eighty pilots participated, with seventy-three survivors and seven martyrs. The bodies of six of them had already been found, but the body of one remained undiscovered. Yesterday, Colonel Kenner, the head of the American Military Anti-Japanese Remains Preservation Office, announced that the remains of this martyred pilot had been discovered by staff members of the office in Huangcun, 450 miles southwest of Shanghai. The deceased was Sergeant Facker, and his grave was discovered by American military intelligence personnel behind enemy lines during the war. They immediately drew up a map and telegraphed the Army Department. Staff members of the Remains Preservation Office followed the map and finally reached the destination. The grave was on a small hillside overlooking the fields, with a flat stone tablet bearing only the insignia of Air Force wings. When the pilot's body was first discovered five years ago, it was identified only by a gold ring with his initials and a leather glove with a name tag hanging on his chest. The body has now been transported to Shanghai by sea and land, escorted by an honor guard to show respect for the fallen hero. Colonel Kenner also said, "We now announce with the greatest respect that the last member of the Doolittle flight squadron has returned. The reason why most of the pilots who landed in the occupied areas were able to escape safely was due to the heroic rescue of the Chinese farmers and intelligence personnel, who provided food and clothing and disguised the American airmen, sending them to safety through small paths."

### Mobile Clinic Serves the Poor and Sick; New Life Women's Association Converts a Truck; Stipulates Work at Three Stations in the City

[Report from our newspaper] Starting September 1, a mobile clinic will be seen in the city providing free service for patients. This clinic is run by the Shanghai Women's Work Committee of the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee. At yesterday afternoon's press conference, Mrs. Huang Zhuoqun, the chairman of the committee and wife of Mayor Wu, said, "The poor are pitiful, but those who are poor and sick are even more pitiful." This is one reason why the mobile clinic came into being.

This mobile clinic was converted from a broken-down truck given to the Women's Work Committee by the Municipal Government. The interior is not only filled with medicines, but also equipped with a sickbed, two stools, two running water basins, a refrigerator, tables, chairs, a commode, etc. Although the equipment is not much, it is sufficient to cope with ordinary medical care. If there are critically ill patients or those with serious illnesses, there are stretchers ready to be carried immediately into the hospital. The clinic is currently scheduled to work at three stations: Mondays and Thursdays at Daxilu, west of Yidingpan Road; Tuesdays and Fridays at the intersection of Jiangling Road and Haifang Road; and Wednesdays and Saturdays between Central Xizang Road and Lafayette Road, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon each day. This may be extended depending on the situation.

A Bridge Between Rich and Poor

The vehicle has one doctor, two nurses, and workers. When they arrive at a station, they prop up a large umbrella on the roadside to provide patients with a place to rest while waiting for treatment in the shade or sun. Before starting work, they use a loudspeaker to report to passersby that they are there to see patients. In the afternoon, the clinic does not drive back to the garage to rest, but goes to various schools and organizations to provide treatment and preventive measures for rash eye disease.

The Women's Association currently has only this one mobile clinic, but they call it the first mobile clinic, meaning that they hope there will be a second and a third coming one after another. However, they are not yet sure about funding. In addition to the 30 million yuan already spent on assembling the vehicle, the estimated monthly medical expenses are at least 30 million yuan. However, the Mayor's wife said that with their enthusiasm for serving the community, she believes this difficulty can be overcome. She said, "The Women's Work Committee is a bridge to take some of the money from the rich and use it on the poor." She believes that there are many ladies in society who are enthusiastic about public welfare, but they may not know how to help. The Women's Association is responsible for this liaison work.

### Prayer for Rain and Sacrifice by Jumping into a Pool Fails to Save Zhejiang Province from Drought!

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 28th

For more than a month, Zhejiang Province, which relies on agriculture, has not received a drop of rain. It is the time when crops are growing, and they will be scorched to death. With great difficulty, we hoped for some "before the chariot rain" on the eve of the ancient lunar seventh month and seventh day. Who knew there wouldn't be half a cloud in the sky? After the Double Seventh Festival, we fully expected some "tear-shedding rain," but we didn't see any. In recent days, there has been heavy thunder and haze on the horizon, but the rain is still stingy, drifting down only a few scattered drops. Wenling, Leqing, Wukang, Yuhang, Haining, Hangxian, Lin'an, Tonglu, Shangyu, Ninghai, Linhai, Ruian, Shengxian, Xianju, Chongyang, (Wuyi, Yin County, Fenghua, and other counties have successively reported drought conditions to the province. At the same time, farmers in these counties are making a last-ditch effort to rescue the crops. It is pitiful that they have not been educated by the times and can only ask the Bodhisattvas to bestow sweet rain. Like Wenling, in addition to praying for rain from the dragon, Chen of Beizha fasted, bathed, burned incense on the 18th, and went to the Dragon Pool, throwing himself into the pool in an attempt to win the emotions of heaven. In Linhai, Rong Qizhuang entered the city to pray for rain and used steel locks to lock the throats of eighteen living people. They had to wait for the "Dragon King" to send rain before they could open the locks. Although those who were locked up were bleeding and in excruciating pain, they could only endure it to show their spirit of serving the public. If the heavens do not send several days of rain quickly, the unprecedented drought of Zhejiang in 1924 will reappear. If a drought really does occur, it will not only affect Zhejiang Province, but the entire Jiangnan region along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line will also be severely affected.

Drought Relief Tools Ineffective

The reporter braved the autumn heat and went to various places in Hangzhou on the 21st, and then went to various places along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line on the 23rd and 24th to investigate the actual situation of the countryside after a long period of sunny weather without rain. The rice seedlings in these places had already grown to a foot tall. Because of the sun exposure for the past month or so, the lovely green color has turned brownish-green. The leaves have not yet set seed, and the fields are all dry. Some of the fields are slightly moist. Families in the countryside with cattle have the cattle dragging water-lifting carts all day long. Families without cattle have both adults and children stepping on waterwheels. Large windmills that use wind power to lift water can also be seen everywhere. Although this area is a water town, there is not much water left in the streams and canals. Some farmers build small dams out of mud to enclose the water in the dams to facilitate water lifting. It looks like the water will soon be drained. Large rivers and streams can of course benefit the areas close to the fields, but those far away cannot enjoy the benefits. I asked the farmers what would happen if it didn't rain again. They said, "There's nothing we can do. We can only go and ask the Dragon King Bodhisattva. In the past, the Qing Dynasty officials would think of us common people. When there was a drought, they would go to ask the Bodhisattva on our behalf. The officials today haven't done any of that. Aren't you angry?" With a feeling of both laughter and tears, I told them that the government was already thinking of ways, but they just smiled and walked away as if they didn't believe it. I looked at their current drought relief tools, such as water-lifting carts, waterwheels, and windmills, which are old things from hundreds of years ago. It is pitiful that they cannot get new knowledge and still silently abide by the established rules.

Quickly Send Cadres to the Countryside to Relieve the Drought

When the reporter returned to Hangzhou, I learned that the provincial government had consulted with the Executive Yuan to prepare machine pumps for water extraction, and at the same time ordered the counties to quickly replant miscellaneous grains in areas that could not be salvaged. These are of course necessary measures. But what the countryside is now longing for is "speed," and for the government to send people down to comfort them, guide them, and correct them. They cannot just put on a show of "hereby ordered" in the yamen to handle so-called official business and think that is enough. These are important topics and a great test of whether administrative personnel can serve the public. If they can send a large number of cadres to the countryside to relieve the drought, then I believe the drought can still be saved. Originally, on the eve of a sowing season, the government should always think about what to do if a drought occurs this year! What to do if a flood occurs? What to do if an insect plague comes? A set of plans and a set of measures should be prepared. If the weather is sunny for more than ten days, they should be worried about a drought. If it rains for ten days, they should be worried about a flood. They should immediately send personnel to the countryside to conduct practical investigations and supervise. The common people will not forget this concern.

Serving the Public Depends on This

We are not blaming the government officials, the "people's servants," here, but only recognizing that this is the minimum true official business that should be done. We see the lovable and pitiful farmers, who still have to "sacrifice themselves by jumping into a pool" and "lock their throats." Can't our officials, who proclaim to serve the people, go down to the countryside to supervise them? Can't we use the spirit of the farmers to save today's drought?

"The people regard food as heaven." The urban people of China rely on farmers for food, and the rural people of China rely on heaven for food. Now is the age of science. Ignoring everything and blindly relying on heaven for food will be eliminated by the times. We hope that everyone can wake up and save the drought, save the farmers, and save themselves!

### Bloodshed in Xiganglu Town Gambling Arrest: Chairman Chiang Orders Investigation; Perpetrator Squad Leader Under Youth Army Custody

[Our Newspaper Wuxi 28th Dispatch] Following the bloodshed that occurred during a gambling arrest in Ganlu Town on the 29th of last month, Chairman Chiang learned of the incident and took it very seriously. He immediately instructed his adjutant's office to direct the Ministry of National Defense to investigate. Subsequently, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng dispatched Qian Xiemin, an inspector from the ministry, to Wuxi to conduct a thorough investigation. He went to the town on the 23rd of this month to conduct an on-site investigation. Representatives from the police bureau and the Youth Army, as well as the local town head and senators, provided oral reports on the situation at the time. He returned to the city that evening. According to Qian, he told reporters that this trip to the countryside clarified the long-standing issue of responsibility, namely, "Who fired the shot that killed the person?" Evidence provided by Ganlu Town residents, local administrative personnel, senators, and the militia captain proves that Wan Fengquan, a member of the Dangkou Police Precinct, was shot and killed by the military. However, it has not yet been determined whether the shooter was a platoon leader or a squad leader. Yang and Li are currently in the custody of the Youth Army authorities pending punishment. The report has been sent to higher authorities for review by a special envoy. Yao Bingxun, commander of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, happened to be inspecting various locations when the incident occurred. Upon learning of it, he expressed his deep regret and telegraphed the Wuxi Police Bureau to express his apologies. He also sent a one million yuan condolence gift to Officer Wan. Qian left for Suzhou the night before to investigate the issue of the murderer. Once completed, he will return to the capital to report on his mission.

### A Major's Quartermaster Privately Hoards Military Weapons: The Garrisoned Gendarmerie Team in Wuxi Discovers the Weapons; The Source and Destination of the Weapons Are Under Detailed Investigation

[Our Newspaper Wuxi 28th Dispatch] Song Liangyu, a major quartermaster at the Logistics Headquarters 119th Garrison Warehouse outside Dongmen Pavilion Bridge in Wuxi County, took advantage of his position several months ago to steal and sell more than 300 long and short firearms. After the 9th Gendarmerie Regiment learned of this, Song was arrested and handed over to the Ministry of National Defense for legal action. Later, Song Liangyu confessed to the Ministry of National Defense that the firearms were obtained through collusion with his colleague, Liu Yangzhi, a major staff member. The 9th Gendarmerie Regiment was ordered to continue the investigation. They discovered that Liu was hiding in Zhongcang Town outside Guangfu Gate, and was frequently associating with accomplices Liang Dizhu (lieutenant colonel deputy station chief of the 83rd Garrison in Yangzhou), Tang Xiaoping, Zeng Xingsheng, Zhu Jixing, and others. Furthermore, Liu and others had recently been spending lavishly and acting strangely. On the evening of the day before yesterday, a large number of gendarmes were dispatched to search Liu's residence at No. 77 Gan Deli. They first found two short guns. At the same time, the town militia, having heard the news, also went to assist. Two disassembled light machine guns were found in a downstairs room, and three were found in a wood shed upstairs. All were brand new Japanese weapons with serial numbers 649, 2965, 10717, 539, and 662. Scattered explosives were also found at No. 11 Tutong Road in the city. As the evidence was conclusive, Liu Yao Amao, Tang Suping, Liang Digui, Zhu Jixing, and the guns and ammunition were taken to the regiment for interrogation. It is speculated that the privately hoarded firearms may be part of a large-scale arms trafficking organization, but the source of the weapons and whether the targets of the sales are related to communist bandits is currently under investigation by the gendarmerie regiment.

### Too Much Dribbling, Not Enough Shots; Xingdao Suffers Another Defeat; 5-1 Loss to the Athens Representative Team; Li Zhaorong Scores in the First Half

[Reuters London 28th Dispatch] The Xingdao Football Team played its second match in England against the Athens League Representative Team tonight. Ambassador Zheng Tianxi once again attended the game. As a result of poor shooting skills and a lack of decisive shots in front of the opponent's goal, they suffered another defeat with a score of 1-5. The Xingdao team, fighting against a strong opponent on a hard ground, showed superior ball control, positioning, and general technique. However, when approaching the goal and about to shoot, their movements were too slow and hesitant, and they were often intercepted by the opposing defense. The individual performance of the Xingdao team was most outstanding in the goalkeeper Yu Yaode. Critics said that his skills were no less than those of professional players in England. Center forward Zhu Yongqiang was very active, but the two inside forwards Li Zhaorong and Zhang Jinhai were restrained by the opposing defenders Top and Ryder and were unable to show their skills. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie, but in the second half, Xingdao collapsed and conceded four goals. The opposing center forward Phillips scored three goals alone. The only goal scored by Xingdao was made by Li Zhaorong.

Xingdao's formation, dribbling, and general strategy were almost on par with the Athens team, but when approaching the goal, they were too cautious, and were repeatedly intercepted by the opposing defense, with no opportunity to shoot, resulting in a loss. They should not dribble slowly, otherwise, with no forwards to assist, they will miss the opportunity. This is something the team should learn.

In the whole city, Wang Yuyi absorbed more than 1,200 boxes, with an opening price of 1.5 million yuan to 2.2 million yuan per dan, and the market atmosphere slightly revealed softening. For other colors, exporters are still watching, but suppliers are also hesitant, so the process is still in a state of scarce entry and exit, and the signs of change are minimal. As for various domestic sales teas, the situation throughout the day was generally the same as the previous day. Chen Jiu Cizhen eyebrow tea rose again due to the scarcity of goods.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Both Fall

It is strictly forbidden for non-industry personnel to trade any other materials, and those who do so will be regarded as hoarding and profiteering and will be severely punished.

### Numerous Stored Goods Flood the Market, Chinese Stocks Trend Weak

Yesterday, many holders of Chinese stocks rushed to sell, and although there was some activity in the middle, there were many small players, but in the end, the tight money situation and the return of off-site materials affected people's morale, and the market was still weak near noon. When the market opened in the morning, it was tired because of the substantial increase in exchange with the National Bank before the holiday. Although Dieyong Yarn once rose to 259 yuan after opening, it soon fell to 251 yuan. The British pound also fell slightly, falling to 249 yuan. After 10:00, it rose slightly to 251.3 yuan.

### Paper Merchants Association Representatives Petition the Import and Export Control Commission

Zhan Peilin, chairman of the Shanghai Paper Merchants Association, accompanied Chen Maoxun, a member of the foreign paper import group, and Zhou Zirui, a member representative, paid a visit to the authorities of the Import and Export Control Commission yesterday to petition for five points:

(1) The second item of the second public notice stipulates that "goods shipped before August 16, 1936 that have not obtained an import permit may be registered with the registration section," but in fact, foreign manufacturers had already loaded goods in inland ports and Haikou before August 16, and their berths had been scheduled in advance, and international shipping lines would take half a month or more to start sailing. Although Shanghai importers were ordered to stop loading by telegram, it was impossible to change, and the Commission should consider the facts and allow the shipping deadline to be extended to the end of September. (2) For all goods registered in accordance with the new regulations, it is requested that import permits be issued as soon as possible so that taxes can be paid and imports can be made, in order to alleviate the difficulties of industry and commerce. The registration deadline is stipulated to be August 31, but due to the time required for foreign mail and telegrams, it is easy to exceed the deadline. It is respectfully requested that the deadline be extended. All those who can provide sufficient documents should be allowed to make supplementary registration in order to complete the registration procedures. (4) In the registration form, there is a column for detailed explanation of the source of foreign exchange. It is found that the source of this self-provided foreign exchange is extremely complicated, including pre-war balances, commissions, post-war balances, commissions, and miscellaneous payments from various customers. If proof is provided for each item, it seems to be difficult in fact, and it is respectfully requested that a modification be allocated to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. (5) A portion of the quota allocation for the first period of February, March, and April, and the second period of May, August, and July, is still awaiting the issuance of import permits, and therefore cannot be settled. It is requested that the official price be used for settlement to show fairness.

### Banking Industry Requests Exemption from Special Business Tax

[Reported by this newspaper] The Banking Business Association of this city convened a standing council meeting on the 26th. After discussion, it was decided that the central government recently stipulated that a special business tax of 4% should be levied on the industry from May 1 of this year. On the one hand, the business tax for the first half of this year from the municipal finance bureau is also about to be paid, which seems to be a duplication. Therefore, it was decided to jointly request the central authorities to exempt the special business tax with the Money Business Association and the Trust Industry Association.

### US Exchange Rate Remains the Same, British Exchange Rate Falls

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the exchange rate market price was approved by the Foreign Exchange Equilibrium Committee. The benchmark price of the US exchange rate remained the same at 38,500 yuan. The benchmark price of the British exchange rate was again reduced by 3,000 yuan to 117,000 yuan.

According to people close to Chen, Chen is expected to attend the meeting next Monday.

### Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Adjusted Again, 20-Count Yarn is 11.5 Million Yuan

[Reported by this newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee has adjusted the negotiated price of each count of yarn again from the 29th as follows: 10-count yarn 8.09 million yuan, 16-count yarn 10.22 million yuan, 20-count yarn 11.5 million yuan, 312-count yarn 15.18 million yuan, 40-count yarn 17.09 million yuan, 42-count double strand 19.69 million yuan.

Yarn Factories Should Pay Foreign Cotton Yarn

The Textile Adjustment Committee limited the payment of 6,000 pieces of government-supplied foreign cotton yarn from private yarn factories in the country for the first quarter within the next two days. The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association has allocated the payment in proportion according to the amount of foreign cotton obtained by each factory in the first quarter. The purchase price is calculated according to the new negotiated price of 11.5 million yuan yesterday, but 9.7 million yuan is paid first for each piece, and the shortfall will be settled after the cotton yarn is paid in full.

Large-Scale Yarn Dump

In addition: Liu, the deputy governor of the National Bank, ordered the Textile Adjustment Committee by telegram yesterday to order private yarn factories to continue to sell cotton yarn in large quantities today in order to stabilize yarn prices, and ordered the Textile Construction Company to open and sell Longtou fine cloth in large quantities today, and to allocate a huge amount of cotton yarn again next Monday.

Strengthened Control

In addition: According to a person in charge of the Textile Adjustment Committee, the "Plan for Developing the Textile Industry and Adjusting the Supply and Demand of Yarn and Cloth" was submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the 15th of this month for review by the All-Economic Council. The All-Economic Council could have passed it at its regular meeting the day before yesterday. However, in view of the recent soaring prices of yarn and cloth, the reason for which is mostly speculative manipulation, and that stabilizing yarn prices requires strengthened control, the articles of the plan are quite strict on control, so it was decided that the responsible heads such as Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Yu Hongjun, and Zhang Jia'ao would jointly review them before submitting them to the next meeting for discussion.

Fangjian Sells Yarn

[Reported by this newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Adjustment Committee as usual yesterday, and because the 27th was a holiday, which happened to be Wednesday's yarn selling day, all customers who should have purchased cotton yarn on that day could still purchase it yesterday. Therefore, a total of 4,524 pieces of jointly allocated cotton yarn were distributed yesterday, equivalent to 6,900 pieces of 20-count yarn, and there were a total of 1,822 application forms. 693 of the forms belonged to the jointly allocated A group of native yarn, and a total of 2,306 pieces were allocated. The B group allocated a total of 2,218 pieces of yarn, and there were a total of 130 application forms.

Yarn Prices Turn Weak

Yesterday's cotton yarn market, the opening market once called high, but because the Textile Construction Company listed and sold as usual, and temporarily increased the allocation quota for household numbers, the chips suddenly became abundant, and under the condition of oversupply, the market turned from strong to weak. As a result, the price of fine yarn fell more than the previous day, while the price of coarse yarn had ups and downs. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 600,000 yuan lower, the price of 20-count Special Double Horse rose by 100,000 yuan, and the prices of Light Double Horse and 16-count Guangming both fell by 100,000 yuan.

The actual market price was also 100,000 to 150,000 higher than the previous day, and the opening price for sending to the factory in the afternoon was 2.27 million to 2.4 million.

In addition: The Zhaohua Wheel Company's Ross ship arrived at the port yesterday morning, carrying 3,000 tons of cotton from South Africa, a total of 15,600 pieces, which are now being unloaded at the Gonghexiang Wharf.

### New Regulations Just Issued, Tobacco Loans Temporarily Suspended

[Report from this newspaper] According to sources speaking to this newspaper: After the principle of purchasing domestically produced tobacco leaf loans was approved by the Joint Treasury Board, Chinese merchants in this city requested loans of 50 billion yuan from various factories, to be underwritten by the China Farmers Bank. The foreign-owned Yizhong Tobacco Company requested a loan of 25 billion yuan, to be underwritten by Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, Shanghai, and Citibank. The principle of allocating the loans is purely based on the usual dealings between each tobacco factory and each bank. The main focus of this loan for purchasing tobacco leaves is on the tobacco leaves produced by tobacco farmers supported by the China Farmers Bank in Tanxian, Shandong, and Xuchang, Henan. Therefore, the focus of the loan is on the China Farmers Bank. Now that the government has issued new exchange settlement and trade measures, state-owned banks are temporarily suspending loans, so the China Farmers Bank's tobacco loan is also suspended. As the four commercial banks, including Zhejiang Industrial Bank, had already signed tobacco loan contracts with Yizhong Tobacco Company, they have been disbursing loans one after another. However, it is reported that the loans disbursed are purely from the banks' own funds and have not been rediscounted or re-mortgaged with the Central Bank.

### The Post-Victory Joint Annual Conference of Scientific Societies

— Liu Xian

The joint annual conference of seven scientific organizations, including the Science Society of China, the China Society of Natural Sciences, the Chinese Astronomical Society, the Chinese Geographical Society, the Chinese Meteorological Society, the Chinese Zoological Society, and the Chinese Anatomical Society, is scheduled to be held in Shanghai from August 30th to September 1st. In addition to reading papers and giving scientific lectures, the agenda includes discussions on "Ways to Improve Science Education in China" and the two special topics of "Atomic Energy and Peace." The conference will also include exhibits of Chinese scientific publications and domestically produced instruments. This grand joint annual conference of the long-silent Chinese scientific community is truly encouraging. I would like to express my feelings and offer my congratulations.

The practice of holding annual conferences by Chinese scientific organizations has a long history. Speaking of the Science Society of China, this is the 25th annual conference. The other societies vary in their number of conferences, but the holding of joint annual conferences has been practiced since before the War of Resistance. For example, in 1935, a joint annual conference of six academic organizations was held in Guangxi, and in 1936, a joint annual conference of seven scientific organizations was held in Beiping. At that time, foreign aggression was intensifying. This joint annual conference is the first since the victory, and it is being held in Shanghai, China's largest city and a hub for Chinese and Western cultural exchange. Its uplifting spirit and the morale of the people should be different from that of 1936. Moreover, at the beginning of national reconstruction, with everything waiting to be done, its significance is far greater than before the war. Therefore, we cannot but have considerable expectations for this conference. Let me elaborate on them.

First, before the War of Resistance, scientific research in our country was quite promising, with talented individuals emerging in large numbers and remarkable achievements being made. Since the outbreak of the war, many scientific institutions have been destroyed by the enemy. Those that were fortunate enough to relocate to the interior were almost isolated from the world due to environmental factors. Books and instruments could not be replenished, and research and publication were practically at a standstill. Two years have passed since the victory, but scientific research remains stagnant. This is due to the government's lack of attention and society's lack of emphasis, leading to this situation. The joint annual conference should take collective action and loudly appeal to the government to pay attention and awaken social support, so that scientific research, which is related to the country's prosperity, will not be delayed for a long time and ignored.

Second, at the beginning of national reconstruction after the victory of the War of Resistance, there is a chorus of economic construction, national defense construction, industrialization, agricultural improvement, three-year plans, and five-year plans. In our view, any material construction or modern plan without a scientific foundation is just empty talk and useless words. We should seize this opportunity of the joint annual conference to gather experts from various scientific fields, bring together many talented individuals, learn from each other, brainstorm ideas, discuss a scientific construction plan in detail, provide suggestions to the government, and implement it step by step, with the goals of improving people's livelihoods, strengthening national defense, and contributing to academic research, so that our country can become a prosperous, strong, and modern nation in the world within ten or twenty years.

Third, to seek scientific progress, we must rely on the improvement of science education. The annual conference's proposal to "Improve Science Education in China" is commendable as it addresses the practical needs. I hope that the participating experts will share their views and find several effective ways to meet the needs of this time and place. As for "Atomic Energy and Peace," it is indeed a topical proposition, but given the immaturity of atomic physics in our country, it is not enough to discuss it. World peace is in the hands of those who hold the secret of the atomic bomb. Without scientists, there is no way to talk about peace. From our perspective, we naturally hope that atomic energy can be used for peaceful purposes to benefit humanity. We hope that our government can pay attention to the research and equipment of atomic energy as soon as possible, so that our outstanding atomic physicists can have a place to use their talents. At the same time, once the secret of atomic energy is made public, we can immediately utilize it and avoid falling behind forever.

The above three points are all humble opinions. I sincerely hope that the members attending this conference can sweep away the past passive mentality and participate in this first post-victory joint annual conference of scientific societies with a new era of enthusiastic spirit and make contributions!

### New Uses for Plastics

— Zhenliang

Sand and mud are the most annoying things for oil extraction. They hinder the flow of oil, water, and air, causing various difficulties and affecting oil extraction. Recently, American engineers have invented a new method to prevent sand and soil from mixing into oil wells: using plastics to solve the difficulties caused by sand and mud.

The method is to inject liquid plastic into the oil well, and the sand particles in the well are glued together by it. When the plastic gradually solidifies upon cooling, the sand particles are trapped, and oil can be extracted freely.

The United States is now using this new method extensively to increase the percentage of oil extraction. Other countries are also following suit.

### Antu

— Bao Zhongqi

——One of the Scientific Dictionaries——

ANTU is the abbreviation of Alpha-nap-tlryl thiourea, commonly translated into Chinese as "Antu," a new rat poison invented by the United States during the war.

Antu is a gray powder that is extremely toxic. One pound can poison 200,000 rats. Humans will not die unless they swallow a large amount.

The discovery of Antu was an accident. Six years ago, when Dr. Richter in the United States was testing the taste sensation of humans and mice, he unexpectedly found that a small particle of Plienyl th-iourea (the raw material of Antu) had no significant effect on humans, but it poisoned six rats to death the next day. Dr. Richter then focused on this discovery and produced Antu.

Mice have sensitive senses, and it is difficult to lure them with ordinary poisoned bait. The slightly flavored Antu raw material cannot be detected by mice, which avoids the above shortcomings.

### The Strategic Position of the Arctic

— Song Liwu

The importance of the modern Arctic region does not lie in its ability to provide the world with a new colony, because the polar climate is not entirely suitable for human life without special equipment. Moreover, the land area of the Arctic Ocean is minimal, and even if there are some islands scattered around, the ground is covered with ice and snow, making it unsuitable for human settlement and activity. However, around the time of World War II, the countries concerned have intensified their attention to the construction and research of the Arctic, especially the United States, the Soviet Union, and Canada, which have spared no effort in investing massive financial and human resources to engage in the development and national defense construction of the Arctic region. The motive is due to the importance of its transportation and strategic position and its abundant resources.

Most of the world's continents are concentrated in the high-latitude zone of the Northern Hemisphere, and the Arctic is located in the center of the continents. The distance from the Arctic to any continent is shortened. For example, the air distance from Greenland to the industrial area of northeastern United States is only 4,300 kilometers, and to the United Kingdom is only 3,000 kilometers. If you fly from Alaska along a circular route, you can reach Japan in 48 hours, which reduces the distance by 2,000 miles compared to going from the west coast of the United States. The Soviet Union's industrial center is deeply hidden in the center of the continent, which is not easily attacked by enemy planes, but if Greenland is used as the take-off point, it is only 3,800 kilometers to Moscow and 4,500 kilometers to the Ural region. If you go from Spitsbergen to various important cities in the Western Hemisphere, the distance can be further shortened. It takes less than 12 hours to fly to New York, and bombers can fly to London in 7 hours. In this atomic age, there is no distinction between front and rear in combat. The northern gates of the world's major industrial countries have been opened since the value of the Arctic was discovered. The countries concerned are occupying advantageous strongholds, and they all want to establish military bases on remote islands that no one cares about in the icy and snowy land. As former US Army Air Force Commander General Arnold Yun said, "If World War III breaks out, the center of the world's strategy will be in the Arctic." Therefore, the term "polar strategy" has been widely adopted by the world and has been put into practice. For example, the United States built the Alaska Highway, expanded the air force base in the area, and opened radar aviation stations, so that the range of giant bombers can reach most areas of Europe and Asia. The army, navy, and air force are constantly conducting large-scale polar combat exercises to deal with enemies invading from the north in the future. Externally, it signed a joint defense agreement with Canada. The bases built in Greenland during the war have not been abandoned to this day, and there are plans to purchase the island. Last year, there was also a proposal to ask Iceland to join the United States, in order to consolidate its northern defense line. The Soviet Union is even more active. In addition to its national defense facilities, which we know little about, in other areas, such as the current dispatch of 170 ships, 200 aircraft, and 450 engineering teams, 40 weather stations are being rushed to build in the Arctic region to conduct full-scale research and development of the Arctic region. In recent years, it has repeatedly proposed to Norway a plan for joint defense of the Spitsbergen Islands, attempting to establish naval and air bases in the area, and to establish a submarine base on Bear Island at its southern end. In 1936, a stronghold was established far to the north at 80 degrees 45 minutes north latitude on Crown Pr. Rudolf Land. Soviet planes exploring the Arctic circle all took off from this island. Activities were temporarily suspended in 1942 due to the Soviet-German War, but resumed on May 9 this year.

The Arctic Ocean route is difficult to navigate in winter due to freezing conditions, but the northwestern European ocean in Norway and northern Soviet Union is ice-free all year round due to the influence of warm currents. Murmansk, located at 69 degrees north latitude, is an important warm-water port in the Soviet Arctic Ocean. During the Soviet-German War, supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States were imported from here. In summer, the Arctic Ocean coast of North America and Asia is barely navigable for three months, but the large amount of floating ice and icebergs in the sea greatly hinder the navigation of ships. However, the east-west distance on the earth's surface is the longest at the equator and shortens as you go north. For example, the marine connection between the European part of the Soviet Union and the port of Vladivostok is far away if it passes through the Indian Ocean, which is far from the shortcut through the Arctic Ocean. Therefore, the Soviet Union has established the Northern Sea Route Administration, equipped with powerful icebreakers to guide the ships. From Murmansk along the edge of the continent, you can directly reach the port of Haishengsui, which is 10,000 kilometers long.

### Aerial Color Photography

— Cai Zhiwei

Aerial color photography was an important new weapon of World War II. It was far superior to black and white photography because color photography could see through the techniques of artificial camouflage. After airplanes and aerial photography were used in World War I, strategists began to use artificial camouflage, painting cannons, armories, aircraft hangars, and storage depots with strange marks or light colors. Roads and highways were covered with nets and branches, or coarse cloth and painted canvas. When enemy reconnaissance planes took black and white photos from the air, camouflage experts cleverly hid military engineering projects, and even concealed the movement of large numbers of troops.

During World War II, airplanes were camouflaged in various ways. Aircraft hangars were located in bushes and covered with many leaves. From the air, one could not see any suspicious signs. Factories, warehouses, train stations, and all important buildings lost their original appearance, replaced by fake shapes and roofs. However, due to the invention of color photography, many camouflage methods quickly lost their effectiveness and value. Color photography is like an eye with divine power, which can see through the mask of camouflage. The depth and lightness of colors can be clearly distinguished, and it also gives people a sense of depth, that is, it can distinguish the three sides of length, width, and height.

The first aerial color photograph was taken by the editors of the American "National Geographic" magazine and published in the September 1930 issue. Therefore, its history is very short, only 17 years so far. It was not until 1936 that the US Army Air Corps further studied aerial color photography.

Initially, when taking photos from the air, the speed of the aircraft had to be slowed down to within 100 miles per hour, otherwise it would be blurred. Later, due to the improvement of the film, high-speed lenses could be realized. Now, the speed of the aircraft is more than two miles per hour, and the results are also satisfactory.

In the past ten years, the art and science of aerial color photography have made significant progress. It was an important new military weapon in World War II. However, it is conceivable that it will soon become a commercial weapon and will be widely used in human construction. It may no longer be used to help humans destroy, but will be a scientific product that improves human welfare.

### General Situation of the China Society of Natural Sciences

— Chen Bangjie, Ren Meie

The China Society of Natural Sciences is one of the largest comprehensive scientific organizations in China. It was established in 1927 and has a history of 21 years. In these 20 years, thanks to the efforts of its members, the society's affairs have grown day by day. Currently, it has more than 2,000 members, including various parts of pure science (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geology) and applied science (engineering, agriculture, medicine).

The head office of the society is located in Nanjing, and the address is in Central University. There is an office in Shanghai, located at 20 Weihaiwei Road. In addition to the head office, branches have been established in the United States, the United Kingdom, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Beiping, Lanzhou, and Xi'an.

The purpose of the society is to popularize scientific knowledge and promote scientific research. In an environment of financial difficulties and difficult material conditions, we have always done our best. The popular science publication "Science World" published by the society has now reached Volume 16, Issue 8, and has not been interrupted during the War of Resistance. There is also an English journal, Acta Brevia Sinensia, which was jointly established by the British Council and the society. Initially, the manuscripts were printed in China and then sent to London for publication. The journal is now printed by the society and has been changed to a quarterly journal. It is one of the comprehensive scientific journals in Western languages published by Chinese scientific organizations. Furthermore, in view of the close relationship between science and national defense, the society has been compiling national defense science books since 1938, which are published by the Commercial Press. More than a dozen types have been published. In addition, we compile science news every week and send it to the Central News Agency for distribution to major newspapers.

In addition to publications, the society has organized scientific expedition teams to Sichuan, Xikang, and the Northwest. In Zunyi, Guizhou, we once tried to conduct scientific performances, performing in local middle schools, which was very popular among students. We believe that this kind of work is the basic work of popularizing scientific knowledge. We often hold scientific lectures in Shanghai and Nanjing. In Nanjing, we held academic broadcasts at the Central Broadcasting Station to enhance the general public's understanding of science. In addition, we are preparing to establish a laboratory in Shanghai and a botanical garden in Nanjing to serve all sectors of society.

Science is endless. The past work of the society is naturally very limited, but our creed is to work hard and diligently, twenty years as one day. We also hope that people from all walks of life who are familiar with science will give us more guidance and support.

[Zheng Shigeng, MinGuo Road asks] Why are express telegrams sometimes rejected?

The destinations of express telegrams in this bureau are not universal throughout the country, only in 15 places: Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Taipei, Chongqing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and Yinxian. And from September 1st, it was ordered to open Bengbu, Huaining, Yangzhou and 13 other places. Also, express telegrams are limited in time (from the time of sending to the time of delivery is only two hours). It is heard that if the line is slightly obstructed, the acceptance will be stopped immediately to maintain the efficiency of the express telegram. The letter did not note the date and place of dispatch, so there is no way to verify. If there are no line obstructions, this bureau will never reject express telegrams that are sent daily. [Mr. Ye, Yongjia Road asks] What are the locations of the new telephone booths and what services do they offer?

In order to facilitate the public's telegrams, this bureau has set up four telephone booths at the North Railway Station, Longhua (blank) Airport, Confucius Temple Park, and Nanjing Road Bund. Handles telegram sending and receiving services. The daily office hours are 9-7, and holidays are temporarily not open. This small telecommunications bureau is equipped with a public telephone for people to borrow. This bureau plans to add five more telephone booths in front of the Golden Grand Theater, Tilanqiao, Zhongshan Park, Nanjing West Road, and Beidang Road. We are currently discussing with the municipal government and relevant bureaus, and once the negotiations are completed, they will be opened one after another.

### A Eulogy for Chairman Du's Sixtieth Birthday, with a Preface

— The Entire Staff of Shenbao

It is said that the benevolent are sure to live long lives, a saying that is proven by the ancients; and love is especially fervent among the masses. Our Chairman, Mr. Du Yuesheng of Shanghai, possesses a loyal heart and a chivalrous spirit, with a bright and open mind. He delights in resolving difficulties and settling disputes, worthy of praise like Zhu and Guo; he constantly shows concern for the poor and needy, in accordance with the ways of Yuan and Chen. Moreover, when it comes to managing wealth, he is on par with Duanmu; when it comes to patriotism, even Xian Gao cannot match him. In times of national crisis, all doubts are dispelled; when he exerts his abilities in the local community, there is no cause for alarm. It is fitting that his influence should spread throughout the land and his reputation flow for thousands of miles! This year, August 30th marks Mr. Du's sixtieth birthday. Eulogies pour in like strings of pearls, and cheers resonate through the streets, wanting to kick the earth and shake the heavens. Everyone agrees that this man is destined for longevity. Gong Zhan and others, fortunate to be among the last to associate with him, have long admired his noble character and are deeply encouraged by this auspicious occasion. Therefore, we present this eulogy:

Tall pines of a thousand feet, verdant and lush; sturdy cypress trees embrace, like pavilions standing tall; the green and deep, a harmonious blend; sweet rain nourishes, sharing the same fragrance; closely we follow Duke Du, a hero among ten thousand; enriching oneself while benefiting others, the hearts of all, both Chinese and foreign, lean towards him; celebrating his sixtieth birthday, his fame startles the world; entrusting him with matters, he spares no effort in management; discerning right from wrong, he always adheres to fairness; a single word from Lu Zhonglian, instantly settles disputes. Recalling his service to the nation, he was tasked with the westward expedition; recovering lost territories, never betraying his integrity; the nation celebrates this joyful occasion, his nature shines like the evening star; ushering in a new year, a new cycle of sixty years begins; pearls and jade fill the hall, talents emerge prominently; how to please his parents? We offer wine with respect; how to please the guests? We play music with zithers and flutes. Though my talent is shallow, I cannot repay his kindness; I offer this clumsy poem, as a sincere tribute. May the noble gentleman be happy and live a long life! Respectfully congratulated by Pan Gongzhan, Shi Yonggeng, Chen Xunbo, Wang Yaoqin, Wang Xianting, Wang Qixu, Bu Shaofu, Zhao Junhao, He Xiya, and others from the Shenbao on this auspicious day in August of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China.

Chunqiu

### Words on Mr. Du Yuesheng's Sixtieth Birthday

— Zhang Shizhao

The nation's Eastern Expedition and the eight-year war initiated an unprecedented battle situation. Manpower and resources were exhausted. Eventually, the weak controlled the strong, the clumsy defeated the skillful, retreat was used to lure the enemy forward, and delay was used to exhaust them. After hundreds of battles, a complete victory was suddenly declared. The victory was also a rare and unprecedented spectacle. Why was this so? Upon reflection, I believe that the key lies in the will of the people: sincerity can move mountains and rocks, and when the hearts of the people are united, no enemy can be defeated. The so-called strength, weakness, skill, clumsiness, advance, retreat, delay, and urgency are merely tactical maneuvers to drive the will of the people towards the goal. However, the will of the people is like the wind, elusive and difficult to grasp. When it arises from humble beginnings, who would have predicted the earth-shattering power that would emerge from it? Therefore, it is said that nothing is swifter than the wind in moving all things. To revitalize the nation and lift the fallen, nothing is more effective than the will of the people. It is said that there are instruments for observing the wind. How can there be no instruments for observing the will of the people? Where are these instruments? They are in a few gentlemen. This truth was once lamented by Zeng Wenzheng.

Therefore, when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred and the nation was in turmoil, within three months, the enemy forces swept across thousands of miles, becoming unstoppable. Thus, a stalemate ensued for eight years. Eventually, the powerful enemy suffered a crushing defeat and surrendered unconditionally. This was achieved through the utmost effort and skillful guidance. Who are these few gentlemen? Upon reflection, I believe that these people do not necessarily hold positions in the court or the military. Whether they step forward or remain in the background, they are secretly relied upon by the people. Their mere presence inspires confidence, and those who follow them feel as if they are returning home. Their influence extends far and wide, and those who gain their support feel as if they have gained an entire nation. In ancient times, there were figures such as the Two Elders of Zhou, the Four Worthies of Han, and, coming down to Wu Guang's rebellion, Ju Meng. None of these were lacking in selection. If one were to ask the average person about such figures in this war, I dare say that they would say: "In the early stages of the war, he was in Shanghai, and Shanghai was secure; in the middle stages of the war, he was in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong was important; in the final stages of the war, he was in Chongqing, and Chongqing was stabilized." If not for my friend Mr. Yuesheng, I would not know how to name him.

Mr. Du earned his reputation for chivalry early in life. However, the principles of chivalry generally involve keeping one's word, being resolute in action, being sincere in promises, not being driven by others, helping those in distress, not boasting about one's abilities, and being ashamed of flaunting one's virtues. People may or may not be aware of the urgency of the times, and Mr. Du has excelled in these principles for the past twenty years. However, if one were to summarize Mr. Du's entire life in this way, it would fall far short of the mark. Mr. Zhang Qianruo is a noble scholar who said to others, "I do not know Mr. Du. I imagine him to be a brash and arrogant figure, isolated from the world." However, I recently met him somewhere and talked for about two hours. His words covered a wide range of fields, including politics, society, and literature. He was as humble as a Confucian scholar, almost unmatched. This is truly amazing! This is why Mr. Du is who he is. He deserves to be listed among those who maintain the moral fabric of society and whose influence spreads like wildfire. This is the truth, not the other. Consider that many chivalrous figures of the past have ended up with ruined reputations and failed to live out their lives. However, Mr. Du's virtue and age have both increased, and his reputation and well-being are both thriving. He carries the hopes of the world because he has moved away from chivalry and immersed himself in Confucianism. The two phrases that Confucius spoke of, "correcting his righteousness without seeking his profit, clarifying his principles without calculating his achievements," are what Mr. Du embodies and practices. In the seventh month of the summer of the Dinghai year, Mr. Du reaches his sixtieth birthday. In this year of national rejoicing, how can we not celebrate it? I, Shizhao, being ignorant, dare to step forward from the end of the guests to describe the great and far-reaching aspects of his public and private relationships, as above.

### A Toast to Mr. Du Yuesheng on His Sixtieth Birthday

— Zhang Yiqu

A round, bright moon hangs in the sky, while officials at the banquet offer jade goblets.

The world praises his boundless generosity, and everyone admires his talent as a pillar of society.

Feng Gong hoped to enter his gate, and the sound of bells echoed from the Shu Road into his dreams.

Today, Mr. Du is comparable to Lord Huang Xie, with three thousand distinguished guests attending.

### Composed and Offered as a Blessing on Mr. Du Yuesheng's Sixtieth Birthday, the Year of Jiazi, the Seventh Month of Dinghai

— Lü Baihua

Reaching far back into the past, I trace the footsteps of Emperor Yao,

Leading an expedition south, standing apart from the crowd!

Knocking at the gate, there is a law of the crowing rooster,

Treading lightly, who can craft the words of a leopard's transformation?

The world's finest talents follow Guan Zhong,

And among men, the mortar and pestle are revered like Wu Jun;

After returning from the Eastern Feng ceremony, he can greet with a deep bow,

Gazing at the majestic peaks, a cloud of Jiazi.

### Morality Originates from Sentiment

— Tao Xisheng

For Mr. Du Yuesheng's Sixtieth Birthday

Morality is the expression of genuine feelings. The ethical norms that maintain society are morality, and the backbone of morality is sentiment. We can also say that the sincerity of sentiment is righteousness, and the full expression of nature is morality. Morality maintains social order.

During the War of Resistance, I had the opportunity to befriend Mr. Du Yuesheng, and I came to know that Mr. Du's strength was in the places where the national power could not reach, serving as the nation's network and the pulse of society. When Shanghai became an isolated island, Hong Kong fell to the enemy, and the sea defense, Guangzhou Bay, and Macau were closely monitored by the enemy, those who were stranded in these places and could not reach the rear, or those who wanted to reach the rear but were blocked, or those who were pursued by the enemy and urgently fled back to the motherland, could all realize their wishes and serve their country and the war effort as long as they entrusted themselves to Mr. Du. This national network and social pulse are both intangible and tangible. The tangible aspects are the organization and the methods, while the intangible aspects are morality and sentiment. When a person's life and family are about to be trampled upon and killed by the enemy, whether they know Mr. Du or not, as long as Mr. Du knows them, as long as they entrust their lives and families to him, they will surely receive Mr. Du's help. Mr. Du is not skilled in rhetoric, nor does he have enough time to plan everything for everyone who entrusts their lives and families to him, but Mr. Du's genuine feelings are expressed as profound morality, which makes everyone trust him. Therefore, wherever Chinese people live, even in places where the national power cannot reach, they can receive his help.

"Do good without seeking reward" is Mr. Du's principle. Based on this principle, what he has done has not earned him a resounding name. Everyone knows Mr. Du, but few can list one by one his contributions to the nation and the country. If one knows Mr. Du well, one will certainly not list one by one his contributions to the nation and the country as a basis for praising him. Today, on the auspicious occasion of Mr. Du's sixtieth birthday, I would like to point out that morality and sentiment are intrinsically linked. This can be said to be a correct understanding of Mr. Du. I believe that friends who truly understand Mr. Du will have the same feeling.

### A Preface for Du Yuesheng's Sixtieth Birthday

— Chen Bulei

The interaction between people and society is merely a relationship of giving and receiving. Observe the merits of society by what it gives to everyone; observe the merits of a person by what they give to and receive from society. It goes without saying that society gives. If one receives from society but gives nothing, that is called being selfish; if one is stingy with what one gives, that is called being miserly; giving and receiving are in balance, that is called being average; receiving less but giving more, that is called serving the people. Since the beginning of mankind, people have used this to judge characters. Those who are eager to do public good and love righteousness, outstanding talents of the nation, are rare among thousands. They are talented and knowledgeable, but they do not boast about themselves, they always dedicate themselves to the country. Mr. Du Yuesheng of Shanghai is different. Mr. Du started from humble beginnings, without relying on any connections. Through his own efforts, he achieved success. He benefits others without seeking personal gain. He supports those who are in need, helps those who are poor, mediates for those who are wronged, and helps those who are struggling. He has contributed greatly to the community and the nation. Those who have benefited from his actions cannot be counted. Mr. Du's character is generous and upright, like the so-called chivalrous figures of the world. However, his appearance is gentle and his attitude is humble. He is open to a wide range of people and speaks with increasing sincerity. He often seems dissatisfied with himself. When someone praises him, he always says, "Stop, this is not worth mentioning, why bother!" Therefore, his extraordinary actions often go unnoticed, and what is known to the public is probably less than one-fifth of what he has done. I have been in Shanghai for a long time and have long admired Mr. Du's virtue. Once, I met Mr. Du, and he sympathized with my weakness. He helped me through countless difficulties, and his kindness is unforgettable!

August, the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Although it is said that the entire team likes him, Father Ma always glares at him whenever they meet, only giving him scraps. He makes jokes about his marksmanship. At a thirty-yard target, he has the ability to smash the wooden legs supporting the target, but can't even touch the outer ring of the target. However, he has a special talent: adaptability—a plan for every glance. He is also very perceptive; before people speak, he can guess what they are thinking. Therefore, every time he leads a squad to fight guerrilla warfare, he has never failed.

The other one, nicknamed "Loud Hearted Trumpet" - although a trumpet, it couldn't be blown loudly - because he rarely speaks two sentences in a year. People who don't talk much are usually very cunning and ruthless, but Wu Rui is honest and straightforward, and extremely kind. In terms of martial arts, he is well-versed in Xingyi Quan and has also practiced Eagle Claw Kung Fu, but he never hurts people without a reason. Although he doesn't speak, he always has a smile on his face, using his smile to convey his thoughts.

Not long after these two rushed back to the old village, Yaoqun and Little Tiger also entered the first fence.

This was quite a grand and lively scene. Although Yaoqun had only been in the old village for about a year and was a guest, she had made many substantial contributions: camouflage devices against aerial reconnaissance over the entire gorge, a new organization for the reconnaissance team, continuous communication in the valleys, biogas lamps, water pipes, medicine, sanitation, disease prevention, schools for children, etc. She had introduced many new arrangements. She was also able to apply new strategic methods to command guerrilla warfare; every time she attacked, she showed bravery. Her treatment of people was also so modest and amiable. Such a person with moral character and knowledge was naturally considered a "hero" in the eyes of everyone in the old village, young and old, male and female; moreover, she had now become an official.

In the village, Little Tiger originally only admired three people: his uncle, the Dragon King; his maternal grand-uncle, Father Ma; and his mother. But since Yaoqun arrived, Little Tiger could be said to be "like a comparison"; like the Monkey King who wreaked havoc in the Heavenly Palace meeting the Bodhisattva Guanyin of the South Sea, showing her utmost respect and obedience; "Aunt Ji is truly a celestial being, she knows everything I'm thinking!..."

When Yaoqun and Little Tiger arrived at the old village, the lively welcoming scene that unfolded from the first fence was even more lively than usual when a team returned from guerrilla warfare; all the people in the village, old and young, men and women, lined up along both sides of the main road leading into the village, with faces full of admiration and smiles; shouting, calling out, praising, and complimenting: "Look, that's what real talent is... A young woman in her twenties has become an official in Beijing... She's both cultured and martial, she can handle anything!..."

When Yaoqun and Little Tiger saw this scene, they jumped off their horses from afar and handed the horses to the welcoming grooms, greeting "Hello everyone" as they ran into the village. The biogas lamps and electric lights (i.e., gas lamps) at the second fence were lit exceptionally. Fifth Master, Little Tiger's mother, and many others with status and positions were waiting at the fence entrance.
