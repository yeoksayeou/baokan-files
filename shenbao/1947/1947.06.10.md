### U.S. State Department Officially Announces Opening of Trade with Japan; Private Transactions to Resume from Mid-August

[United Press International, Washington, 9th] The U.S. State Department and the War Department, in order to accelerate Japan's economic recovery and reduce the post-war burden on U.S. taxpayers, issued a joint announcement stating that private trade between the U.S. and Japan will resume on August 15th. Private business representatives will be permitted to go to Japan under a quota system to directly trade with Japanese manufacturers and purchase Japanese products. Up to now, all of Japan's foreign trade has been handled by the official U.S. Commercial Company, which purchases Japanese products to the U.S. and sells them by auction or secret bidding. The proceeds are handed over to the War Department to offset the costs of purchasing food and raw materials since Japan's surrender. According to recent estimates, Japan owes the U.S. $200 million on this account. State Department officials said that they hope this new plan will, after enabling foreign merchants to contact Japanese producers, also stimulate foreign investment in Japanese enterprises. This investment could be facilitated through sales of raw materials and commercial credit loans to Japan, with goods to be delivered in the future. It is expected that the resumption of private trade will have a significant impact on Japan's post-war recovery and the stability of Far Eastern trade. The joint announcement also stated, "Allowing foreign business representatives interested in trade development to go to Japan can help establish a genuine supply and demand relationship between Japan and other Far Eastern countries."

The plan presents the following points: (1) Foreign business representatives can contact Japanese manufacturers without restriction; (2) Allied controls will be reduced to a minimum, consistent with the objectives of the occupation forces; (3) All measures cannot be considered final before September 1st, in order to give foreign companies an equal opportunity at the start, with those who already have offices in Japan. For the time being, due to residential restrictions, the facilities afforded to private trade representatives will be limited to 400 people in the first phase. Officials further explained, "Currently, any merchant can choose to purchase the Japanese goods they need. The Japanese Trade Bureau will, based on the situation in Japan, pay the manufacturers in Japanese Yen at a fair price. Foreign merchants will remit U.S. dollars or other common foreign currencies to Allied Headquarters as payment for the exported goods. The prices will be determined based on the fair value of the world market. Allied officials will use these funds to purchase raw materials for use by the Japanese people. The announcement also stated that all transactions completed by private negotiation should be licensed by the Japanese government and approved by Allied Headquarters. "As long as Japan remains in its enemy status, the maintenance of controls is, of course, necessary, but some of these controls should be lifted as soon as possible in all circumstances before the signing of a peace treaty."

[United Press International, Tokyo, 10th] General MacArthur issued another announcement today, calling for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, and praised the resumption of private trade with Japan on August 15th as a partial opening of the economic blockade against Japan. The text of the announcement is as follows: "The resumption of private trade with Japan on August 15th is necessary. Otherwise, [the Japanese] may starve. Although this partial step has been taken, Japan's economy remains very precarious. The only thorough solution is to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, not only for Japan but also for the world."

### Japanese Exchange Rate Temporarily Undetermined; Number of Commercial Representatives from Each Country to Be Determined by the Far Eastern Commission's Trade Bureau

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th, United Press International dispatch] When 400 foreign representatives are expected to begin trading with Japan, the exchange rate will not be fixed. It will be decided after the circulation of various goods is relatively adequate. Headquarters stated that at the beginning, any arbitrary exchange rate would be unrealistic and detrimental to the handling of certain matters, due to the inconsistency of prices within Japan, and the fear of limiting the overall volume of trade. The 400 merchants coming to Japan can have unrestricted contact with Japanese manufacturers. Also, General MacArthur's headquarters personnel will reduce control over commercial agreements and will not participate as much as possible. The allocation of the number of commercial representatives from each country will be determined by the Allied Trade Bureau of the Far Eastern Commission. The hotel, transportation, and communication of the representatives in Japan will be handled by Japan, but food must be imported and all must be paid for. Japan will also provide banking, international telecommunications, insurance and other facilities as soon as possible. The prices of goods will be determined by headquarters experts according to world market prices. However, foreign merchants can still discuss prices with Japanese manufacturers. In addition, in order to enable merchants to conduct preliminary negotiations, Headquarters is currently planning to permit exchanges regarding transactions, including special rights to exchange samples. Furthermore, in order to avoid improper profits during the initial rush period of Japanese trade, it is stipulated that no transactions may be concluded before September 1st. However, transactions negotiated privately will be licensed by the Japanese government and made effective by Headquarters, but Headquarters will not directly participate in the matter, but will be handled by the purchaser and the newly reorganized Japanese Trade Office.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] British diplomatic and business circles in Tokyo are adopting a cautious attitude towards the measures announced by General MacArthur. They point out that the most important factor, the international exchange rate of the Japanese Yen, is still regarded by some as not feasible at present. However, they all feel that the restoration of Japan's foreign trade relations is a positive step in any case. The Japanese reaction to this measure is generally "welcoming, but suffering from a lack of goods to sell, so hoping to obtain loans first."

### Japan's Textile Industry Revives; We Urge All Countries to Pay Attention

Great Repercussions Internationally

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The revival of Japan's textile industry, which is sufficient to affect our fragile foundation, has caused great repercussions internationally after it was pointed out by an economic expert. The United States is also paying close attention to this and has expressed its willingness to provide us with assistance in terms of machinery and talent. At the same time, our government has also, through diplomatic channels, prompted the relevant countries to pay attention to this matter.

### We Need Power Plants; Hope to Obtain Them from Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch] A certain Chinese reparations representative told a Central News Agency reporter today that China hopes to obtain a large number of power plants from Japan as reparations in order to supplement China's broken power industry. He said: China's power industry is in very poor condition. The power supply in major cities averages only 30% to 50% of the pre-war supply, resulting in power outages and insufficient power, which affects other industries. Most of China's original power plants were destroyed by the war and cannot be repaired. In addition to the fact that some factories with power generation equipment were dismantled and transported out by the Japanese, most of the machinery is dilapidated due to lack of maintenance during the war. According to the same source, China's current power industry equipment is all dilapidated and remaining. Taking only Shanghai, which currently has the best power supply situation in China, as an example, the total loss of power during the war is said to be approximately 112,800 kilowatts, which is about half of the total pre-war power generation. Furthermore, the operating conditions of power plants in Tianjin, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Shenyang, and Chongqing are all precarious. The reparations representative believes that Japan should, in reason, compensate China with a considerable number of power plants. He explained that the relocation of various industries will reduce power consumption, and that Japan's power industry is not being fully utilized because the number of factories currently in operation is quite small. Judging from existing industries, Japan does have some surplus factories. According to the temporary reparations plan, it was originally planned to have about 20 power plants divided among the four countries. However, the reparations list is currently being revised, and it is unknown whether the number of power plants stipulated in the temporary reparations plan will increase or decrease.

### Our Country's Wartime Losses; Preliminary Statistics Completed

Details Not Yet Ready

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The person in charge of the Reparations Commission stated on the 9th that the figures for our wartime losses have only completed preliminary statistical work. Although the reports on our wartime losses published in various newspapers are similar to the preliminary statistics of the commission, the details have not yet been prepared. The losses in the Northeast, Hebei, Shandong, and other areas occupied by the Communist army are not included, and therefore cannot represent the full picture of our country's wartime losses. Even the reported provinces and cities still need to be reviewed by the commission before they can be used as final statistics.

### MacArthur Orders Compilation and Reporting of Machinery Seized by Japan from Factories in South China; Japan Seeks to Reduce Burden of Reparations

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Allied Headquarters recently ordered the Japanese government to compile a report on the whereabouts of a large number of machines and tools transported from steel plants in South China and the Kowloon Steel Plant in Hong Kong when the Japanese army occupied Hong Kong. This equipment includes valuable machines such as lathes, planers, motors, and electric furnaces.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] The Japanese government is outwardly extremely compliant with the issue of reparations, but in reality uses various methods to reduce the burden of reparations. The General Federation of Labor, led by the Socialist Party, has also recently formed a "Reparations Countermeasures Committee" to study various issues related to reparations. It is reported that three principles have been decided: (1) To investigate and study the equipment related to maintaining the minimum living standards of the people in the reparations factories designated by General MacArthur, and request General MacArthur to postpone the dismantling. (3) To explain the actual situation of the first two items to the society as much as possible and arouse general attention.

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] General MacArthur's Headquarters announced today that General MacArthur recently received instructions from the Far Eastern Commission that when selecting factories of the Japanese government, financial groups, and large merchants for transfer as reparations, three points should be "considered": (1) Security must be guaranteed and industrial disarmament must be achieved; (2) The general priority of the countries requesting reparations; (3) The legitimate needs of Japan's peacetime economy.

Preliminary negotiations were held on the afternoon of the 5th and it was decided to begin the inspection immediately, but no inspection report has been sent out yet. The news that the inspection team has arrived in Dalian, etc., should be incorrect.

### Democratic National Construction Association Has Not Joined the Democratic League

Li Zhuchen Solemnly Declares

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] Li Zhuchen recently told a Central News Agency reporter that he was very surprised to see in the newspaper that Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun answered inquiries from Democratic League members in writing, stating that the members of the various parties and groups participating in the Democratic League included Zhang Naiqi and Li Zhuchen of the China Democratic National Construction Association. Li said that the Democratic National Construction Association was organized by various business and industrial figures in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War, hoping to conduct research on industry and commerce and, when necessary, make suggestions to the government, and is not a party or group in nature. When the association joined the Democratic League, the undersigned absolutely did not know, and whether or not to join various parties and groups is completely a matter of personal freedom and cannot be handled by anyone. I hereby solemnly deny joining the Democratic League to avoid misunderstandings among the public.

### Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party to Discuss Peace Plan

Xu Chuanlin to Go to the Capital to Report on His Work

[Our newspaper] The Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party was originally scheduled to meet on the 9th, but due to insufficient attendance, it was changed to the 11th or 12th. All important officials stationed in the capital will rush back on the 10th to participate. It is reported that there are two important matters to be discussed at this meeting: (1) At the Nanjing State Council meeting, it was resolved that the members of each committee should first discuss the specific methods for restoring peace outside the meeting, and then hold a meeting to make a final decision. Therefore, the Democratic Socialist Party will fully discuss this matter at this Standing Committee meeting, and then propose practical methods for restoring peace in the name of the party. (2) Some positions within the party have become vacant due to the withdrawal of reformist personnel, and new candidates will also be decided at this Standing Committee meeting.

[Our newspaper] As soon as Xu Chuanlin receives the appointment letter from the government, he will go to the capital to take office. When asked by reporters whether he had any important cases to bring up, he replied that the current important tasks are: first, to reform politics, especially local politics, and strive for integrity to alleviate the people's suffering and increase stability; second, to rectify military discipline, starting with improving the treatment of soldiers. However, these are only principles, and how to implement them requires collective wisdom. As for the issue of restoring peace talks, it is extremely complex and he dare not comment lightly.

### Yang Yuzi of the Democratic Socialist Party Discusses His Views on Universal Suffrage

[Our newspaper] Yang Yuzi, a member of the People's Political Council of the Democratic Socialist Party, came to Shanghai from the capital on the morning of the 9th. When asked by reporters about his views on universal suffrage, Yang said that he hoped that the various parties and the government could first consult and stipulate the proportion of representatives of each party. It would be more reasonable for the Kuomintang to occupy the largest number, and for the China Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and people of virtue to each occupy a certain quota. Otherwise, the Kuomintang has the advantage of 20 years in power, and this is the first general election. If there is completely free competition, other parties will have no chance. Zhang Junmai's date of departure to the capital has not yet been determined, but the government hopes that he will go to the capital before the People's Political Council to discuss matters, so it should be possible to arrange it in the short term.

[Our newspaper] Leading members of the Democratic League such as Huang Yanpei and Shen Junru have returned to Shanghai one after another. Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun are currently still in the capital. It is reported that they will also return to Shanghai in the short term after the relocation of the office in the capital is completed. In addition, spokesperson Ye Mayi yesterday denied the news that lower-level personnel of the Democratic League had raised nine questions.

### Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hubei Provincial Governments Approve Contracts; American Company to Invest in Three Provinces; Establish Factories to Develop Coal Mines and Water Conservancy

[United Press International, Hong Kong, 9th] The provincial governments of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hubei have approved commercial contracts with the Pan-Yi Company, allowing the company to establish petroleum, automobile, shipbuilding, fertilizer, cement, and glass factories in the three provinces, and to develop coal mines and water conservancy projects. Bi Qinni, Chairman of the Board of the company, believes that American capital is willing to invest in China at this time, but only if Chinese capital also participates in the investment and the understanding of the Chinese government authorities and provincial governments is obtained. This plan stipulates the import of a large number of steel, dyes, factories, and industrial equipment from the United States for the industrial recovery of the three provinces, and the establishment of factories to refine tung oil and other vegetable oils, the proceeds of which can support other enterprises. Bi has also been appointed as a senior advisor to the provincial governments of Guangdong and Guangxi. During the war, he served in the Chinese army with the rank of major general and was responsible for supplying six army corps in South China.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Regarding the issue of workers' base pay, Wu Yun Chu, a member of the National Economic Committee, reported at a meeting on the 9th the views of the National Federation of Trade Unions and the Shanghai Industrial Association Joint Conference, hoping to restore pre-war base pay. Wu pointed out that workers' wages have increased from two cents to four cents. If calculated at 23,000 times, it would be equivalent to 46,000 times, which is really beyond the ability of the general business community to bear. After listening to Wu's report at the meeting, it was decided to appoint Wang Yunwu, Gu Zhenggang, Pan Xulun, and Wu Yun Chu to conduct further research on the matter and report back to the meeting.

[Another cable] In order to save foreign exchange, the authorities will reduce overseas institutions as much as possible in the future, and the number of personnel going abroad will also be reduced as much as possible. Furthermore, in the future, all agencies must obtain the approval of the Executive Yuan before using foreign exchange.

### We Will Soon Submit a Construction Plan to the United States; $500 Million Loan Will Be Agreed Upon; The Principle of Selling State-Owned Enterprises Has Been Decided

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Our country's construction plan, which was prepared to match the $500 million loan, has been allocated by the Ministry of Communications, the Resources Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other agencies according to the five-year construction plan. It is currently being copied and has been handed over to Weng Wenhao for final verification. It can be submitted to the United States within days. In recent days, reporters interviewed the persons in charge of the relevant agencies, and they all expressed confidence, saying that a concrete agreement on the loan will be obtained before June 30th, and believed that President Truman will mention this matter in his upcoming important speech. According to reports, there are two loans under negotiation between the United States and China. There is no problem with the $500 million loan in the U.S. Congress. The key depends only on whether the U.S. can agree to our country's construction plan. Another loan is similar in nature to the U.S. loans to Greece and Turkey. The current U.S. Congress does not have time to discuss it and may leave it to the next U.S. Congress to study.

### Chairman Addresses Central Memorial Week, Explaining Policy on Handling Student Protests; Government Resorted to Suppression as Last Resort

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Chairman Chiang, at the KMT Central Headquarters' Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week meeting on the morning of the 9th, delivered a ten-minute speech on the current student unrest, stating: "Investigations have revealed that the student protests in various regions are entirely orchestrated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in secret. The government, as a last resort, has adopted measures to suppress them, and normalcy has largely been restored in various areas. Regarding the Wuhan University incident, it was indeed due to improper handling by the military and police. The responsible officials have been punished accordingly. The student protests in Shanghai, etc., have been largely resolved, but the Jiaotong and Datong Universities have not yet resumed classes. This is because the professors at these two universities are still on strike. The Chairman believes that educators taking this approach is truly regrettable." The following is a summary of the Chairman's original words explaining the government's policy on handling the student protest issues:

"When this student unrest initially arose, several schools were practically in a state of anarchy, particularly in Shanghai, rendering it impossible for most teachers to teach and most students to study, severely and significantly impacting social order. Although the government repeatedly urged restraint, it was difficult to quell the unrest. In order to maintain the lifeline of the nation and the race, and to safeguard the studies of the majority of young people, the government, through a resolution of the State Council, promulgated the 'Provisional Measures for Maintaining Social Order.' The government has the responsibility to ensure the safety of the people and maintain social order. When social order is disrupted and public safety is threatened, the government cannot shirk its responsibility to handle the situation. This is true in all modern countries. In the evolution of this student unrest, the majority of students are pure and do not wish to abandon their studies. However, the CCP and a few ambitious elements are manipulating and coercing them from behind the scenes, and the signs of disruption are obvious. There are many facts that can prove this. Although the government issued the 'Provisional Measures for Maintaining Social Order,' it still upheld the principle of protecting young people and repeatedly urged school authorities and faculty to take responsibility for persuading the students and reporting any hidden CCP members within the schools, without wishing to order the military police to intervene. This has been the government's consistent policy in handling this student unrest. However, the situation in Shanghai was unique. At that time, the CCP not only incited students to strike but also incited workers to strike, businesses to close, obstructed transportation, and disrupted order. They also dispatched many special agents and professional students to various schools to vigorously agitate, using a minority to control the majority, leading from strikes to worker strikes, business closures, and even inciting the local military and police, attempting to achieve their goal of armed rebellion. To prevent the realization of this conspiracy, the government granted the Shanghai local security authorities the power to take emergency measures to cope with special incidents. As for other areas where the situation was less severe, the handling methods were still primarily focused on guidance. Therefore, the results of handling the situation in various regions were very good. In particular, the authorities and faculty in Tianjin and Beiping schools took responsible leadership, and the students were all clear about the greater good and adhered to their duties, and were able to quickly restore normalcy and resume classes.

Wuhan Garrison Authorities Mishandled Student Unrest

Derelict Personnel Have Been Investigated

However, at Wuhan University, during the military police's investigation and arrest of CCP members, there were casualties, which was truly an unfortunate incident. The school has always had an excellent academic atmosphere and has always been cherished by me. However, the Wuhan security authorities did not strictly comply with the government's orders and entered Wuhan University with armed military police without authorization, and the students who were injured and killed were not CCP members inciting student unrest. Based on the investigation report obtained by the Ministry of Education, the government believes that the Wuhan Garrison Command handled the matter improperly and should be held responsible. In addition to severely punishing the relevant personnel in the department, the commander of the command, Peng Shan, has been dismissed from his post and is under investigation. Currently, schools in various regions have restored normalcy, but a few schools in Shanghai have not yet resumed classes. Furthermore, some faculty members insist on striking, making it impossible for students who earnestly hope to resume classes to receive their education. This is truly the greatest regret in the education sector. Our country has always regarded respecting teachers and valuing education as the guiding principle of education. The government will naturally respect the reasonable demands and good suggestions of faculty members. However, teachers should not abandon their responsibility for national education by striking, nor should they fail in their duty to nurture young people. If school classes are not resumed quickly, and the atmosphere of education continues to deteriorate, what a great loss this will be to the nation and the race? The Ministry of Education should take responsible action as soon as possible to avoid harming education.

Clarify Right and Wrong, Fulfill Responsibilities, Safeguard Public Safety

In short, the government's policy in handling this student unrest is to distinguish right from wrong, fulfill its responsibilities, and prevent CCP conspirators from using beautiful names such as democracy and freedom to incite young people, disrupt society, and affect public safety and the atmosphere of education. The local security agencies that have followed orders, enforced laws, maintained local security, safeguarded the studies of young people, and diligently performed their duties, the government will naturally provide responsible protection. If there is improper handling or unauthorized actions, the government will also punish them according to law and will not grant leniency. It must be understood that the impact of this student unrest on the loss of national vitality is already incalculable. I deeply hope that all members of the education sector will place the life of the nation as the most important thing, quickly restore order in schools, so that young students will not waste their studies, so as not to fail as mentors who nurture young people."

### Organizational Regulations of the Executive Yuan's Design and Evaluation Department Announced; Responsible for Drafting Policy Guidelines

Sun Liren came to Changchun on May 30 and returned to Jinan on the 4th due to official business. This is his second visit to Changchun since taking office as Deputy Commander-in-Chief. He will visit Jilin in the coming days. Dafangshen Airport was invaded by the communist army on the 18th of last month, and the airport facilities were destroyed. Xiong's aircraft was the first to land after the repairs. Xiong told our reporter that the National Army is making careful deployments and is determined to inflict a devastating blow on the communist army in the shortest possible time. Changchun, Jilin, and Siping must be secured to await coordination with the overall counterattack against the communist army.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 9th] National troops in Changchun and Siping have been continuing to sweep the periphery for days. The communist army's First and Second Columns are still entrenched between Changtu and Kaiyuan and in the mountains southeast of those areas. The joint brigade of 500 men entrenched in Shangxia Jiucaiyu was swept away by the National Army and has fled towards Huangqizhai. The National Army stationed in Chaihebao and Nanzamu is advancing towards the communist army in Shangxia Feidi, Huangqizhai, Cangshi, and other places. The Anshan-Shenyang Railway was unable to run to Andong from the morning of the 9th, while traffic between Shenyang and Benxi continues as usual.

It was severely attacked by the National Army, suffering heavy casualties and scattering in all directions. The Yongji National Army is sweeping east and northeast along the railway, inflicting heavy casualties on the communist army in Dachaopeng and Damifang.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 9th] Since the communist army in the north invaded Changtu and Kaiyuan, Siping has been quiet for a long time. On the 8th, the communist army concentrated six divisions to attack Siping again. The situation became tense again on the night of the 8th. The defenders of Wafangdian in the south have withdrawn, and the National Army has established a defensive line south of Zhu Baotaiyue. To coordinate with the war in southern Liaoning, the communist army launched the Shuhe Offensive, with a large force attacking Chifeng from Baiweichang. After several days of fierce fighting, the defenders broke through on the 8th and shifted positions. Chifeng has fallen into the hands of the communist army again. Zhao Jiaxiang, the commander of the Shenyang Garrison, has requested to resign due to the pressure of military affairs. His request has been approved, and Commander Peng Bisheng will take over his position. The port of Yingkou is under construction for city defense works. There are few ships. The new mayor, Yang Hongda, has not yet arrived. The city's security is the responsibility of the joint military and police inspection office. Reinforcements have arrived, and there are no communist troops within dozens of miles.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The communist army suffered heavy losses in the attack on Longhua in Rehe Province. Their commander of the Fifth Brigade was killed in action. The National Army buried more than 2,000 bodies of communist soldiers, covering an area of 17 mu.

### Tieling's Terrain is Naturally Strategic; Any Communist Invasion Will Be Met with Defeat

[Central News Agency, Tieling, 9th] The communist army's southward invasion is originally a bandit-style harassment, attempting to disrupt traffic, obstruct spring plowing, loot supplies, and also to disrupt order and shake morale, with a opportunistic mentality. Once it encounters strong resistance, it changes its plans. Because it has rarely encountered serious blows in the past two weeks, it has become complacent and even boasted of attacking Shenyang. However, since the communist army fled south across the Yangtze River, its casualties have been very heavy, its troops are exhausted, its ammunition supplies are difficult, and its morale is low. It has long been on the decline. The retreat of the National Army from Kaiyuan a few days ago, daring not to follow, can serve as evidence. According to the reporter's observation, although the communist army may not have abandoned its plan to invade south, its delusion of disturbing Shenyang has approached disillusionment. Even if the communist army actually attempts to cross Tieling, the only important town north of Shenyang, I believe that this truly strategic location will surely become its own burial ground. Tieling is backed by mountains and faces water, with naturally dangerous terrain. The people of the entire county have also exerted their organizational power, working day and night without rest, making this iron ridge stronger and a steel ridge. The valiant and skilled New Sixth Army and other troops, under the command of General Liao, have made the 1.2 million troops and people of Shenyang safe and sound. The communist army, with its shouting and clamoring, has seen it and become afraid, daring not to cross the red line lightly. The market in Tieling is as peaceful and prosperous as ever. The fluctuation of supplies is minimal. As General Liao said, to protect the Northeast, you must protect Shenyang. To protect Shenyang, you must first ensure Tieling. The people of Tieling know that everyone is responsible for the major affairs of the country, so they all do their best to automatically assist the National Army. The cooperation between the military and civilians is always seamless.

### Communist Army in Shandong Province Retreated to Yimeng Mountain Area; National Army Recaptures Juxian City; Sweeping Operations Underway in Shaanxi Province Towards Baoan

On the 5th, after defeating the communist army's New Second and New Ninth Brigades, it continued to advance to Zhaoanshi City (west of Anse) and nearby areas. On the 7th, the National Army on all routes gradually approached Baoan and had reached the line of Yan Gou (35 kilometers northeast of Baoan), Lujiacuan, Baijia Aozi (10 kilometers east of Baoan), and Heilonggou. It is now actively sweeping towards Baoan.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 9th] Fierce fighting continues on the outskirts of Cangxian. The battle for the village of Shi'erhu is fierce, with the two armies locked in a stalemate.

### Communist Army Near Anyang Withdraws

[Central News Agency, Xinxiang, 9th] (1) More than 20,000 men from the communist army's First and Seventh Columns, gathered near Caiyuan, have been retreating north in succession in recent days and have reached the intermediate area of Dongtaibaicun, Zhuanglong, and Liuyuan, east of Anyang. Some appear to be crossing the Zhang River northeast of Liuhe Village. (2) The communist army's Second and Third Columns have crossed the Wei River from Wulingji (east of Tangyin), Tunziji, and northwest of Junxian and are surging east of Puyang. Liu Bocheng is said to be in Puyang. (3) After the National Army swept the periphery of Anyang, there are no traces of the communist army east to Xujiaqiao, south to Weijiaying, north to Shilipu, and west to Xiaosikong Village and Niangniangmiao. (4) The entire force of Wang Zi is sweeping towards Cuijiafeng, eliminating more than a thousand communist soldiers in Yu Cao. The reasons for the communist army's withdrawal from the vicinity of Anyang are: first, they felt that the pressure of the Northern Expedition was too great; and second, they suffered heavy losses, the soldiers' morale was low, and officers below the battalion level deserted one after another. Liu Bocheng believed that crises were lurking everywhere, and therefore withdrew.

### Satisfactory Closing of Unfavorable Meeting; Resolution Passed to Convene Annually Henceforth

We must encourage private operation and utilize foreign investment so that China's water conservancy projects can be widespread in geography and rapid in time." He said, "All my colleagues in the water conservancy sector should abide by these instructions for life, strictly observe them, maintain the good atmosphere of the past, seek higher work efficiency, encourage and motivate each other, and expand achievements, so that we will not fail the country or betray our responsibilities." Finally, he said, "There were many proposals from all parties at this conference, such as planning future water conservancy construction, enriching the basic work of water conservancy, promoting the fundamental plan for river management, and cultivating specialized water conservancy talents, all of which are fundamental plans and long-term plans, enabling colleagues in the water conservancy sector to have a common goal to work towards, which is the great success of this conference. The fact that we were able to bring together water conservancy workers from all over the country can be said to be a grand event of the time. The participation of academic experts and the detailed plans and discussions provided by the Chinese Society of Hydraulic Engineering indicate that administration and academia, government and the people, and the central and local governments have all become one, adding unlimited light to the future of water conservancy."

Cao Ruizhi, the representative of the Yitian member, delivered a response, saying: "We are very fortunate and happy to participate in this grand gathering, and the more than 200 proposals passed are not empty words, because the Ministry of Water Resources seeks truth from facts, so our joy and excitement stem from this."

### After the Chinese Communist Party Rejected the Call for Peace

Recently, the call for peace within the country has been echoing for a month. From the National Political Council to local public opinion organs, all have made such appeals. Standing from the perspective of the people, we believe that since Japan's surrender and the victory in the War of Resistance, there has been no peaceful day in the country, leading to various reconstruction and development efforts only being talked about but never implemented. Therefore, we have always sympathized with this appeal, believing that if peace can be achieved, all reconstruction and development and various difficult problems can be readily resolved. We have also pointed out that whether the current call for peace can be effective depends on the attitude of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). For the government, resolving domestic disputes through political means has always been a consistent policy. With the reorganization of the government, the newly appointed Premier Zhang Jun has also repeatedly stated that the door to peace is not closed; if the CCP is willing to lay down its arms and start anew as a political party under a democratic constitutional government, the government is very willing to reopen peace talks. Under these circumstances, we sincerely hope that the CCP can prioritize the interests of the people and enable peace to be achieved as soon as possible. Therefore, we have high expectations for the relevant peace resolutions made by the National Political Council, which represents public opinion. Because the resolutions made by the Political Council represent the entire Council, we fully believe that such resolutions, representing the will of the people, will surely win the approval of the CCP. However, what is the result we have obtained?

According to a report from our newspaper in Nanjing, although the proposal to reopen peace negotiations with the CCP was put forward by the Political Council, its realization is extremely difficult. According to the CCP's Xinhua News Agency radio broadcast received here, they have issued an informal response to the Political Council's call for peace, even denying the qualifications of the Political Council. It is claimed that the Political Council is a tool of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), issuing calls for peace while simultaneously making various resolutions that favor warfare, thus losing the true meaning of peace. At the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, the CCP broadcast insists on not taking the current government as a negotiating partner. Thus, the various appeals for peace over the past month will all become a bubble. We are neither surprised nor pessimistic about the arrival of this news. The CCP has previously stated that the last National Assembly for drafting the constitution was a tool and denied the validity of the constitution, and even declared all actions of the National Government, including foreign treaties, as invalid. Therefore, it is naturally conceivable that it would not take the National Government as a negotiating partner and further regard the Political Council, which represents various parties and factions and represents public opinion, as a tool. However, the arrival of this news cannot but give rise to the following feelings.

According to a report from the United Press in Nanjing, observers say that the CCP's attitude is not expected to affect the new peace plan proposed by the government for discussion in the State Council. This will be the government's final peace initiative towards the CCP to resolve internal disputes through political means. The government's immediate response to this is to continue drafting peace proposals. According to Interior Minister Zhang Lisheng, the government will not revise its plan as a result of the CCP's broadcast. If the report is true, we cannot but express our heartfelt admiration for the government's attitude. This spirit of tolerance should move every citizen. After the CCP has made such a statement, the government could have ordered a campaign of suppression, but the government still does not change its original intention and still tries to carry out peace talks, because it values the interests of the people and cannot bear to see lives lost and suffer from war again, so that the people can have an opportunity to recuperate and gradually seek the revival of the nation. The government's sincerity in seeking peace is so great, and the CCP's unwillingness to peace is so evident. Therefore, it can be seen that all future calls for peace should be directed to the CCP and must force them to abandon their current policies, so that peace can be achieved.

What we must also point out here is that the situation in China is actually very simple. Peace is the unanimous call of the people, and it is also the government's unchanged policy. The reason why peace has not been achieved is due to the CCP's attitude. A reporter from the United Press in Nanjing stated that "the CCP's ultimate goal is one-party dictatorship, not multi-party participation in government, which is the same as the Soviet political model in various parts of the world." Under these circumstances, achieving peace is not easy. However, the CCP only accounts for a small minority in China. The current government has expanded its base, abandoned the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang, and included the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and other leading figures, which is sufficient to represent the general public. At the current stage of the situation in China, the emergence of this expanded government is the greatest achievement. Recently, Mr. Gold, the chief editor of the Shanghai Da Mei Evening News, returned from the United States and told reporters: "Personally, I believe that the United States has no intention of supporting the Kuomintang in order to gain control in China..." It should be known that the current government is no longer the Kuomintang's government; if there is no nearsightedness or color blindness, this government needs to be supported. This is why we welcome and look forward to President Truman's statement on China policy. Domestically, we naturally cannot allow the current situation to drag on any longer; we should clarify it in a timely manner.

### Wang Fangzhuan, a Student from the First Vocational School of Hunan Province, Confesses to Arson Under the Instigation of Communist Spies, Vividly Recounting How He Was Bewitched

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 9th] The case of Wang Fangzhuan, a student from the First Vocational School of Hunan Province, who committed arson under the instigation of Communist spies, has been clarified. According to the student's confession, in September of last year, he was watching a play at the Guotai Theater in Changsha and saw a fellow audience member arguing with military police. He persuaded the military police and admired the audience member, so they became acquainted. The audience member, who called himself "Tai Laoyao" (real name not given), spoke very well and mentioned that he had a former classmate of Wang, Su Dasui, and said that Su was now serving in the Communist army and had a bright future. He also criticized the government and promoted Communist , which moved Wang's heart. Wang was bewitched. Xiong used his insidious scheme, first using seduction, saying that he would introduce Wang to a girlfriend and showed him photos. Wang was indeed moved and wrote love letters, which were all delivered by Xiong, but he never met the target. Xiong also invited Wang to frequent tea houses and restaurants and provided him with pocket money to increase their relationship. Wang fell into the trap without realizing it. At that time, he also introduced a fellow party member, known as Hu Laoyao, to contact Wang. Later, Wang learned that Hu was a subordinate of Neng, so Xiong and Hu often visited the school where Wang was located and even stayed overnight in the school, often stealing students' clothes. One day, Hu gave Wang a can of kerosene, instructing him to set fire to the school, but he did not do it. Hu was very unhappy, but Xiong reassured Wang, instructing him to investigate the thoughts and actions of the students and the residence of the principal. Until the beginning of December, Hu returned to the school, gave Wang a pistol and 30,000 yuan in legal tender, and ordered him to kill the principal, otherwise Wang would be punished, etc., with severe coercion. However, Wang could not bear to do it and did not make a move. Later, at the end of the same month. Wang was caught stealing in the school and was being investigated by the school authorities. Xiong and Hu happened to arrive, demanding the return of the gun, with a threatening attitude towards Wang, forcing him to set fire immediately to find a way out, under close supervision. Wang saw the situation was dangerous, fortunately his conscience had not died out, taking advantage of the fact that the teachers and students had not yet gone to bed, he had no choice but to set the fire and then immediately told the principal the truth, so it was discovered early, and no major disaster occurred. Since the school considered the matter related to the current school order, it was not appropriate to release him lightly and has transferred him to the judicial authorities for trial and handling.

### US Congress May Convene a Special Session to Review US-Soviet Tensions; If the Stalemate Cannot Be Broken, the US Will Take Action

[United Press, Washington, 9th] It has been learned today that senior congressional leaders in the United States, deeply concerned about the trend of US-Soviet relations, are seriously considering convening a special session of Congress this fall. It is understood that they feel that if tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union continue to increase, it is necessary for Congress to take action on some new measures to back up US foreign policy. It is expected that this decision will be made soon. Congress is currently scheduled to adjourn at the end of July and reconvene in January next year, but those in charge said that the House and Senate will only recess in July, pending a call from Republican Ridge-s. If it is a direct adjournment, President Truman will issue an emergency announcement when necessary to convene a special session. However, if there is a recess in July, the issue of a special session in the fall will be convened by House Speaker Martin and Senate Speaker Vandenberg. There are several factors that may cause the US Congress to convene a special session: (1) Judging from the Hungarian coup, diplomatic circles believe that the United States will continue to adopt a tough stance against the Soviet expansion policy in Europe. The US government now seems to have this indication, that is, if necessary, it will submit this issue to the United Nations. (2) The meeting of foreign ministers in New York in September will reveal whether the United States can reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the German treaty and whether the United States should take an independent path. If the issue remains stalemated, congressional leaders believe that it is necessary to reopen Congress. This meeting may immediately increase the funding for the conscription plan, take immediate action on the amended Neutrality Act, and on military cooperation with Western Hemisphere countries. Some administrative officials sent to Congress welcome the convening of a special Congress, if its purpose is to consider passing a broad foreign expenditure plan this fall to draft legislation. The plan is currently under study at the State Department and may involve spending large sums of money each year for two or four years to enable European countries to become economically self-sufficient. This will be another step in promoting the new Truman Doctrine to prevent communism. At the same time, Republican leaders have decided to end the meeting of Congress within the next seven weeks, even if this adjournment is temporary. Senator Taft, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, told reporters that he would consult with House leaders this week to decide what legislation can be drafted during the remaining meeting days.

[United Press, Washington, 8th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee, one, has initiated discussions on a resolution calling on the Soviet Union to abide by its wartime guarantees and insisting on implementing a firm US policy in view of the recent actions of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. This proposition was originally put forward by Congressman Colemann and was once shelved, but after the Communist Party of Hungary recently implemented a coup, the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee announced that the committee tentatively scheduled to begin collecting opinions from all parties on the 11th to determine whether this was necessary. Secretary of State Marshall, Secretary of Commerce Harriman, Chief of Staff Eisenhower, and former President Hoover will be invited to attend to present their views.

### President Truman Warns Aggressors Not to Follow in Japan's Footsteps; The United States Attaches Importance to Recent Developments in Europe

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Communism in Europe is in danger of causing the political demise of Hungary. In order to cope with this situation and the US-Soviet power war moving from the Balkans to Eastern Europe, President Truman arrived in Washington on the 8th from Kansas City. While the US government is closely watching Europe, it is also concerned about the Far East, another front in the fight against communism. The US government is drafting a plan to reaffirm US policy toward China and unfreeze the Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan to aid the Chinese Nationalist government. The US government is also planning ways to urge Congress to take action on the long-delayed aid to Korea plan as soon as possible. President Truman warned aggressors in a temporary speech in Kansas yesterday, saying: Japan once mistakenly believed that the United States was incapable of fighting a war. Aggressors must not repeat its mistakes. This statement shows that Mr. Truman will take strong action to counter communist aggression in Europe. According to informed sources, the United States' first step will be to lodge a strongly worded protest with the Soviet Union, condemning the Communist Party's acquisition of power in Hungary, and then take decisive action to ensure that the same coup does not occur in France and Italy.

### Hungarian Secret Police Arresting People in Austria

[Reuters, Vienna, 8th] Reliable sources said that Varga, the Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament who fled Hungary during the current Hungarian political crisis, is now hiding in a monastery in the country. Varga fled after learning that Ferenc Nagy, the Secretary-General of the Hungarian Farmers' Party, had been arrested and had confessed to the Soviet authorities that he was also involved in the coup conspiracy. After arriving in Vienna, he heard that three Hungarians had been kidnapped from Austria by the Hungarian secret police and taken back to Hungary, so he hid and did not dare to show his face. The Austrian Ministry of the Interior has launched an investigation into the claim that the Hungarian secret police arrested people in Austria without authorization. Varga was originally a clergyman in the Lake Balaton area, so it is not surprising that he is hiding in an Austrian monastery. During the war, he engaged in underground work, using his clerical status to help Allied prisoners of war escape. He is one of the most progressive members of the Hungarian Farmers' Party, and he and the party's Secretary-General, Nagy, are both opposed to adopting a policy of appeasement towards the Communist Party.

### United States Mass Producing Huge Bombers, Volume So Large it is Shocking

[United Press, Fort Worth, Texas, August 8] The US Army's B-36 newest type of bomber is now being mass-produced here, and its sheer volume is shockingly large. The body to the tail is very far apart, and it is necessary to set up a convenient railway in the middle to run a small car and pass through the gas pipes for communication between the two parts. The gasoline it carries is enough for a car to circle the earth sixteen times and still have enough left to travel through any of the forty-eight states of the United States. Six gasoline tanks are built into the aircraft, capable of storing 21,000 gallons of the finest gasoline, enough to fill two and a half railroad tank cars. Thirteen of these giant machines have been assembled for the last time at the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft plant, the world's largest aircraft factory, here. The fuselage has a volume of 17,724 cubic feet, and the bomb bay can carry four military cars. The six hollow steel propellers, each 19 feet long, are larger than any previously used on airplanes. It weighs 139 tons, which is more than any other aircraft. The two wings are 230 feet long from end to end. The tail is 46 feet 7 inches high. The similar C-99 transport can carry 400 soldiers per aircraft. The factory that manufactures this aircraft is 4,000 feet long, and the connected fluorescent tubes can reach 32 miles. Visitors must travel by car.

Brigadier General Ramey, commander of the Eighth Air Force, recently stated: The new B-36 flying fortress will roam the skies in a few weeks. This has undoubtedly caused "unhappiness" to the military departments of "aggressive" nations. "Unless history completely changes, we will need a large number of such aircraft." Brigadier General Ramey also said that the possibility of carrying small fighter planes in the aircraft is currently under consideration, as there are currently no fighter planes that can continue for 10,000 miles, and the aircraft can carry 10,000 pounds of bombs and fly 10,000 miles. If a gasoline turbine engine is used, the speed of the aircraft can be increased by another 100 miles per hour. Currently, there are only three airports that can provide take-off and landing for this giant aircraft, and more are under construction.

### Poland Arrests Large Number of Anti-Soviet Elements, Socialist Leader Puzak Also Among Them

[Reuters, London, August 8] A Warsaw dispatch reported tonight that the Polish Ministry of National Security has issued a communiqué announcing the capture of some personnel from a terrorist organization led by General Anders' Freedom and Independence Movement. The personnel of this organization provided intelligence to its central organization, carried out terrorist activities against government officials, incited labor strikes to undermine the country's economic recovery, engaged in anti-Soviet propaganda, and spied on military intelligence. General Anders is the commander of the Polish Second Corps stationed in Italy. When ten Poles accused of treason were tried in Warsaw in January of this year, the prosecutor accused Anders of having an organization for the Freedom and Independence Movement.

[French News Agency, Warsaw, August 8] The Polish Ministry of Public Security issued a communiqué today announcing that several leaders of the Polish Socialist Party, including Puzak, have been arrested. Sixteen Poles were tried in Moscow in June 1945 on charges of anti-Soviet activities, and Puzak was also one of the defendants. These individuals were all members of the Polish Socialist Party, which was established in London in 1940. Polish authorities recently seized documents proving that the party had cooperated with reactionary groups led by General Anders. However, the communiqué did not specify the date of Puzak's arrest, but news of their arrest had been heard as early as last December. At that time, officials had partially confirmed these messages, but denied that Puzak had been arrested. Now that the Polish Ministry of Public Security has issued this communiqué at a time when the domestic situation is gradually easing, political figures here generally believe that this is a warning to right-wing socialists, as the Socialist Party's opposition to the Labor Party in the government is growing day by day.

After entering Romania, the Soviet Union organized the Soviet-Romanian Joint Oil Company to take over the former German assets in Romania.

When Muslim League Chairman Jinnah drove to the scene, supporters of the Muslim League shouted "Emperor of Pakistan."

Observers here recently stated: According to this indication, the Soviet Union seems to have new attempts to extend its influence towards the Aegean Sea and the Dardanelles Strait, and to take action in the Balkan countries. Turkey is now deeply afraid that the left-wing IMRO will occupy cities in the Greek Macedonia region and establish a Macedonian government, which will allow Soviet forces to approach the Strait area. The only way for Britain and the United States to deal with this is to directly intervene in the Balkans, regardless of the consequences.

### Japan's Stubborn Ambition to Conceal is Obvious, Hitoshi Ashida Quibbles

Still Hopes Various Countries Will Grant Sympathy

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, August 9] The statement made some time ago by Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida regarding territorial issues has alarmed various Allied countries. Ashida specifically clarified this on the 9th, saying, "Japan's territory has been stipulated by the Potsdam Declaration, but because small islands close to the Japanese mainland have not yet been decided, I hope that the peace treaty conference that has the right to resolve such islands can grant Japan sympathetic goodwill, hence the aforementioned statement."

### 180,000 Loads of Rice to be Distributed This Month, Household-Based Grain Rationing to Begin in August, Large Households Expected to Receive 1 Dou Per Month and Small Households 5 Sheng, Chairman Wu Reports at the People's Food Distribution Meeting

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal People's Food Distribution Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Shandong Fellow Association office on Ximen Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The meeting was attended by Chairman Wu Kaixian, Committee Members Ye Shifu of the Food Department, Ye Xinming of the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse, Ren Xianxin of the China Trust Bureau, Zhang Xiaosong of the Department of Civil Affairs, Xu Youzuo of the Police Bureau, Shao Yongsheng of the Municipal Council, Shui Xiangyun of the General Labor Union, Xu Jiying (representing Yan Zhongsheng) of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Ji Mingzhai, the head of the distribution section of the distribution committee. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Wu reported on the establishment process and the people's food distribution plan, stating: Considering that June, July, and August are the leanest months for rural rice sources and the period when market demand is greatest, the government has established this committee with the consent of the Food Department and President Zhang of the Central Bank in order to make appropriate supply adjustments.

Two Major Policies

Regarding the future adjustment of the people's food in this city, there are two major policies: one is to universally implement household-based grain rationing, and the other is to distribute grain to a portion of organized citizens, such as factory workers and school students. The Food Department can allocate 187,000 dan of rice to this city in June, of which 120,000 dan will be used for rice distribution to factories, schools, etc., and the rest will be allocated to various districts in the city for flat-price sales according to the proportion of the poor population in each district. It is expected that the city can obtain 250,000 dan of rice for distribution in July. The quota for organized citizens will remain unchanged, and the increase will be used to increase and universally distribute the amount for the poor. It is expected that the allocation quota will be 350,000 dan in August. Starting from August, preparations will be made to implement household-based grain rationing in accordance with the resolution of this Municipal Council. It is expected that large households will receive 1 dou per month and small households will receive 5 sheng. When necessary, the rice distribution to organized citizens such as workers and students will be cancelled, and wealthy households will not be allocated rice.

Two Principles for Flat-Price Sales to the Poor

As for the flat-price sales to the poor in each district, there are two principles: (1) The identity of the poor is based on application rather than investigation. After review by the baojia, the district people's representatives will review, register, and report. The flat-price sales stations will be planned and handled by the district office. When selling rice, the police sub-bureaus of each district will supervise together, and the distribution office will send personnel to patrol and inspect. (2) The amount of distribution is determined based on the number of poor people and the amount of rice distribution, which will be announced temporarily.

Organizational Rules Approved

The organizational rules of the distribution committee were then approved. Its responsibilities include matters related to the guidance of grain sources in this city, the overall planning, purchase, storage, and quantitative distribution of the people's greed, the design of grain administration, and the investigation of grain production in various places. It has three sections: review, distribution, and investigation, and four divisions: document, affairs, accounting, and statistics. There are also several specialists and inspectors. The committee meets once every two weeks, and the chairman may convene a meeting temporarily when necessary.

At 3 p.m. in the afternoon, Secretary Zhang Shude convened a working meeting.

### A Grand Gathering at the City Government: Welcome to Chen Qitian, Many Leaders from All Sectors Attend to Offer Advice to the Minister

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mayor Wu held a grand welcoming reception in the City Government Conference Room to welcome Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian, who was in Shanghai on official business. Dozens of leaders from the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors attended, including Pan Gongzhan, Chen Xing, Xu Jilong, Luo Qinghua, Xu Xueyu, and Liu Hongsheng. First, Mayor Wu delivered an introductory speech, followed by a speech by Minister Chen, who stated: Shanghai is the financial center of the country and has a very close relationship with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. He expressed his willingness to listen to the opinions of the responsible persons of relevant agencies and leaders from all sectors, hoping to seek progress in an unstable situation and strive to integrate the government with the people for close cooperation.

Decision-Making Should Consider Things First

Subsequently, Chairman Pan raised two points: (1) The most important issue at present is how to make the industrial and commercial sectors closely cooperate with the government. What merchants feel the most painful about now is not the excessive tax rate, but the cumbersome procedures. Moreover, Shanghai has been designated as a direct tax auditing zone, which seems very unreasonable, as Shanghai is not a special region. It is hoped that Minister Chen can understand the suffering of the people and provide convenience to the industrial and commercial sectors. (2) In terms of administration, the government must seriously consider policies before making decisions, and after decisions are made, it is hoped that they can be thoroughly implemented, avoiding frequent changes in orders, leaving the people at a loss. After the lifting of the cost-of-living index freeze this time, it is feared that discounting low salaries may still cause labor-management disputes, which should be paid attention to.

Control Policies Should Be Revoked

Xu Jilong said that due to the turbulent situation and currency inflation, the industrial and commercial sectors cannot recover quickly, the cost of living has risen sharply, and high wages and heavy taxes are really unbearable for factories. In the future, all kinds of government control policies should be revoked, and it is hoped that harassment in taxation can be reduced. Luo Qinghua called on the government to break prejudices and cooperate sincerely. The discounting of the index should be improved. Jiang Yiping put forward opinions: (1) Smooth flow of goods. (2) Reasonable price limits. (3) Determine the required amount of tax revenue. (4) Simplify procedures for industrial and commercial loans.

Finally, Minister Chen summarized everyone's opinions and gave a reply, stating: China is at a difficult juncture, and the government and the people must cooperate to overcome the difficulties. He personally decided to be humble and sincere and seek truth from facts, etc.

After Finishing Official Business, Return to Beijing That Night

Minister Chen went to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, Textile Construction Company, and Fuel Management Committee in the morning to inspect. At 2:00 PM, he went to the International Hotel to attend the preparatory committee of the China Economic Construction Association. During the meeting, Chen emphasized that the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee would soon replace the Textile Management Committee. After that, the control of yarn and cloth can be reduced, and part of the raw material supply problem in the industrial and commercial sectors can be solved. At 11:00 PM that night, Minister Chen took the night express train back to Beijing.

### A Wild Wind and Heavy Rain Hit Shanghai: Water Still Accumulates in Low-Lying Areas, and Boats Can Travel on Land Again

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the city was hit by wild winds and heavy rain. It started from early morning and cleared up for a while after 2:00 PM in the afternoon, but started again in the evening. The average wind force was 30 nautical miles per hour, and it reached 40 nautical miles per hour around 10:00 AM. The rainfall totaled more than 1.2 inches. Many dilapidated houses in the urban area were destroyed by the strong winds, and low-lying streets accumulated water again, forming canals.

The Shanghai Meteorological Observatory reported that the storm was caused by a low-pressure system in the Xiangqian area moving eastward, while a high-pressure system occupied the southern part of Korea and Japan and the northern part of the Yellow Sea, hindering the advancement of the low-pressure system. As a result, wild winds and heavy rain occurred. The rain area has spread to Lu, Yu, Xiang, Gan, Zhe, and Min in recent days. The main stream of the low-pressure system arrived near Nanjing yesterday morning, and had moved into the East China Sea in the afternoon, so the local climate cleared up for a while, but due to the unstable high-pressure climate in southern Japan and Korea, Shanghai is still expected to have cloudy and rainy weather today. The weather forecast of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory is listed below: Yellow Sea: Clouds, overcast rain, brisk to strong easterly to northerly winds, slightly larger waves. Central China: Overcast rain turning to clouds, fog in the morning and evening, brisk northerly winds. Shanghai: Overcast, showers, gradually improving, fog in the morning and evening, gentle easterly winds. East China Sea: Overcast, coastal rain and morning fog, brisk to strong cyclone, northerly showers and giant waves. Southern brisk southeasterly to southwesterly winds, medium waves. Temperature on the 9th: Maximum 70 degrees, minimum 65.2 degrees.

### Greater Shanghai Urban Plan ·Drafter Talks About Key Points· Port Configuration, Mechanical Equipment, Universal Construction of Hospitals and Schools

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Greater Shanghai Urban Plan, which the Municipal Government Urban Planning Committee has been studying for more than a year, has been approved in principle by the current Municipal Council; however, few ordinary citizens know the key points of the plan. The reporter interviewed Professor Paulick, a consultant of the Urban Planning Committee, yesterday. He is the main drafter of the plan. According to him, the key points of the plan are roughly the following. (1) Port issues. Shanghai is a gathering place for industry and commerce and the most important port for national import and export goods. There are two current shortcomings. One is that the equipment is not modern enough, and the loading and unloading of goods is slow. The second is that transportation costs are expensive, which has a significant impact on the development of industry and commerce. In the new urban plan, based on the two major principles of modernization and reducing transportation costs, it is planned to highly concentrate the port in several locations and configure all modern mechanical equipment to make the loading and unloading of goods fast and the cost reduced.

Large Bridges and Tunnels · · Are Not Cost-Effective

(2) The issue of developing the Pudong area. The Urban Planning Committee believes that the connection between the two sides of the Pujiang River is not suitable, whether building a bridge or an underground tunnel on the river surface. The reasons for this are that the construction cost is too expensive and does not meet the financial plan, and the construction difficulties must also be considered. For example, if a bridge across the river is built on the Bund of Nanjing Road, the bridgehead must be far away near the racecourse, which has too much impact on the urban area. In addition, the entry and exit of pedestrians and vehicles at the bridgehead will increase the level of traffic congestion in the urban area, so it is better to develop Pudong into an industrial zone and choose another location. As for wanting citizens to move to Pudong, more ferry terminals can be built to facilitate transportation.

Build More Trunk Lines · · Bypass the Bustling City

(3) Road traffic issues. The plan divides areas to build more direct trunk lines that do not pass through the commercial center. The east-west and north-south traffic in the urban area must pass through Xizang Road and the commercial center south of Suzhou Creek, so the areas are concentrated and traffic is congested. If more direct trunk lines are set up, this phenomenon can be avoided. In addition, the characteristic of Shanghai's traffic problems is the complex types of vehicles and different speeds, so the new urban plan separately designates road lines for various vehicles to avoid high-speed vehicles being blocked by low-speed vehicles. (4) Population and management issues. As a result of urban industrialization, the population will inevitably become more concentrated in the city. It is estimated that the population of Shanghai may increase to 7 million in 25 years. The urban plan takes the city of 7 million people as an ideal, and in terms of management, every 4,000 people are taken as a basic unit. Public facilities such as schools, hospitals, libraries, and sports fields are built in each unit to make Shanghai a modern city.

### Restoring Wages from 1937: The Authorities Say It's Impossible. Representatives of the Industrial Association Petitioned the Two Leaders.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Industrial Association dispatched representatives such as Hu Boxiang and other eight people to visit Mayor Wu in the morning at 10:00 AM, claiming that after the announcement of the index in May, most industries could not afford it. Therefore, they requested that the workers' wages be restored to the year-end salary of 1937. Before the solution, the April index of 14,800 times should be temporarily issued. Mayor Wu said that it was impossible to restore the workers' basic salary to 1937, because the profit and loss situations of each factory are different. Therefore, it is not possible to use one industry as a unit to seek a solution, but individual consultations must be resolved.

Layoffs and Closures: Discuss Slowly

The eight representatives visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau again in the afternoon. Director Wu replied to two points: (1) It is impossible to restore the basic salary to 1937, (2) Layoffs and closures can be discussed slowly. Both sides argued vigorously during the meeting. The representatives claimed that the compilation of the cost-of-living index is based on 1937, so the basic salary should also be restored to the number of 1937. Director Wu said: The addition of the workers' basic salary to today's number is agreed by both labor and management, or decided by arbitration, so it is a kind of contractual behavior. If it is said that the capitalists were initially forced to do so, then why didn't they immediately declare it invalid at that time? Moreover, discounting the index while the basic salary remains unchanged leads to the same result, so why must the contract be canceled? As for wanting to use one industry as a unit, there is no way to find a solution. Because the profit and loss situations of each industry are different, it is impossible to stipulate uniformity, otherwise those who make money will help him make money again, and those who cannot maintain it will still not be able to maintain it.

Mediation of Disputes: Just Like Treating Diseases

The representatives replied: Theory is theory, facts are facts. Workers in Factory A see that the index discount of workers in Factory B is different from their own, and most of them are unwilling to give up, which often leads to strikes or slowdowns. In fact, if the skin does not exist, where will the hair attach? At present, if we must pay according to the facts, there is no other way, and each factory is preparing to die. Director Wu said: We are doctors, and there is no doctor in the world who hopes that the patient will die. If the capitalist cannot afford it and cannot reach an agreement with the labor, he can apply for a judgment, and the judgment committee will never decide to close the factory. Finally, the representatives urged the director to pay attention to the fact that the wage difference between young workers and skilled workers is very small, which makes most young workers not seek to improve, and the impact will be that there will be a lack of skilled workers in the future. Director Wu said that this point can be considered.

### Storm Strikes Navigation Vessels: Da Feng Ship Traveling on Shanghai-Nantong Line Has an Accident at Liuhe: Some Injured People Are Rescued and Come to Shanghai · · A Boy Died After Being Sent to the Hospital

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Da Feng ship of the Da Feng Shipping Bureau in this city, which operates the Shanghai-Nantong line, left Pier 14 at 11:00 PM on the 8th with passengers on board. Unexpectedly, a storm suddenly rose at 2:00 AM in the middle of the night. The ship tried its best to support it. Until about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, it reluctantly passed near the mouth of Liuhe. Because it could not withstand the attack of the stormy waves, it finally had an accident. The ship urgently sent an SOS radio signal for help. A tanker of more than 2,000 tons was the first to rush to the rescue. The company dispatched the (Hbony) large tugboat after receiving the call at 12:30 PM yesterday, and then requested the Hangzong Water Transport Brigade to dispatch the Wanli landing craft and the Shenhua ship to rush to the rescue.

### Fire on Xinzha Road: Carelessness in Printing Factory Spreads to Neighbors: Two Workers Are Missing

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning, a fire broke out in Lane 920 (Houfuli, Fukang Road) of Xinzha Road, burning down Nos. 112, 110, 108, 106, and the front No. 94 pavilion building. The loss cannot be estimated. Zhang Qingfang, captain of the Jing'an District Fire Brigade, and Li Jiukang, firefighter No. 519, were injured by the collapse of the canopy due to their bravery in fighting the fire and were immediately sent to the police hospital for treatment by car. Two workers from the Tongmao Printing Factory at No. 110 are missing, and there is still no news of them until dusk. It is feared that they have been buried in the fire.

The reason is that at about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the Tongmao Printing Factory at No. 110 suddenly reported carelessness. The interior of the factory was full of flammable materials such as paper and ink, so the flames spread in all directions in an instant. At that time, it was drizzling and the southeast wind was tight, and the upstairs of No. 108, the right neighbor, was immediately affected. The fire truck arrived at this time, but the alley was far from the Taiping Dragon Head, and the water came out slowly, and the fire became more intense. After the firefighters bravely fought and poured water, the fire in front was slightly contained, and the back spread to the upstairs of No. 106 and No. 112, and the flames spread to the pavilion room of No. 94, Qianlong, through the canopy built by Tongmao. At this time, the second fire truck also rushed to the scene and fought bravely to pour water, and the fire gradually extinguished. It was completely extinguished at 7:30 AM. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Three apprentices from the factory have been taken to the bureau for interrogation.

### ·Wang Jingwei's In-Laws· Chen Chunpu's Retrial: The Main Reason Is Drug Prohibition · · Whether There Is Evidence Remains to Be Investigated

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Chunpu, one of the giants of Wang Jingwei's family and the puppet government, was previously sentenced to death by the High Court. Chen appealed against the verdict and applied to the Supreme Court for a ruling. The case was sent back for retrial. The case was heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Chen served as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Executive Yuan, the Minister of Organization of the Puppet Central Party Department, the Minister of Construction of the Puppet Government, and the Governor and Pacification Director of Guangdong Province. When he was interrogated yesterday, he was wearing a blue cloth gown and had a sad face. He defended his crimes: (1) The defendant did not participate in the "Basic Treaty Between China and Japan" and the "Declaration of War Against Britain and the United States" signed by the puppet government. (2) During his tenure as Minister of Construction of the Puppet Government, he built water conservancy projects, improved agricultural tools, and devoted himself to the rural revival work. (3) During his tenure in the Guangdong Provincial Government of the Puppet Government, he banned smoking and drugs, eradicated tobacco seedlings, and provided relief to cultural workers. (4) Chen is the defendant's distant aunt. The defendant has a 20-year personal relationship with Wang. His appointment to the puppet government was purely under the control of emotion. (5) Going to Japan was to visit his wife's illness, not to escape, and had no political effect. At this point in the confession, the court said that the biggest reason for returning this case for retrial this time was to investigate whether there was any definite evidence for the defendant's eradication of tobacco seedlings during his tenure as Governor of Guangdong Province in the Puppet Government, so the interrogation was more detailed. Finally, it was ordered that the case still needs to be investigated, the retrial will be rescheduled, and the defendant will be returned to custody.

Yesterday, this reporter inquired with Secretary-General Xu of the provincial government about this matter.

After the athletes representing this province at the National Games are selected, the authorities plan to provide them with short-term training. It is said that this province has a good chance of winning medals in the triple jump and middle hurdles events in track and field.

Page 6 National Banks Guard Against Overseas Remittance Evasion - Specific Measures to Be Implemented - Black Market for Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and US Currency Rampant [Our Newspaper] The government, in response to increasingly serious issues of smuggling in South China's import and export trade and overseas remittance evasion, dispatched Rogers, a British consultant to the National Bank, Shao Zenghua, deputy director of the National Bank's business bureau, and Shen Xirui, deputy director of the China Trust Bureau, to Hong Kong on the 28th of last month to discuss concrete measures to stop it with the local authorities. It is now known that Mr. Shao Zenghua returned to Shanghai on the 8th, while Mr. Rogers and Mr. Shen proceeded to Guangzhou. Mr. Shao told reporters that he has not yet met with President Zhang since his return, so he could not comment on the trip. [Another Report] It is heard that Mr. Shao will make another trip to Hong Kong in the short term. Mr. Shao told reporters from the United Credit Bureau that the trip's results were very satisfactory, and specific measures will be implemented to prevent overseas remittance evasion. However, because the matter is of great importance, detailed discussions with relevant parties are needed. No comments can be made until the final decision on the measures. Regarding the news of Hong Kong bankers establishing a new exchange rate, Mr. Shao said he had not heard of it. Regarding the news that the Central Bank will establish an institution in Hong Kong, Mr. Shao said that it is impossible because the Central Bank cannot establish institutions abroad. Regarding the prevention of overseas remittance evasion to Hong Kong, relevant parties said that various countries are implementing strict foreign exchange controls. Therefore, our hope to increase overseas remittances can only be achieved by striving for the number allowed within the laws of various countries. However, even with the limited overseas remittances, the large gap between the black market and the official price discourages overseas Chinese from remitting through national banks. US dollar drafts are very popular in the Guangzhou area. Because there are currently many forgeries, those engaged in this business are very cautious. Sellers must have two established shops as guarantors, and they must specify that if they cannot be exchanged within three months, the guarantors will be fully responsible. Because the procedures are cumbersome, black market US dollar transactions have had to move to Hong Kong, causing private traders to become even more rampant.

Regarding imported flour: since August of last year, the China Trust Bureau has successively ordered 110,000 tons from Canada. 80,000 tons have now been shipped, totaling 3.2 million bags (at 50 pounds per bag).

China Trust Bureau Conducts Barter Trade - 80,000 Tons of Tung Oil Shipped to Japan The Central Trust Bureau recently shipped 80,000 tons of tung oil to Japan for barter trade. Tung oil was originally a specialty product of our country and played a very important role in export goods in the past, with a very large export volume. Since the black market for foreign exchange became rampant, the difference between domestic and foreign prices has been significant, making it impossible for export businesses to export, so they stopped. Currently, various countries are very interested in our tung oil for making paint. Although there have been discussions about adjusting prices in the United States, there has been no follow-up so far. Although tung oil merchants hope that the government will purchase and sell it abroad, the government's treasury is currently very strained and cannot provide massive support, so it can only find ways to conduct barter trade with foreign countries to open up sales channels and avoid stockpiling in Shanghai. It is heard that the 800 tons that will be shipped to Japan this time have been decided to be transported by Merchant Shipping Bureau ships by the weekend. It has not yet been decided what goods will be shipped back to our country.

### Accusation of Making False Claims of Losses While Manufacturing Military Uniforms; Using a Gun to Intimidate and Search for Checks: Investigation Begins on Ma Yiju for Infringing on Freedom

[Reported by This Newspaper] In November of last year, the Quartermaster General Headquarters of the Combined Service Forces planned to solicit bids for the manufacture of a large number of military uniforms. At that time, a man named Ma Yiju claimed to be familiar with the Quartermaster General Headquarters and said that there would definitely be profits to be made after winning the bid for the military uniforms. However, Ma was an amateur in the manufacture of military uniforms, so he joined forces with Dai Shanxiao, the owner of Dai Hongxing Military Uniform Factory, to form Changfeng Military Uniform Factory to negotiate the manufacture of the military uniforms. Ma served as the manager, managing economic matters and all external affairs, while Dai served as the factory director. After undertaking the manufacture of the military uniforms, the factory received 165 million yuan from the Quartermaster General Headquarters. There was no concern about losses, but after the completion of the uniforms, Ma Yiju falsely claimed a loss of 70 million yuan and ordered Dai to pay 35 million yuan. When Dai did not agree, Ma used a gun to intimidate Dai and searched his person, taking away a check for 20 million yuan. He also threatened Dai to call home and take out the land deed as collateral for the remaining 15 million yuan. Afterwards, Dai filed a complaint on the charge of infringing on freedom, and the District Prosecutor's Office has begun an investigation.

### Reader Consultation: Education and Culture

(1) Regarding the Joint Entrance Examination

A group of people who missed their education asked: We saw in the newspaper that the Ministry of Education ordered a joint high school graduation examination and university entrance examination this year. However, we graduated from high school several years ago and have been eager to pursue further education but have had no opportunity. We were planning to take the university entrance examination this year, but we were shocked to hear of this order. What is the actual situation? Please answer.

[This Column's Answer]: (1) The joint entrance examination regulations stipulate that the high school graduation examination for the second semester of 1946 will only be held jointly with the first new student entrance examination for the first semester of 1947 for public and private colleges and universities. This measure will not hinder the further education of students who graduated previously, because public and private colleges and universities will still hold several new student entrance examinations on their own in addition to enrolling some new students during the joint entrance examination. (2) The Ministry of Education has now decided not to hold the high school graduation examination this year, so the previously announced joint entrance examination regulations will not be implemented this year.

(2) Private School Screening

Qian Yunjun asked: (1) I graduated from the junior program of the Private Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School in July 1940. Does my alma mater still exist? (2) The exchange of formal diplomas is related to the confirmation of graduates' qualifications. If my alma mater has closed down, what procedures should be followed for exchanging diplomas?

[This Column's Answer]: (1) The Private Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School has now closed down. (2) Graduates of the school could have applied for screening, but the opportunity has been missed. The Municipal Education Bureau has already conducted three screening sessions and will not hold any more in the future. Graduates of the school who have not yet applied for screening have no other recourse but to take the university freshman entrance examination with equivalent academic qualifications.

### Wuhan University Did Not Resume Classes Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper from Hankou on the 9th] The Wuhan University Professors' Association originally planned to resume classes today, but the students have not resumed classes. The problem of handling the aftermath still needs continued persuasion. The students of the school held a general assembly last night at 9:00 PM and still had some objections to the resolution made by the professors to accept the central government's handling plan, and decided on three measures: (1) Classes will not resume temporarily until the case is completely resolved. (2) The representatives going to Beijing should depart as soon as possible. (3) The Professors' Association is requested to stop sending telegrams accepting the handling plan. President Zhou learned of this decision and, despite being ill, accompanied Acting President Liu Binglin to address all the students, gently persuading them to appreciate the government's earnest efforts to handle the situation fairly, resume classes first, and wait quietly for the investigation.

### The Municipal National Education Research Association Held its Opening Ceremony Yesterday: Director Wu Encouraged Colleagues in National Education to Work Hard

Director Wu then delivered a speech, saying: The importance of national education is still not understood by some people in society, but I believe that national education work has a profound impact on the future of the country and cannot be compared to temporary meetings or meetings that do not reach a decision. Because the research of this association is for the sake of the next generation of new citizens, its significance is immense. US President Truman believed that whether the world will be peaceful in the future depends on elementary school teachers. The UNESCO is also actively supporting countries to improve their basic education. The purpose of the meeting to be held in our country this fall is also for this purpose. After I came to Shanghai, I inspected the actual situation of national education and participated in the American Labor Exhibition, and I felt very excited. With the efforts of all parties, national education in Shanghai has indeed made leaps and bounds, and the future is very promising. Shanghai occupies a leading position in various regions and should be a model for other regions, but the environment is difficult, even more so than in other regions. I hope that colleagues in national education in Shanghai will take responsibility, not be afraid of difficulties, and work hard. Subsequently, Gu Shusen, Chen Heqin, Chuantong Xian, Huang Renjian, and Huang Jun delivered speeches.

### Fudan University Professors' Meeting: Resolved to Resume Teaching Immediately; Requested the Alumni Association to Find a Way to Release Students as Soon as Possible

[Reported by this newspaper] The Fudan University Alumni Association hosted a banquet for all the professors of the school yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the New Life Club to discuss the resumption of classes and the rescue of arrested students. Professors Yu Nanqiu, Chen Guyuan, Chen Wangdao, Zhang Zhizhang, Luo Zhongyi, Pan Zhenya, and others, as well as alumni Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, Duanmu Kai, Wu Daocun, Bao Kangzhi, and more than a hundred other people attended. Xi Yushu, the chairman, reported on the significance of the meeting, expressed deep admiration for the school's professors for making necessary protests to protect the students, and urged the professors to resume classes as soon as possible. The alumni association is willing to do its best to rescue the arrested students.

Report

Subsequently, Jiang Yiping reported on the progress of the Alumni Association, together with the responsible persons of the Professors' Association's board of directors and supervisors, negotiating with Mayor Wu for several days regarding the arrested students, and the various events that Mayor Wu had promised. He hoped that after the professors resumed classes, they would hand over all the responsibility for rescuing the arrested students to the Alumni Association. After Jiang's speech, Professor Yu Nanqiu, who returned to Shanghai from Beijing the day before, reported on the government's attitude towards handling the student protests and the progress of his negotiations with alumnus Yu Youren on resolving the Fudan University strike.

Purpose

Then, Professor Lu Yudao stated the purpose of the school's strike: (1) to rescue the students, (2) to protest against illegal arrests, and (3) to oppose infringement on academic freedom, and explained each of the above three points separately. Students need freedom more urgently than they need preferential treatment. Schools are the largest industrial institutions for manufacturing talent. Because of academic research, all kinds of theories need to be discussed freely, and the government should not accuse them of being suspected of communism because of this. Students' involvement in politics is to urge the government to make progress, and they should not be accused of opposing the government because of this. If it is found that students do have conspiratorial activities against the government, they should be dealt with according to the law.

Hope Finally, Lu put forward three hopes: (1) that the arrested students will be released quickly, (2) that the military police will no longer infringe on the school in the future, and (3) that academic freedom and educational dignity will be maintained. After Lu's speech, Professor Pan Zhenya proposed that the responsible persons of the Alumni Association be asked to leave the meeting and hold a meeting of all the professors in place to elect Yu Nanqiu as the temporary chairman to discuss the resumption of classes and the rescue of students.

Resolution

The resolution was subsequently made: (1) to resume classes immediately; (2) that the original rescue committee, together with the Alumni Association, will be responsible for handling the rescue; and (3) to persuade President Zhang to stay and urge him to return to school as soon as possible to preside over school affairs. At the same time, a written document was sent to the Alumni Association, asking them to quickly find a way to rescue the arrested students and guarantee the following points: (1) guarantee the safety of the school, and in the future, without the notification or consent of the school authorities, no more military police will be sent to the school, and especially no plainclothes personnel will be allowed to enter the school; (2) guarantee that the arrested students will be released as soon as possible; (3) guarantee that the students on the arrest list of May 30 who have not yet been arrested will not be arrested; (4) guarantee that no students other than those on the arrest list of May 30 will be arrested.

Guarantee

Afterwards, the responsible persons of the Alumni Association, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, and Duanmu Kai, publicly announced that they would guarantee to negotiate with the authorities on the above four points in order to achieve a satisfactory result. Jiang also asked the Professors' Association to persuade the students to resume classes as soon as possible. After the professors agreed, the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.

### Mayor's Cup Junior Basketball: Green Heroes Win Championship; France Abandons Game in the Last Ten Seconds

The final of the Mayor's Cup junior basketball group, Green Heroes vs. France, was held at the gymnasium at 7:30 PM yesterday, following the group B league. Both sides had cheering squads to cheer them on, and the atmosphere was quite lively. However, when the game reached the last ten gauze, Green Heroes was leading by 33 to 29.

The referees were Liu Hesheng and Yu Juju. Green Heroes attacked first, but because both sides were too nervous, neither scored within four minutes. Then, Fei Jianxing of France scored the first point. Zhu Guanhong fouled, and Shi Jilin regained one point. Then each achieved a three-point tie. Shen Yaoyong added icing on the cake. In the first quarter, Green Heroes took the lead with 5 to 3. The competition in the second quarter was still very fierce, and each team scored seven points to create another tie. At the end of the first half, France came from behind to lead with 12 to 9.

Changing sides and fighting again, France launched a major offensive. Green Heroes trailed by 11 to 18. Shi Jilin scored two free throws, and Green Heroes gradually got closer. At the end of the third quarter, Green Heroes overtook the lead by one point with 23 to 22. In the last quarter, Li Xushen of France scored a long shot, and Shen Yaoyong of Green Heroes also scored two points. After that, the battle became more intense, and the scores rose and fell rapidly. When Green Heroes took the lead with 33 to 29, there were only ten seconds left in the regulation time. Seeing that the overall situation was over, France disregarded sportsmanship and insisted on not playing anymore. The referees announced the abandonment and the game ended.
