### Chairman Chiang's Radio Address on the Tenth Anniversary of the July 7th Resistance, Announcing to the Entire Nation: Arousing Insight into Treacherous Schemes, Rising Up to Suppress the Rebellion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Chairman Chiang, on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the July 7th Resistance, broadcast to the nation. The original text is as follows: Fellow countrymen across the nation, today is the tenth anniversary of our July 7th Resistance. I feel it is necessary to solemnly explain to all my fellow countrymen the changes in our national situation since the victory of the Resistance, the entire crisis of the nation, and the key to the blessings, misfortunes, and interests of our fellow countrymen. Our goal in resisting Japan was to defend our territory, recover the Northeast, and maintain the integrity of our sovereignty and territory. If the sovereignty and administrative control of the Northeast are not restored for even a single day, then the goal of the Resistance has not been achieved. The heroic souls of the millions of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves for the Resistance will have no way to be comforted. This is entirely the common responsibility of us who survive. Everyone knows that before Japan surrendered, there were no Communist bandit troops in the Northeast. When the National Army entered the Northeast to receive and administer sovereignty, in that year and a half, the Communist bandits launched five offensives against the National Army, besieging the areas the government had already received, cutting up the Northeast's land, and slaughtering the Northeast's people. Recently, the Communist Party's response to the People's Political Council's peace proposals was first to use its propaganda organs to slander and smear, followed by launching frantic offensives inside and outside the customs as a de facto response. In particular, their offensive in the Northeast this time was of unprecedented scale. Since early May, they have launched more than 300,000 troops to launch fierce attacks on various important strongholds, and finally concentrated the focus of the attack on Siping Street, using ten times the strength of the defending troops to launch eighteen days and nights of fierce attacks. Finally, relying on the spirit of our soldiers continuing the resistance against Japan, they dealt a crushing blow to the invading Communist bandits, shattering their attempt to encircle Changchun and Jilin, seize Shenyang, and enabling the Northeast war situation to reach a turning point for success or failure. However, the Communist bandits' consistent conspiracy to destroy the motherland will never stop there, so the crisis in the Northeast cannot be said to be fundamentally resolved by the victory in Siping Street. How the Communist bandits entered the Northeast and how the troops they joined in the rebellion in the Northeast were organized is all well known and obvious. The Communist Party is inheriting the mantle of the imperialist Japan and the puppet Manchurian traitors. They are implementing the poisonous scheme left behind by the imperialist Japan's failure to completely destroy China, not allowing our Chinese nation to restore sovereignty in the Northeast, not allowing our Republic of China to enjoy territorial and administrative integrity, and even today they are still using the remaining troops of our enemy, Japan, leading them to trample on our Chinese land and harm our Chinese people. The Communist bandits' perverse and insane actions are more brutal than any bandit in history, and their intentions are more vicious than any traitor or puppet in Chinese history. Fellow countrymen must know that the Communist Party's military rebellion is to split our entire China and destroy our entire nation. They must make our national spirit and inherent morality diminish completely, so that we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, will forever be reduced to slaves and cattle, unable to maintain independent and free personalities. If we allow the Communist bandits' destructive and inhumane bestiality to continue to exist, then we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, will suffer the same collective slaughter, collective exile, and eternal enslavement as the recently subjugated nations.

### The Communist Party's Treacherous Heart Does Not Awaken from Persuasion

The purpose of our National Revolution is to establish an independent, free, and democratic New China based on the Three Principles of the People, and the work of national construction must be premised on the peaceful unification of the country. But peace and unification are inseparable, unification and democracy and freedom are inseparable, and unification and the people's happiness are even more inseparable. If the country cannot be unified, then all national construction ideals will become empty talk, and the people's rights and livelihood cannot be realized. The people cannot obtain a standard of living above a basic level when they are trampled upon locally, their economy is divided, production is destroyed, and transportation is cut off. Compatriots must be able to recall that "The war has just ended, and internal strife cannot be allowed to exist again." This was my sincere cry to the Communist Party after the victory. Any responsible government and any patriotic people do not want to cause the country and the people to fall into the suffering of war again after the scars left by the war. We do not want to deny that communism has become a doctrine or ideology. At that time, we only hoped that the Communist Party would follow the path of democracy, like the communist parties in democratic countries such as Britain and the United States, and win voters through peaceful and legal political parties. Therefore, for ten years, especially in the past year or more, the government has always been painstakingly tolerant and compromising, only hoping that the Communist Party would not undermine unification, not maintain troops to divide the country, not overthrow the foundations of the country, and not constantly harm the people's lives. The government could consider accommodating their opinions if they worked together for peaceful and democratic construction. However, no amount of negotiation, agreement, or mediation can eliminate their treacherous hearts, and no amount of negotiation can awaken them to the future of the country and the suffering of the people's livelihood. The main actions of the Communist bandit troops for more than a year have been concentrated on destroying transportation, destroying industry and mining, and destroying the dying rural areas everywhere. Every time the government calls for peace and every time it issues a ceasefire order, it only encourages the Communist bandit troops to expand and attack further, only increases the difficulties of the National Army's front lines, only increases the sacrifices of loyal soldiers and the people, and only expands the banditry and prolongs the war, making the work of social recovery and reconstruction after the war more difficult than ever before. Now, my fellow countrymen across the country can clearly recognize that the Communist Party has a "bandit nature that is difficult to change," has absolutely no sincerity in repenting, and is determined to rebel to the end. Their ambition and conspiracy will not stop until they destroy the country and harm the world. If we cannot unite as a country, discern treacherous schemes, and be determined to suppress the rebellion, then not only will the people's livelihood become increasingly desolate, but the entire country will also be divided and destroyed by them.

### Today's Indifference Means Tomorrow's Helplessness

The Communist Party's open rebellion after the end of the War of Resistance was originally a conspiracy they had already determined. When we won the War of Resistance, they openly launched their so-called "joining the army movement" and "social struggle," "mass liquidation" in the bandit areas, using violence and coercion, specializing in cruel killings to establish prestige, from old women to young children, not allowing a single grain or a single piece of cloth to be retained, and every blade of grass and every tree was robbed, for their rebellious violence. All able-bodied men in the bandit areas had no way to survive unless they followed them as bandits. Any slight resistance would result in being sliced to death and buried alive, implementing their so-called "death to the whole family for one deserter." Tens of thousands of fellow countrymen in the bandit areas were driven by the Communist bandits in this way, becoming the victims of their rebellion and harming the people.

However, in our rear areas, especially in the major cities of Central and South China, there are still many people who do not recognize the fundamental crisis of the country and the nation, do not see clearly the Communist Party's extremely vicious atrocities, or hope for luck and tolerate them, or live in ease and comfort, not knowing that our fellow countrymen in the rear can still maintain their regular way of life entirely because of the National Army soldiers who are sacrificing themselves to suppress bandits and save the people, fighting and resisting on the front lines. Otherwise, they would have already fallen into the same tragic situation as the people in the Communist areas of North and Northeast China. Therefore, if we weaken the National Army today, we are shaking the basic right to survival of the people of the whole country. Precisely because our fellow countrymen in the rear cannot clearly see the facts of this disaster, blessing, and interest, the Communist bandits use the psychology of ease and comfort and blind tolerance in society to instruct their reactionary tools to put forward various slogans such as "opposing grain requisition," "opposing conscription," and "opposing civil war" to reverse black and white, numb people's hearts, confuse society, and shake the foundations of the country, so that our human, material, and even spiritual strength cannot be concentrated and applied to the work of suppressing bandits and construction. Sitting idly by and watching the Communist bandits' violence grow and the rebellion spread, tracing back to the source, it must be said that our social figures have been poisoned by the Communist bandits' counter-propaganda. It must be known that in order to carry out their conspiracy to betray the country and the nation, the Communist bandits must first block our fellow countrymen's ears and eyes and numb our fellow countrymen's conscience. The Communist bandits' purpose is to make my fellow countrymen completely ignorant of national righteousness, regard the country's peril as nothing, and even be ignorant of their own blessings, misfortunes, and permanent interests, thereby losing their confidence in self-improvement, self-reliance, and independence, and becoming spiritual prisoners of the Communist bandits in an invisible way. The state of麻痹in society today, where right and wrong are indistinguishable and interests are not distinguished, is exactly what the Communist bandits want to create. This is just like the ancient saying that swallows nest under dangerous curtains, but do not know their danger. In fact, when the nest is overturned, there will be no intact eggs. Fellow countrymen, today's indifference means tomorrow's helplessness. When you are like the fellow countrymen in the bandit areas, you have fallen into a trap, unable to live or die, even if you want to regret it, it is too late. The fate of our country and our fellow countrymen across the country has actually reached such a serious crisis. How can I not fulfill my responsibility to clearly inform and awaken the vigilance of all my fellow countrymen?

### Only Two Roads Ahead: Hoping Fellow Countrymen Will Choose Immediately

Fellow countrymen must know that now there are only two roads in front of our China. I hope our fellow countrymen will make a choice immediately. One is the road of following old ways and delaying, being indifferent, sitting and waiting for the Communist bandits to slaughter and trample on us, causing the entire country and 450 million fellow countrymen to be destroyed and submerged. The other is the road of facing the facts, recognizing blessings and misfortunes, distinguishing interests, being self-reliant and self-improving, uniting and rising up, eliminating banditry, and saving the country and ourselves. Are we going to unite together and devote all our efforts to suppress the rebellion, maintain the country's territorial sovereignty, complete unification, and achieve the goal of democracy and freedom? Or are we going to sit idly by and watch the bandit troops run rampant, the rebellion spread, our own homes being robbed, our families being humiliated, our children being driven and coerced, becoming tools for traitors, and finally destroying the country's lifeblood? All of our fellow countrymen should think about what kind of days the fellow countrymen who have suffered from banditry in the Northeast and North China are living. In the Northeast, they have experienced more than ten years of subjugation and humiliation, and what the victory has brought is the terror of the Communist bandit troops. Oppression, robbery, slaughter, and the replacement of the violent rule of Japanese imperialism. As for the various parts of North China, they have sacrificed the most and suffered the deepest during the War of Resistance. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the fellow countrymen in many areas had not yet regained their breath when they were invaded by the Communist bandits again and plunged into the abyss of darkness again. Recently, the Communist bandits' offensives in various places have all been with the bandit troops driving their so-called "militia" in front and large carts and mules behind. Wherever the fierce front passes, they rob and loot everything, leaving no chickens or dogs behind, surpassing the enemy's "three alls" policy during the War of Resistance. Whenever the Communist bandits occupy a stronghold, tens of thousands of people have to abandon everything, risk danger, and return to the rear of the National Army's position. The sound of their cries of resentment is the most tragic thing in the world. Our fellow countrymen in the rear are brothers with them, connected by blood. How can we turn a blind eye to their fate? How can we not rush to save them from their disasters? Moreover, the Communist bandits' full-scale rebellion is aimed at destroying the entire China and enslaving all fellow countrymen. If we cannot unite as one to suppress bandits and quell the rebellion, then the inhuman life of the fellow countrymen in the Communist-occupied areas of Northeast and North China today will be a true reflection of the future life of our fellow countrymen in Central and South China.

### Today's Quelling of Rebellion and Suppression of Bandits is Truly Self-Salvation and Self-Defense

We have not yet completed our recovery, and obstacles are piled up. I deeply know the difficulties in the lives of the general fellow countrymen in our recovered areas, especially the suffering of the farmers in the rural areas is indescribable. But no matter what, compared with the lives of the fellow countrymen in the bandit-stricken areas, who are deprived of their lives, actions, spirits, and materials, and even every breath, every word, and every move is suppressed, and even fathers and sons, husbands and wives must be wary of each other and dare not express their pain, there is a world of difference. It can be seen that today our national soldiers, civilians, and fellow countrymen's quelling of the rebellion and suppression of bandits is not only saving the fellow countrymen in the bandit areas, but it is truly self-salvation and self-defense. If, when the Communist bandits' attempt is so obvious, we still follow old ways and look back, coldly watch, and allow the bandit troops to spread and run rampant, and still cannot be responsible and do our duty to the country and fellow countrymen, and work hard to rise up and curb the rebellion, then we are willingly destroying our own lives and property. Moreover, we have gone through eight years of firm and unyielding resistance, suffered all kinds of hardships, and sacrificed the lives of millions of soldiers and civilians. If we allow the Communist Party's bandit troops to succeed in their malicious conspiracy, their rebellious and harmful ambitions, destroy the glorious history of our national soldiers, civilians, and fellow countrymen's resistance, and carry out the unfinished work of the Japanese imperialists to destroy China, then we ask ourselves, how can we be worthy of our original intention to rise up and resist at that time, and how can we be worthy of the heroic souls of countless martyrs who sacrificed themselves?

### US Begins Review of Our Plans for Using $500 Million Loan; Initial Actions Reveal Traces of Deal

[United Press, Washington, 6th] According to government officials on the 6th, the Export-Import Bank has begun action on the large number of development plans submitted by China earlier to use the $500 million line of credit. It is said that this plan has been sitting on the desk of the State Department for more than a month. It was only at the beginning of this week that Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun took it to the Export-Import Bank. Ambassador Gu's sending this plan to the Export-Import Bank indicates that there have been new developments in the proposed plan. At least, the bank's general manager, Martin, made a statement beforehand, saying that he would give individual and careful consideration to the plan.

Another part of the government said that the bank has already started action, but it will take a longer period of time before a decision can be made. They explained that in addition to studying each proposal separately, the bank will also generally study China's economic situation. Experts in finance, engineering, law, and general economics will take turns reviewing the plans, and then decide whether to allow the loan. At that time, this plan will be submitted to the National Financial Advisory Council for review. The council is composed of representatives from the Export-Import Bank, the Ministry of Finance, the State Department, and the Department of Commerce. At the same time, officials from the Chinese Embassy in the United States, the China Resources Commission, and the Chinese Supply Mission are on hand to assist and provide information to the Financial Advisory Council when needed.

Informed sources on both the Chinese and American sides said that the Export-Import Bank may give priority to transportation plans, as they best meet the bank's own prerequisites, that is, any new loan must be able to increase export trade. Secondly, attention will be paid to the plans that can best help China become self-reliant.

The advisory group he led currently supervises more than ten Chinese Air Force schools, ranging from Jianqiao Aviation School to Chengdu Meteorological School.

### Chief of General Staff Chen Informs All Officers and Soldiers: Suppressing Bandits is the Unfinished Responsibility of Revolutionary Soldiers

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Chen Cheng, Chief of the General Staff, issued a letter to all officers and soldiers for the July 7th Commemoration. The main points are: Although Japan has been defeated today, the Northeast territory and birthright have not been received due to the Communist bandits' obstruction, that is, the goal of the War of Resistance has not been fully achieved, that is, the responsibility of our revolutionary soldiers has not been completed. Now the government is mobilizing the national strength to quell the rebellion, and it is hoped that all comrades across the country will thoroughly implement the policy of suppressing the rebellion in order to save the people in the bandit areas and consolidate national unity. Our central work from now on is all for suppressing bandits and all for victory. Chairman Chiang instructed that the revolution has reached a serious juncture, and it is also a good opportunity for our soldiers to kill enemies and serve the country. We must not hesitate or lose confidence, and we must especially know that the Communist bandits' rebellion is not accidental, but an inevitable encounter in the course of the revolution. Now it has reached the second phase of the National Revolution, and the center of its work is to implement the principle of democracy and the principle of people's livelihood, and its object is to eliminate the obstacles of the Communist bandits' evil forces. Now the revolutionary forces have exceeded all corrupt and evil forces. As long as we earnestly raise our vigilance, victory can be achieved early.

### Kong Xiangxi's Speech

We want construction, not destruction

We want people's livelihood, not people's death

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 6th] Kong Xiangxi attended a welcome meeting held by all sectors of Taiyuan Provincial Government at 8:00 a.m. on the 6th. In his speech, he said: "Although the country is in difficulty, it has indeed made a lot of progress. On the way back from Pingyao to Bingzhou, I looked at the wheat seedlings from the air. They were very short, and there were still autumn crops that had not been planted. There has been a severe drought in Shanxi Province, resulting in the starvation of more than 300,000 people. Of course, we still hope for heavy rain now to hurry up and plant the late autumn crops. Even if there is no rain, we also hope to understand that air transportation is very convenient. Don't panic or hoard. Any political system in the world cannot be separated from selecting the virtuous and capable and emphasizing trustworthiness and good relations. When the Great Way is practiced, the world is for all." Kong replied to reporters, (2) The economic crisis is indeed very serious, but I am never pessimistic. When we won, organizing the economy was originally a golden opportunity, but unfortunately people's hearts are too bad. Some have armed internal strife, and some have taken over factories, but they have sealed off the factories. It's all because they haven't taken the world as their own and made plans. Don't destroy, we want people's livelihood, not people's death, we want democracy, not rebellion. The government is definitely not against the Communist Party, but it wants the Communist Party in democratic meetings. (3) I will go to the United States immediately after returning to Beijing. There are four tasks: (1) When I had surgery in the United States before, the doctor ordered a check-up every six months. (2) I will discuss the funding issues of Yenching and Yingshan with American school directors. (3) Participate in the Sino-American Cultural Association and the World Citizens Games. (4) The Bank of China handles exchange preparations to build bridges between domestic industry and commerce and overseas Chinese industry and commerce to subsidize the national economy.

### Communist Bandits Cross the Yellow River to Invade and Destroy River Bank Restoration Work; Chen Panling Discusses the Impact on the Project

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, the Next Day] The main force of the communist bandit Liu Yibo and Cheng has completely crossed the river. The first attempt of the bandit army seems to be to destroy the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, and then dig up the dikes to realize its ambition of large-scale destruction. This action of the communist bandits has been planned for a long time. They had built more than 100 ships and stored them in the trenches they dug. The reason why they opened the trenches at this time and released the ships to cross the south bank was to call for a halt to military operations in this area and the opportunity for the government to express its acceptance, in order to cooperate with the upcoming Yellow River flood season to carry out their so-called "destruction is revolution" rebellion.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 5th] Chen Panling, Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Project, issued a statement saying: "Thanks to the painstaking efforts, the construction and defense work of the Yellow River dikes in Hebei and Shandong have been fully prepared. Just when the great flood is approaching and the opportunity is fleeting, the communist bandits suddenly crossed the river in force in the Linji area of Shandong. The workers who had been recruited have all fled, and the materials that have been stored are in danger of being lost. Moreover, in the area upstream of Heigangkou in Henan Province and Dongming and other places in Hebei Province, the communist bandits constantly fired from the north bank to the south bank. Despite casualties, they still desperately robbed and were threatened at times, which greatly affected the project. The flood prevention and rescue project must seize the time. Even if the communist bandits can collapse in a short period of time, it will not be possible to re-recruit workers and purchase materials in a short period of time. With dikes that have not been repaired for ten years and are subjected to floods, we still dare not guarantee their absolute safety even if we exhaust our manpower and resources. Now, suddenly facing this unparalleled serious blow, the urgency of the project situation is obvious to everyone. This bureau can only try its best to find ways to maintain close contact with the board of directors, and, under possible circumstances, will still supervise the river workers to overcome difficulties and dangers, and go to resume work, in order to save the crisis in case of emergency."

### During the Jinling University Graduation Ceremony, the Ambassador Expounded on the Situation in Our Country; A Democratic System is Most Needed at Present

### Full Text of the Chairman's Broadcast - Continued from First Edition

Suppression of Bandits and Pacification of the Country - For the Sake of National Interests

Therefore, today's pacification and suppression of bandits is for the highest interests of the nation, as well as for the basic survival, democratic and free rights of the people. Fighting against the Communist bandits is no different from the sacred meaning of the War of Resistance against Japan. In other words, today's bandit suppression work is the continuation of the unfinished task of the War of Resistance against Japan. Just as I said to my fellow countrymen, it is a struggle that must be gone through to ensure the victorious fruits of the War of Resistance and to achieve the true independence and freedom of the nation. The successive and heroic sacrifices of our National Revolutionary Army soldiers should receive the same lofty respect as the martyrs of the War of Resistance. Providing sufficient food and troops, and enriching the frontline military, is the undeniable duty of each of our 450 million compatriots. In the sense of saving the country and protecting the people, regardless of region, whether it is the front or the rear, everyone is closely related and shares the same fate. I want to solemnly announce to our compatriots that from the recent Northeast campaign, we can see that the Communist bandits' ambition has been completely exposed, and the national crisis is increasingly aggravated. Therefore, everyone can no longer have any侥幸安 (expecting good luck and security) illusions, and can no longer have an attitude of being outside the military. We must urgently catch up, unify our will, concentrate our strength, unite the military and the people, strengthen the strength of bandit suppression, and strengthen construction work, to remove this eternal scourge for the country. We must implement total mobilization with the same spirit as during the War of Resistance, and we must be particularly invigorated and strict to correct the shortcomings that occurred during the War of Resistance. We must contribute all manpower, material resources, and lives without hesitation and without reservation, and work together for the cause of saving the country, saving our compatriots, and suppressing the chaos and settling the upheaval. Only in this way can we preserve the victorious fruits of the War of Resistance against Japan, and only then will the country have independence and freedom, and society have the hope of regaining security.

The Meaning of Total Mobilization - Arouse National Awareness

Fellow countrymen, the National Government has already ordered the implementation of total mobilization for bandit suppression. The most important meaning of this total mobilization is to arouse the vigilance of the people of the whole country, to unify the will of the people of the whole country, and to concentrate the strength of the people of the whole country. We must call on the patriotic people of the whole country to rise up together, save the country and save themselves. The initial measures of the government must follow the legal path, and we fully trust the patriotic conscience of our compatriots, so that compatriots across the country will automatically and spontaneously serve the country under the great righteousness of the nation. But our citizens must love the country and respect themselves, abide by the laws of the country, and fulfill the duties of citizens. For tasks related to the Communist bandits, we must do our best to contribute to the suppression of bandits and construction work. Every action must benefit the progress of bandit suppression and construction work. Leaders from all walks of life in society who have status should take the lead in upholding justice and serving the public. Our youth across the country are entrusted with the fate of the nation. In particular, they must distinguish between right and wrong, identify obedience and rebellion, promote national consciousness, and protect national life. If the youth are willing to be tools for the Communist bandits, and are willing to see the country perish and the people灭绝 (die out), then so be it. Otherwise, everyone should recognize themselves as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, citizens of China, and seek independent survival for the Chinese nation, so that they can develop free thoughts in the future without being destroyed and persecuted by the Communist bandits. Then they must make up their minds, go to the country early, those who study should concentrate on studying, and those who work in agriculture, industry, and commerce should work hard to produce and increase national strength. Everyone should stick to their posts and fulfill their responsibilities, so that the social order in the rear is absolutely stable. The rebellion and the complete destruction of social order are mutually echoing and cooperating.

Respect People's Rights - But Do Not Connive at Evil

Since our War of Resistance against Japan, the Communist Party has consistently carried out malicious propaganda against the government's work of resisting Japan and building the country. Its purpose is to alienate the relationship between our government and the people, and to disperse the entire strength of the Republic of China. It degrades the status of the country, obliterates the history of the War of Resistance of our entire military and civilians, reduces the confidence of our people in saving the country, and frustrates the patriotic will of our people. They not only spread rumors, stir up trouble, and disrupt and destroy in schools, society, factories, and the economic sector, but they also openly declared that this kind of disturbance and destruction is their "second battle line" of rebellion, and military rebellion is their first battle line. The two support each other, which can not only affect society militarily, but also affect the front line from the rear. This is such a dangerous conspiracy that I must call on everyone to prevent it in time. I can declare to everyone that the government's implementation of total mobilization this time must be within the scope stipulated by law. The military and political organs at all levels must respect the basic rights of the people. However, for those who do not realize the national crisis, do not abide by the national righteousness, and are instigated by those who甘爱共匪乱国殃民 (cherish the communist bandits, disrupt the country, and harm the people), participate in the work of their "second battle line," and have acts that disrupt order and endanger security, the government, for the sake of the survival of the country and the happiness of the people, must not connive at evil, and must be responsible for banning them and punishing them in accordance with the law. At this time, when the military's suppression of bandits is actively underway, and the soldiers are fighting bloody battles, all my patriotic compatriots must be united, united as one, recognize the goals clearly, and work actively. Only in this way can we strengthen military strength, shorten the date of the war, and achieve the goal of 평叛乱 (suppressing the rebellion) as soon as possible.

The government's decisions on the current situation have been seen in the resolutions of the State Council. This total mobilization is not only mobilized for the military victory of bandit suppression, but also for seeking national reform and labor construction. Therefore, I would like to point out the following two points to my compatriots.

Implementing Constitutional Government - Not Delayed Due to Bandit Suppression

First, we must devote ourselves to completing the work of national construction. Today, of course, we must concentrate our strength, strengthen the military, suppress the rebellion, and achieve unification. On the one hand, we must also work hard to build and increase production to break the Communist bandits' conspiracy to hinder national construction and endanger people's livelihood. In particular, our work to implement constitutional government and promote democracy will never be delayed because of bandit suppression. The Communist Party shouts democracy but opposes constitutional government, refuses to participate in the National Assembly, and does its best to undermine the progress of the national construction process. This shows that the Communist bandits fundamentally do not want China to have a constitutional government, fundamentally do not care about China's implementation of democracy, and fundamentally do not want China to complete production and construction. If China implements a constitutional government, it will have to disarm its private armed forces before the constitutional government and lose its basis for treason; if China embarks on the broad road of democracy, and the people rise up to be the masters of the country, then their so-called proletarian dictatorship and the terrifying policy of dictatorship will not be able to carry out its deception and oppression before the public opinion of the people. Moreover, once China implements constitutional government and democracy, and completes the economic construction that it should have, it will 不能製迭 (not be able to fabricate) social chaos and economic panic, and will not be able to rely on the hunger and poverty of the people to achieve its conspiracy to establish a Soviet regime. Therefore, I want to 正吿 (solemnly tell) my compatriots across the country, 正吿 (solemnly tell) all compatriots who are truly working for democracy, freedom, and the establishment of a modern country, we must eliminate this Communist bandit armed group that is fundamentally incompatible with democracy, freedom, and reconstruction. At the same time, precisely because we want to free China from the clutches of terrorism that creates chaos and hunger, we should urgently catch up, complete the constitutional government, prepare to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, protect the 基本 (basic) rights of the people, and improve the economic life of the people. We must never waver our consistent confidence and relax our due efforts.

While Carrying Out Bandit Suppression - Reform Internal Affairs

Second, we must do our best to promote national reform and progress. Now, on the one hand, we must carry out the bandit suppression war, and on the other hand, we must reform internal affairs. I do not shy away from the fact that the government itself has various shortcomings, and our society also has many weaknesses. After eight years of arduous resistance, there was followed the disaster of the Communist bandits' rebellion, which made the government and society unable to breathe, and it was difficult to balance the treatment of symptoms and root causes, and the national strength and people's strength were even more exhausted. After the war, various shortcomings and weaknesses were even more exposed, resulting in deepening pain for the people and a scattered national will. If the government cannot decisively reform and strive for progress, our country will not be able to survive in the modern world. Therefore, our political, economic, educational, social, and other aspects of reform must not wait for the end of the bandit suppression military, but should begin to be implemented immediately. We must replenish the country's strength through thorough reform, relieve the suffering of the people, and unify the will of the government and the people, in order to break through the national difficulties that the country is currently facing. The government will sincerely adopt and strive to correct any opinions and contributions from our compatriots regarding the shortcomings of politics and economy, and the location of the people's livelihood. For the mistakes in the administration of governments at all levels, we hope to point out examples and make incisive accusations, so that they can be earnestly corrected. Our implementation of total mobilization this time is to gather the strength of the government and the people, with one heart and one mind, self-reflecting and self-conscious, to reform the accumulated ills of politics and eliminate all obstacles that hinder national progress. Therefore, the meaning of our total mobilization is not passive but active, not local but national, not a one-sided responsibility for the people, but also a spur to the progress and construction of our governments at all levels and local societies. Zhongzheng (Chiang Kai-shek) has devoted himself to the revolution, and has always struggled to save the country from danger, struggled to implement the Three Principles of the People, and struggled to unify the country, build the country, and realize constitutional democracy. Personal success or failure, gain or loss, praise or blame, and glory or disgrace are not what he cares about. What I can tell my compatriots is only a sincere loyalty to save the country and save the people. I will never fail the Father of the Nation and the revolutionary martyrs, I will never go against the original intention of the revolution to save the country, and I will never fail the military and civilians who shared weal and woe during the eight years of the War of Resistance. I will do my best to preserve the fruits of our victory in the War of Resistance. I vow to lead all my compatriots to the end, to the end, with life and death, to the end, against any enemy that hinders the realization of our ideology, undermines our national unity, and hinders our national construction and progress.

Remove Obstacles to National Construction - Complete the Great Cause of National Construction

My compatriots across the country: As we approach today's sacred anniversary of the July 7th War of Resistance against Japan, I ask compatriots across the country to revive the spirit of national unity and courageous advancement during the War of Resistance, and to strengthen our confidence in removing obstacles to national construction and completing the great cause of national construction. I announced to my compatriots across the country early when we won the War of Resistance: "Our task of post-war revival and national construction is ten times more difficult than during the war." Given the depth of internal and external troubles China has suffered in the past century, and given the weakness of our national and social foundations, it is not something that can be achieved overnight to build a new China that is prosperous, healthy, independent, and free. But our country has such a long history, such a large population, and such excellent and persevering national virtues, I can assert that any stubborn resistance will not be able to hinder our country's revival, as long as our compatriots rise up with the same determination and patience as during the War of Resistance, and work actively, the Communist bandits' rebellion will be quelled in the shortest possible time. After we overcome this last difficulty and remove this biggest obstacle, the nation can enter a bright and splendid path. Therefore, our compatriots must not be confused by the Communist bandits' false propaganda, and must not be discouraged by the current difficult situation and shake their self-confidence. I hope that my compatriots will not forget the oath of "Victory in the War of Resistance" at that time, strengthen our belief in "National Construction will be achieved," promote the great achievements of the victory in the War of Resistance, break through all the difficulties and obstacles, eliminate the Communist bandits, eliminate the red disaster, in order to complete the great cause of national construction, and comfort the spirits of the military and civilian martyrs who sacrificed for the War of Resistance and bandit suppression (End)

Editorial

### A Dedication on the Tenth Anniversary of the War of Resistance – After Reading Chairman Chiang's Broadcast to the Nation

Today is the anniversary of the July 7th Incident, a great memorial day woven with blood, tears, and sweat by our Chinese nation. It has been exactly ten years since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred; in the past eight years, although we fought arduously in the war, enduring all kinds of suffering and torment, the people of the whole country believed that this was a sacred war related to the survival of our nation, and believed that final victory would belong to us: therefore, in the past eight years, every July 7th, we always felt that the gate of victory was one day closer to us, we often shed excited sweat, commemorating this great day; and spurred us on to shed blood and sweat to strive for victory. Eight "July 7ths" have passed, and we have finally won the final victory, making the past eight years an unprecedented and most glorious era in the modern history of our country.

This day last year, we encountered the ninth "July 7th," more than ten months after the arrival of victory. Not only did we not see the country embarking on the road of national construction and revival, but we also witnessed the fruits of victory beginning to spoil, which made us have to respond with bitter tears. Today, this year, is the second "July 7th" after the victory of the War of Resistance. Remembering the hardships of the past war of resistance, the heroic blood shed by the martyrs has been passed down through the ages: but looking forward to the future of the country, with various terrible crises lurking, we feel the great responsibility we bear. If we cannot fulfill the mission of "national construction," how can we be worthy of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for righteousness! Therefore, on this day this year, we must never just respond with tears like last year, but should revive the spirit of striving for victory by shedding sweat and blood during the War of Resistance, remove all obstacles on the road to national construction, and achieve the great cause of national construction. Today, the colleagues of this newspaper, in addition to mourning the war-dead soldiers and the victims, express their feelings, and are willing to warn and encourage themselves together with the people of the whole country.

First, the victory won by our country in the eight-year War of Resistance was achieved at a very heavy price: we must not allow the fruits of victory to mold and rot. In the hearts of us Chinese people, there is a very painful memory: as soon as the sound of cannons rang out at the Lugouqiao Bridge, the aggressive arrogance of the Japanese invaders was pressing, forcing our Chinese nation to engage in a life-and-death struggle. The "August 13th" Battle of Songhu followed, leading to a full-scale war between China and Japan. Later, the Battle of Pingjin, the Battle of Taierzhuang, the Battle of Xuzhou, the Battle of Wuhan, the Battle of Changsha, the Battle of Henan and Hubei, the Battle of Hunan and Guangxi, the Battle of Sui and Jin, and the Battle of Yunnan and Burma, from the northern desert to the southern Qiongya, almost the entire territory of China was ravaged by the Japanese invaders, and the number of soldiers and civilians who made heroic sacrifices, one after another, was more than tens of millions! The victory was exchanged for the heads of tens of millions of people; how can we not cherish it especially. But since the arrival of victory, less than two years have passed, all the beautiful dreams after the victory have vanished, and defeated Japan is about to stir again: Japan's ninety-year-old veteran parliamentarian Ozaki Yukio even put forward an absurd proposal, advocating that in Northeast China, Taiwan, Ryukyu, and Korea, a referendum should be held when public order is restored to determine whether the people in each place hope to be independent or willing to join which country. From this alone, we can know that defeated Japan is trying to make a comeback. Looking back at our own China, in the seats of international conferences, it often suffers the humiliation and exclusion of other countries. The so-called "one of the five powers," China has long been nominal. The failure to receive Lushun and Dalian, and the invasion of our country's Xinjiang Province by Mongolian troops, all show that China will once again suffer the threat of foreign aggression. If we do not rise up and strive to become strong, then not only will the blood of tens of millions of soldiers and civilians be shed in vain, but China will once again become the invaded. Therefore, on this day this year, we have to cry out loudly to raise the people's vigilance about national affairs; in any case, we must preserve the fruits of victory and never allow them to mold and rot.

Second, although the domestic and international situation makes us feel the danger to the country's future: it is not difficult to break a bloody path out of the encirclement. At present, the most urgent task is to remove all obstacles on the road to national construction. Looking at it from afar, the evolution of the international situation in the past two years has formed the current situation of two major camps confronting each other, which no one could have predicted. In the past, the world still had some hope for the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, but to this day, facts have proved that the possibility of cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly slim. The Soviet Union's attack on Marshall's aid plan for Europe has the intention of dividing Europe: while Britain and France believe that the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the European recovery plan is the first step in dividing Europe. According to this, the antagonism between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly acute, and it has reached the stage of close combat; we have repeatedly pointed out that China is a peace-loving country, and it is willing for the world to "unite" rather than "divide." The division of the world will only benefit the defeated countries. The United States, under this situation, will inevitably actively assist Germany in its economic recovery, which goes without saying; the United States will adopt a policy of supporting Japan even more. The rise of Japan is a threat to China's security, so the United States' policy toward Japan cannot but make China uneasy. But if we can adopt an attitude of "seeking the answer from ourselves," reflecting and warning ourselves, then we cannot but complain about ourselves, why can't victorious China unite sincerely and strive to become strong? Instead, it consumes its national strength in domestic wars? God helps those who help themselves. When the United States sees that defeated Japan can get on track and be orderly in everything, it cannot but have a psychology of bias toward Japan: but the United States' adoption of this policy toward Japan will inevitably cause a catastrophe in the Far East in the future, and the first to bear the brunt will be our China. If the third world war breaks out, no matter what its nature, if China is the battlefield, it will ultimately be the misfortune of the Chinese people. Therefore, this kind of international situation is brewing, and for the sake of China's future, and for the sake of peace in the Far East, we should try to eliminate it. If our internal problems cannot be solved, it will naturally reduce our international status. Let us think calmly, the Communist Party cannot escape the blame for creating the current situation in the two years since the victory! Last night, Chairman Chiang broadcast to the nation, also explaining the situation of our country. Chairman Chiang said: "The main actions of the Communist bandits in the past year have been concentrated on destroying transportation, destroying industry and mining, and destroying the dying countryside everywhere. Every time the government issues a ceasefire order, it only helps the Communist Party to expand further, and only makes the post-war social recovery more difficult. Now, our compatriots across the country can clearly recognize that the Communist Party has absolutely no sincerity to repent." Facing this dangerous situation, if we cannot unite as a country to quell the rebellion, then our Republic of China will inevitably be divided and destroyed by the Communist Party. Therefore, when we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the July 7th War of Resistance, we should restore the spirit of the War of Resistance and strengthen our belief in the inevitable success of national construction; make up our minds to be the government's backing, and remove all obstacles on the road to national construction in the shortest possible time, so as to embark on the road to national construction!

In conclusion, we cannot but express our supreme respect for the soldiers who have been fighting hard in the front lines, and who have not been able to return home after the victory, and who are still there to remove obstacles on the road to national construction. As Chairman Chiang said: "The fact that the compatriots in the rear can still maintain their normal way of life today depends entirely on the national army soldiers who are sacrificing themselves on the front lines to suppress bandits and save the people: otherwise, they would have already fallen into the same tragic situation as the people in the Communist bandit areas of North China and Northeast China." These words are most worthy of our people in the rear to appreciate and think deeply about!

### Marshall Aid Plan May Extend to the Far East Discussions May be Proposed in the Far East Economic Commission

[Central News Agency Chenggong Lake, 5th, United Press] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is scheduled to hold a meeting here on the 10th, which may informally discuss extending the Marshall Aid Plan to the Far East. The representative of the committee will also discuss the possibility of the Soviet Union boycotting the meeting. This meeting will be officially named the Plenary Committee Meeting, and its purpose is to complete the rules of procedure and discuss other maintenance issues. The agenda item closest to the Marshall Plan is the proposal made by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East at the Shanghai meeting. Observers here said: Although the Marshall Plan was proposed to aid Europe, the United States has responsibilities in Japan, Korea, and other parts of the world. It is recalled that at the Shanghai meeting, Soviet representative Stetsenko said that the Soviet Union might not send representatives to attend the Plenary Committee, and the committee seemed to have a tendency to ignore the Soviet Union's views on military and important issues. Mr. Shi opposed the establishment of a Plenary Committee and authorized it to report directly to the Economic and Social Council. He said: This decision makes the work of the committee itself decorative. In addition, the chairman of the Shanghai meeting, Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu, will arrive here on the 8th or 9th to submit a report on the Far East meeting.

### Five Countries Have Accepted the Invitation to the Anglo-French European Conference Some Countries Must Make a Final Decision

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 6th] It is learned that, to date, five European countries, namely Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and the Netherlands, have accepted the Anglo-French invitation to participate in the Paris Economic Conference.

As of the afternoon of the 5th, although no formal reply to the Anglo-French invitation has been received, it is generally believed that at least twelve or three of the twenty-two countries invited will accept it, possibly including Poland and Czechoslovakia. Exactly how many countries can attend the meeting, it will be known one minute before the start of the meeting, and some countries will have many difficulties in making such an important decision.

A Glimpse of European Reactions

[Reuters London, 5th] Among the twenty-two European countries invited to participate in the Paris meeting to discuss the Marshall Plan, most countries have not yet decided their attitude. The reactions of these countries to the Anglo-French invitation are summarized as follows:

Scandinavia: Authoritative sources in Copenhagen said that the foreign ministers of the Scandinavian countries will meet next Wednesday or Thursday to discuss the Anglo-French invitation. The foreign ministers of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have already exchanged views with each other. According to Stockholm news, the foreign ministers of the three countries have all expressed their approval of accepting the invitation. Austria: Reliable sources in Vienna said that although there is opposition from the Communist Party, Austria is still expected to accept the invitation. The Austrian cabinet meeting next Wednesday may be held earlier to discuss the Austrian government's reply to Britain and France. Czechoslovakia: An important delegation from Czechoslovakia will go to Moscow within days to discuss economic affairs with the Soviet Union. The delegation may be led by Prime Minister Gottwald or the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Turkey: A telegram from Istanbul said that the Turkish ambassador to France will represent Turkey at the Paris meeting. Greece: News from Athens said that Greece's reply accepting the Anglo-French invitation is expected to be submitted on Sunday.

[This newspaper's report] London, 6th broadcast: Yugoslav authorities predict that their government will refuse to participate in the Paris meeting on the US aid plan for Europe, and it is said that the government's attitude will depend on the attitude of the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, Albanian capital, 6th] The Albanian "Bashkimi" newspaper today criticized the Paris meeting, saying: "The meeting will teach the imperialists that they cannot buy the freedom and independence of European countries with dollars."

### Italian Foreign Minister Meets with Soviet Ambassador

[Agence France-Presse Rome, 6th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza met with Soviet Ambassador to Italy Kostilov today and had talks. According to political figures, the content of the talks was about Italy's acceptance of the Anglo-French invitation to participate in the Paris Economic Conference and the Soviet Union's delay in ratifying the peace treaty with Italy.

### French Ministry of Foreign Affairs Will Publish Documents of Foreign Ministers' Meeting

Molotov Sends a Telegram to Thank Bidault

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 5th] It is learned that the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs will publish the various documents of the recent Paris Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting in a yellow book. The British Foreign Office is not prepared to take the same steps. In addition, it is learned that French Foreign Minister Bidault has received a telegram from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov issued on the 3rd of this month, which said: The Soviet representative was sincerely entertained in Paris, and now he hastily returns to his country and would like to express his gratitude to your Excellency.

### Lie Returns Home for Vacation

[Reuters New York, 5th] Before departing for Norway for vacation, United Nations Secretary-General Lie issued a statement denying that the US aid plan for Europe exceeded the authority of the United Nations. Mr. Lie also said that all developments in Paris have been given detailed reports by Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British representative to the United Nations.

### Britain and France's Attitude Toward Spain Remains Unchanged

[Reuters London, 5th] Authoritative sources here said: On the eve of Franco's holding a referendum in Spain to decide the succession law, his broadcast to the nation, although declaring that Spain had completed the resolution of the Anglo-French refusal to invite Spain to participate in the Paris meeting in terms of legislation and social work. Britain and France's neglect of Spain is only because Britain and France believe that the Spanish government is not a democratic government, and the United Nations organization is also not prepared to cooperate with Spain under the current circumstances. Franco's speech did not change these views of Britain and France.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 5th, United Press] Official sources said that Spain will lodge a strong protest with the British Foreign Office against Spain not being allowed to participate in the negotiations on the Marshall Plan.

### Social and Economic Council Will Discuss the Cooperative League Alliance Proposal

[United Press Chenggong Lake, 5th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council is scheduled to meet here on the 19th of this month to discuss the proposal of the International Cooperative Alliance, that is, the United Nations Organization will establish an agency to manage the oil resources in the Middle East within the scope permitted by the countries concerned. People from Britain and the United States believe that the United Nations Agency cannot effectively manage the oil resources in the Middle East, so they expressed their opposition.

### The French Political Situation Remains Unstable

Supporters of the Government May Split

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 5th] Regarding the National Assembly's passage of the vote of confidence in the Ramadier cabinet, political figures here are very satisfied with this. The National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party held a meeting today to discuss the economic policies adopted by the government, and a vote will be held tomorrow. It is expected that Prime Minister Ramadier will not receive a majority of support. According to the calculation, when the French Communist Party withdrew from the government, the Ramadier cabinet only obtained the support of 2,529 votes against 2,125 votes. But at this moment, although Prime Minister Ramadier has overcome some obstacles, he still cannot rest easy, because the majority of those who support the government still have the potential to split.

### Bevin's Warning to the Soviet Union Deeply Shocked the British and American Circles

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 5th] Regarding the speech made by British Foreign Minister Bevin last night on the American National Day, according to news received here from New York, the stimulation caused by this speech in the United States is even greater than that caused in Britain. Foreign Minister Bevin warned the Soviet leaders not to irritate Britain too much, lest it become unbearable. There are also many people in Britain who are indignant because the Soviet Union refuses to cooperate with other countries. Although all of this is worthy of attention, it does not mean that this kind of emotion is generally held by the British people or their responsible people. On the contrary, important British figures all hope that the Soviet Union's refusal is not final in nature. In any case, the failure of the Paris Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting should never be regarded as the "last chance" for understanding between Western and Eastern Europe has disappeared. There are also some points in Foreign Minister Bevin's speech that are quite important, such as his expression of willingness to cooperate with the Soviet Union.

### Eden Delivers a Speech in Support of Bevin's Diplomacy

[United Press London, 5th] Former Foreign Minister Eden delivered a speech here on the 5th, supporting Bevin's actions, that is, preparing to carry out Marshall's plan regardless of the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate. Eden's speech said: "The task of the rulers of our country is very clear, they must plan together with our French friends and other countries willing to participate, so as to respond to Marshall's historical contribution and make it happen quickly. It is especially important because the European economy is extremely serious and there should be no hesitation. We hope that some small Eastern European countries, whose need for economic assistance is no less than ours, can come to participate in this plan regardless of the Soviet Union's unwillingness." Although Eden supported the government's foreign policy, he severely condemned the domestic economic plan. He warned: "If Britain continues to squander American loans at the current rate, our American credit will run out before Christmas this afternoon, and we will supplement it with our own financial resources, but according to the current expenditure, it will not be able to support it for another year."

### US Ambassador to Poland Takes Office

[Agence France-Presse Warsaw, 5th] The newly appointed US Ambassador to Poland, Griffiths, came to take office and arrived here today.

### Truman Calls on the People to Continue to Help Relieve the Famine Abroad

[Reuters Washington, 6th] President Truman yesterday published a report that the United States provided 8.5 million tons of food to foreign countries by June 30, 1947, and warned the United States that there are still millions of people in the world in a state of extreme starvation. The United States should do its best to continue to alleviate human suffering and help other countries engage in self-help. The President emphasized that although the United States' harvest this year has exceeded historical records, the United States should not ignore that even with the greatest efforts of the United States and other food exporting countries, it cannot meet the food emergency needs of the post-war world. The severe cold in Northern Europe last winter affected the harvest, so in the coming months, the United States still needs to export a large amount of food.

### Hungary's General Election in September

[Reuters Budapest, 5th] Today it was added that Hungary's general election will be held in September, and the new election law can be submitted to the parliament at the end of this month, and it is expected that the number of recognized members will increase.

### "Flying Saucers" Discovered Over the United States What Are They? Opinions Vary

[United Press Portland, Oregon, 6th] After reports from 33 states yesterday successively reported the discovery of disk-shaped objects with great speed in the sky, the people of the whole country were confused and lost. Several US military aircraft equipped with photography equipment are ready to search today. A B-30 aircraft is now waiting to be launched at Muroc Army Air Base in California, and six P-51 aircraft are gathered here to attempt to偵察 what these mysterious flying saucers are. Scientists and soldiers all admit that they cannot explain this phenomenon. The Army and Navy announced that it was not a military test aircraft: Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lilienthal said that it had nothing to do with the Commission's experimental work. Two astronomers in Chicago said that the flying saucer may be "artificial." Kouber, director of the Yerkes Observatory at the University of Chicago, believes that it is definitely not a meteorite. Lee, Dean of the DePaul College of Northwestern University, said: "We now know for sure that the Army and Navy are studying all kinds of things that do not exist in the world. Flying saucers and those who send thunder signals to the moon are of the same nature and are one of the greatest technological achievements of this year, and their construction has been absolutely kept secret." In addition, the "Los Angeles Observer" quoted a scientist as saying: "These flying saucers may be the result of atomic energy transformation experiments. The speed is very high, but it can be controlled from the ground, with a radius of twenty feet, and part of it is propelled by rockets during takeoff." In addition, Ully, an atomic scientist at the University of Chicago, held the opposite view, calling it absurd. When the first report of the discovery of flying saucers was made on the 25th of last month, the general public scoffed at it, but so far there have been hundreds of reports, and most of them are trained pilots, which makes this matter more credible. On the 4th of this month, a group of 200 people in Idaho and another group of 60 people witnessed similar reports in the eastern states. But there are many different opinions on some of the characteristics of flying saucers, such as size, speed, brightness, circular or elliptical shape, and the strange volatility of flight posture.

### Cultural and Economic Agreement Signed Relationship Between Poland and Czechoslovakia Increased The List of Members of the Czechoslovak Delegation to the Soviet Union Determined

[Reuters Prague, 5th] Prague and Warsaw simultaneously issued a communique today, reporting on the results of the Polish delegation's visit to Prague to discuss how to strengthen relations between the two countries. The Polish delegation was personally led by Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz and arrived in Prague on Sunday. The communique reported that the two countries had signed a cultural and economic agreement, and emphasized that both parties believed that it was necessary to implement this agreement in the long term.

In addition to negotiating the details of the implementation of the aforementioned agreement, the representatives of the two countries only decided to implement the provisions of the annexes to the Czechoslovak-Polish alliance treaty signed in Warsaw on March 10 in the shortest possible time, that is, to enable the Czechs and Slavs in the territory and the Poles in the Czech territory to enjoy full power of national political, cultural, and economic development. The communique further declared that the two sides have agreed to establish a Polish consulate in Ostrava, Czech Republic, and a Czech consulate in Katowice, Poland, soon. Finally, the communique stated that after the representatives of the two countries exchanged views on various issues concerning the international situation, especially the German issue, it was known that the positions of the two governments were completely consistent.

[Agence France-Presse, Czech capital, 5th] The Czech Christian People's Party newspaper reported today that the members of the Czech delegation who are about to go to Moscow to conclude a commercial agreement with the Soviet Union have been changed due to the changed political situation after the failure of the Paris Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting. It will now be led by Prime Minister Gottwald and Foreign Minister Masaryk, and Minister of Foreign Trade Ripka is also one of the representatives. When the Czech delegation is in Moscow, it will discuss political issues with Soviet representatives. As for the goals of the Czech delegation and the length of their stay in Moscow, officials have not yet issued any statements. But according to observers, one of the main issues that the Czech delegation should discuss with the Soviet authorities will be the issue of Britain and France inviting the Czech Republic to participate in the European Economic Conference. The Czech Republic urgently needs US assistance, and this issue may be completely resolved in Moscow.

### Japanese Workers' Grand Parade: Support Current Government

Urge Implementation of Socialist Party Platform

[United Press Tokyo, 6th] Over 20,000 members of the All-Japan Labor Union Association marched in the Imperial Palace Plaza on the morning of the 6th to support Katayama's socialist government. This is the first labor parade to support the government since the occupation of Japan.

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 6th] Since the Katayama Cabinet, centered around the Socialist Party, came into power, many of the policies it proposed to the Japanese people when it was in opposition have not been implemented due to compromises with conservative forces, causing dissatisfaction among the Japanese people. On the 6th, Tokyo worker groups convened a Socialist Party encouragement rally at noon, attended by 30,000 workers, who unanimously criticized the Socialist Party's weak policies and demanded that the party implement its platform from its time in opposition. The assembly resolved to present the following three opinions to Mr. Katayama: (1) The government-stipulated industry-specific wages effectively freeze wages and are therefore opposed. (2) Ensure the rationing of essential living supplies and the minimum standard of living for the people. (3) Immediately abolish labor income tax. This resolution was immediately handed to Mr. Nishio, the Socialist Party representative attending the meeting. Mr. Nishio immediately stated that the Socialist Party's policies during its time in opposition would be gradually implemented. The meeting adjourned at 2 p.m. that day.

### American Journalists Invited to Inspect Japan

[United Press Washington, 5th] A group of newspaper publishers and editors, invited by the Department of the Army, is scheduled to depart on the 8th for Japan to inspect the American military occupation work. The list of names and itinerary are not yet known.

### Spanish Succession Law: Referendum Held Yesterday. Cabinet to be Reorganized Upon Passage

[United Press Madrid, 5th] Spain held a referendum on the 5th, and Franco's "Succession Law" is expected to pass by a large majority. It is rumored that after the government obtains this "vote of confidence," the cabinet will be reorganized. Franco plans to appoint a prime minister, so that he can focus on his duties as head of state. Today's referendum is the first in Spain in eleven years. The expected results are 75% to 85% in favor, 15% neutral, and no more than 10% opposed. According to semi-official forecasts, 60% of the 16,187,092 eligible voters will vote. Anti-Franco factions have been ordered not to vote, or to cast blank ballots. The leaders are restorationists. The National Labor Confederation and the General Chamber of Commerce, lacking freedom of speech, publication, and assembly, can only engage in clandestine activities. The effectiveness of their opposition will only be clear when the national voting results are announced on July 26th. The only issue in the referendum is the Succession Law, which stipulates that Franco is the head of state, Spain is a "Kingdom," and when Franco voluntarily resigns or dies, a king or regent will succeed him in governing. This law has already been promulgated by Franco by decree and passed by parliament.

### Australia Opposes Coddling Japan: Foreign Minister Evatt to Meet MacArthur for Discussions. U.S. Fears British Veto in Japanese Peace Conference

[United Press Sydney, 6th] When Australian Foreign Minister Evatt meets with MacArthur in the middle of next week, he will lodge a strong protest against "one-man rule" in Japan. Australian government newspapers and the people seem to be united in opposing the U.S. government's view that the occupation policy towards Japan is appropriate. Protests against Japanese whaling and the excavation of phosphate mines reflect Australia's dissatisfaction. The criticism of Australian newspapers regarding this matter is the most intense anti-American rhetoric in years. The MacArthur-Evatt meeting is expected to improve strained relations between the U.S. and Australia. While the meeting is generally regarded as "private" rather than "political," Evatt will present an overview of Australian grievances from a friendly standpoint. Australian observers believe this meeting is crucial, as the British Imperial Conference will convene in Australia in mid-August to formulate British Imperial policy on the Japanese peace treaty.

[United Press Washington, 5th] U.S. officials, reportedly deeply concerned about the Soviet Union's "abuse" of veto power in the United Nations, strongly oppose the U.S. relinquishing its veto power in the future Japanese peace conference. They strongly advocate that the U.S. retain its veto privilege, fearing that the United Kingdom, with a majority of member states, would effectively wield a veto power in the Japanese peace conference. The disagreement over whether to use the veto power in the Japanese peace conference has become a fundamental conflict between the U.S. and the British Empire. This winter or next spring is the most likely time for convening the Japanese peace conference. U.S. officials do not believe that the Japanese peace treaty should be formulated by the Council of Foreign Ministers drafting the European peace treaties. The State Department hopes that the current member states of the Far Eastern Commission will draft it. Resolutions will be passed by a two-thirds majority. In other words, any issue requires eight affirmative votes to pass, but any resolution cannot pass if there are four negative votes. Therefore, U.S. officials believe that under concerted action, the British Empire would effectively wield a veto power, as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will all attend the Japanese peace conference. Furthermore, India and the Netherlands, known for supporting British Far Eastern policy, will also be attending the Japanese peace conference, and Australian Foreign Minister Evatt is the most vocal opponent of the veto power.

The United Kingdom will convene a meeting in Canberra on August 22nd to discuss policy on the Japanese peace treaty. U.S. officials deeply fear that this meeting will formulate a policy that allows Britain to absolutely control the Japanese peace treaty and has the power to block any resolution that Britain dislikes.

### International Tariff Negotiations: Six Groups Reach Agreements

[Reuters Geneva, 6th] The Preparatory Committee of the International Trade Organization has issued a report revealing that four groups of countries have completed tariff negotiations: South Africa and Chile, China and South Africa, South Africa and Cuba, and Chile and Norway. In addition, Canada and Norway, and South Africa and Czechoslovakia have also reached agreements. Therefore, out of a total of ninety groups, six have completed tariff negotiations. The report also states that agreements already reached may be revised depending on other negotiations.

### Indian Interim Government Resigns. Northwest Frontier Province Holds Referendum. Maisky to be Appointed Soviet Ambassador to India

[Reuters New Delhi, 5th] Indian Interim Government Vice President Nehru and his cabinet have submitted their resignations to Governor-General Mountbatten. Political figures believe that the resignation of the Interim Government is a natural consequence of the Indian Independence Act being presented to the British House of Commons. The Governor-General will now reorganize the Indian government to conform to the provisions of the partition plan.

The Northwest Frontier Province will hold a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the province will belong to Pakistan or Hindustan. Province Governor Lockhart announced that for the eleven days of the vote, the entire province will be considered a "disturbed area," and those who attempt murder, kidnapping, or illegal arrest will be subject to the death penalty. It is reported that the Congress Party's provincial cabinet does not support joining Pakistan or Hindustan, but advocates the establishment of an independent Pathanistan state.

[Reuters London, 6th] "The People's Daily" reports that the former Soviet ambassador to Britain, Mr. Maisky, will be appointed as the first Soviet ambassador to India. The newspaper also states that Jinnah's Pakistan is striving to establish closer relations with Afghanistan. Therefore, Nehru will soon personally go to Moscow to prevent Pakistan and Afghanistan from joining hands, and also to prevent them from forming a large-scale Islamic group with Middle Eastern Arab countries.

### Chinese Painting Exhibition Opens in Geneva

[Central News Agency Geneva, 5th Dispatch] The Chinese painting exhibition organized by Dr. Hu Tianshi, the director of the Chinese Library in Geneva, opened this afternoon at a famous museum here. The exhibition includes 170 selected works, 70 of which are by Wu Zuoren, a professor at the former National Beiping Art College and Central University. There are also many masterpieces by outstanding Chinese male and female painters, as well as 50 works collected by the Chinese Ministry of Education. On display are also 30 classical and modern works from the Song Dynasty onwards from the collection of the Chinese Library here. The exhibition will be open for one month.

### Japan Commemorates "Black Ship Festival." Acheson Discusses Policy Towards Japan

[United Press Shimoda, Japan, 5th] U.S. Navy Commodore Perry, who led ships 94 years ago to urge Japan to trade with foreign countries, is commemorated by the Japanese with the "Black Ship" Festival since 1930. It was suspended during the war and has now resumed today.

[Reuters Tokyo, 6th] On this day commemorating the first landing of U.S. Commodore Perry in Japan in 1854, Allied Control Council Chairman Acheson issued a statement declaring that one of the main goals of the U.S. policy towards Japan after the war is to establish a peaceful and responsible Japan. Less than two generations after Perry's arrival in Japan, Japan began adopting Western civilization and the advantages of modern warfare. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Japanese people, who now abhor militarism, will adopt a democratic system suitable for their domestic needs and foreign responsibilities. The U.S. has done its best under various difficulties to provide food relief to the Japanese people. The U.S. is willing to enable Japan to become self-sufficient as soon as possible and will not deprive Japan of anything needed for a peaceful economy and for creating its responsible position in foreign affairs.

### General Yarnell Discusses U.S. Defense Elements

[United Press Culver City, Indiana, 6th] Retired Admiral Yarnell, former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, stated in a speech at the opening ceremony of the summer naval school at Culver Military Academy on the 6th that universal military training "may be useful," but this is not the most important factor in U.S. preparedness. France also implemented compulsory military training, but still collapsed because France was a politically divided country, and its army lacked unity, morale, and efficiency. The elements of U.S. preparedness should include fully developing our economic and financial strength, developing our resources, and developing the morality and physique of our people.

### Analysis of Basic U.S. Policy

—Special Translation by this Newspaper's Editorial Department

The basic policy of the United States is to safeguard its own security, promote its well-being, and assist other countries in the world to the extent possible. The United States simultaneously adopts two supplementary policies to achieve these goals. These two policies are: (1) Strengthening the United Nations organization as quickly and fully as possible; (2) Ensuring that the United States is capable of defending itself and providing possible support to all friendly nations.

It is generally recognized that the United States cannot rely on the United Nations to safeguard its security in the coming years. At the same time, the conflict of interests and policies between the countries controlled by the Soviet Union and the Western powers led by the United States is a persistent concern for world peace. This is also a very obvious fact.

Among all the countries in the world left over from the war, the United States is one of the most fortunate countries. Therefore, various parties are requesting it to assume international obligations, the scope of which is obviously beyond what the United States can independently bear. In terms of the actual capabilities of the United States, all requests worthy of consideration should see if they possess one of the three reasons, strategic, economic, or humanitarian. Obligations based on strategic reasons are related to the long-term security and stability of the United States itself. If this security relationship is not very close, then the impact of those obligations on the economic interests of the United States must be examined. As for humanitarian obligations, they may be unavoidable and relatively large in number. However, examining the relationship of these obligations to U.S. security and interests, their status is secondary to strategic obligations and economic obligations related to security. The greatest contribution of humanitarianism is to avoid another world war.

To examine the urgency and scope of the requests of various countries for U.S. aid, the world can be divided into five regions for consideration. These five regions are: (1) the Middle East, (2) Central Europe, (3) Western Europe, (4) the Far East, (5) South America.

Middle East

The Middle East (including the eastern Mediterranean) is a region of active concern for U.S. policy at present. This is evidenced by aid to Greece and Turkey. This is due to the fact that the Soviet Union and the United States have recently become leaders of two opposing worlds, Britain is unable to maintain its dominant position in the region, and the importance of the large oil reserves in the region is increasing.

Although the direct relationship of the United States with the Middle East is relatively recent, this relationship is very important. The future security and progress of the world depend on the ultimate cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Western bloc. Until this cooperation is realized, and to help the success of this cooperation, U.S. policy must contain the Soviet system within its current scope. It is generally recognized that the United States must lead this obligation. The Middle East and Central Europe are two extremely important regions for exercising this leadership.

Turkey is the keystone of the Middle East, and Greece is the arch. If Greece falls under Soviet control, Turkey will inevitably follow. At that time, the Muslim world will be invaded by communism, and the oil reserves in the Middle East will be exploited by the Soviet Union, and Western countries will have no share in them. The Soviet bloc will not only gain a wider area, abundant resources, and an excellent strategic position, but also increase the prestige and strength of the spread of communism.

Speaking of the scope of U.S. obligations in the Middle East, some believe that to prevent future cost increases, it is best to fully invest at present, so that Turkey becomes the Middle East's fortress to prevent the expansion of Soviet power. The results of U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey and the scope of future involvement, although unpredictable, are safer and cheaper to strengthen the dikes now to prevent problems before they happen than to rescue a flood later.

Central Europe

Central Europe (referring to Germany, Austria, and the ports of the Strait) is as important as the Middle East, but the situation in these two regions is completely different. First, the Central European issue is still under negotiation, and the aftermath of the war has not yet been completed. Second, Central Europe has not only political or military problems, but also economic problems. Third, the armies of the Soviet Union and the Western powers each occupy a zone, facing each other.

The obligations assumed in the Middle East are relatively new, but the obligations in Central Europe are the earliest and unavoidable. The only question is how to deal with the situation in Central Europe in the most appropriate way to reduce it to a sustainable level. The main reason is the absolute necessity of military occupation and long-term economic assistance from the United States. The more indirect reason is the promotion of anti-communist policies. This task must continue for several years.

Western Europe

The scope of obligations borne by the third region in need of U.S. economic assistance, Western Europe, depends on the success of the United States in resolving the Central European issue. The more unfavorable the developments in Central Europe, the greater the obligations of the United States in Western Europe.

However, the relationship between the price of the United States rebuilding the economy of Western Europe and the U.S. policy of opposing the expansion of the Soviet bloc should not be viewed too closely. U.S. economic assistance to Western Europe, especially to Britain and France, can also be regarded as an investment in the future economic interests of the United States, with the hope of recovering it in the future. On the other hand, we acknowledge that political unrest and economic hardship are sufficient bases for communist activity. Any measures taken by the United States to prevent or overcome these disturbing postures are, in fact, attacking communism.

Far East

The fourth region for which U.S. foreign aid must be assessed is China and the Far East. The problems here are different in nature and scope from those in the Middle East and Central Europe. Although China and Korea are adjacent to the Soviet region, they are farther from the center of Soviet activity, and history has shown us. China's territory is too large, and its national character is too elastic, and it is not easy to conquer, assimilate, or dominate. From the American point of view, the strategic problem of the Far East has changed greatly with the defeat of Japan. The Far East is no longer a region under high political pressure. Part of its difficulty is that there is no strong country there.

The spread of communism in Manchuria, North China, and Korea is inevitably a major obstacle to U.S. policy, and it also has a significant impact on the United Nations organization and the economic and political interests of the United States in the region. However, as long as the United States continues to maintain its strategic position in the Mid-Pacific and the Philippines, the spread of communism in that region will not directly threaten Western countries, as the results that the Soviet invasion of Central Asia or Europe could cause. Therefore, regarding the issue of obligations arising from the U.S. opposition to the expansion of communism, from a strategic point of view, the status of the Far East is clearly below that of the Middle East and Europe. The region's demand for U.S. aid must be large, but on the whole, it cannot enjoy priority. In fact, the Far East is indeed a region where the United States can limit its obligations when necessary.

South America

South America is the fifth important region to consider for future U.S. obligations. The situation here is also very different from other regions. The main difference is that South America is geographically farther from the Soviet Union, and it has political, geographical, and economic ties with the United States, and South America has not been ravaged by war, and there are no serious problems such as relief and recovery.

South America, especially the northern half of the region, is of great strategic and military-economic importance to the United States. Therefore, U.S. obligations in South America should be very large, but Americans have a sense of shared interests and mutual dependence. Most Americans feel that South America will not go to another path except to stand on the same front line as Western countries.

From a realistic point of view, although South America is very important to the United States, U.S. obligations in the region may be fundamentally limited when necessary. (Translated from "World Report Weekly")

### Unprecedented Grand Ceremony on the Huangpu River: Military and Civilians Excitedly Celebrate the Receipt of Japanese Reparation Ships. Japanese Sailors Close Their Eyes and Lower Their Heads with Infinite Sadness

[Reported by This Newspaper] The flag-raising ceremony for the first batch of eight Japanese reparation warships, including the "Yukikaze," was held at the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Gaocangmiao Navy yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. The ceremony was solemn and grand, and the military and civilians were excited and enthusiastic. It was truly an unprecedented and glorious page in history.

Starting at 8:00 a.m., naval officers and soldiers and people from all walks of life arrived at the venue one after another, including Naval First Base Commander Fang Ying, Chief of the Ship Receiving Office of the Naval Headquarters Yang Daozhao, Navy Major Staff Officer Zhong Hanbo from the Mission to Japan, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Koesah, Chairman of the Municipal Party Committee Fang Zhi, Mayor Wu's representative Zhang Bide, Garrison Commander Fu Zhengmo, Director of Jiangnan Shipyard Ma Deji, reporters from various newspapers, photographers from the Central Film Studio, naval colonels, and naval family members, totaling several hundred people. The "Yukikaze" was berthed at the Jiangnan Shipyard between the first and second docks, while the other seven ships were scattered in the center of the river. The command platform was set up on the shore, facing the "Yukikaze" at a distance of about 50 meters. The surroundings were filled with colorful naval signal flags. Two national flags were suspended on the left and right sides in front of the platform, and a white cloth banner was hung high on the left side of the platform, on which was written "Flag Raising Ceremony for Receiving Reparation Warships." Steel plate pontoons were laid from the command platform to the "Yukikaze," and various signal flags were also hung on both sides of the handrails of the gangway for boarding the ship. Fluttering in the wind, it was a magnificent sight.

At exactly 9:00 a.m., the ceremony began, and all participants took their positions. Starting from the command platform, the first row was for guests, followed by naval officers, naval soldiers, honor guards, and military bands. Ogata (formerly mistakenly identified as Okada) and Funayama, the foremen of the Japanese crew who sailed the ships to Shanghai, stood on the right side of the command platform, closing their eyes and lowering their heads, seemingly with infinite sadness. The remaining Japanese crew members remained on board the ships.

### Not Boasting Because of Receiving Reparations, But Sufficient to Prove That Justice Will Be Done—Speech by Chairman Fang, Commander—

At 9:05 a.m., the music played, and after standing solemnly and singing the national anthem, Chairman Fang Ying, in an excited tone, spoke in front of the microphone. Fang pointed out that the foundation of human civilization lies in peace and mutual assistance. In the past, a few Japanese warlords disregarded public justice and harbored aggressive ambitions, thus causing World War II, but most Japanese people love peace. Now that the warlords have been overthrown, the Japanese people are moving towards the path of peace and democracy. A total of ninety-two warships are being paid to the Allied countries, divided into three batches. The first batch of thirty-two ships is divided into four groups, which were drawn by lot by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. China drew the third group, totaling 10,040 tons. The second batch of eight ships will arrive in Shanghai in two weeks, and the third batch of seven ships will arrive in another two weeks. Finally, Fang said that those who harbor aggressive ambitions will inevitably lose more than they gain and suffer the consequences themselves. First, mankind must practice mutual assistance in order to avoid war and ensure lasting peace. We are not boasting about the reparation warships we received today as war trophies, but this fact is sufficient to confirm that justice will be done. Finally, Commander Fang expressed his admiration and gratitude for the close cooperation between the Allied Headquarters of General MacArthur and our mission to Japan, and for the sincere piloting of the reparation ships to Shanghai by the Japanese sailors.

### Melodious Music, National Flag Rising

At 9:15 a.m., the master of ceremonies shouted "Lower the Japanese flag—" Officers, soldiers, and guests turned to face the "Yukikaze," and everyone was silent. Hundreds of pairs of eyes gathered on the sun flag on the top of the ship, regarding it as a symbol of Japanese imperialism, falling down. The joy in the hearts of hundreds of people was fully revealed in their expressions. Then the blue and red surrender flag was also taken down. At 9:20 a.m., the command platform shouted again "Raise the national flag." In the melodious music and the salute of all officers, soldiers, and guests, our blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flag slowly rose and fluttered under the blue sky, seeming even more solemn and beautiful.

After the flag-raising ceremony, Japanese sailors Ogata, etc., presented the acceptance letter. This acceptance letter had already been signed by our representative in Japan. Now, it was formally signed by Commander Fang Ying to complete the formalities. Then, Committee Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Committee and Zhang Bide, the representative of Mayor Wu, were invited to speak. They all felt deeply honored by the ceremony, believing that it was the end of the Japanese warlords' aggression and the harvest of the Chinese people's love of justice and peace. They also hoped to strengthen naval construction and be vigilant against countries that still harbor aggressive ambitions and destroy peace in the world. Finally, the ceremony was completed with gun salutes and music.

### Visiting the Xuefeng Warship

After the ceremony concluded at 9:40 AM, reporters boarded the "Xuefeng" warship for a tour. The ship is one of the largest destroyers of the eight received, weighing 2,490 tons. However, all the armaments had been removed, and the items on board gave a sense of disarray and dilapidation. The iron rails for transporting torpedoes at the stern were also heavily rusted. Re-equipping and renovating it would require considerable time. According to Director Yang of the Receiving Office, the new names for the ships have not yet been decided. For the time being, they will be distinguished by their tonnage as "Receiving No. 1" to "Receiving No. 8" to transport naval equipment received from various locations for assembly. After completion, the official names will be announced, along with the selection of the captains.

Additionally, the "Wakataka" warship, which escorted the eight ships to Shanghai, set sail to return to Japan at 11:00 AM after the receiving ceremony, carrying all the Japanese crew. Our liaison officer, Major Zhong Hanbo, and U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Kosha also accompanied the ship to Japan to prepare for escorting the second batch of warships to Shanghai.

### Commendation of Loyal Souls and Public Burial to be Held - Our Special Plane to Welcome - Yang Guangzheng's Remains - Today Arriving Directly in Nanjing from Manila - Ashes of Zhu Shaoping and Others to be Returned Simultaneously

[Report from Our Newspaper] Our country's former Consul General in Manila, Yang Guangzheng (see photo), due to his efforts in mobilizing overseas Chinese to raise funds in Manila during the War of Resistance to assist the motherland in resisting the enemy, was unfortunately killed by Japanese invaders on April 17th of the 31st year of the Republic. In order to commend the loyal souls who sacrificed their lives for the country, the government has ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to dispatch a special plane to fly to Manila to welcome the remains of the loyalist back to the country for a public burial in Beijing on a selected date. In addition, the ashes of seven staff members who died at the same time, including Zhu Shaoping (Vice Consul), will also be transported back to the motherland.

Philippine Overseas Chinese Respectfully Bid Farewell to the Remains of the Loyal Martyr

According to Ms. Yang Lilin, Yang's sister, she told reporters yesterday that Yang's remains will be flown directly from Manila to Beijing today, arriving around 4:00 or 5:00 PM.

They petitioned the government to send a special plane to welcome them back for a public burial. The overseas Chinese in Manila will hold a grand "July 7th" memorial service today, during which a farewell ceremony for Yang's remains will be held before being respectfully sent to the airport.

Our City Schedules a Memorial Service

The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Continental Newspaper, Hu She, World Society, Arctic Company, China Ren Society General Headquarters, and Tsinghua Alumni Association, among other organizations, recently organized a preparatory committee for a memorial service at the Tsinghua Alumni Association in the Citibank Building. After discussions between committee members Qi Yunqing, Zhang Guoxun, Xu Zhendong, Lu Meiseng, and Yang's family, it was decided to hold a memorial service at the Wu Liande Hall of the Asia Literary Society on Museum Road at 5:00 PM on the 10th of this month to comfort the loyal soul and express condolences. They also plan to establish a political lecture series at Yang's alma mater, Tsinghua University, to commemorate him permanently, and all donations received will be used to fund the lecture series.

Young, Handsome, and Held Important Positions

The following is a description of Yang's career:

Yang Guangzheng, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang, was born in Shanghai in the 11th year before the Republic of China (1900 AD). At the age of fifteen, he was admitted to Tsinghua School. After graduating five years later, he went to the United States and was admitted to Colorado University. After obtaining a bachelor's degree, he continued his studies at Princeton University, earning a master's and doctoral degree in political economics. He was only twenty-four years old at the time.

In 1924, he served as a secretary at the Chinese Embassy in the United States and attended the Geneva Opium Conference. In 1926, he returned to China and served as a professor at Tsinghua University. In the winter of 1927, he served as an assistant in the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and concurrently as the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, taking over the Beijing English Special Report and founding the China French Magazine.

Attended the Coronation of the British Monarch

In 1929, he married Ms. Yan Youyun, from the prominent Yan family of Cixi. After their honeymoon, he served as the Consul General in London. After three years, he was reassigned as the Director of the Chinese Information Office at the League of Nations. In 1933, he was recalled to China by Song Ziwen and founded the World Telegraph Agency, with branches in Geneva, Paris, and other places. He also served as the Foreign Affairs Inspection Commissioner for the five provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. In 1935, he took over the Continental Newspaper as General Manager and Editor-in-Chief.

Unyielding and Tragically Killed

After the August 13th Incident, he was ordered to remain overseas to carry out foreign propaganda and was subsequently transferred to serve as the Consul General in the Philippines. At that time, he launched a campaign to raise funds from overseas Chinese, obtaining 22 million Philippine pesos to donate to the country. After the fall of Manila, the Japanese invaders forced Yang to raise 24 million Philippine pesos for the Japanese army's military expenses, but Yang resolutely refused, leading to his and his staff's tragic death at the hands of the enemy.

Yang's wife, Ms. Yan, and her children are currently residing in New York. Ms. Yan is currently employed by the United Nations.

### Bail for Service Method - Postponed to Resume Next Year

[Report from Our Newspaper] Before the war, there was a method of bail for service in the courts, that is, after a prisoner was detained for a certain period, he could apply for a ruling for bail for service. This method was suspended during the War of Resistance and was originally scheduled to resume on July 1st of this year. The judicial organs of this city recently received an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to postpone it for six months and resume the bail for service method from New Year's Day next year.

### Arrested Students' Families - Request Re-trial Again - Supplemented Opinions Opposing Application of Martial Law

[Report from Our Newspaper] Reporters learned from the families of arrested students yesterday that after the families of the students arrested on the 25th of last month applied to the High Court for a retrial of the arrested students, the High Court sent a letter to the city government for inquiry. The city government then replied that the arresting agency was the Garrison Headquarters. The High Court then sent a letter to inquire with the Garrison Headquarters. The families recently supplemented their opinions, requesting the High Court to promptly conduct a retrial. The original statement listed five reasons, strongly opposing the application of martial law, and requested the High Court to conduct a retrial within 24 hours according to the law.

### The Navy Authorities - Investigated and Returned - Fuxing Island and Land - Owned by the Dredging Bureau

After the victory, the Navy Headquarters, in order to meet urgent needs, had designated all the land and buildings owned by the Shanghai Dredging Bureau on Fuxing Island, which had fallen into enemy hands, for use as a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. Fuxing Island is located in the middle section of this port, north of Yangshupu, and was originally a channel of the Huangpu River! It was formed into an island by the Dredging Bureau through the consolidation of waterways and land reclamation. Except for a small portion, the land on the island is owned by the Bureau, which established a civil engineering construction site on the island as an important base for guiding the engineering of the Huangpu River, on a grand scale. The naval authorities, considering that the Bureau is a water conservancy engineering organization in our country, and that the island's construction site could not be recovered for use, fearing that it would affect dredging and port affairs, it is now learned that General Commander Gui Yongqing has ordered the Commander of the First Base Area in Shanghai to investigate and return the portion of the property in the Fuxing Island camp that belongs to the Bureau, in order to facilitate the advancement of dredging work. It is also learned that the handover procedures between the two parties were completed on the 5th.

### Direct Telegraph Line Added Between Shanghai and Manila

The Ministry of Communications' International Radio Station and the Globe Wireless Telegraph Company simultaneously announced that, in addition to the original direct telegraph circuit between the International Radio Station Shanghai and the Globe Company San Francisco, they have now obtained the approval of our country's Ministry of Communications, the U.S. Communications Commission, and the Philippine government, and will officially add a direct telegraph circuit between the International Radio Station and the Globe Company Manila at 9:00 AM today (the 7th).

The Globe Company's Manila branch is equipped with a self-made, state-of-the-art high-speed telegraph typewriter that can transmit over a hundred words per minute, day and night, directly to San Francisco and New York. It is said that the speed and accuracy of this machine are far superior to those of other telegraph typewriters. The International Radio Station's Shanghai-San Francisco circuit is currently preparing to refit with this new machine.

### Jiangnan Shipyard Workers - Petition with Five Demands

The Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy had 5,000 workers last year. Starting in April of this year, due to a shortage of funds, lack of materials, and inability to carry out large-scale work, the number of workers was gradually reduced to over 2,000. Yesterday, some of the shipyard's workers took advantage of the weekly holiday to launch a march and petition, demanding five points: (1) Subsidize shipbuilding funds, (2) Expedite the allocation of US$500,000 in foreign exchange, (3) Guarantee employment, (4) Resume work, (5) Oppose shift changes.

### Pseudo-Official Xu Jinyuan - Prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office

After the victory, he was reported as a suspected traitor. The case was transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation by the military authorities. Recently, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution against him in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Item 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors.

### The Damachang Airport's Enclosed Land - To Be Collected by the Baoshan County Government

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhu Wenbin, a city councilor from the Damachang district, and Li Yanggao, the chairman of the district people's representative assembly, recently wrote to Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau, stating that the Damachang district has been taken over by the municipal government and requesting that the collection and return procedures for the land enclosed by the Damachang Airport be handled by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Director Zhu replied that the Land Administration Bureau had sent personnel to contact the Binshan County Government this year, because the Damachang base was originally within the jurisdiction of Baoshan County, and the land registration books had not yet been taken over. At that time, County Chief Cheng stated that the county government had submitted a request to the higher authorities to handle the collection. The Land Administration Bureau then submitted the contact process to the municipal government for approval. Later, the municipal government instructed that since the procedures had already been handled by the Baoshan County Government, there was no need to repeat them in order to avoid duplication. As for the boundary demarcation issue, it will be handled separately. Although the Ministry of Interior has convened two meetings, the boundary demarcation has not yet been finalized. Realistic Bandit-Catching Exercise - Solving the Case is as Easy as Turning One's Hand

[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 11:00 AM yesterday, the Songshan Police Sub-bureau received a phone report stating that there was a robbery at No. 56 Dakang Lane, Jianguo Road. Sub-bureau Chief Song Tingjun personally led the criminal investigation section chief Shen Zuoluo and all the volunteer police and judicial section police officers to pursue the bandits by car. However, the bandits had already fled far away. According to the victim, the two bandits were both armed with handguns. One was wearing a white Hong Kong shirt and shorts, with a straw hat. The other was wearing a Xiangyunsha shirt and pants. After the robbery, they fled along South Tibet Road. Sub-bureau Chief Song immediately ordered a chase. Arriving at the scene, they saw no trace of the bandits, then turned to the Fuxing Middle Road Caishi Road intersection and asked a traveling car dealership if anyone had hired a car. The dealership replied that two people with such attire had arrived and hired a car to go west. The car was sent back to the dealership, and according to the driver's report, the two passengers got out of the car at the Da Hu Hotel near Dongxin Bridge and went inside. They then went to the hotel and found the two bandits in a room on the second floor, arrested them, and confiscated their weapons and stolen goods, bringing them back to the bureau together. From the time the case was reported to the time it was solved, it took only about forty minutes. It turned out to be a bandit-catching exercise.

### Public Bus - Improvement - Ventilation - Equipment - Installation Already Completed - Joining Lines in Operation

Regarding the Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee's improvement of ventilation equipment on public buses, the committee has been proceeding separately with: (1) Two louvered windows are being manufactured on both sides of the original front windows at the front of each bus. All of them can be opened on sunny days to absorb air, and after closing on rainy days, air can still pass through the louvers. (2) The upper half of the windows on both sides of the bus body are now changed to open downwards, so as not to block the windows after passengers are seated. (3) The committee has also stationed service personnel at the main stations to discourage passengers from boarding the bus without restrictions, as reducing passenger density effectively increases air circulation.

The committee has completed the modification of car No. 448 and others, which are now operating on Line 3 and are indeed effective. In addition, the committee has lengthened the bodies of the T2, T3, and T4 Dodge cars and remanufactured them into formal public buses with aluminum skin bodies. Another twenty-five vehicles were completed a few days ago. It was originally planned to open Line 12 with them, but now, in order to divert congestion on various lines, it has been decided to first join the original lines in operation. The opening date of Line 12 will be decided after the new cars under construction are completed.

### Duanmu Kai's Legal Perspective: A Step Closer to Democracy After the Current Government Reorganization

[Our Newspaper] This newspaper held its fourteenth Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the China Broadcasting Station, inviting renowned lawyer Duanmu Kai to speak on "Looking at the Current Government from a Legal Perspective." The following is a summary of his speech:

Recently, the government underwent a reorganization characterized by two features: (1) In addition to the existing Kuomintang, the China Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party also participated. In the National Government Committee, there are National Government Committee members from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties. In the Executive Yuan, there are political affairs committee members from both parties, and two ministers from the Youth Party. In the Legislative Yuan, there are legislators from both parties. Although individuals from the two parties have not yet participated in the Judicial, Control, and Examination Yuans, this does not affect the significance of this government reorganization. (2) This government reorganization implements a responsible cabinet system, with the Executive Yuan directly responsible to the National Government Committee. This system is not without precedent in European and American political history, but there are also differences. For example, the United Kingdom had coalition cabinets of various parties during wartime, but these required parliamentary approval. In France, due to the small size of the parties, almost no single party could form a cabinet alone. Each cabinet was composed of several parties and also required parliamentary approval. In the United States, although the Republican Party recruited individuals into the cabinet during wartime, they were only responsible to President Roosevelt personally, while the Democratic Party was responsible to Congress regarding the government. China's Executive Yuan being responsible to the National Government Committee is slightly different.

Three Stages of Revolution

Since the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang has implemented a one-party dictatorship, up until this reorganization. When we study the reasons for its one-party dictatorship, there are three bases: (1) Theoretical basis: The Kuomintang is the party that created the Republic of China, and its sole purpose is to create a democratic country. However, the people of a democratic country must have the skills and knowledge to exercise democracy in their habits and political cultivation. People initially liberated from an autocratic system lack this quality. Therefore, President Sun divided the revolution into three stages: A. Military government period, B. Tutelage period, C. Constitutional government period. First, military force is used to clear obstacles to the revolution's future. Then, during the Tutelage period, a provisional constitution is promulgated to train people to have a deep understanding of democracy, and only then can the Constitutional government period be effectively entered. Therefore, one-party tutelage is a necessary stage of the revolution.

Lessons from Facts, Legal Basis

(2) Factual basis: After the establishment of the Republic of China, the Kuomintang once transferred power to Yuan Shikai. During that period, Yuan proclaimed himself emperor, there was a restoration of the monarchy, the parliament was dissolved, and warlords carved up the country, experiencing countless sufferings. After the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic, it was clearly realized that political power could not be handed over casually, allowing reactionaries to take the opportunity to diminish the revolutionary movement. Therefore, the one-party dictatorship was not relaxed in the slightest, which is indeed a lesson from reality. (3) Legal basis: According to Article 30 of the Provisional Constitution, "During the Tutelage period, the National Congress of the Kuomintang shall exercise the central ruling power on behalf of the National Congress." Therefore, the ruling power of the National Government is granted by the Provisional Constitution and cannot be changed. Unless the constitution is completed, the constitution is promulgated and implemented, and the Provisional Constitution naturally ceases; or the National Assembly re-amends the Provisional Constitution, there is no other way to change it. This is the legal basis for the one-party dictatorship.

How to Explain the Three-Party Government?

Since the Kuomintang has implemented a one-party dictatorship, how can the formation of a three-party coalition government before the implementation of party politics be explained? First, although the Kuomintang practices a one-party dictatorship, it only employs people based on talent and ability. In the past, not only were there many non-party members participating in government work as administrative officials, but there were also many as political officials. Since the Kuomintang is entrusted by the people to form a government, the participation of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties in the government has been agreed by the Kuomintang and must also be agreed by the people. Second, although there are more than two parties, there must be one party that takes the lead. Even in Western multi-party cabinets, there can only be one prime minister, and one party must bear more responsibility. The current government of China is still led by the Kuomintang, which also bears more responsibility. This does not hinder the Provisional Constitution.

A Renewed Impression at Home and Abroad

Our impression of this government reorganization can be summarized as taking a step closer to democracy. In terms of the evolution of the National Government, it can be called a one-power system when it was first established, with the chairman of the National Government directly exercising the five powers of legislation, administration, judiciary, supervision, and examination. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, the five Yuans were separated, but this was a division of labor, not a division of power. After the September 18th Incident in the twenty-first year of the Republic, the five Yuans were directly responsible to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. This was a change from division of labor to division of power, and the changes gradually moved towards democracy. However, one-party dictatorship is difficult for the people to understand, no matter how hard the efforts. Therefore, there are new measures for this government reorganization. The possible impacts of this reorganization are threefold: (1) It shows that the Kuomintang is willing to open up political power. (2) Any party, as long as it is a legal activity, is allowed by the government. (3) Politics is practical experience. The Kuomintang's dictatorship for more than ten years has prevented people from other parties from engaging in politics. This government reorganization allows people outside the Kuomintang to gain experience in practical politics. Therefore, after this government reorganization, there is a renewed impression at home and abroad, and we evaluate it as "taking a step closer to democracy."

### China National Aviation Corporation Car Accident: Police Officer Couple Injured, One Dead

### Retired Youth Army Lays Down to Block Train

At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, more than sixty students from Jiaxing Middle School (i.e., retired Youth Army) including Zhou Bo and Zou Zhiming, who were specially trained by the Cadre Training Office of the Ministry of National Defense, arrived in Shanghai from Jiaxing by military train. They immediately jumped onto the FP726 first-class carriage of the Jinghu 8th Express Train, which was parked on the sixth platform of the North Station, preventing passengers who had purchased tickets from boarding. Captain Hong of the station's military police company went to persuade them, but was refused, and the two sides stood in stalemate for more than half an hour. The students then lay down on the tracks to prevent the train from heading west. In order to maintain traffic and protect the interests of passengers, the Railway Bureau was forced to have the railway police and military police pull all the students lying on the tracks off the platform, and the 8th train was able to depart, but it was delayed by more than an hour. In order to alleviate their economic difficulties, the Railway Bureau added a third-class carriage to the 58th train to Nanjing at 5:00 p.m. to send the sixty-odd retired students back to their hometown, and the dispute was resolved.

### Ebbs Company Gold Note Case: Macebow Appeals to the Supreme Court: Four Main Points of Reasoning

[Our Newspaper] In the case of Dutch national Macebow disrupting finance, the High Court previously sentenced him to one year in prison and confiscated US$65,369.71 and HK$20,000. Macebow refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. The main points of his reasons for the appeal are as follows: (1) When the appellant was arrested on March 3 of this year and the foreign currency of the American Ebbs Company was seized, there was no law in China punishing the buying and selling of foreign currency. (2) The Chinese government's "Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency" became law on February 27 of this year, but according to the regulations on the effective date of laws promulgated on December 23 of the 21st year of the Republic, the above-mentioned measures had not become law in Shanghai on the date when the appellant was arrested and the foreign currency of Ebbs Company was seized. (3) Ebbs Company is not a bank, so the appellant cannot be regarded as a bank manager. Ebbs Company is engaged in the business of selling and trading TTDD foreign exchange and has never accepted any deposits of any kind. The deposit of HK$20,000 paid by the Lei Da Company to Ebbs Company and the US$40,000 security deposit recovered by Ebbs Company from a third party are not bank deposits. (4) The original judgment confiscated a total of US$65,369.71 and HK$20,000. Even if the Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency should be effective, the part of the original judgment that confiscated the money is still confused.

### Postal Questions and Answers

[Regulations] (1) This column is published every Monday and answered by the Public Service Group of the Post Office. (2) Letters to this column are limited to questions related to various departments of the Post Office and related to the public. (3) Please indicate "Postal Affairs" in the upper left corner of the envelope to avoid paying postage. (4) Letters should be sent to the Public Service Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration or forwarded by this

Newspaper's "Social Service" column.

This bureau has received inquiries from (1) Mr. Wen Shaowei, Xinzha Road, (2) Mr. Wang Erling, Shengze Dongbaiyang (3) Mr. Ru Xin of Shanghai (4) Ms. Zhu Yunping, Hankou Road, and (5) Mr. Chao Zixing, Wujin Taicheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory. We will briefly answer the points raised below:

(Answer) (1) (A) "Postage stamps that have been announced as abolished by the Post Office may be exchanged for new stamps from the postal authority within six months from the date of abolition" (Article 10 of the Postal Law). Other than that, once postage stamps are sold, they will not be redeemed or exchanged to prevent abuses. This is based on the provisions of Article 136 of the Postal Rules. (B) Large-denomination postage stamps you mentioned can be used permanently unless there is an order to abolish them.

(2) (A) The Nanyang region is vast, and the distance from Shanghai varies. The time required for postal transportation is also different. For example, it takes about ten days by airmail to send to Batavia or Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies, and about three weeks by land and sea. It takes only five or six days by airmail to send to Singapore or Penang, and about sixteen days by land and sea. We are not sure where you are referring to when you say Nanyang. (B) Postal recruitment is always announced in newspapers, and the qualifications are also stated in the announcement. There will be no examinations held in the near future. (C) Pingliang Road is in District 19, and Wuchang Road is in District 5 east of Zha Pu Road, and District 0 west of it.

(3) Mail sent to Surabaya, Java, and land and sea mail is transported directly to Surabaya or Batavia. If there are no ships that go directly to Java, they will be taken to Singapore or Hong Kong for transit. Airmail is sent by plane to Hong Kong for delivery. If there are China National Aviation Corporation planes flying to Calcutta, then they will be transferred from Calcutta. The Shanghai-Calcutta route is the fastest, but it is only once a week (sealed and sent on Fridays). For the rest, please refer to the previous question.

(4) (A) Clothing and daily necessities can be sent as small packages, but the cloth clothing must first be inspected by the customs. (B) Small packages are limited to one kilogram and calculated in units of one hundred centimeters. Currently, the postage for small packages to Anhui is 1,131 yuan per hundred centimeters. (C) Small packages can be sent to postal agencies for delivery. (5) (A) A minimum deposit of 1,000 yuan in national currency is required to open a postal savings account. (B) You should be able to withdraw money at any time with your account book, but you must leave at least 1,000 yuan. (C) The interest rate is 1% per week, calculated daily.

Postal Proxy

To Mr. Yang Yunbo: I have received your letter. The Yishe in this area is at No. 16, Lane 153, South Huangpi Road (Beile Road), Chinese Chess Association. There are many famous masters in the club. You can also play chess at the Pinfang Tea House, which is diagonally opposite the Pudong Wenxiang Association on Zhongzheng Middle Road, but it is of a lesser quality than the Chinese Chess Association.

### Suzhou Industrial College of Jiangsu Province Enrolls New Students in Four Departments

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou News] Suzhou Industrial College of Jiangsu Province was founded in the first year of the Republic of China and has a long history. Various workshops and laboratories are well-equipped. During the Anti-Japanese War, it suffered major damage.

It is reported that this summer, the school's textile, mechanical, civil engineering, and architecture departments are all recruiting new students, and it is expected that the number of applicants will be quite large.

### Yu Shangyuan Will Not Participate in the Drama Experts Meeting; It is Reported That the Issue of Travel Expenses to the Meeting Has Become an Obstacle

UNESCO Secretary-General Huxley previously sent letters to the Minister of Education of China and Yu Shangyuan, inviting Yu to participate in the "Drama Experts Meeting" organized by the organization as an expert. The meeting is scheduled to be held in Paris starting on the 28th of this month. Its main task is to discuss assisting the drama revival and development of countries ravaged by the Nazis and to prepare for the establishment of the "International Drama Society." Mr. Yu immediately followed the instructions of the other party and sent letters to solicit the opinions of the main figures of Chinese drama. He also disclosed the documents sent by the other party in the newspaper. After collecting them, he sent the "Proposal" on June 19 for inclusion in the agenda. The main points of the proposal are to hope to set up a "Far East Branch of the International Drama Society" in China and to donate and build experimental theaters, drama libraries, and museums in Nanjing and other places. It is now known that regarding Mr. Yu's travel expenses, the other party only bears half of the round-trip travel expenses to France and the living expenses during the meeting, estimated at about 500 US dollars. According to the investigation, this trip requires about 3,000 US dollars (Mr. Dong Shouyi's trip to Europe to participate in the Olympic Games was subsidized by the Chinese government to this amount). It was recently reported that the Ministry of Education can only subsidize Mr. Yu 1,000 US dollars, and the difference of 1,500 US dollars is twice the actual need, so it is impossible to make the trip in reality.

### Tuition Increase in Beiping City Next Semester; The Number of Students Dropping Out of School Will Increase Dramatically; Students from Private Universities are Making Plans to Stop School and Find Employment

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] Due to the increase in tuition fees for universities, middle schools, and primary schools in Beiping City next semester, the number of students dropping out of school will increase dramatically. Although the tuition fees of private schools have not yet been determined, it is estimated that universities will be around 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, middle schools will also be between 300,000 and 500,000 yuan, and primary schools will be around 300,000 yuan. Therefore, after the municipal or national schools began to enroll and register, the crowding of applicants was unprecedented. On average, each municipal middle school will only recruit 200 new students, while the number of applicants reaches 5,000 to 6,000. Despite the rain all day, the number of applicants has not decreased slightly. The number of applicants in one day has exceeded the total number of applicants in previous years. Those who apply for the second grade of municipal junior high schools do not hesitate to move back one year to apply for the first grade. On the registration certificates, there are many "verified" stamps of four or five schools. According to middle school students studying in private schools, the cost of accommodation and meals will not be less than 2 million yuan next semester. Most schools must pay all at once before the start of the semester. This is not something that ordinary families can afford. The accumulated letters of solicitation by the principals of each municipal primary and secondary school are quite impressive. Students from private universities anticipate the difficulties of the future, and some of them are making plans to stop school and find employment. However, due to the large number of unemployed people, finding employment is not easy. There are also many students in the second, third, and fourth grades who are preparing to re-enroll in the first grade of national universities. The situation is even worse for those whose families are in the communist area and have cut off assistance. The Beiping Education Bureau originally planned to increase schools and increase class sizes next semester, but due to financial difficulties, almost all of them cannot be realized.

### Mingde Girls' School in South Shanghai

New School Building Completed

Tuition Reduced by Half

The three-story new school building of the private Mingde Girls' Primary and Secondary School in Shanghai, located at its original site in Huajinfang, Huajin Road, South Shanghai, has been fully completed. In addition to classrooms and offices, it now has laboratories, music rooms, workshops, libraries, and a grand auditorium, all fully equipped. The school has decided that starting next semester, in addition to continuing operations at the old site at 688 Linsen Road, the South Shanghai branch will first resume its kindergarten, primary school, and junior high school levels. The junior high school will exclusively enroll girls, while the other levels will be co-educational. Furthermore, given the post-war social and economic decline and the lack of recovery of prosperity in South Shanghai, the school fears that parents will be unable to bear the tuition fees according to the standard fees set by private schools. As there are only two municipal girls' high schools in the city with relatively low fees and limited enrollment, which cannot meet the actual demand, the school has decided to reduce tuition fees as much as possible in order to popularize girls' education and take into account the burden on parents, halving the fees according to the standards set by private schools, in line with the original intention of establishing the school.

### Oriental Economic Library to Officially Open Today; Director Tao Xisheng Received the Press for a Visit Yesterday

[Our Report] The Oriental Economic Library, which has been in preparation for many years, is now ready and will officially open today. Director Tao Xisheng and Deputy Director Lin Side of the library received members of the press in the city for a visit yesterday. Initiators such as Du Yuesheng, Li Fuxun, Zhou Zuomin, Qian Xinzhi, and Qin Runqing believe that economic research is of utmost importance at the beginning of national construction, and that the lack of an economic library in Shanghai, the economic center of the country, is a serious deficiency. They therefore reorganized the books received as enemy and traitor property after the victory, and widely collected and cited materials to complete this pioneering undertaking. The library collects more than 200,000 volumes on economics, doctrines, history, geography, events, institutions, policies, technologies, narratives, and various valuable historical materials. Among them, Japanese books account for about 60%, and the remaining 40% is equally divided between Chinese and Western languages. The Japanese have always paid great attention to economic surveys in our country, and during the war, they carried out systematic economic research in their occupied areas. Currently, the Oriental Economic Library has a portion of unfinished works by the Japanese, which are awaiting further research and completion by the Chinese. The library's reading regulations stipulate that reading hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily, with holidays, the following day, and Mondays closed. All visitors to the library need to purchase a "reading ticket" at a cost of 1,000 legal tender per ticket, valid for the day. The library is located at 523 Yuguo Road in this city. Readers who find it inconvenient due to distance can have meals in the library.

### Oriental Economic Research Institute Establishes Scholarships

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Oriental Research Institute, a new organization engaged in research on China's economic construction after the victory, is headed by Tao Xisheng. Recently, in order to promote academic research and reward talent, it has established scholarships. Any students in their third or fourth year of study in the departments of economics, business administration, agriculture, accounting, or statistics at accredited universities, whose grades are in the top four and have proof, can apply. It is stipulated that 500,000 yuan will be issued per person per semester, but they must work at the institute for two years after graduation. It has now been decided to start with universities in the capital.

### The Only Institution of Higher Learning in Luoyang: Jiaozuo Institute of Technology

— Fan Hong, Our Correspondent in Luoyang

Leaving Luoyang City, crossing the Luo River, and heading south along the Luonan Highway, after traveling about fifteen li, one can see a large area of cypress groves surrounded by red walls. This is one of Luoyang's famous historical sites - the Guan Di Forest. Immediately to the east of the Guan Di Forest, with a small lake at the entrance, surrounded by desolate and miserable gray soil and broken walls, appears particularly deserted. This is the location of the only institution of higher learning in Luoyang today: the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology.

The Jiaozuo Institute of Technology, abbreviated as Jiaogong, was originally located in Jiaozuo, northern Henan, famous for its coal production along the Daoging Railway Line. Later, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and in 1937, when the enemy reached Anyang, Jiaogong moved to Xi'an. In 1938, it moved again to Tianshui, Gansu. In July, it was ordered to merge with the Engineering College of National Northwest Associated University and the Engineering College of National Northeast University to form the National Northwest Institute of Technology, located in Guluba, Chenggu, Shaanxi. In October 1945, it was approved to restore the school. Since Jiaozuo was occupied by the Communist army and suffered severe damage, making it impossible to move back, it was agreed to use the old wounded soldier hospital in the Guan Di Forest of Luoyang as a temporary school site, and enrollment and classes began in October 1946. Thanks to the painstaking efforts of President Zhang Qinglian over the past year, although the facilities in various departments are simple, they have all stepped onto the right track, restoring the old appearance of the past, and creating the foundation for an institution of higher learning in Luoyang. We cannot help but congratulate western Henan, the mining industry, and our fellow students!

Jiaogong currently has about 160 students in the two departments of mining and metallurgy, as well as the preparatory class, distributed in more than 100 empty rooms and a courtyard of dozens of acres, which is quite comfortable and compact. Most of the professors are the original veterans, which new schools cannot catch up with.

Students get up at 5:00 AM every day, and classes start at 8:00 AM. According to the timetable, they attend seven or eight classes in a row to complete the day's tasks. At night, oil lamps illuminate the classrooms and dormitories, and everywhere there is diligent thought, with pens and brushes constantly scratching. The quiet air is a bit stifling, almost the opposite of the situation when reading English every morning. After class, or on Saturdays, or after an exam, there are not many fans on the sports field. Most go to the streets to stroll, sit in tea houses. The streets in the Guan Di Forest have become increasingly desolate recently. Only the quiet tea houses, a bit like the south, cannot help but make people think of the southern country, especially when the sun sets and the breeze stirs the green shade, making people linger.

Students not only have a good reading atmosphere and a regular life, but also get along well with each other. Although they come from thousands of miles away and have slightly different accents, the harmonious atmosphere is always maintained thoroughly. There are no disputes, let alone fights, which saves the training staff a lot of work.

Almost every afternoon, they go to the Longmen Coal Mine, ten li away, for practice. This regular procession attracts the attention of the nearby people, making them aware that living in a university is not just about eating idle rice and putting on airs.

However, it is regrettable that the library is too empty, the extracurricular activities are too quiet, the experimental equipment has not been shipped back, and the exams are not free from being a joke. We cannot blame Jiaogong; very few schools in the country are not guilty of these problems. Therefore, we can only seek spiritual gain and victory.

Jiaogong was founded on March 1, three years before the founding of the Republic of China, initially by the British Fu Company to fulfill a contract, and was named the Jiaozuo Railway and Mining School. In 1915, the Zhongyuan Company was established and jointly operated with the Fu Company, renaming it the Fu Zhong Mining School. In 1919, it was renamed the Fu Zhong Mining College, offering specialized undergraduate courses. In 1921, adapting to the school system, it was renamed the Fu Zhong Mining University. In 1926, the Fu Company ceased operations, and the Zhongyuan Company provided all the funding. In 1931, it was renamed the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology, adding a civil engineering department. In 1933, it was ordered to change the department into a faculty. Currently, the Fu Zhong Company subsidizes 20 million yuan per month (in the past few months, it was 10 million yuan), and the Minsheng Coal Mining Company and the Longmen Coal Mining Bureau each subsidize 1% of coal production. Together with subsidies from the provincial government, the Ministry of Education, and other sources, it can reach more than 30 million yuan per month. After deducting expenses of more than 20 million yuan, there is still a small surplus, and the future development is very optimistic.

This semester has already ended, and 100 new students for this year will be enrolled in Luoyang and Kaifeng on August 5th and 6th respectively. Unfortunately, because the school site is small, the preparatory class will not be continued this year, and the classes in each department are limited and cannot be expanded. In fact, it will make thousands of high school graduates long for it, with no way to advance.

Graduates of Jiaogong are almost all over every corner of the country, especially in the Huainan Coal Mine, Jiaozuo Coal Mine, Minsheng Coal Mine, Longmen Coal Mine, and Yiluo Coal Mine, which are all the achievements of Jiaogong alumni.

Currently, schools across the country are making a fuss about various issues, such as strikes, sending representatives to the capital to petition, and holding meetings. Only Yugong is quietly far away in the Guan Di Forest, fifteen li outside Luoyang City, peacefully avoiding this storm. This is not only the blessing of the school's faculty, staff, and students, but also the blessing of western Henan! I wish Jiaogong eternal life, strength, and prosperity!

### Wimbledon Championships End; American Players Reach the Pinnacle; Win Four and a Half of the Five Major Titles

[French News Agency, Wimbledon, 5th] At this year's Wimbledon Tennis Championships, American athletes showed irresistible momentum, surpassing the achievements of 1938 and 1937. The United States won four of the five championships, and also made it into one mixed doubles final.

[United Press, Wimbledon, 5th] Today, the sky is low and windy, representing the English summer. On the closing day of Wimbledon, 20,000 spectators attended, including Queen Mary, Prime Minister Attlee, and US Ambassador to the UK Douglas. The women's doubles final created a huge upset, with Miss Hard and Mrs. Duthie defeating last year's champions Miss Brough and Miss Osborne 3-6, 6-4, 7-5. In the women's singles final, Miss Osborne defeated Miss Hard 6-2, 6-4. In the men's doubles final, to everyone's surprise, the "hope of the British Empire," young players Mottram and Sidwell of Australia, lost to Americans Kramo and Fogenburg 8-6, 6-3, 6-3. Today was a great day for America, winning all the championships and half of the mixed doubles. Australian Brownwich and American Miss Brough defeated Australian Langer and South African Mrs. Bowalton 1-6, 6-4, 6-2. Most of the tennis performances today were of extremely high standard. Even Queen Mary, at the age of 80, was very interested and sat for a long time. After the women's doubles match, Duthie and Hard went to the royal box, where they received two bouquets of flowers each from Queen Mary and the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, wearing a white hat and scarlet dress, personally presented the silver cup for the women's singles champion to Miss Osborne, a veteran from California. In the men's singles final, Kramo and Fogenburg entered the arena in gray velvet jackets amidst cheers, breaking the tradition of wearing white jackets.

[Reuters, Wimbledon, 5th] Osborne, a 30-year-old veteran from California, became the new tennis champion, defeating Hard, a 22-year-old student at the University of Miami, Florida, 6-2, 6-4. In this way, both the men's and women's Wimbledon champions in 1947 were from California. Kramo is also from California. Perhaps because of the competition in the central arena, the game did not reach the highest standard, revealing nervousness. Hard's usually steady ball play was out of order today. The men's doubles, on the other hand, featured many wonderful shots. In the women's doubles final, Hard and Duthie's victory over Osborne and Brough was very thrilling. In fact, after each winning a set 3-6, 6-4, Osborne and Brough led 5-3 in the third set, and Brough was serving, "40-0." Hard and Duthie saved three points in a row to escape danger, and then won three consecutive games to win the championship, which can be said to be very fortunate. In the Fruit Plate Challenge, Mrs. Jerzykowski of Poland defeated Britain's Blair Heaven 6-6-1, 7-5 to retain the championship. In the men's singles final, Stad of South Africa defeated Mottram of Britain 6-3, 6-3.

### Table Tennis Finals Produce an Upset; Green Team Defeats Hualian

Tonight, Post A Faces Hualianhua

The seventh match of the second Table Tennis League Finals was held at the Central Assembly Hall at 8:00 PM the night before last. Hualian, the champion of the third division, faced the Green Team, the runner-up of the fourth division. Hualian was a veteran team with strength above the Green Team. However, due to incorrect lineup arrangements and bad luck, they were unable to perform as desired. On the other hand, the Green Team, with concerted efforts, became more and more courageous. Especially in the third and fifth groups, the battles were the most thrilling. Green Team's Chen Yinzhou and Qin Duye fought fiercely for five games, each winning 3-2 against Hualian's top players Lu Wenliang and Li Zaichun, thus laying the foundation for victory and creating an upset. When Hualian's main players Li Zhen and chopper Zhong Zhihui displayed their power in the sixth and seventh groups, the overall situation had been decided, and it was of no help. As a result, the Green Team defeated Hualian 4-3. The results are as follows:

(Green Team) (Hualian) (Score)

Li Ronglong Pan Rixi 3-0

### Municipal High School Sports Association Volleyball Finals; Tongji and Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School Win Men's and Women's Championships Respectively

Huayan Wins Exhibition Match Against Soviet Union

The middle school volleyball league organized by the Municipal Secondary School Sports Association held its finals for both men's and women's groups at the gymnasium of the Municipal Sports Hall starting at 1:30 PM yesterday. Due to the hot weather, the audience was not very crowded. As a result of the final battle, the women's group of Municipal No. 1 defeated Aiguo 2-1 and won the championship. The men's group of Tongji Affiliated Middle School defeated Zhongzhi A in straight sets and won the title. After the competition, an exhibition match was held between Huayan and the Soviet Union A team. The Soviet Union team was late, and Gok Deng only appeared at 4:20 PM. The original plan was to win three out of five games. After three games, it was already 5:00 PM. Because there were four makeup games for the B Group Industrial and Commercial Basketball League, it could not be concluded. The results of the three games were that Huayan led 2-1.

In the women's group final, Municipal No. 1 faced Aiguo. The referee was Hu Xidi. In the first game, Aiguo took the lead and maintained the advantage all the way. After the change of sides, Municipal No. 1 chased hard and unexpectedly caught up later, winning 21-19. In the second game, the competition between the two sides was even more intense. After 16-16, they tied repeatedly. Aiguo relied on their final efforts to tie the score 21-20 with a score of 21-20. In the final game, Municipal No. 1 became more and more courageous. On the other hand, Aiguo's energy gradually declined, and they finally could not hold on. Municipal No. 1 won 21-15 to secure the victory. The overall result was 2-1, and Municipal No. 1 defeated Aiguo to win the championship.

The men's group final followed, with Tongji Affiliated Middle School facing Zhongzhi A. The referee was Wu Zibin. After the start of the game, because of the difference in strength between the two sides, the battle was not as tense as the women's group. Tongji Affiliated Middle School won 21-13 and 21-17 successively. Zhongzhi Tian lost in straight sets, and Tongfu won the men's group championship. In the exhibition match, Huayan performed exceptionally well. They easily took the first game 21-14. In the second game, the Soviet Union strengthened their defense and tried their best to counterattack, and they did manage to win 21-17. In the third game, the Huayan army regained its momentum and broke through again 21-17. It was almost 5:00 PM and could not continue. Huayan led 2-1. The results of each game and the lineups of the four teams in the men's and women's finals are recorded below:

### Guangdong Provincial Bank General Manager Discusses the Current Overseas Remittance Problem and Proposes an Outline for Improving Overseas Remittance Policies

[Our Newspaper] Liu Zuoren, General Manager of Guangdong Provincial Bank, has been in Suzhou since the beginning of last month, attending the National Provincial Banks Joint Annual Meeting. He is currently passing through Shanghai on his way back to Guangdong. He took time to meet with reporters to discuss the current issues with overseas remittances and gave the following statement:

Overseas remittances are of great importance, and have previously been a significant item in balancing China's international balance of payments. Today, they are the primary source for supplementing China's foreign exchange reserves. They have significant implications for China's finances, fiscal policies, and economy.

Based on statistics that are available from various sources, the historical amounts of overseas remittances are as follows (unit: millions of national currency): Year 21: 323, Year 22: 305, Year 23: 232, Year 24: 316, Year 25: 320, Year 26: 450, Year 27: 600, Year 28: 1200, Year 29: 1800, Year 30: 244, Year 31: 862, Year 32: 2400, Year 33: 1482, Year 34 (January to August): 286.

Since Year 25, overseas remittances have been more than sufficient to offset the amount of excess imports. However, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, annual overseas remittances averaged approximately 1 billion national currency. Although this amount was three times higher than before the war, due to currency depreciation, the actual amount of overseas remittances during the war is estimated to be about one-third less than the pre-war amount.

After the post-war recovery, there was a constant difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate for overseas remittances. Coupled with the daily depreciation of the currency, lengthy remittance times, complicated procedures, and other factors, the general trend of overseas remittances has been decreasing. It is estimated that the total amount of national overseas remittances after the post-war recovery averages approximately 17 billion yuan per month, or approximately 200 billion yuan per year. If calculated based on the rate of currency depreciation, overseas remittances after the post-war recovery are approximately one-seventh of the pre-war annual average of 300 million yuan.

Accepting Institutions

The Bank of China's overseas remittance figures are estimated to account for approximately 50% of the total national overseas remittances during the war. After the post-war recovery, with the re-establishment of silver shops, money houses, and remittance agencies, the Bank of China's share of overseas remittances has decreased to approximately 30%. The remaining 70% is mostly remitted through foreign banks or private domestic silver shops and remittance agencies, indicating that a large portion of overseas remittances has been evaded.

Concentrated in Hong Kong

Currently, overseas remittances from all countries in the Americas or British territories are mostly concentrated in Hong Kong, making Hong Kong the center for overseas remittance evasion. In recent months, as the black market exchange rate has been much higher than the official rate, the evasion of overseas remittances to Hong Kong has been increasing daily. It is estimated that recently, the amount of overseas remittances evading to Hong Kong has reached US$10 million per month. The result of overseas remittance evasion to Hong Kong has a significant impact on China's economy, which can be analyzed in three points: (1) It deprives China of a source of foreign exchange to offset the excess of foreign trade deficits, making the international financial balance more complicated. (2) Overseas remittances flowing into foreign banks become frozen funds, which are not only not invested in domestic production and construction projects, but also deepen the domestic economic crisis if they become floating capital participating in speculative activities. (3) It directly contributes to the prosperity of Hong Kong and indirectly enriches the foreign exchange reserves of the United States, offsetting the excess of the British international balance of payments.

Improvement Strategies

Reviewing past overseas remittance policies, it is believed that the main problems that urgently need improvement in the future are: (1) Strengthening the overseas remittance network, (2) Reducing the difference between the official exchange rate and the market rate for foreign exchange, (3) Improving the remittance and payment methods, and (4) Providing services to overseas compatriots.

How to strengthen the absorption of overseas remittances should start with loosening regulations and expanding the overseas remittance network. Overseas Chinese are located in various places. In addition to the Bank of China setting up branches in major overseas cities, local banks in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, as well as other banks handling overseas remittances, should be allowed to establish branches in areas with a higher concentration of overseas Chinese. Banks should maintain close ties with remittance agencies that specialize in absorbing funds from lower and middle-class overseas Chinese. In addition, banks should continue to seek more agents or correspondent banks, and should also increase the number of overseas remittance payment institutions domestically.

There are three opinions on how to reduce the difference between the official exchange rate and the market rate for foreign exchange. (1) The best approach is to bring the official rate closer to the market rate, adjusting the exchange rate at any time to eliminate the difference between the two. Alternatively, the official rate could be abolished altogether, allowing the exchange rate to stabilize at a natural level. (2) Implement a subsidy policy. The amount of the subsidy must be increased at any time, and it is best for local national banks to consult with local overseas remittance banks to determine a rate that is close to or not lower than the black market exchange rate. (3) Handle foreign currency remittances and deposits, i.e., so-called original currency deposits. When overseas remittances in the original currency are returned to the country, they should be deposited into an account, and payments should be made in national currency based on the exchange rate and subsidy method on the day of payment.

How to improve the remittance and payment methods: the collection and payment should be simple and quick, the procedures should be simplified, and everything should be scientifically managed to achieve speed and efficiency. The attitude of the staff should be gentle and courteous.

There are three opinions on how to serve overseas compatriots:

(1) The government should assist overseas Chinese in their economic recovery. (2) Domestic and foreign overseas remittance banks should establish an overseas Chinese service organization to facilitate communication. (3) In cases where overseas compatriots or their families have financial difficulties or have their remittances cut off, low-interest loans should be provided.

Liu concluded that although the current overseas remittance problem is caused by the significant difference between the official rate and the black market rate, leading to remittance evasion, a satisfactory solution can be achieved if the aforementioned improvement measures are implemented. With the large number of overseas Chinese today, as long as we provide good guidance and actively absorb remittances, the future of overseas remittances remains bright.

### The Reproduction Industry Fights Again for Yarn Allocation; The Production of Yarn, Although Improved Due to Original Cotton, Is Still Insufficient

The textile industry association's cotton yarn allocation work, involving more than 300 reproduction businesses from both local and out-of-town areas, has been its target, and disputes in this area have been ongoing for years. This time, the joint allocation has expanded from local to outer areas such as Dangxi Wu, etc., and the number of yarn factories subject to requisitions is 67 units. The scale is large, and the strength is thick. According to related sources, the 20,000-piece joint allocation method being tested is only the beginning and is not yet normal. This is because during the re-allocation period in November and December of last year, the requisitioned yarn factories were limited to the city and already reached 24,000 pieces per month. If the supply of raw cotton can be resolved, the allocation of yarn disputes is expected to decrease. It is heard that the cotton importers had long ago paid for the cotton clothing ordered from the United States, but because they did not meet the import quota allocation procedures, a considerable amount of goods arrived but were not allowed to be used. Among them, in terms of those who have arrived in Hong Kong and are urgently awaiting transshipment, there are already 400,000 to 500,000 bales. Relevant parties have formulated a plan to unfreeze them, which will be collected and re-allocated to the various yarn factories by the Central Trust Bureau. In addition, the Head Office is also working hard to import foreign cotton. The raw material problem of yarn factories is not as severe as the outside world has reported. Director Zou of the textile industry association has discussed this with President Zhang of the Central Bank several times. The fact that the yarn factories have been able to obey Zou recently is also one of the important reasons. As for the yarn allocation agencies, they also held a joint allocation in the name of the Cotton Spinning Industry Association in the Sixth District in September and October of last year. However, the outside world's impressions were not good, and the actual allocation was rumored to be inconsistent. This time, the yarn factories reiterated the previous proposal, and the textile industry association is still carefully considering this. Some people advocate flexibility, while others advocate rules. The nine trade associations of the reproduction industry in the city recently held a joint meeting and drafted a summary of opinions on improving yarn allocation on the spot, which was submitted to the textile industry association, advocating for regulated and open sales, so that the yarn factory's business and profits can be maintained at a just level. The reproduction industry's use of yarn is spared from having to seek it in the black market, and it was also stated that regardless of the size, age, or location of the factory, as long as the yarn factory is within the scope of control of the textile industry association, it should be evenly and regularly allocated according to its production equipment and recent activities. The price of yarn should be negotiated at any time to protect the reproduction cost of the yarn factory in principle. The summary is quite critical of the textile industry association's current yarn allocation methods. Mentioning the joint allocation handled by the Sixth District especially shows distrust, which shows the deep attention paid by the reproduction industry to the measures taken by the textile industry association. According to the persons in charge of the reproduction industry, in the most recent two months, the textile industry association allocated very little yarn. The amount obtained by the industries is less than 30% of the amount required. The high price of yarn in the black market is inevitable. Recently, the textile industry association's negotiated price was 8.8 million yuan for 20-count standard, but the actual market price is much higher than this. In the end, it is because the production equipment is limited, and the yarn produced is not enough to meet the demand. The price follows the market, and the upward trend is inevitable.

### National Banks and Others Regularly Meet to Discuss Handling Foreign Cotton

[Our Newspaper] Regarding a batch of foreign cotton that had already arrived at the port before the end of April this year, but could not obtain a license within the approved foreign cotton quota, the total amount is estimated to be over US$8 million. The principle is that the government will collect and purchase it, and then hand it over to national and private yarn factories for processing and weaving. To discuss the detailed handling methods of the foreign cotton, the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the Audit Department, the China Textile Construction Company, and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association will each send representatives to hold a joint meeting at the Central Trust Bureau this Thursday afternoon.

### Central Trust Bureau Orders Iced Eggs to Be Shipped to the UK in Batches

Recently, the Central Trust Bureau has been commissioned by the Export Promotion Committee to order four batches of iced eggs, totaling 2,250 tons, from the China Iced Egg Industry Association on behalf of the government for shipment to the United Kingdom. Each ton can be sold for 200 pounds, and the payment for the eggs will be made by the Central Bank. It is heard that iced egg merchants are willing to accept the order. In addition to the 2,000-plus tons of iced eggs, the bureau previously ordered 250 tons of dried egg flakes from the iced egg industry, which are also being shipped to the UK. The first batch of 50 tons has already been shipped to the British Ministry of Food. It is reported that the British Ministry of Food and grain merchants have expressed great appreciation for China's egg products.

### Increased Cigarette Tax Rate to Be Implemented Starting from the 26th of This Month; An Additional One-Third Will Be Levied on Top of 100%

The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance previously planned to increase the cigarette tax rate in the city by 200% on the 1st of this month. Subsequently, the Cigarette Factory Industry Association convened a cigarette business research conference, pointing out that cigarettes are currently in the mold season, and sales are sluggish. It sent representatives to visit Director Fang of the Goods Tax Bureau, requesting that the cigarette goods tax be increased by 100% based on the current tax amount and hoping to postpone implementation until August 1.

It is learned that the authorities believe that the reduction in work and slow sales in various factories are indeed true. In order to show consideration for the difficulties of businesses and take into account tax revenue, the new tax rate will be a general increase of 100%, plus one-third of the total amount of the new tax. That is, if the original tax per box was 600,000 yuan, the new tax amount should be 1.6 million yuan, and it will be implemented starting from the 26th of this month. As for various cigarettes that have the same tax rate but different prices, the Cigarette Business Research Conference will propose adjustments in the coming days to show uniformity.

### Edible Oil to Be Rationed Per Household; Expected to Be Implemented Before the 20th

The matter of rationing edible oil per household has been actively prepared by the relevant authorities and has taken a sudden turn for the better. It is expected to be implemented before the 20th of this month. The method is the same as sugar rationing, printing oil purchase certificates, which are issued by the Civil Affairs Department to each district and then distributed to each household. With a population of 4.17 million in the city, each person will be rationed half a catty of oil, and the selling price will be approximately 5,000 yuan. The final decision will be made at that time. As for the source of edible oil, the Central Trust Bureau will entrust seven major oil factories in the city to extract oil from soybeans, and then the oil will be sold through the member stores of the Oil Merchants Association. The bureau has transported 2,300 tons of soybeans from the Northeast to Shanghai and will allocate them to various factories for extraction within this week. However, according to the Civil Affairs Department's household statistics, the city's population is 4.17 million, and each rationing of oil requires 20,800 dan, and the shortage will be supplemented by Qingdao. The first rationing will be on the 15th of this month and will consist of soybean oil and raw oil. In the future, rapeseed oil will be the main type, but the distribution will be carried out after a considerable amount of soybean oil has been accumulated, sufficient for one rationing.

Qingdao Exports Surplus Soybean Oil

Director Lin of the Qingdao Municipal Social Affairs Bureau returned to Qingdao yesterday after passing through Shanghai from Beijing. It is said that the Ministry of Food has agreed in principle to transport the surplus soybean oil from Qingdao in order to maintain the local production capacity and to regulate the shortage of edible oil in the cities along the Beijing-Shanghai line. The transportation part is primarily carried out by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's North Pacific grain vessels. If the transportation situation is normal, approximately 3,000 tons can be transshipped per month. This city is one of the major consumption areas for edible oil.

### Cork Manufacturers Request a Ban on Imported Finished Products

[Our Newspaper] Recently, the city's cork industry has been threatened by imported foreign goods and has petitioned the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting the government to ban the import of foreign cork products. The Industry and Commerce Guidance Office convened a meeting of cork manufacturers yesterday to discuss this matter. It is reported that cork comes from Spain, Portugal, and North Africa, with an annual import volume of approximately 800,000 kilograms, equivalent to approximately US$400,000. In the import control measures, cork is listed as a non-quota elective import item, but since November of last year, there has been no import of cork raw materials. Manufacturers hope that the government can understand the difficulties of businesses and allow an import quota of US$400,000 for cork raw materials, but for foreign cork finished products, except for those with special uses, all others should be banned from import.

### Flour Association Applies to Continue Rationing Flour

The flour needed by the city's pasta food industry was ordered by the Central Trust Bureau to continue rationing last month, and the allocation price was the same as the price agreed upon by the bureau. However, rationing has not yet started in July, and the Flour Bran Association sent members to the Central Trust Bureau yesterday to make contact and apply to continue rationing. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the distribution of flour can be released, and Li Lang flour will still be distributed, but the price and delivery technology still need to be reviewed. The association will continue to send members to the Central Trust Bureau today, and it is hoped that a decision will be made.

In addition, the flour ordered by the Central Trust Bureau from the United States is extremely large in quantity and has been continuously transported. The bureau will sell it in large quantities in the market to suppress the price of flour and prevent unscrupulous merchants from raising prices and hoarding goods.

### The Number of Members in the Economic Survey Mission to Japan Will Not Be Reduced

[Our Newspaper] Pan Xulun, the head of the economic survey mission to Japan, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and stated that the various preparations for the mission to Japan are being handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he is not convenient to disclose the details. According to reports from other sources, the MacArthur Headquarters has not yet responded after our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram to Tokyo for negotiations. However, rumors that the number of members in our delegation will be reduced are probably untrue. When the number of members in our delegation was initially determined, the past Indian delegation to Japan was used as a reference. Relevant people estimate that the mission can be formed within this month.

### It Is Difficult to Increase the Purchase Price of Pledged Boxed Tea in the 35th Year; Those Unwilling to Sell to the Government Can Dispose of It Freely

The disposal of pledged boxed tea in the 35th year was approved by the Four Joint General Management Council on the 3rd of this month and will be collected and purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. It is learned that the Central Trust Bureau has not yet formally received a clear order, but has begun preparing for the collection and purchase matters and will begin processing once the notice arrives. According to the person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau, the purchase of the boxed tea this time is not a compulsory action. If tea merchants can find a way to export the tea themselves and are unwilling to sell to the government, they can still dispose of it freely. However, those who fail to repay the loan upon expiration should be disposed of in accordance with the treaty. The purchase price was agreed upon by the Central Bank and relevant parties to be 720,000 yuan for Qihong, 600,000 yuan for Tunlv, 550,000 yuan for Minhong, 480,000 yuan for Pinglv, 520,000 yuan for Yulv, and 320,000 yuan for Wenhong and Wenlv. Based on the pledged 80,000 boxes, the purchase funds required are 28 billion yuan. It is heard that tea merchants hope to increase the price appropriately, but it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain government approval. After the purchase, the Central Trust Bureau will be responsible for overseas sales. All grades of quality must be re-inspected, and those that do not meet the standards will not be imported or exported. In addition, the pledged boxed tea will all expire on the 10th of this month.

### Shou Jingwei Inspects the Tea Industry in Taiwan and Believes That the Future Is Still Optimistic

Shou Jingwei, the manager of the China Tea Joint Operating Company, went to Taiwan on the 17th of last month to preside over the opening of the company and inspect the situation of the tea industry in Taiwan Province. He returned to Shanghai the week before. When the reporter visited him, he was informed of the general situation of the tea industry in Taiwan. He said, "Taiwan's tea-producing areas are mainly in Taipei and Hsinchu, and the main products are Oolong tea, Pouchong tea, and black tea, among which Oolong tea is particularly famous in Europe, America, and the Near East.

The development of Taiwanese tea began after the Han people migrated to the area. Initially, it was only for consumption by the Han people in the area. Then, as production increased, it began to be sold to Fujian and Guangdong provinces. In 1869, a British person named [Name] shipped 210,000 catties of Taiwanese tea to New York, which was the beginning of the export of Taiwanese tea to foreign markets.

During the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, planting was encouraged. At its peak, the planted area occupied 45,455 chia (each chia is equal to 14.5 mu, accounting for 649,094.5 mu), and production increased sharply, with a maximum annual production of 26 million catties. During World War II, due to food shortages, the Japanese converted tea fields to cultivate food crops and tried to increase food production, resulting in large-scale, fully mechanized manufacturing plants. 49 in Taipei, 5 in Hsinchu, 137 in Taichung, and 12 in Kaohsiung were gradually destroyed, and the Taiwanese tea industry fell sharply.

Before the war, the output of Taiwanese tea in 1936 was 20,721 households producing crude tea, with a production volume of 18,081,426 catties, and 73 households producing refined tea, with a production volume of 17,485,783 catties. After the victory, in 1946, the total output of refined tea (including Oolong tea, Pouchong tea, black tea, and green tea) was only 6 million pounds (4.5 million catties). If it is not affected by prolonged rains this year, it is expected to produce 50,000 dan.

In 1935, the total export volume of Taiwanese tea reached 141,815,616 catties. After the victory, in December 1946, 400,000 pounds were exported to the New York branch of the China Trust Company, and in 1947, another batch of 7,000 boxes was shipped to the American branch of the Bank of China.

Currently, the Bank of Taiwan has undertaken tea factory loans to make their capital flow and production is not stagnant. The provincial tea company has distributed tea loans of 300 million in joint currency, and other tea merchants and cooperatives have distributed tea loans of 490 million yuan. The China Joint Operating Company's Taiwan Bank approved tea loans of 200 million yuan. Tea loans in Taiwan Province totaled 990 million yuan, and if calculated based on the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal currency adjusted on July 3, the 990 million joint currency tea loans are equivalent to 64,350,000,000 legal currency. Taiwan's provincial tea loans have crowned domestic tea loans, and the future of joint tea is optimistic.

However, it is heard that many tea merchants, due to rising prices, cannot replenish raw materials after the finished products are sold, creating a virtual profit and real loss on the books, and deceiving the eyes of the inspectors, replicating old tea, and mixing it into foreign markets, and if they are allowed to do so, the tragic situation of Taiwanese tea exports will be unimaginable. The Taiwan Tea Company has learned from this and is actively seeking solutions to the following difficulties: (1) the restoration of tea gardens, (2) the impact of prices on production costs, (3) the replenishment of materials, (4) the instability of the lives of tea farmers, and (5) the inability of Taiwanese compatriots to understand the government's tea policies.

### Should the Import of Batteries Be Prohibited? The Authorities Are Currently Considering It

[Our Newspaper] The Industry and Commerce Guidance Office recently received instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that the Guangzhou Battery Industry Association has stated that the large number of foreign batteries imported for dumping has affected the existence of more than 40 private battery factories in the country. It specifically submitted a document to the municipal government, which was forwarded to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, hoping to ban the import of foreign goods to protect the industry. However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that batteries are divided into dry and wet types, with different sizes and uses, and it is necessary to consider whether the country can be self-sufficient after foreign imports are prohibited. The municipal Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has been specifically instructed to verify and report the situation.

### Hong Kong Textile Industry Sends Trade Delegation to Southeast Asia

[United Press, Hong Kong, 5th] The Hong Kong textile industry is currently planning to send a trade delegation to the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, and Siam. The delegation of 25 people is being sent by the Chinese Manufacturers Association and is scheduled to depart at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. According to the chairman of the association, the purpose of the delegation's trip is to regain the pre-war market, expand existing markets, and open up new markets for Hong Kong products. Hong Kong manufacturers are facing strong competition from Japan and other countries. The chairman of the association also said that China's machinery is not as modern as that of other countries, but the main difficulty lies not in this, but in the high cost of living, which increases costs and makes it difficult to sell products.

New Longan Seedlings Damaged

Quanzhou News: This time, the local new longan flower seedlings were severely damaged by wind and rain, resulting in considerable losses.

### Sichuan Gallnuts Smuggled South

Sichuan gallnuts are gathered and scattered in Hankou and Shanghai. For the past month, prices in Chongqing and Hankou have consistently exceeded those in Shanghai. Recently, the Shanghai market price has been slightly firm due to the scarcity of incoming goods. However, the Chongqing price has risen to 800,000 yuan, which is still 50,000 yuan higher than the Shanghai price. According to sources in the industry, there are rumors that these gallnuts are being trafficked to Guangzhou and smuggled to Hong Kong. However, transactions in gallnuts here are extremely low, and Hong Kong prices have not risen sharply. The reason for the smuggling is likely due to the differences in exchange rates.

### Output of Pork Bristles

[Central Sky Agency, Lanzhou, 5th] 170,000 tons of Gansu province pork bristles have been transported out, managed by the Lanzhou branch of the China Trust Bureau under commission from an American merchant. Previously, camel wool, a trade item from Gansu, had no export route due to high costs and poor quality.

Woolen Cloth Firm

The woolen market on Qipan Street and Chang Le Tea House is still very tight. Except for the usual summer items of "Power Lease," "Fan Li Ding," and other brands, all other woolen fabrics, whether shiny, for men or women, colored, or rough, are trending strongly, especially thick overcoating woolens. Merchants from Taiyuan Province and kebang (visiting merchants) are actively selecting and searching for goods. This is because new shipments are not arriving, transshipment through Hong Kong is difficult, and the local factory production, except for that of China Textile Corporation, is limited. Those in the industry have a positive outlook.

Ya'an and Other Counties Promote Tea Planting

[This newspaper, Ya'an, 30th] (Delayed) The border tea transported from Xikang to Tibet amounts to 30,000 loads per year, which holds considerable economic and political value. To increase tea-producing areas and improve tea quality, the provincial government has established large seedling nurseries in Ya'an, Tianquan, and other counties to cultivate tea trees, distributing them widely to the people for large-scale promotion.

### Exchange of Philippine Pesos to Be Handled in Four Locations

According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, regarding the Philippine government's previous decision to limit the period for exchanging Philippine pesos, our ambassador to the Philippines, to facilitate the exchange for overseas Chinese in the country, negotiated with the Philippine government. As a result, the Philippine government has agreed to entrust Citibank or Bank of China in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Xiamen to collect Philippine pesos and remit them to the Philippine government for exchange. The exchange period has been extended to August 21st of this year. Overseas Filipino Chinese in the country holding Philippine pesos are advised to take note.

Longkou Vermicelli Prices Rise

According to Tianjin telecommunications, Longkou vermicelli prices have risen to 1.45 million yuan, an increase of about 20%. Prices here are also following closely, selling for 1.92 million yuan.

### The Tenth Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident—Looking Back, Looking Forward

— This Newspaper's Archives

It has been a full ten years since the "July 7th" Lugou Bridge Incident occurred.

Over the past ten years, soldiers on the front lines have fought valiantly, and people across the country have contributed labor and donations. We finally won the final victory, but the flower of victory has borne bitter fruit. Some may ask: Will the tragedy of July 7th be repeated? This is not alarmist talk. Recalling the domestic and international situation before July 7th and looking at the current situation, one cannot help but be concerned. Although July 7th was the prelude to the War of Resistance, the ambition and conspiracy of Japanese aggression had already been conceived and grown long before July 7th. The September 18th Incident was the initial step in invading China, and the Lugou Bridge Incident was the realization of seizing North China. Japan had the intention of invading China even before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, annexing the Ryukyu Islands and seizing Taiwan. Subsequently, the Korean issue led to the Sino-Japanese War. After the war, Japan had already established a foothold in Northeast China. World War I further propelled it into a major power. From then on, Japan's gradual and rapacious encroachment on China became even more aggressive.

Although Japan had long harbored the intention to annex China, it did not dare to openly launch a war. At that time, China was divided by warlords, with constant internal strife. Therefore, Japan exploited the contradictions and suspicions between warlords, doing its utmost to sow discord. Furthermore, it seized opportunities to engage in economic operations and obtain various privileges, using them as capital for future aggression. What it desired was unending internal chaos in China; what it feared was unification. It attempted to obstruct the Northern Expedition of the National Revolution, and the May 3rd Jinan Incident was a manifestation of its obstruction. By the time the Northeast changed flags, the Northern Expedition was completed, the country was unified, and construction began, Japan could no longer fulfill its ambitions. It was then that it revealed its hideous face and the evil consequences.

Ten years ago, our country had already achieved unification. Although construction had just begun, industry and commerce had taken initial shape. Although finances were not abundant, they were not as depleted as they are today. However, we were still taken advantage of by those with ulterior motives. After eight years of war, all construction has been destroyed by artillery fire and is now incomplete. The people's livelihood is increasingly difficult, and finances are increasingly strained. If the Communist Party does not wake up and continues to engage in territorial division and military expansion, the lessons of the past are a cause for grave concern.

Ten years ago, when Japan began launching its war of aggression, everyone believed that it was a desperate gamble. If Japan were defeated, it would be irrecoverable. As it turned out, Japan was defeated and surrendered, but on the eve of defeat, there were still 17 divisions of elite troops from Tokyo to Kanagawa, and large amounts of gold were found on the seabed of Tokyo Bay. These signs indicated that Japan was defeated but not crushed, like a robber on the eve of execution shouting, "I'll be a good man again in twenty years." After the Allied forces landed and took control, Japan again used international contradictions to seek opportunities for its revival. In the economic sphere, some monopolistic large enterprises, such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, were nominally dissolved, but in reality, they were fragmented into smaller units. Industry still maintained the levels of 1930 to 1934, and the steel production quota was not small. The major light industries, such as the textile industry, had 6 million spindles and 200,000 looms, unmatched by other countries in the Far East. The recent declaration of opening up to foreign trade is nothing less than opening a path to revival for Japanese industry. Its demands for fishing rights in the Kuril Islands, special rights for Taiwanese immigrants, and joint administration of the Ryukyu Islands further demonstrate its surging ambition, with great intent to "make a comeback." Although Japan is the defeated party, the militaristic ideology of the past has not been eradicated. Now that the peace treaty has not yet been concluded, it has already begun to relive the old dream of aggression and encroachment, causing victorious China to recall the situation of ten years ago, inevitably leading to the re-enactment of the September 18th Incident.

The loss of the Northeast and the failure of the League of Nations to impose sanctions allowed Japan's ambition for aggression to grow, inch by inch. On one hand, it established the puppet state of Manchukuo; on the other hand, it continued to advance into the interior, attacking Yuguan and conquering Rehe, all of which were preludes to the Lugou Bridge Incident. The reason why the Japanese bandits were so rampant at that time was that they recognized the invasion of China as a golden opportunity not to be missed. This was because it was the most severe period of the world economic panic. After President Roosevelt took office in the United States, he was busy with domestic policies, hoping to overcome the domestic economic crisis. In Europe, after Hitler came to power, he actively sought to break free from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles, leaving Britain with no time to look eastward. The Soviet Union was also focused on the implementation of its Five-Year Plan. At the same time, after the failure of the disarmament conference, the United States began allocating funds to build its navy in 1932, but Roosevelt expressed his willingness to continue disarmament. Britain also maintained the provisions of the London Naval Treaty and the Washington Naval Treaty, but Japan secretly expanded its navy. After the failure of the London Naval Conference in 1935, Japan withdrew from the conference and openly built ships on a large scale, so that the Japanese navy had the potential to surpass the British and American navies. All these circumstances created an opportunity for Japan to invade China.

Japan's ambition to invade China was not something that arose in a day. Its preparations were abundant, and its operations had been going on for decades. Weak China was not enough to resist it. However, China was able to engage with the Japanese bandits for eight years and win the final victory because of its spiritual strength and the unity of the whole country. After the victory, we should have engaged in construction, restored the vitality lost during the war, and embarked on the road to national revival. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party engaged in military expansion, destroying unity, causing the flames of war to reignite and the people to suffer the disaster of war again. Broken industries cannot be rebuilt, disrupted transportation cannot be restored, the economy is even more depleted, and the people's livelihood is even more declining. These are all caused by the Communist Party. One may ask: "Will July 7th come again?"

The root of the eight-year War of Resistance was the Northeast. After the victory, the Northeast has not yet been fully recovered, and alarm bells are ringing on the northwest border. An Outer Mongolia that has been separated from China and independent for two years is actually leading troops to assert its dominance, invading its former suzerain state, which has to be alarming. Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang are intertwined, serving as a barrier to our northwest. They have long been coveted by others. Due to the brewing of independence in Outer Mongolia, many incidents have occurred. Xinjiang is located on the border, with a complex ethnic makeup. The government is unable to attend to it due to many troubles in the country. The previous Yining Incident was carefully handled by the central government, which re-established ties with Xinjiang, which had been isolated for a long time. Xinjiang after the Yining Incident is like the Northeast changing flags in the past, and the invasion of the Outer Mongolian army is another scene of the "September 18th" Incident!

Xinjiang leans against the Pamir Mountains in the west, surrounded by high mountains, with only the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains bordering Outer Mongolia, a flat sandy area with no defenses. Nomadic people live there, galloping for hundreds of miles, considering it normal. Since the loss of Kulun in 1921, the Outer Mongolian government and Tannu Uriankhai have become independent, separating from the north. Now, the alarming situation in Xinjiang cannot help but remind people of the past in Outer Mongolia. Moreover, Xinjiang's land is twice as large as the Northeast, and Xinjiang's treasures include gold, coal, iron, oil, primitive forests, and vast pastures. Recently, uranium mines have also been discovered. The desire to arouse foreigners' greed for its reserves is no less than that for the Northeast, and its importance is greater than that of the Northeast. Will the scene that was staged in the Northeast in the past be repeated in the Northwest?

Looking at past history, after each war, there must be a peace movement, but after this great war, there seem to be some exceptions. Although the United Nations organization has been established, it cannot eliminate the world's crises. Originally, after China's eight-year War of Resistance, various countries have recognized the spirit of the Chinese nation and can overcome material poverty. If after victory, we engage in construction and reach a certain level, it would not be difficult to stabilize the Far East and lay the foundation for world peace. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party engaged in military expansion, destroying unity, turning a beautiful flower of victory into a withered and broken one. Seeing Japan growing stronger and hearing alarms from the Northwest, how can the various situations before "July 7th" not reappear before our eyes? At this moment, the Communist Party should pull back from the brink, thoroughly reflect, and not become a sinner of the nation!

### The Power of Our New Foreign Policy

— Translated by Zhou Songxi

The original article was published in the June issue of "Reader's Digest" in the United States, written by former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, William C. Bullitt, detailing the Soviet Union's ambitions for the world and its use of communist parties in various countries as tools. Pronouns such as "we" and "our" refer to the United States. This article has not been changed, in order to preserve its authenticity. —Translator's Note

All democratic countries find it difficult to face unpleasant facts and prefer to linger in blissful illusions, until disaster strikes, as we experienced at Pearl Harbor.

We know that in World War II, if Hitler had been able to organize the countries of Europe and Africa to attack the Western Hemisphere, and if the Japanese warlords had been able to organize the countries of Asia to launch a similar attack, we would have faced fatal danger. Today, Stalin's goal is to do both (i.e., Hitler's goal and the Japanese warlords' goal). The sacrifices we made in World War II and the results we gained from victory are about to make Europe, the Near East, the Far East, and Africa all be ruled by the Soviet Union. We are now facing this painful possibility, whether we like it or not, this is a very important fact today. If asked, "What error in judgment caused this poisonous fruit of victory?" The answer is very clear: Our government mistakenly believed that the Soviet Union was a peace-loving democratic country, and not a despotic country that was all about plundering and determined to conquer the world, starting in 1941. Therefore, a very unfortunate mistake was made in history. When our troops engaged in war with superb skill and courage and executed our foreign policy, they did not pay attention to the interests of the American people that were related to life and death. Stalin has the ambition to conquer the world, just like Hitler, and we did not do anything to stop him and defend ourselves.

We hoped that he could turn into a gentle and peace-loving person, so at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences, we continuously gave him the rights he wanted. Even former Secretary of State Byrnes believed that he could get along well with Stalin when he sacrificed in 1945. It took several months to realize that Stalin's ambition was endless, and could only be stopped with resolute opposition.

When Byrnes gained this painful lesson (which all Americans will sooner or later receive), he bravely rejected Soviet imperialism. When the Soviet Union was about to invade Turkey, he managed to stop it, and saved the eastern Mediterranean from this fear of invasion. By supporting the Iranian government, he enabled it to drive out the Soviet agents who occupied northern Iran. These two things are enough to prove that Stalin has not dared to risk using force to deal with the United States. We are much stronger than the Soviet Union today, and Stalin knows it.

Our country's position today is very similar to that of France in March 1936. At that time, France's air force and army were the strongest in the world. But Hitler still dared to send troops deep into the Rhineland, and began his life of conquest. We have already obtained evidence that Hitler knew very well that if France could mobilize, it could overwhelm Germany. If France mobilized, it would have to order the troops to turn back. But French mobilization was very expensive. At that time, the French government wanted to balance the budget, and mobilization would separate people from their families and careers. In political terms, it was also not suitable for public opinion, and there were many honest French people who were influenced by distorted reports and mistakenly believed that Hitler would never harm France, just like some people today strongly argue that Stalin will not harm the United States. Therefore, France did nothing at that time.

When Hitler was ready, he immediately overwhelmed France. France did not dare to face the facts in 1936, which led to its own destruction.

When Hitler occupied a strategic area as a base for launching an offensive against a country, he would first comfort the future victims, and lull them into a false sense of security. This is the principle of Hitler's strategy of conquest, and also the principle of Stalin's tactics. His tactics are completely the same as Hitler's: fifth column, propaganda, making treaties, breaking treaties, intimidation, and military force. But Hitler never cultivated such an insidious and powerful tool in the countries he wanted to conquer as Stalin's Communist Party and comrades traveling everywhere. Time is now working against us, just like it was working against France after March 1936. Day by day, we are approaching the development of the Russian atomic bomb. The Soviet Union's large-scale productive forces are still producing for war. Stalin's rule over Eastern and Central Europe is becoming increasingly successful. He can use the resources of a vast area with more than 100 million people to confront us. Stalin has already merged Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Finland, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, Romania, and has placed the entire Poland, the entire Romania, the entire Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania, and the Red Army zone of Germany and Austria under his rule. He is increasingly tightening his grip on Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Finland, which are already in his iron fist. He is also exerting great pressure on Greece and Turkey, and without external assistance, Greece and Turkey cannot resist the Soviet Union. His fifth column is working hard to communize the entire territory of Germany. His agents in France and Italy are very powerful, and have already forced the governments of the two major countries to accept their leaders as state officials. Stalin's power is on the offensive around the world, while the democratic countries are in retreat. To prevent him from uniting the forces of Europe, Asia, and Africa to launch a decisive attack on the Western Hemisphere is the most important thing for the United States today. We cannot simultaneously provide sufficient assistance to all nations threatened by Soviet imperialism. We must carefully select several key points to apply all our strength.

President Truman has given first priority to Greece and Turkey. These two countries are obviously facing the disaster of being invaded, and the urgency is second only to Greece and Turkey for France, because France's position is also a matter of life and death. This is one of the problems we face in the world, and it should be studied in detail.

If Stalin succeeds in controlling France by relying on his fifth column, then the French government will become our enemy. The people of France will obey his orders under the pressure of Communist Party agents and artillery. We will face the threat of Stalin's air force.

If France is controlled by Stalin, then Europe will become a communist world. The Communist Party of Italy is particularly strong, and will definitely fall into Stalin's control. Europe and Asia will become a vast communist continent between the two oceans, and the British and American zones in western Germany will become a small enclave on that continent, until the British and American troops withdraw. Britain will be vulnerable to Russian rockets, which will be more intense than those launched by Germany in France before, and will suffer large bombs like Malta. The smaller countries of Europe will fall one by one. If Europe is governed by the Communist Party and directly listens to Moscow, then the United States will feel as endangered as if Europe were ruled by the Nazis and directly obeyed Berlin.

Today, the Communist Party is the largest party in France, but there are many small parties, so that 72% of the members of parliament are non-communists. In a democratic country with normal mental, material, and moral values, the Communist Party should not be involved in the government. However, France has suffered heavy material losses, and non-communist leaders have to do everything they can to recover. Therefore, the Communist Party has used the threat of general strikes to force other parties to give it high positions in the government. Today, its famous leader Thorez, who was a deserter from the French army in World War II, serves as Deputy Premier, and Communist Party members have become ministers of defense, labor, health, and reconstruction.

The ground staff of the French Air Force are now almost entirely controlled by the Communist Party, and many officials are Communist Party members. As for the army itself, there are many party members. In addition, the Communist Party has its own well-equipped underground forces, which outnumber the regular French army. People in Paris freely say: "If Stalin wants to take over France, he can do it anytime with a phone call."

If the non-communist leaders who make up the majority of the French parliament decide to organize a national coalition government to oppose the minority Communist Party, then we should provide the necessary assistance to enable it to maintain a democratic government. Furthermore, we should also help them establish France's economic institutions. France's basic economic position is sound. If the Communist Party can be controlled, then all the needs to become a stronger democratic country again should be helped to compensate for the devastation suffered during the war and the German occupation.

If France can become a democratic country, then it can unite the democratic countries of Europe to defend themselves. This is a foolproof method, and it is also a method for us to defend ourselves. If most of Europe cannot become a democratic entity, then all of Europe will unite under Soviet tyranny.

Greece, Turkey, France, China—how many more countries need our help? Perhaps there are many more countries. We must help them as much as we can. Today, our national strength is far greater than that of the Soviet Union. This is also the only opportunity for us to avoid an open war with the Soviet Union. We should have the foresight, ability, and courage to prevent Stalin from controlling new strategic areas, and should organize the free nations of the world to resist Soviet imperialism, so that the Soviet dictator always encounters superior forces. That force must be not only military and economic, but also ideal.

If we want to use ideals to defeat the lies and distorted truths of the Communist Party, we have the Bible, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's speech at Independence Hall, and there is no need to look far. In Lincoln's speech, he asked himself "What great principle has maintained the union of these states so long?". His answer was "It is that ideal in the Declaration of Independence, that not only aims at giving liberty to all the people of this country, but hopes that the world in all future time, shall have it." This ideal is what we want to defend, and it is also what we want to contribute to the world. In the field of ideals, freedom is our atomic bomb.

It is hard to believe that ambitious people can be driven by communism to attack the democratic countries that we cherish, but it is true. If we do not now face the enemy squarely, and do not realize that the enemy is strong, fierce, cunning, cruel, and does not know what truth, benevolence, and goodwill are, then we will not be able to save ourselves!

### Jinan Vientiane

— Special Correspondent Tian's Airmail from Jinan, June 29th

Anyone who has read The Travels of Lao Ts'an cannot help but be captivated and yearn for Jinan, which has been beautified and rendered as enchanting as Jiangnan. Although, today, only the northern part of Jinan can still barely be described as "every house has flowing water, every household has hanging willows"; the saying "peach blossoms on four sides, willows on three, a city of mountains, half a city of lakes" (the Daming Lake couplet), is not as true or realistic as "roads on four sides, bandits on three, a city of refugees, half a city of soldiers."

Jinan, after eight years of the War of Resistance and two years of internal turmoil, may have been thought by those who have never been there to have been destroyed beyond recognition, like other cities in the country. However, on the contrary, except for the former site of the court outside Pulimen, which was once destroyed and has now been rebuilt, walking through the entire city, one can hardly find any traces of destruction. According to people familiar with Jinan, due to Han Fuqu's major retreat, the enemy dropped only two small bombs weighing less than 20 pounds in total on Jinan. After the enemy occupied Jinan, they used it as the largest supply base for North China and spared no effort in construction and expansion. In addition to expanding the northern part of the commercial area opened by the Germans in the west of the city by two or three li as an industrial area, they also developed the area south of the commercial area all the way to the foothills of Sili Mountain and Ma'anshan, building many brand-new Western-style houses, making it a fairly ideal residential area. This newly expanded construction, in terms of area, almost exceeds the old Jinan before the War of Resistance by a factor of one. The more than ten wide asphalt roads crisscrossing the city also embellish Jinan, making it look "like something important," with the initial scale of a modern city. In the early days of the victory of the War of Resistance.

In the same Jinan City

Three Shandong provincial government chairmen once lived there: He Siyuan from the central government, Li Yu from the CCP, and Yang Yuxun from the puppet organization. Yang was the son-in-law of "Hongxian Emperor" Yuan Shikai. At that time, because Chairman He entered Shandong alone with limited forces, the remnants of Chairman Yang's puppet organization still existed with the support of the enemy puppet army. Li Yu, since the "Qilaishan Seven-Person Uprising," had expanded his troops to more than 200,000. At this time, his troops were all over the outskirts of Jinan. He was also clamoring to compete with Lieutenant General Hosokawa Tadayasu, commander of the 43rd Army of the Japanese army, for the surrender, with the posture of troops approaching the city. In addition, local armed groups from various counties, where soldiers and bandits were difficult to distinguish, were mixed among them. Commanders filled the streets, and refugees were everywhere. Therefore, those who were joking and mocking changed a few numbers in the Daming Lake couplet to become "roads on four sides, bandits on three, a city of refugees, half a city of soldiers."

It was not until the Double Tenth Festival in the 34th year of the Republic, after Li Yannian was ordered to come to Jinan to handle the surrender and the traitors such as Chairman Yang were ordered to be arrested, that the situation in Jinan became slightly more stable than before. But continuing down, Li Yu, because he failed to compete for the surrender, had been fighting and besieging Jinan by force and soft tactics. The "seizure" phenomenon in the early days of victory also frequently increased the infinite hidden pain for the people who had been in enemy territory for many years. It was not until the spring of the 35th year of the Republic, when Wang Yaowu was ordered to come to Jinan to direct military affairs and win back the hearts of the people, that the situation began to stabilize. Otherwise, according to the observation of some qualified people, it is really unimaginable what the situation in Jinan would have evolved into today.

Before the War of Resistance, the population of Jinan was less than 400,000. Since the victory, due to the difficulties in all directions, refugees from various counties gathered, and the population once increased to nearly 800,000. Since last month, with the reopening of the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Jinpu Railway, some refugees have returned to their hometowns, and the population has decreased to slightly less than 700,000 (excluding the military). After the population increased, housing became the first serious problem. Although there were many buildings left by the enemy in Jinan, and because Shandong people have always been heroic and righteous, almost every family in Jinan has become a refugee shelter, taking in more or less of their relatives and friends who fled from various counties. However, due to the sudden increase in population and the large number of troops, the housing shortage has become increasingly serious. Especially in the commercial area, although there is no need to quote prices in gold bars, asking for rent based on flour is enough to make those living in other places anxious.

According to Mayor Wang Chongwu, at least half of the 700,000 people in Jinan are refugees, and at least 200,000 of these 350,000 refugees rely on relief to maintain their lives. In the past, they mainly relied on the UNRRA's flour to build roads and repair the Yellow River堤堤 in a work-for-relief method. However, the UNRRA Shandong-Qingdao branch will end in August. At that time, unless the external situation greatly improves and the refugees can return to their homes and live in peace, their lives will also become the most serious problem.

Due to the surplus of labor, although there is no exact number of unemployed people to investigate, it is not difficult to imagine that the number is alarming. Beggars fill the streets, calling people "sir" and "madam," kowtowing like pounding garlic, especially among school-age children around the age of ten. Labor is generally so cheap that only food is provided, because according to the current prices in Jinan, eating cornbread costs at least more than 200,000 yuan per person per month. When you go out and walk, as long as you are dressed relatively neatly, you may often encounter seven or eight rickshaw pullers asking you "want a ride?" within 500 steps, making you feel that dealing with them is simply an extra hardship. How do they know that these people are also being forced to "walk" due to the high pressure of prices?

There are 100,000 stores of all sizes in Jinan, and almost 70-80% of them rely on selling inventory to make a living. Due to sluggish business and the repeated decline in people's purchasing power, daily business income often does not cover daily expenses. Naturally, there is no remaining power to purchase new goods. When you walk to the front of each store, looking through the glass window, although it still looks like the counters and windows are full, showing a "sufficient inventory" appearance, according to the honest words of some business friends: the bolts of cloth in the window are actually just wrapped with a few circles on the outside to fill the facade, and the "cores" inside are mostly so large that they would scare you when you see them. At the end of last year, according to a survey, 572 businesses were forced to liquidate, and more than 3,000 businesses requested the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau to suspend operations but were not approved. Recently, a friend came from Hong Kong and Shanghai, and I accompanied him to Qingliange, the most famous place for Qingchang and Dagushu here. Although the tea fee is only 2,000 yuan per person, unexpectedly there are at least twenty-five or six beautifully dressed singers sitting in the side boxes, while there are only ten or so listeners sitting in the main hall, forming the greatest irony. More than half of the audience in the city's six movie theaters and two Peking opera theaters are soldiers. To show preferential treatment, the theaters sell half-price tickets to soldiers, which naturally affects the theaters' income. However, according to the person in charge of this newspaper's Jinan distribution office, who also manages a movie theater, the main thing that can barely maintain business is still relying on these military audiences. Ordinary people cannot afford to enjoy a movie that costs 2,000 yuan a ticket, and they are really poor to the bone.

Jinan's scenic spots

Thousand Buddha Mountain and Sili Mountain have long been stationed with troops, and ordinary people are not easily allowed to enter. Although Zhongshan Park in the commercial area can be freely accessed, the park's area is so small that it is not even half the size of the Bund Park. In this hot summer, the park is crowded with tourists, and being among them is like being packed into a jar of sardines. As for the old city of Jinan, which is known as the city of water and has seventy-two famous springs, many famous springs today have long existed only in name. The most famous Baotu Spring has now been used as a reservoir for the waterworks, and Pearl Spring is located in the police station, so ordinary people cannot easily enter. Other places, such as Daming Lake, which has eight scenic spots of Lixia and occupies one-third of the city, have tourist value, but the price of a single boat to cruise around the lake is 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, which is also beyond the reach of ordinary people. Therefore, many people say that Jinan is like a well, and the only greatest enjoyment left for the general middle class is to spend 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to take a bath. However, according to the old manager of Mingxinchi, the largest bathhouse in Jinan on Sanma Road, their business averaged 3,000 people per day before the war and even during the enemy occupation, but now it averages only more than 100 people per day. Indeed, rising prices have made people see bathing not only as removing dirt but also as a high-level enjoyment.

The poor condition of public education personnel in Jinan in the past was the worst in various provinces, with high prices and low salaries. Moreover, even this treatment could not be paid on a monthly basis, and even if it was paid, it would be discounted by 20% or 30%. Since this year, thanks to Chairman Wang's efforts to raise funds from various sources, the central government has also included Jinan in the first tier, along with Beijing and Shanghai, when adjusting the treatment of public education personnel. In addition, with the allocation or purchase of uniforms, cloth, flour, etc., everyone felt that they could barely breathe. As for students, more than 8,000 of the more than 10,000 middle school students were forced to flee from the "liberated areas." Their families suffered miserably from "struggle," and there was no financial support. In the past, they mostly relied on the monthly stipend of 48,000 yuan per month, which could only last for a week in reality. Therefore, the yellow cloth distributed by the relief agency had to be sold and turned into Zhongshan formal attire for middle and lower-level civil servants. After the students exhausted all their possessions, they were forced to do part-time jobs. Those who could not find work were forced to eat noodles made of three flours, bran, and even wild grass roots and elm bark. Their lives are hard enough, but they know very well who caused them to suffer. They only make reasonable appeals, and they have never gone on strike. Therefore, on the one hand, the government increased the amount of the public stipend, and on the other hand, after Wang Yaowu and Shandong Xinbao advocated donating one day's income, the total amount donated and pledged in the past three weeks has reached more than 200 million yuan. In Jinan, which is poor to the bone, this has to be considered the highest and most concrete expression of great sympathy.

If you come to Jinan for the first time, people will definitely tell you the "three nots" of Jinan: "the roads are uneven, the telephone is unclear, and the electric lights are dim." In fact, except for some roads in the suburbs that are like honeycombs, the smooth asphalt roads in the urban area, especially the commercial area, are still rare among the major provincial capitals in the country. The telephone calls are worse than long distance calls in Beijing and Shanghai because the machines are too old. As for the electric lights, the company's coal reserves have been exhausted, and the losses are too great. Except for military and government agencies, even these dim electric lights had already stopped supplying a month ago. In order to save fuel due to sluggish business, (kerosene cost 2 million yuan per large barrel, and once rose to 2.3 million yuan,) even in the summer night, the lights were turned off and the shops closed as early as 10 o'clock, and the whole city was plunged into darkness. After the curfew began at 11:30, iron wire fences were closed one after another at the street corners, and soldiers with live ammunition stood guard at the large and small fortresses, and the whole city seemed to enter another realm. The sound of gunfire and artillery is more familiar to the residents of Jinan than firecrackers. Whether it is day or night, whether it is a military exercise by the National Army or an attack by the Communist Army, they have absolute confidence in Wang Yaowu, and they can still sleep soundly.

Jinan's current situation is due to

Not much coal and high prices

Except for a few yarn factories or flour mills that are uniquely blessed, such as Renfeng, Chengda, Chengtong Dongya, etc., the rest have been shut down by 70-80%. At present, the price of coal in Jinan has risen to 2.5 million yuan per ton, and the retail price is 1,500 yuan per jin. Poor families can only buy two or three jin at a time wrapped in a cloth handkerchief to take home in order to cook. They regard these meager coal fines as precious as "black gold and ink jade." How can they cope with this in the hot summer, or in the bitterly cold northern country when winter comes?

According to past experience, more than 30,000 tons of coal are needed per month in winter. At present, the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Jinpu Railway is open, and it is estimated that the six coal mines in Taian, Xintai, Ningyang, and Qufu in southwestern Shandong, which are mined by local methods, produce more than 10,000 tons per month. If they are engaged in transportation and storage at this time, they may be able to avoid freezing and starvation this winter. However, the current difficulty is the lack of transportation tools. The Provincial Highway Bureau has fewer than ten standby trucks, and although the business army has seventy or eighty vehicles, they are also busy grabbing grain, which is more important than coal. As for the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Jinpu Railway, it will take until the end of this year at the earliest to be opened to traffic. Even if the Jiaoji Railway is opened immediately, it is even more distant and indefinite due to the lack of materials. Under such difficult traffic conditions, on the contrary, cotton flowing into Jinan from the Communist area, as well as cattle hides collected in Jinan after farmers slaughtered their cattle due to the inability to cultivate land due to the war, have become a flying class and are continuously transported abroad due to the prospect of profit. At the same time, the remaining automobile and bicycle parts and hardware materials, and even gold cloth, etc. in Jinan are flowing to the Communist area one after another. This extremely abnormal exchange of materials can be regarded as more or less embellishing the prosperous and active side of Jinan. The difficulties currently encountered in Jinan are exactly the same as those encountered in major cities in northern China. People are looking forward to a stable tomorrow.

### On Reforming Education After the Great University Unrest

— Zhou Jixi

Following this unprecedented nationwide university upheaval, the current semester has ended hastily, and the next semester is coming in a flash. If the education authorities and educators do not proceed with caution, plan for the future, and boldly reform education, not only will the future of education be unimaginable, but the great task of nation-building will also suffer immeasurably. Now, I respectfully present several methods for reforming education, based on my limited understanding, for correction by the people of the country, and I hope that the education authorities and colleagues in the education field will adopt and implement them.

First, democratize education. The first resolution passed by the Joint Annual Meeting of Educational Organizations in the 34th year of the Republic of China was to establish educational policies. The principles are: (1) In academic matters, there should be freedom to conduct academic research; (2) In thought, there should be freedom of belief and expression; (3) Academic and cultural organizations should have freedom to establish themselves. In administration, a proactive approach should be adopted. The original proposal pointed out: (1) Clearly demarcate the scope of educational undertakings between the central and local governments, and assign responsibilities at different levels; (2) Replace interference with supervision, laissez-faire with assistance, passivity with initiative, prevention with trust, delay with speed, and subjective praise and criticism with objective standards in administrative methods; (3) Encourage private individuals to run educational undertakings and engage in research and experimental work. The above points can be said to be the principles and methods of democratizing education. Because with the freedom to conduct academic research, express thoughts, and establish academic and cultural organizations, education can be democratized, academic thought can flourish, and education and culture can progress. However, the current educational administration, school administration, and all educational facilities often lack freedom and cannot be democratic; they are either overly interfered with or completely laissez-faire; they are either passive everywhere or constantly vigilant. As for the delay and ineffectiveness of educational measures, and the subjective nature of educational rewards and punishments, these are even more common phenomena. These are all the internal reasons for the failure of education and the repeated outbreaks of student unrest. Therefore, if we want to reform education and cultivate a good academic atmosphere, we must respect freedom and implement democracy: patiently guide and supervise young people; sincerely love and assist students; inspire young people to be proactive and self-reliant, and to govern themselves and their studies; implement moral education to make students sincerely convinced, respect teachers, and value the Way; all educational facilities must be swift and reliable, and unexpected events must be dealt with immediately and decisively, and resolved legally and rationally; the evaluation of educational achievements must be based on objective standards, and especially on impartiality and selflessness, and on strict and fair evaluation of merits and demerits, and rewards and punishments in accordance with the law. If we can do this, education can be democratized, student unrest can be eliminated in its infancy, a good academic atmosphere can be created, and satisfactory educational results can be obtained. Therefore, democratizing education is the top priority for reforming education after this unprecedented university unrest.

Second, rationalize allocation. There is a very irrational distribution in education in our country. Taking university education as an example, according to a recent survey, there are 53 public and private universities in the country, 11 of which are located in Shanghai, 5 in Beiping, 4 in Guangzhou, and 3 each in Nanjing, Wuchang, and Chengdu. The above six major cities have a total of 29 universities, accounting for more than half of the total number of universities in the country. The universities in Shanghai alone account for more than one-fifth of the total number of universities in the country. However, there is not a single university in provinces such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Xikang. Other independent colleges and schools above the junior college level are also concentrated in several major cities. Secondary schools are also concentrated in the provincial capitals and cities of various provinces. Some people say that education above the secondary level, especially university education, does not need to and cannot seek balanced development, because the development of education requires the progress of social civilization, especially a university, which must be run in the most culturally advanced metropolis in order to absorb modern civilization, conduct in-depth academic research, and have new creations, inventions, and discoveries, and promote the continuous advancement of society and human culture. Yes, education needs society, and society also needs education; culturally backward societies need to develop education to promote the progress of civilization, just as culturally backward China needs to develop education to promote the modernization of the country. Therefore, we can say that society progresses because of the development of education, and education develops because of the progress of society. Therefore, within the scope permitted by the environment, both higher education and secondary education should seek rational distribution and balanced development. Recently, the student unrest in the Jiangzhe area and the Yingda relocation movement occurred earliest. Regarding the issue of the Yingda campus, the Ministry of Education located it in Jinhua in order to rationalize the distribution. The students of Yingda University argued that Jinhua did not have the conditions to establish a university and advocated relocating the campus. In all fairness, Jinhua is located in the middle of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, bordering the Dongyang River to the south, with the benefit of boats and rafts, and facing Jinhua Mountain to the north, with the beauty of forests. There are four or five middle schools in the city, and many middle schools in the nearby counties. Although its cultural level is not very high, and there are inconveniences in teaching, its quiet environment is quite suitable for cultivating the minds of students and nurturing the noble character of young people. If the Ministry of Education can seek rationality in terms of library equipment and teacher treatment, and if a virtuous and capable president leads from above, for example, if Principal He Bingsong of the school had not died and was still in Jinhua presiding over school affairs, the student unrest demanding relocation may not have occurred. Therefore, while we demand the rationalization of the regional distribution of education, we must also demand the rationalization of the distribution of books and equipment; that is, the distribution of books and equipment to schools in places with lower cultural levels, especially universities, should be more and better and more substantial than the distribution to universities in large cities. For example, the recent distribution of teaching equipment for the engineering, agriculture, and medical departments of colleges and universities in the rehabilitation areas subsidized by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration should be based on this principle to seek the rationalization of the distribution. The treatment of teachers should also be more generous than that of universities in large cities, and they should be given funds for research and inspection in large cities during the winter and summer vacations, and professors who go abroad for further study should have priority. The winter and summer vacations can also be used to select students of engineering, agriculture, and medicine to practice in large factories and hospitals in large cities, or to learn a scientific technology that cannot be learned locally. Within the possible scope, students can often be led to visit things related to their studies in large cities. The selection of the president of the school should be especially cautious, and the most respected and talented first-class scholars must be invited to preside over school affairs. If we can do this, the university will not be prone to student unrest even if it is run in a place with a lower cultural level or in a remote province. Therefore, demanding the rationalization of the regional distribution of education requires the rationalization of the distribution of books and equipment in order to reform education. In order to seek the rationalization of the regional distribution of education, the education authorities should, according to the needs of society, establish vocational schools or independent colleges related to local construction undertakings in accordance with local conditions, and then slowly expand them into universities as society progresses and local needs increase. It is not necessary to start by establishing a university with more than three colleges. As for the universities concentrated in major cities, if they can be urged to move away from the busy and noisy big cities to smaller cities or remote provinces without universities, and seek the rationalization of distribution, that would of course be very good, but it should not be too forced, so as not to cause storms and student unrest. In this extremely turbulent country, the government's demand for the rationalization of the regional distribution of schools should be approached with caution and should not be rushed in order to eliminate student unrest and stabilize education.

Third, strengthen the supervision system. The educational supervision system is a system in which educational administrative organs set up supervisors to supervise the degree of implementation of education according to legal standards. In the United States, supervisors are divided into two types: one is to supervise teaching, and the other is to supervise administration. Each county and city education bureau has supervisors. The United Kingdom has central supervisors and local supervisors. Each local supervisor must be subordinate to the Ministry of Education supervisor and cooperate with him. In order to compel children to attend school, local governments also set up enrollment supervisors. The supervision system in the Soviet Union is divided into two levels: the federal level and the local level. Federal supervisors are representatives of the Federal Education Committee, and their task is to examine academic affairs and assist in the improvement of public education. The duties of local supervisors are similar to those of federal supervisors, but their supervision area is smaller. In our country's supervision system, the central government and provinces, counties, and cities all have supervisors; however, because of their small number and low quality, supervisors at all levels often take a cursory look and supervise without guiding. When educational problems occur, they cannot foresee them and prevent them, nor can they deal with them well afterward and eliminate future troubles. The recent rise and fall of student unrest, which has shaken the country, is also due to the unsoundness of the supervision organization. Therefore, when we discuss reforming education after this university unrest, we must strengthen the supervision system. At the central level, we should invite first-class scholars with high moral standing and reputation to serve as Ministry-appointed supervisors, and respect their status, give them generous treatment, and send them to universities to give lectures, explain the essentials of learning, being a person, managing affairs, and dealing with people, guide the thoughts and behaviors of young people, so that young people who have heard his words will benefit more than reading books for ten years, and have him introduce famous scholars to give academic lectures at universities, and establish close ties with professors, guide academic research work at universities, solve their difficult problems, and deal with unexpected events that occur temporarily. The Ministry of Education should focus more on the supervision of school administration in higher education, and focus on the teaching aspects of primary and secondary education; the supervision of teaching aspects should focus on whether scientific experiments and practice can be done diligently, and whether exercise books, composition books, experimental reports, and practice reports can be done diligently and carefully corrected. In terms of physical education, emphasis should be placed on whether everyone participates in and holds morning exercises, inter-class exercises, and extracurricular exercises and other fitness exercises every day, rather than training a small number of athletes to compete for trophies. The overall goal is to promote the health of all students through universalization and mass participation. The supervision of local education administration and school administration should have careful and detailed inspections, identify the strengths and weaknesses, and give practical guidance on what should be established and what should be reformed. Special care should be taken to be fair-minded and have a peaceful attitude, and should never be biased or hold a bureaucratic attitude of superiority. Educational workers who are enthusiastic about education and have achieved outstanding results should be reported to the government for rewards. Schools with a long history, excellent results, and great contributions should be reported to the government to increase their funding and enrich their content, so that they can make even better efforts and greater contributions. For example, National Chiao Tung University and Nantong College, a private school, both have a long history and excellent results. The former has made great contributions to the transportation industry, and the latter to the textile industry. If the government can reward and encourage them to fully develop, they will surely make greater and more contributions to industrial construction and the great task of nation-building. As for school-shops, after the supervisors have investigated and confirmed them, whether they are middle schools or universities, they should be reported to the authorities for closure, so as not to mislead people's children and cause harm to the country and society. Supervisors at all levels should establish close ties both horizontally and vertically, and hold more educational supervision conferences to discuss the current educational problems and the ways to solve them, and study how to reform education and other issues.

In short, democratizing education, rationalizing allocation, and strengthening the supervision system are all necessary measures for reforming Chinese education after this university unrest. I wonder what your opinion is?

### Exhibition of Historical Materials on Zheng Chenggong Planned by Tainan Municipal Government

— Tainan Aviation News, June 30, Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

Zheng Chenggong, the representative of the spirit of Taiwan, his great achievements can shock the heavens and move the gods. He is not only respected by the people of this island, but also admired by the heroic figure of the nation, both in the East and the West, in ancient and modern times.

The Tainan Municipal Government has decided to hold the Zheng Chenggong Historical Materials Exhibition at Chihkan Tower in the city from the 6th to the 9th of this month. This will be the first exhibition since the restoration, collecting and displaying more than 50 types of historical materials, calligraphy, paintings, photos, printing plates, and historical biographies of Koxinga. In addition, in order to preserve historical sites, the historical museum inside Chihkan Tower will soon begin construction. When former Minister Bai visited Taiwan, he donated money to preserve this historical site. According to Zhuo Gaoxuan, this year's anniversary of the establishment of the Tainan Historical Museum has collected historical documents and literature of the sage Zheng Chenggong and other historical materials from the Ming and Qing dynasties, and is still continuing to collect them. Together with the original historical materials from the Ming and Qing dynasties, there are about 60 pieces. Among them, Chihkan City, Chihkan Tower, Yanping Prince Shrine, and Kaiyuan Temple are all historically famous, and they are very valuable to visit.

Chihkan Tower is located on Minzu Road in Tainan City. It was built by the Dutch in the fourth year of the Ming Yongli period and called Fort Provintia. In 1622, Zheng Chenggong drove out the Dutch and renamed it Chengtianfu. After the implementation of the pacification policy, it was once used as a hospital for the Japanese land and sea garrison and the Joint Southern Normal School. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Japanese Mayor Hatori allocated a large sum of money for repairs.

Zheng Chenggong's five-character handwritten manuscript during the reign of Emperor Longwu of the Ming Dynasty originally read: "Rites, music, clothing, and crown are the first; articles are the home of Confucius and Mencius; Nanshan opens up the land of longevity; the East Sea brews flowing clouds."

### Wells' Early and Late Periods

— Li Jinming

Since "The Outline of History" and "The Science of Life" were translated into Chinese (both published by Commercial Press), Wells has become widely known to general readers in China. His early works, with scientific ideals as the center, enjoyed a high reputation internationally. Although literary historians have given the so-called "scientific stories" a "Pseudo" evaluation, in many aspects, they have now exceeded the ideal and are close to the experimental stage.

Lang (author of A Short History of English Literature) commented on his early writings:

"Herbert G. Wells is a sincere writer with a serious attitude towards art, and is one of the most outstanding among the many realists of the same era. He declared that we should take the whole of life as the subject of writing. We should further discuss social, political, and religious issues in a cold attitude until we clarify the thousands of superficial clichés.

"The disputes arising from the discussion of such topics," Lang criticized with some sarcasm, "are simply eleven thousand, even the most discerning ancient Hebrew King Solomon would have to hold his tongue. These problems have become Wells' task and tools. In short, Wells' mission is reform, and his tool is the novel, which is somewhat like an ancient hero driving out demons. We express our admiration for his saving power and courageous confidence. He sees more falsehoods in religion, society, and politics than Carlyle counted—simply nowhere is not 'vague,' and from every vague problem, he must derive a book. Therefore, he is not only a storyteller, but also the main purpose of his twenty or thirty novels is partly scientific ideals——using the seemingly real themes to build Utopias like Verne or More. Later, he published a bright book "Joan and Peter," which clearly depicted Europe's imminent entry into World War I; in fact, he was wantonly attacking modern education

"Like other reformist writers, Wells has his characteristics and weaknesses. His characteristic is that he is very familiar with sociology and science. He cannot use it practically, but he uses it to praise God. His weakness, however, is that the people described in his works lack soul and humanity. In "Marriage," he placed the male and female heroes he described in a small hut away from the city, and proved how possible this beautiful and simple rural life is. In fact, living by a desolate coast is more complicated and less safe than living in a magnificent mansion." Lang believes that "simplicity and purity are not formed by studying science and living by fishing; they come from human nature, and the so-called complexity of life and consciousness is not necessarily the result of urban life."

"In short," Lang felt, "Wells compromised by discussing the defects of reforming society, but in fact lost the good parts of those problems. For example, "The New Machiavelli" only shows how sincerely the author is trying to uncover those false faces. Nevertheless, he is still a good writer, powerful and sincere, but the general shortcoming is that he lacks the attitude of telling stories too much. His most successful work, "The Wheels of Chance," does not have the above shortcomings."

After middle age, Wells' literary works gradually became scarce. "The Shape of Things to Come" should be regarded as a report rather than a story. From an artistic point of view, I think Lang's opinion is still fair, but his scientific themes, no matter how "serious" they are, are more progressive and real than those irresponsible attitudes, and can be ranked above fairy tales as reading materials for young people to cultivate their interest in science. I think that after Wells failed to find a conclusion that could be realized from the power of science, he abandoned his original job and turned to social and political issues——these issues should not be as Lang said: even Solomon should shut his mouth, in fact, it is not impossible to talk about them, as long as we focus on the possible aspects. Like his "The Shape of Things to Come," it is publicly recognized as a successful book, a prophecy, and a good international example. If the international community can really act according to his ideals, why worry about World War III? We are just afraid of looking at Mr. Wells too ideal; he does not transcend reality. The items he shows only depend on whether the peace activists in the international community are willing to do them. I hope that his will can be realized.

Wells is great, seemingly greater than all 20th-century writers, if we put aside the two words of art.

### Preface to the Commemorative Album of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association

— Pan Gongzhan

May 4, 1947, the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association was formally established: this is a happy and congratulatory event! In the feudal era, the capital was often the cultural center: the rulers, in order to consolidate their position, tried their best to absorb talents: the culture produced by the efforts of these talents must be a monochromatic, for-official-use culture. Later, human rights were enlightened, and human dignity was raised high. Culture was no longer centered on individuals——even if it came from several masters, it was autonomous, rational, and not utilitarian——but shifted with the material civilization it created, so major cities became cultural centers: this is the phenomenon that should exist in a democratic era.

Shanghai also became the national cultural center under these conditions.

However, according to the "Treaty of Nanjing" in the twenty-second year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty (1842 AD), Shanghai was opened as a commercial port. In name only, it was "commerce," but in fact, it became a semi-colony: facilities such as concessions insulted our national dignity. The culture produced in such an environment must be a semi-colonial culture, that is, a slavish culture of worshiping money, pleasing foreigners, and low-level tastes.

In World War II, China won international equal status at the cost of blood and flesh. Enlightened allies abolished the unequal treaties that bound China. As a result, Shanghai was restored from a nominal Chinese territory to an actual Chinese territory. However, a truly Chinese-based culture still needs to be built.

In this Shanghai, the national cultural center, and in this unprecedented cultural construction, the Shanghai literary and art writers undoubtedly shouldered a great and arduous responsibility, because literature and art are the education of human emotions, the ploughing of the soul, and the essence of culture.

Before the establishment of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association, Shanghai did not have similar literary and art groups; after the establishment of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association, similar literary and art organizations may also be born. For the former, we sincerely wish them healthy survival; for the latter, we sincerely pray that they will multiply; however, for this newly born Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association, we truly place the most enthusiastic hope, carrying on the past and opening up the future, hoping to unite the Shanghai literary and art writers together.

The territory of literature and art is like a large garden. Specializing in planting a certain kind of flower, even if it is a famous flower, can be prosperous for a while——but "prosperity" is only "for a while"! Various flowers must be skillfully arranged, so that there are flowers to enjoy in all seasons, and they can be compared.

The road of literature and art is also a broad road. Everyone can walk, and everyone can walk "at the same time." Whoever uses more strength will walk faster, and whoever will walk farther. Those who walk slowly, or stop walking, or even turn their heads back, will inevitably regress or decline. As for those who do not work hard themselves, but vainly try to block others from moving forward, they will never succeed!

The purpose revealed in the "Official Declaration" of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association's inaugural meeting lies in "work" and in "association." It wants to reform the current situation of the literary and art circles, which are fragmented, divided, and self-governing, to eliminate factionalism, to unite friends who are loyal to literature and art, to ask friends in the literary and art circles to participate together, to help each other and cooperate; and then to strive for human dignity, to strive for respect for wisdom, to strive for freedom of thought: all of these, the vision is far-reaching, the mind is broad, and it should be unprecedented. If we follow this path, we will surely be able to build the above-mentioned construction project.

I believe that the colleagues of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association are definitely enlightened, optimistic, and proactive. Although countless material and spiritual difficulties are watching us, all the difficulties of mankind are created by mankind itself, and overcoming these difficulties is our responsibility. I personally am willing to follow the gentlemen of the Shanghai literary and art circles, encourage and work together to promote the literary and art undertakings of Shanghai in our nation-building journey!

### The Song of Twilight

— Old Kai

As twilight slips off its bronze-colored sleeping gown, and dusk unfurls its milky silk sash, encircling the forest, trailing over the green chest of the valleys and plains—everything is so hazy, that even the white flocks leisurely returning home in the spaciousness are indistinguishable.

Yet, everything is so serene.

The shallow pond's angry frogs, the short bamboo thicket's sparrows, abruptly cease their child-like clamor and old woman-like chatter.

The church bell seems to have lost its former modulated resonance.

The streams: some utter murmurs of praise, while others stretch out their slender and pure arms, carrying the clear ringing of silver bells and the rolling of pearl wheels.

Wild grasses dance joyfully in the evening breeze, and the first shy stars open their delicate eyes, peering down from the pale cloud heaps.

Swaying willows plant welcoming banners all along the embankment.

On the edge of the cliff, the dense cedar forest nods repeatedly in emotion.

Even the silent distant peaks unexpectedly add a touch of pink, gifted by the setting sun, to the azure, and reveal a kind of restrained and solemn joy.

The song, like a sea swallow, soars in the boundless blue sky. The song, like a wild horse, gallops across the vast prairie permeated with the fragrance of earth.

This beautiful song, under the heavens and above the earth, creates a dazzling and unparalleled world of illusion.

She broadcasts heroic and marvelous激嚮, making life leap with joy; she also bursts forth with mournful and pure tones, causing emotions to raise a white flag to her, causing emotions to tremble at her feet.

In this tranquil, poetic twilight lane, she runs wild across the sky and fields, flying with the soft silk of love, binding every firm young person and young heart. Wandering travelers must pause for a moment from their hurried steps; travelers rushing through the dust and wind occasionally shake off their fatigue under her consolation.

Listen, listen to this beautiful song.

She can open the doors of our souls, recall those joyful dreamscapes, and purify those decadent emotions and sorrowful memories.

Everything is so hazy, and everything is so serene.

The song sung at twilight seems to be an elusive spirit in the air and mist!

### A Midsummer Night's Dream

— Wang Deyun

Decoration

Golden dawn decorates the sunrise; silvery white clouds decorate midday; crimson sunset decorates twilight, and dark blue stars decorate the night.

Life decorates the earth; fresh flowers decorate the maiden; "The bright moon decorates your window;"—You, you decorate my dream.

July

The starry sky of July brings my beautiful Midsummer Night's Dream.

Those silver poetic days, those stone-like stars, those pairs of limpid eyes, that gentle whisper... a series of blue dream memories.

In the bustling reverberation interwoven with zither melodies and frog songs, when your eyes and the stars in the sky shimmer together, my whistle resounded. By the evergreen dwarf trees, we chased after the fireflies of light…

Now, the starry sky of July is still beautiful, but I hold an empty broken heart, delirious with infinitely enchanting old dreams!

Love Song

A love song is the flying spurt of passion, the overflow of melancholy.

With your heart full of sorrow, sing with all your might, sing out your misfortune, your hope, and also sing out your dream.

Even if there is no girl playing the zither by your side, you can still sing. Please pluck the heartstrings of your shaking head, and sing your lonely, anxious, and fiery love song.

If the night breeze is sentimental, it will carry your song to that distant place.

### Miscellaneous Talks on Schemes

— Kengqiang

Poetry is the rising sun, it wants to wipe away the tears that flowers and plants shed in the dark night, and encourage the dome to reveal a cyanic and white micro.

In the fourth poem of "Inscription on Professor Yu Jianhua's Five-Foot Continuous Landscape Painting of Huangshan Mountain," published in this publication on the 6th, the author was "Wang Xiaoqin." The recording and publication were incorrect. This is hereby corrected.

### National Song

— Tan Yunshan

In June of the 36th year of the Republic of China, on my fifth return to China from India, the ship passed through the South China Sea to the Taiwan Strait, and suddenly encountered a hurricane. The waves surged, with a force that seemed to overturn mountains and overturn seas. The situation was extremely dangerous. Thinking of national affairs, I composed two poems, "National Army Song" and "National Song." The following is the "National Song":

(1)

We are Chinese, we must love China; China's rivers and mountains, are so great, China's scenery, is so beautiful.

(2)

We are Chinese, we must love China; China's land, is so fertile; China's products, are so abundant.

(3)

We are Chinese, we must love China; China has the world—the oldest civilization; China has mankind—the longest history.

(4)

We are Chinese, we must love China; We are born here, we eat here; We grow up here, we grow old here.

(5)

We are Chinese, we must love China; Our ancestors, were born here, Our children and grandchildren, will be born here.

(6)

We are Chinese, we must love China; Our gardens, our fields; Our ponds, are all here.

(7)

We are Chinese, we must love China; Our virtues, are love, thrift, and diligence; Our lives, are simple and honest.

(8)

We are Chinese, we must love China; We don't smoke opium, we don't gamble; We only do good, we don't do evil.

(9)

We are Chinese, we must love China; Our bodies are strong, our spirits are healthy; Our habits are good, our minds are upright.

(10)

We are Chinese, we must love China; We must also love—the world and humanity; We must also love—all living beings and all things.

(11)

We are Chinese, we must love China; Only when China is prosperous and strong, will the world be peaceful; Only when China is prosperous and happy, will mankind be at peace.

(12)

We are Chinese, we must love China; Prosperity and strength, prosperity and peace; This is our—responsibility and mission.

(On the Donghai Haitian Ship, June 24th of the 36th year of the Republic of China)

### Plum Blossoms

— Hu Shuyi

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 336

— Ye Jingfeng

In these more than forty hours, apart from a little rest, I spent most of my time guarding by Ding Jun's bedside, hoping he could wake up for even half an hour, or a few minutes, but I never got this last chance. At the same time, I also used excuses to go to several detention centers to explore the other captured comrades, and also contacted Xu Jun once or twice, but I still couldn't find any trace of Yaoqun and Little Tiger. One thing was very clear: there were no women among the detained comrades.

I went to the puppet police headquarters to inquire, and it was said that the Japanese military police had indeed captured two female spies, but as for where they were imprisoned, I didn't know. Regarding Little Tiger, it was also an instruction from the Japanese military police that there was such a magic fellow who looked like both an old man and a child, who could kill people with evil methods. Three or four Japanese military policemen had been killed by him, and even the wound could not be verified; the puppet government must capture him within a limited time. The puppet police had no choice, regardless of whether he was human or a demon, they hadn't even seen his shadow, so where could they go to arrest him? So they had to use the "reward" method to perfunctorily deal with the Japanese.

I was busy in Tianjin for three days, but I can say that I had no results. The Japanese special agents and military police regarded the cracking of this secret agency as a great achievement. With my little position and influence, trying to rescue the detained comrades was just like the Shanghai people's saying: "Don't even talk about it." Not to mention me, even if Tsurumi himself came, I'm afraid it would be impossible; because the special agents here were under Matsu's command, and we had no internal lines, so we couldn't do anything.

On this evening (the 7th), I received a secret telegram from W Jun, saying that he had gotten news of Yaoqun and told me that it would be best to find a way to return to Beiping as soon as possible. I thought that although I couldn't rescue the detained comrades for the time being, at least I had to reduce their suffering. In the hurried chaos, I arranged two things: First, I got a sum of money, half of which was entrusted to the Japanese military policeman who was in charge of management, telling him to treat these people as well as possible, and telling him that this was the instruction of the action headquarters, and he couldn't disobey. At the same time, I distributed the remaining money to several comrades to make things easier for them. Second, when I left, I pretended to be very serious and talked a few words with the head of Matsu's branch in Tianjin, hinting to him: "These important criminals have many clues, and Staff Officer Aobe received my report and will definitely use them." With these words, that fellow would definitely not dare to arbitrarily impose harsh tortures on them again.

When I rushed back to Beiping, W Jun gave me a telegram and a report. The telegram was sent by Yaoqun from Tianjin on July 3rd, and it was not delivered until the 6th. Although it was a telegram, it was slower than a mail package; it had been deciphered from the code into plain text:

Passed through Tianjin and learned that the secret station had been attacked. We are trying to rescue them, but our strength is insufficient and it is difficult to achieve results. Please send reinforcements as soon as possible. If there is no solution within two days, it will be difficult to [illegible] because Zhang [illegible] still has [illegible] dealings. Release.

### The Rising Tide and the Housing Famine

— Shilang

Life is almost threatened every moment. We only hear the sounds of "adjustment" and "rising." Everyone is "sighing."

The government is clearly worried about the rising tide as well. Over the past week, working personnel from the municipal government's Economic Supervision Office have been riding around everywhere, strictly prohibiting the black market for gold and US dollars, and successively cutting off the intercom phones in the speculative markets. This all shows that the government has taken emergency measures to "eliminate the rising tide" and stop "price fluctuations."

If the "July rising tide" can be temporarily stabilized by the government's efforts, this is what everyone is 향 to 求.

But to date, the municipal government has not made any rigid regulations on the issue of housing rents in the city, which is really puzzling.

We believe that the existence of the housing rent black market is also one of the reasons for fueling the rising tide.

For a small room, the landlord (actually the sub-landlord) can ask for 10 or 20 million. A house is even 30 or 40 million. Does the municipal government just allow the black market price of the housing famine to be so rampant, so arrogant?

In order to eliminate the "rising tide," the municipal government should consult with local figures to discuss a remedy for the housing famine. At the very least, it should conduct a thorough investigation of vacant houses throughout the city, rigidly stipulate leasing regulations, and, if necessary, send personnel from the municipal government to enforce them forcibly!

The evil precedent of gold bars for Shanghai housing is entirely the act of breaking the law created by Shanghai "sub-landlords." We ask the municipal government to use the strictest laws to break this man-made "gold bar fortress" in Shanghai!

### Prelude to the War of Resistance

— Qilou

The first bullet of aggression was fired late at night on July 7th, almost entering the early morning of the 8th. People in Jiangnan knew about this news when they read the newspapers on the 9th. Before this, songs of resisting aggression had already resounded throughout the country. Everyone expected that one day we would stand up to stop the enemy and drive them out of the Northeast. However, this first bullet did not give people that feeling at first. We silently swallowed too many insults. Maybe this bullet would have to be swallowed as well.

As a result, in the following days, the authorities used diplomacy to deal with military affairs, and would never give up peace until the last moment. The central radio station broadcast the story of King Goujian of Yue. The people demanded to rise up and expel the Wu army, but King Yue always said it was too early, too early. The youth at that time were more anxious than the people of Yue. Even the elderly believed that they could no longer tolerate it. The songs of resistance resounded through the clouds, but diplomacy was still in progress.

The enemy thought this was an encore of September 18th, and they could encompass North China with a sleepy hand. Only the bystanders were clear, and Europeans and Americans began to warn Japan not to bend the bow too strongly. China was no longer the China of the past. At this time, a conference was being convened in Lushan. The sound of the enemy's artillery fire of aggression was like an empty valley without an echo, so the enemy played more and more freely. Perhaps it was like a rattlesnake that had already struck and had no room to shrink back. In mid-July, the central voice came from Lushan. It gradually accelerated from a slow beat, and gradually rose from a low pitch. It gradually matched the voices of the people, and led the people, forming a great chorus of national resistance.

The prelude to the real War of Resistance was thus slowly unveiled.

### The American Vegetable King

— Yongnian

Readers probably all know that there are major industrialists in the United States, such as the Oil King and the Steel King. Today, I will introduce to you Fred Vahlsing, who operates the American vegetable industry and can be called the Vegetable King.

It is said that most of the vegetables that every American eats, no matter where he lives in the United States, are grown by Vahlsing. Today, Vahlsing's land holdings cover six states in the United States. One vegetable garden in Texas covers 10,000 mu, which can be said to be the largest in the world. There, he grows 500 mu of celery; 1,500 mu of cabbage and 3,000 mu of carrots. He uses hundreds of trucks, trailers and airplanes to sow or harvest. Once, the work clothes he made for his staff weighed 500 tons. He is very knowledgeable about insecticides, climate, freight rates in various places, etc., related to the cultivation and transfer of his products. He is simply like a living encyclopedia. Sometimes, when his business requires him to go out in person, he takes his own twin-engine plane to his destination.

He started in the vegetable business at the age of twelve. At that time, he carried vegetables from his father's vegetable garden in Long Island to New York City for sale, doing twelve dollars worth of business every day, and also selling vegetables for his neighbors, doing sideline business. Later, he took the 10,000 yuan he had accumulated through hard work, plus five pounds of cabbage seeds, and gave them to his friend Keyes. In the hot state of Texas in the South, he sold 200 mu of barren land and began to plant cabbage, which disappeared from the market in the North from November to the coming spring. In the winter of 1927, he first transported cabbage to New York City, which attracted public attention. Restaurants competed to add it to their menus. He gradually expanded his land to thousands of mu. He wanted to plant corn in the same place. Local farmers warned him, saying that there were special pests in that area that would eat up all the corn planted. But he testified: "There will always be a way to deal with it." He followed the expert's instructions and hired 500 workers to drop a mixture of insecticide and heavy oil on each ear of corn. Weeks later, he actually harvested a large amount of winter corn.

Later, he planned to grow potatoes in the eastern United States, so he bought a large piece of marshland that was generally considered worthless and worked hard to operate it. He used bulldozers to dig several miles of trenches and laid down water pipes. Because there were many pests, he had to use airplanes to spray DDT, and he also laid a long perforated steel plate mat near the field as an airport for the airplanes. Months later, he harvested seven tons of potatoes per mu! Two tons more than anyone else's highest output per mu!

Vahlsing's goal is to find new ways to get vegetables from the garden to the kitchen quickly and healthily, which is the secret to his success.

### Telling Jokes While Holding Back Tears

— Chen Ye

Today's magazine editors mostly feel the difficulty of soliciting contributions. It is even more difficult to find outstanding manuscripts. I think the biggest reason here is the huge pressure that the current broken era has placed on everyone's hearts, making it impossible for most people to have a relaxed mood. In today's difficult life, writers are the ones who find it most difficult to cope with. However, the manuscripts that are welcomed are definitely not those that complain. The more difficult people's lives are, the more they demand the relaxation of newspaper texts. Therefore, newspapers and magazines need beautiful essays, broad expositions, travel life, and so on. There are authors who write for reasons other than remuneration, but those with tragic lives also have to write about "Napoleon's Love Life," etc. In turn, they feel like they are telling jokes while holding back tears. Who knows how much sorrow is hidden behind them?

### On Mutual Understanding

— Jiankang

"There are acquaintances all over the world, but how many are intimate!" Many friends who have extensive social circles cannot help but sigh with emotion once their efforts fail.

I have thought about it—why are there "acquaintances all over the world," but so few "intimate" friends? Is it possible that everyone in the world is a bad egg, and everyone, including myself, cannot be intimate with others, and is unwilling to be intimate with others?

Now, I have obtained a superficial explanation:

First, because our interactions often cannot be as satisfactory as we would like. For example; when you and I meet, we inevitably exchange a few pleasantries. Before that, it is either through the introduction of others: or we hand over business cards while introducing ourselves: or "Your surname?" "It happens to be..." We ask and answer each other, and try to understand each other. It's good if we already know our place of origin and occupation. Otherwise, according to Chinese custom, we then ask "Where is your residence?" "Where are you doing well?" Well, people with different paths do not conspire together. I am engaged in construction engineering, and you are engaged in education. I work in an administrative agency, but you are covering up your tracks in the financial world. If you speak Cantonese or Hakka, and I am a Sichuanese who has never left the Kui Gate, how can we get to know each other? Isn't it just "I've admired you for a long time, I've admired you for a long time!" "Ha, haha, ha!" From then on, it's over.

This is to say that in addition to acquaintance, there are also barriers in occupation and language, making it difficult to be intimate, and impossible to be intimate.

Second, to take a step back, assuming that you and I, with different hometowns and originally different occupations, are actually working in the same agency due to accidental circumstances, and even see each other every day or have the opportunity to meet and chat every two or three days, but you may be sitting in a high-ranking position, and I am just an assistant, or I am in charge of a certain department, but you are responsible for the ordinary work of another department. In terms of business, life, and other aspects, there seems to be no way for us to care about each other, and there is no need to do so; similarly, assuming that our positions are equal, but because of our work interests, you are busy in the external affairs department, while I am diligent in the internal affairs. Although we do not hate each other, how can we get to know each other from closeness?

This can be said to be having a relationship but not a deep one; if either of us is suddenly transferred or leaves the job not long after, then it is almost like having no relationship, because you and I have not known each other for a long time, so how can we talk about mutual understanding!

In addition, if you and I find that there are major differences in our personalities, tempers, ways of dealing with people, and even habits, hobbies... or even that we are incompatible, then the difficulty of mutual understanding is even more obvious!

### American Miscellany

— Xu Ziyuan

Severe Housing Shortage, Solutions Available

The entire world is experiencing a housing shortage after the war, and the United States is no exception. However, some countries appear particularly severe, with China being a prime example. Other countries tend to be more moderate, and the United States is one such example. In the US, no one dares to hoard property for speculative purposes, especially housing. Authorities regularly investigate the population and housing occupancy of each household. If the number of rooms exceeds their needs, the government has the power to mandate that they rent it out. Moreover, the rent is determined by the government based on the location, size, age, and amenities of the house. On average, a furnished bedroom with bedding and utilities costs around $30 USD per month. Once the government sets the rent, that's what the tenant pays, no more, no less. If there are any issues, tenants can report it to the rent control board and have the landlord brought to court.

In addition, many public welfare organizations specialize in helping citizens find housing. These include the Red Cross, the USO, and various military schools and units, as well as housing offices set up at various airfields to solve housing problems for military families. They regularly send people to residential areas to solicit available rooms for rent. American landlords generally have considerable sympathy for those who are stranded and are eager to make spare rooms available to military families. There is no practice of raising rents or gouging them. There are no key money or upfront fees, and it is unheard of to pay a year's rent in advance. Those without luggage can pay first and then move in, while those with luggage can move in first and then pay.

Moving in the United States is very simple, usually just a few suitcases. Furniture and bedding are typically provided by the landlord, which is very convenient for traveling families. Even towels, bath towels, and tableware are provided by the landlord. You can also arrange to have meals with the landlord's family, or you can prepare your own meals or eat at a restaurant. Another option is a boarding house that specializes in providing meals. They have set mealtimes, and you simply go in, sit down, and pay for your meal. These places offer home-style cooking at very affordable prices, around 35 cents per meal. Unfamiliar customers sit around a long rectangular table together, with men, women, young, and old all present. It feels like a large family, and the hostess is enthusiastic and encourages you to eat. You can eat a lot of food for very little money. Chinese people are not very willing to go to such places, because Chinese people value vanity. They would rather spend $1.75 on a rare steak that hurts their teeth. Boarding houses usually have rooms for rent, but because the rent is lower, it is difficult to find vacancies. (Twelve)

### News Clippings

— Short Compilation

The price of rice in Ningdu, Jiangxi Province, is rising daily, making it difficult even for beggars to survive. The local beggar chief, Zeng Jinlan, went through the streets ringing a gong and shouting, appealing to the government to prohibit the export of rice, and loudly shouting "Help!" Her cries were met with a hundred responses, and hundreds of poor people gathered in the streets, cheering loudly in support. That evening, Yang Jisheng, the owner of Hongye Rice Shop, loaded three large carts of rice to transport to Ganxian for sale. The carts were attacked and smashed by the poor people with stones at the General Gate. The poor rushed to climb onto the carts, and in an instant, the rice was all snatched away.

In Zhongjia Ping outside the south gate of Wugang County, Hunan Province, there is an old lady, Xiao Zeng, who is 128 years old. She has had four sons and six daughters. Only two daughters remain, both over 80 years old. Because the family is poor, they rely entirely on their own labor to make a living. Upon hearing this, County Magistrate Xu specially prepared one stone of white rice, one fat chicken, two catties of pork, and a set of bedding, and personally went with party and group leaders to present the gifts. When County Magistrate Xu arrived, the old lady was just carrying over eighty catties of water back home. Seeing such distinguished guests arrive, she repeatedly called them good officials.

A junior staff member with the surname Wang at the Longhai Railway Administration has served in the bureau for more than twenty years. Recently, he requested the bureau to provide his pension in advance in order to support his family and prevent them from starving. As for his affairs after death, he cannot afford to worry about them in this situation where even making a living is difficult.

The Suzhou City Defense Command has invented a new method of banning gambling:

"If gambling is discovered, once it is confirmed by interrogation, the perpetrators will be punished by being made to stand in a wooden cage, and the cage will be placed in a busy location in Guanqian Street, where they will be forced to stand for two hours as a warning."

The Nanjing Narcotics Prohibition Agency has requested the allocation of thirty police dogs from the Ministry of Interior's Inspectorate General, specifically to be responsible for detecting opium. These police dogs were purchased from the United States and have received special training. They can smell the scent of opium from one kilometer away, follow the scent to search, and once they find someone with the scent of opium, they will bite them tightly and not let go, without fail.

The Fuxing Town Central Primary School in Mile County, Yunnan Province, has recently been experiencing a severe shortage of funds due to the rising cost of living. They have come up with a bizarre idea of setting up a gambling den in the school to profit from it and supplement the school's funds. The school's teachers and staff stand around the gambling venue every day, soliciting customers.

Wang Shufan from Leping, Jiangxi Province, is the only son of the late National Assemblyman He Keling. He is currently twenty-three years old and weighs 348 catties. He is known as the "King of Fat People." He walks slowly, pants when he sits, and often falls asleep after sitting for a while. He has to have blood drawn at the hospital a couple of times a month to prevent a stroke. Recently, upon hearing that there was a "Fat People's Convention" being organized in Nanchang, he came to the province with his family to see the sights. The Nanchang "Fat People's Convention" seized the opportunity of the "King of Fat People's" visit to the province to hold a welcome party, using it as a way to attract attention.

### Genius Mathematician Hua Luogeng

— Pingzhai

One summer more than ten years ago, I first stepped into the beautiful Tsinghua Garden amidst the sound of cicadas and frogs. Everything was new and strange; even the people coming and going were peculiar. For example, there was an old gentleman wearing a blue Chinese-style coat that was neither new nor old, carrying a cloth bundle in his hand, seemingly concerned about something as he went in and out of the library—who knew that this was the world-renowned Mr. Chen Yinke! There was a plump gentleman, with one leg amputated, holding tightly to two crutches, but going up and down the stairs as if flying: this was Mr. Pan Guangdan!

However, what I will never forget is one evening, when the moonlight was like water, immersing the entire garden in an even cooler atmosphere. As the cool breeze passed, it brought waves of cicada and frog sounds—I suddenly heard someone loudly reciting verses from Browning's poems. Circling around from behind the trees to the stream, I saw a young man in his thirties sitting on the white stone bridge railing, with short "flat-top" hair, black-rimmed glasses, clear and a little haggard, gazing at the moon and reciting poetry.

We walked away on tiptoe, and my friend quietly told me: "This is Hua Luogeng from the mathematics department—a remarkable man!"

Looking back again, he may have felt that someone was watching him. He stood up and walked away with a limp, struggling with difficulty.

After that, I often saw him. I learned that he was from Jintan and had never attended university, but his diligent self-study had enabled him to achieve amazing accomplishments in mathematics. His papers were often published in foreign mathematics journals and received high praise. At that time, renowned figures in the foreign mathematics community, such as Hadamard from France (President of the International Mathematical Union) and Wiener from the United States, were lecturing at Tsinghua University. Mathematics professors and researchers from all universities in Beiping came to listen to their lectures. However, these professors and graduate students came less and less often—in the end, it is said that only Hua Luogeng quietly sat in the audience, "competing" with Hadamard on stage, who was gesturing wildly. The news spread among the students, who said that Hadamard was extremely impressed with Hua Luogeng, repeatedly calling him "Professor Hua," while in fact Mr. Hua's title at that time was still only "Instructor."

Everyone said: Hua Luogeng should go abroad, and everyone guessed that his achievements after going abroad would definitely shock the world even more.

At that time, the situation in North China was most urgent. The students in Beiping launched a massive demonstration, shouting the slogan "Down with Japanese Imperialism" in the face of Japanese military police with murderous expressions.

Mr. Hua was not good at walking, but in one demonstration, the students found him at the front of the line! Seeing his figure, even the most timid students immediately joined this mighty, mournful, and angry procession!

They were victorious, and Mr. Hua indeed went abroad. Whether it was the United States or the Soviet Union, they all bestowed countless top honors upon him. Domestic academic institutions competed to invite him, but he drifted to the United States again. Recently, I heard that he is consulting about his illness.

Mountains and waters are long—who dares to say that Chinese people are inferior to others? Who dares to say that China has no hope!
