### Soviet Union Leads Eight European Nations to Form New Communist International, Issues Joint Declaration Against the United States, Clear Division Between Two Major World Camps

[United Press, Moscow, 5th] It was announced here on the 5th that the communist parties of nine European nations have established a common party program, refusing to compromise with American "imperialism," and have established a headquarters in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, to act in unison. Earlier, sources in Paris said that the communist parties of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, France, Czechoslovakia, and Italy held a meeting in Poland at the end of September to determine the basic program, the content of which is now being published here. Pravda and various European communist newspapers stated: the leaders of the nine communist parties gathered in a certain location in Poland last month, with the Soviet Union sending Politburo members Zhdanov and Malenkov to attend. Their reports are considered an important part of today's one-thousand-word declaration. Zhdanov was one of the signatories to the resolution to dissolve the Third International, announced on May 15, 1943.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 5th] Pravda today published a piece of news of great significance to the international situation: representatives of the communist parties of Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union, France, and Italy held a meeting in Poland at the end of September and resolved to establish an information bureau with its headquarters in Belgrade (the capital of Yugoslavia). The purpose of establishing the information bureau is to exchange experiences and decide on coordinated actions. It will be organized by two representatives from the central committees of each national party who attended the aforementioned meeting, and they will be appointed by the central committees. The bureau will publish a monthly magazine in Russian and French, and may also issue a weekly magazine in the future. Zhdanov, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, reported on the international situation at the meeting. After hearing the report, a declaration was issued stating: The world is now divided into two major camps. The Soviet Union is currently fighting for peace and democracy, while the United States is attempting to control the world. The declaration strongly criticized Truman, Marshall, and the socialist parties of Britain and France, calling the right-wing elements of the socialist parties traitors. It also stated: American imperialism is attempting to enslave Europe, China, Indonesia, and South America, and to turn the big capitalists of Germany and Japan into its pawns. In addition to criticizing British Prime Minister Attlee, French Socialist Party leader Blum, French Prime Minister Ramadier, President of the Italian Constituent Assembly Saragat, Austrian Chancellor Renner (Social Democratic Party), etc., the declaration also pointed out that British Foreign Secretary Bevin is enthusiastically pursuing British imperialism. The declaration finally encouraged the communist parties of all countries to strive for national independence and democracy, and to resist imperialist plans in politics, economics, and ideology. The representatives attending the aforementioned meeting were all important figures in the communist parties of their respective countries, such as Zhdanov of the Soviet Union and Minc of Poland (the country's Minister of Industry).

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today refused to formally comment on Moscow's announcement of the re-establishment of the Communist International, but other officials privately admitted to being deeply concerned, fearing that this move foreshadows the Soviet Union intensifying its aid to the Chinese Communists. It is said that few Chinese people believe that the Communist International has indeed been dissolved. Moscow's announcement makes the Soviet Union's plans even more obvious. Chinese officials will closely monitor the future development of the situation. (Reactions from the United States, Britain, and France can be found in the left corner of page three.)

### Improving the Livelihood of Civil Servants: Original Proposal Reviewed and Four Measures Decided, to be Submitted to the Legislative Yuan Plenary Session Today for Discussion

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The proposal to improve the livelihood of civil servants and teachers was reviewed again by the Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 6th. Chairman Liu Tong presided over the meeting, and more than ten people including Liu Butong, Liu Zhiping, and Cheng Yuanzhen attended. After two hours of heated discussion, it was resolved to rename the "Civil Servants and Teachers' Life Loan Project" to "Civil Servants and Teachers' Livelihood Improvement Project," and the following decisions were made:

1.  Starting from September, the minimum standard of living for civil servants and teachers should be based on the salary earned before the war, at 30 yuan, calculated according to the cost of living index. Salaries exceeding this amount will be paid at one-tenth of the cost of living index. The calculation formula is as follows: 2.  Maintain the current method of purchasing physical goods.

2.  Provide dormitories for civil servants and teachers. a. Request the government to continue building new civil servant and teacher villages. b. Request the government to allocate enemy and puppet properties to civil servants and teachers as dormitories.

3.  Civil servants and their direct relatives receive free medical care when they are sick, and their children are exempt from tuition fees when they study in primary and secondary schools.

Three supplementary resolutions: Stop private construction loans, and loans that have been issued should be recovered immediately. For special circumstances, interest should be calculated at the private interest rate of ordinary banks. The treatment of civil servants and teachers should be equal. The Housing Leasing Regulations should be revised as soon as possible. After this proposal is decided, it will be submitted for discussion at the Legislative Yuan plenary session on the 7th.

### Control Yuan Continues Investigation of Overseas Foreign Exchange Usage, Song Ziwen Expresses Opinions on Control Yuan Report

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] According to reliable sources, although the domestic part of the investigation into the use of foreign exchange has been completed, the most important data in the United States remains to be collected. After all, the use of the US$500 million that the United States loaned to us in the past has not yet been fully clarified, and there are some doubts about it. For this reason, the Control Yuan has asked the Ministry of Finance to instruct the agencies in the United States to provide the Control Yuan with information on the use and quantity of materials supplied for loans in the United States, so as to conduct further investigations. The entire work will be difficult to complete in the short term. It is also heard that this investigation is not related to the deposits of Chinese people in the United States.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] After the Control Yuan published the "Investigation Report on the Use of Foreign Exchange and the Business Conditions of Various Companies," which was published in various newspapers, Guangdong Chairman (former Premier) Song Ziwen made a statement on this matter. (Continued on the first column of page two)

### Du Zhenyuan Visits Song Ziwen, Discusses Building a Branch Line of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Transport Coal from Gouyadong to Guangzhou

[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th] Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau, stated that he and Chairman Song discussed the security of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the construction of a branch line from Pingshi to Gouyadong. Gouyadong is a coal-producing area in northern Guangdong. There are currently more than 30 million tons of unmined coal in the area that no one is mining and transporting. Therefore, it is planned to build a branch line from there to connect to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway so that coal can be continuously transported to Guangzhou. At that time, the coal shortage in Guangdong Province can be solved. The line is 35 kilometers long and requires 50 billion yuan. He met with Chairman Song at 10:00 a.m. on the 6th to prepare to apply to the Executive Yuan for funds for construction and to mobilize investment from all parties for development. He also stated that Chairman Song paid great attention to the Huangpu Port. The branch line from Guangzhou to Huangpu has been completely completed. He personally inspected the road on the 4th. Although the project is simple, it is barely usable.

### Song Ziwen Summons Subordinates

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Song Ziwen summoned the heads of various units under the provincial government in the past few days and gave instructions on security, finance, finance, and economic construction. Mr. Song has great hopes for the Industrial Division and is determined to actively develop it. It is heard that the most large-scale textile factory and the Shunde Sugar Factory will first be allowed to be reorganized and expanded.

### Members of the Engineers Association Visit Industrial Construction

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Members attending the annual meeting of the Engineers Association set off in two groups on the morning of the 6th to visit industrial construction near the capital. More than 300 people went to visit the Yongli Chemical Plant and returned to Nanjing in the afternoon. The factory was built in February of the 26th year and is the only large-scale chemical factory in Asia. The maximum daily output of ammonium sulfate (fertilizer) can reach 150 tons, and sulfuric acid can reach 500 tons. However, it was occupied by the enemy during the war, and it was greatly damaged. Currently, it can only produce 100 tons of ammonium sulfate and 80 tons of sulfuric acid per day. Expansion is currently being sought, and some of the machines purchased from the United States have been shipped. Two factories are planned to be set up to double the existing production. The reason for the current reduction in output is the difficulty in obtaining coal sources. The large scale of the factory has made its neighboring Liuhe County famous as a chemical city.

### Minority Parties Participate in General Election, Negotiations to be Held Again Within the Week

[Our newspaper] According to sources close to Zhang Junli, Zhang's visit to Nanjing to negotiate the general election issue did not reach an agreement. Before leaving, he agreed with Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng to continue negotiations within this week. Whether it will be in Nanjing or Shanghai has not been decided.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] An official from the Central Committee of the Kuomintang told visiting reporters that "the reason why the negotiations between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Kuomintang on participating in the general election failed to reach an agreement is the technical problem of how to enable a considerable number of minority parties to be elected. After all, voters in various places have the freedom to vote, and even candidates nominated by the Kuomintang cannot guarantee that they will be elected. The Kuomintang people deeply hope to cooperate closely with minority parties in the general election, but it is slightly difficult to achieve a situation where each party has a considerable number of people elected in terms of technology, so it remains to be studied further. As for how to resolve the issue of minority parties recommending party members to participate in popularly elected local public opinion institutions, it also needs to be discussed further, but there is no difficulty in participating in local temporary councils."

### Traffic Blockade in City and Suburbs, Changchun City Defense Further Consolidated, National Army in Shenyang Holds Defense Exercise

[Our newspaper, Changchun, 6th] The bandit Independent Fourth Division, which had fled from Wanbaoshan to Xiaolong, is close to the suburbs of Changchun, but no attempt to attack Changchun has been found. Mengjiatun in southern Changchun was once again occupied by bandits last night. Bandits on horseback have now been found on the south, west, and north sides of Changchun, totaling nearly 20,000. However, after the National Army announced the blockade of traffic between the city and the suburbs starting from the 5th, public order in the city became more consolidated. However, Songjia Jiazi in the north of the city was harassed by bandits yesterday, and the police station arrested more than ten disguised bandits in the area. According to National Army generals in charge of the city defense, Changchun is now a "steel Changchun," and the small bandits are not to be feared. The Sixth Column of bandits, which attacked Danantun and Gongzhuling from Yitong, has now been determined by the military to have crossed the Siping area via Helusu on the east side of the China Changchun Railway and is participating in the battle south of Siping.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] The city of Changchun has not been alarmed by the proximity of the bandits to the suburbs in recent days. Shops and stalls in the city are operating as usual, and cinemas and entertainment venues are as prosperous as usual. Public order in the city is as usual. The city defense fortifications around the city, which 600,000 citizens have built by hand for several months, meander through the suburbs, making them seem to live in solid bunkers. The military authorities in Changchun announced the blockade of traffic between the city and the suburbs starting yesterday and conducted a household census all night.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] The magnificent pace of Changchun's men, women, and children concentrating their efforts to defend Changchun is about to enter its climax. The military and political authorities in Changchun are now launching all men and women in the city to organize a wartime work corps, whose detachments will be scattered in various defense areas to undertake various logistical tasks. Civil servants and students from various agencies and schools in Changchun will be the basic members of the corps.

[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 6th] The garrison troops held a defense exercise this afternoon, with Chu Xichun as the commander-in-chief. Streets and alleys were equipped with well-equipped National Army troops, ordered to deploy defenses as if facing a formidable enemy. According to the person in charge of the Defense Headquarters, the significance of the exercise lies in guarding against the infiltration of small groups of Communist bandits and the activities of Communist bandits' latent elements.

[Another dispatch] At the Hunhe Grand Iron Bridge in the south of Shenyang on the night of the 5th, a team of more than 70 people suddenly arrived. Four soldiers went forward and claimed to be there to change defenses. The defending army replied that they had not received orders and waved them away. Not long after, the other party fired at the iron bridge, but was repelled by the defending army. The bandits' trick failed. (News about price controls in Panjin on the fourth column of page two)

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Fierce fighting continues in the Gaoling area along the Beining Railway outside the Guan. The National Army is unusually strong, and the Pingjin Army inside the Guan is now unimpeded.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] The situation in western Liaoning is calm. A unit of the Fifth Division of the Seventh Column of bandits attacked Gaotai Mountain, Liusha River, and other places northeast of Xinmin on the morning of the 5th. After a fierce attack by the National Army, almost the entire army was wiped out and has now fled.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] The important town of Wulajie in northern Jilin is still firmly defended by the National Army. The two sides are facing each other across the Songhua River in Wulajie. There was no fighting in eastern Jilin yesterday.

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] According to well-informed British sources: U.S. consular personnel in Changchun and Shenyang will not be evacuated.

Editorial

### Further Discussion on the Draft Commercial Registration Law

Regarding the draft Commercial Registration Law, our newspaper expressed initial opinions in an article on the 1st of this month, but felt the need for further elaboration. Therefore, we now present the following additional arguments:

Eliminate Redundant Procedures: Businesses that have already completed company registration should, as a rule, not be required to undergo commercial registration again. This is because the company name has already been determined during the registration process, and the issue of trade name rights does not arise, so there is no need for further protection. Following this logic, whenever a business's trade name rights are already protected by other regulations, requiring further commercial registration is redundant. Therefore, for businesses such as grain merchants and pawnshops that have already obtained official permits, the law should allow for exceptions. This would save merchants from going through repetitive procedures and would not compromise the government's administrative oversight.

Establish More Registration Agencies: Current regulations stipulate that the competent authority for commercial registration is the county government at the county level and the social affairs bureau in municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. This poses no major obstacle in cities because businesses are relatively concentrated, distances are limited, and transportation is readily available. Even if the procedures require multiple trips, it is still manageable. However, the situation in counties is very different. Outside the urban areas, the rural markets and villages can be tens or even hundreds of miles away. If the current system requires all businesses to apply directly to the county government, the costs of food, lodging, and transportation will inevitably exceed the registration fees, placing an undue burden on merchants. To alleviate this difficulty, it should be stipulated that county governments may delegate the handling or acceptance of applications to local district offices, thereby easing the burden on businesses.

Provide Assistance with Registration Procedures: All registration procedures, including required documents and fees, may appear simple. However, many ordinary merchants and citizens are unfamiliar with laws and regulations and struggle with filling out forms, leaving them feeling helpless. Even in Shanghai, a city known for its progressive atmosphere and higher levels of business acumen, many businesses still have to pay experts to handle the application process. How much more difficult is it in inland cities? The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, recognizing this situation, has introduced rules for public associations to assist with the registration process, precisely to ease the burden on merchants and citizens. Given the scarcity of experts and greater barriers in inland areas, clear guidelines should be established, allowing designated personnel from the competent authorities to provide one-on-one guidance and assistance with filling out forms for those who are unable to do so, charging reasonable fees, to avoid unnecessary delays and minimize the substantial mental and material losses suffered by merchants.

Maintain Voluntary Registration: The above suggestions are all aimed at facilitating commercial activity. However, if the draft law is adopted, making commercial registration mandatory and enforcing strict deadlines with penalties for non-compliance, the policy of protecting businesses' trade name rights will inevitably deviate from its intended purpose and become an oppressive measure. As mentioned previously, mandatory registration does not enhance government administration. Some argue that without mandatory registration, the government cannot gain a comprehensive overview of commercial activity, thus hindering its ability to formulate appropriate policies to address deficiencies. In other words, those who advocate for mandatory registration aim to obtain commercial data and statistics for policy-making, which is understandable. However, it should be recognized that administrative surveys and statistics should be conducted by the government itself and should not burden the public, forcing all merchants to expend resources and face penalties under the guise of commercial registration to satisfy the desire for secondary benefits. For example, last year, certain agencies and organizations in this city conducted a survey on labor conditions by distributing forms, collecting data, and assigning personnel to provide guidance. The results were satisfactory because they were based on factual information and general knowledge. We believe that this is a good practice that should be emulated when conducting commercial surveys.

Moreover, merchants tend to be lazy and seek convenience, and even with strict enforcement of mandatory registration, the outcome may not be entirely satisfactory. Why do we say this? Currently, membership in trade associations is legally mandatory, and penalties are in place for non-compliance, yet many businesses still do not join. Similarly, workers are legally required to join labor unions, but many still do not. Furthermore, current commercial registration, based on ministerial orders, is already mandatory. In Shanghai, when it was first introduced, specific areas were designated, and deadlines were set for completion. The local regulations were even stricter than the draft law. However, after nearly two years of urging and repeated extensions, it is said that only about 60,000 businesses have registered so far. In inland counties, not only are merchants indifferent, but the county governments responsible for this task are often too busy to attend to it. Therefore, relying on commercial registration to obtain comprehensive commercial data and statistics may be unrealistic.

Add Restrictive Clauses: It is not legal coercion but the allure of benefits that drives registration. In Shanghai, for example, the only industries with high registration rates are those with access to goods allocation. It is said that the total number of grain merchants in this city exceeds 4,000. Concerned about the excessive number, some relevant authorities wish to impose restrictions. However, given the available resources, what legal grounds are there to reject registrations? Furthermore, due to the allocation of goods through several trade associations, the number of new members has surged, leading to a situation where resources are spread thin, and the interests of existing members are diluted. The newcomers have even taken over the dominant positions, disrupting the original order. These members have appealed to the authorities to impose restrictions. However, under the current laws, what legal means are available to impose such restrictions?

As we all know, Shanghai is home to unscrupulous businesses that exist in name only, specializing in speculation and fraud. However, as long as they meet the requirements for registration, there is no way to refuse their application. Moreover, according to Article 20 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Enterprises During Extraordinary Periods, restrictions can be imposed on the manufacturing of luxury goods or other non-essential enterprises. However, the Commercial Registration Law does not contain any such provisions. Most surprisingly, gambling is explicitly prohibited, but the registration law does not explicitly prohibit the manufacturing and sale of gambling paraphernalia. Examples of this kind are numerous. We believe that the conditions for restricting registration, as stipulated in Article 6 of the Implementing Rules, namely, "not contrary to public order" and "good customs," are insufficient and require supplementation.

Chapter VII of the draft law stipulates: "Businesses that have not been registered before the implementation of this law shall, within one year after the implementation of this law, apply for establishment registration in accordance with the provisions of this law." This deadline is also too short. Given that it has taken Shanghai two years to complete registration, and even with lenient estimates, only about two-thirds of businesses have registered, it is conceivable that other counties and cities that have not yet initiated the process or have vast jurisdictions will need more time. It is important to recognize that once this deadline is written into the law, it becomes a rigid requirement. If the registration is not completed by the deadline, not only will all unregistered businesses be considered illegal, but the competent authorities in each city and county will also be held accountable for failing to implement the law effectively. Therefore, it is best not to include the registration deadline in the law but to allow local administrative authorities to adjust it based on their specific circumstances.

### Song Ziwen Issues Statement

(Continued from page 1) Mr. Song stated: "The provisional measures for the administration of foreign exchange and import-export trade have all been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council for implementation. As President of the Executive Yuan, I am responsible for enforcing the law. All foreign exchange converted during my tenure, with my approval, has been vetted to ensure compliance with the administrative measures before being approved for conversion. There has absolutely been no instance of non-compliance. After the government convened the Political Consultative Conference in February of the 35th year of the Republic, the general public believed that the country could finally be stabilized. Therefore, the government devoted its full efforts to stabilizing prices and finance so that the people, who had suffered from prolonged warfare, could find some respite. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party violated the agreement and resumed hostilities. Transportation facilities were largely destroyed, production capacity was reduced, and military expenditures increased, leading to a sharp increase in currency issuance. These developments cannot be solely attributed to my responsibility. The public will judge fairly, and there is no need for me to elaborate. As for the foreign exchange converted by the Fuzhong, Yangzi, and China Construction Bank companies, the Ministry of Finance has conducted detailed investigations and published the figures. It accounts for only 0.5% of the total foreign exchange converted, which is one-half of one percent. When the Associated Press of America published news claiming that these three companies monopolized foreign exchange, thus monopolizing import-export trade, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement clarifying the situation, refuting the Associated Press's report as completely baseless and denying any possibility of monopolizing import-export trade. I have never inquired about the affairs of Fuzhong and Yangzi companies. As for the China Construction Bank, I resigned from my position as director when I became President of the Executive Yuan. Therefore, if there were any irregularities in the operations of the company, the responsible persons of the company should be held accountable, and I bear no responsibility. I have not yet seen the full text released by the Control Yuan. I am providing these comments based on what I have read in the newspapers."

### Opening Up Local Political Power

[Our Report] The Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party are taking a relatively proactive stance toward opening up local political power. The nominees of the Democratic Socialist Party for the three provincial committees have been finalized as Zhang Zhongxuan (Hubei), Tan Kaiyun (Anhui), and Zhong Jiemin (Guangdong). Li Yunian, a member of the China Youth Party, has announced the establishment of the Hubei Provincial Committee. After the National Congress, Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, and Liu Dongyan were designated as representatives to visit Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng separately to discuss the opening up of local political organs and the protection of the party members' activities in various regions. Zhang and Wu stated that "opening up local political power is the government's established policy and will be implemented gradually.

### Military and Official Discipline Supervisory Group Submits Suggestions to Improve the Handling of Enemy Property in the Hebei-Beiping-Tianjin Area

[Our Beiping Report, 6th] The Military and Official Discipline Supervisory Group, responding to accusations regarding the handling of enemy property by the Hebei-Beiping-Tianjin Enemy Property Management Bureau, conducted an investigation and discovered instances of corruption. They have prepared a set of recommendations and submitted them to the Control Yuan via telegram for transmittal to the Executive Yuan. The recommendations stated: "Real estate that should be returned is not returned, while real estate that should not be returned is returned. In terms of materials, collusion with unscrupulous merchants or purchases and auctions dominated by influential figures have occurred." The Bureau is scheduled to cease operations soon and transfer responsibilities to the China Trust Bureau. However, due to the urgency of the matter, the current staff still numbers over 400. Therefore, the China Trust Bureau will be understaffed after taking over. Establishing a separate organization would result in a top-heavy structure. Therefore, the recommendations suggest that after the Bureau ceases operations, the China Trust Bureau, representing the Executive Yuan, should jointly form a committee with local governments and public opinion organizations to avoid the abuses of power by a single entity. The committee should conduct a thorough investigation of the past work.

### Li Shutian Delivers Speech: The Major Port in the North Should Still Be in Qinghekou; Tanggu New Port Is Prone to Freezing

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th] Li Shutian, Dean of the College of Engineering at Beiyang University, recently delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society, discussing the Hai River, the Tanggu New Port, and the major port in the North. Mr. Li began by stating, "We should use a telescope, not a microscope, when looking at seaports." He continued, "Throughout history, the Yellow River has flowed into the sea through Tianjin, and the silt carried by the river has clogged the harbor, making it impossible to build a major port at Dagu. Comparing the major port in the North in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan with the Tanggu New Port, the major port in the North is only a few miles away from a 40-foot deep-water area, and the surrounding waters do not freeze in winter. The Tanggu New Port, on the other hand, lacks flowing river water and is prone to freezing. Therefore, the major port in the North should still be in Qinghekou." Mr. Li also discussed the functions of Tanggu New Port, stating, "The navigation channel in the Japanese-built new port plan is 200 meters wide and 6 meters deep, which is only sufficient for coastal vessels. The New Port Engineering Bureau plans to deepen the channel to 8 meters. Although this standard can be technically achieved, it will be difficult to maintain."

### Rao Invites Minister Gu to Attend the Asian Labor Conference in India

They also stated that if he is unable to attend the entire conference due to official duties, he should at least attend some of the meetings to enhance the impact of the first-ever labor conference held in Asia due to his presence. It is said that Minister Gu is unable to accept the invitation due to his busy schedule and the approaching general election, as well as his important responsibilities related to vocational and women's organizations' election affairs. If arrangements can be made in the near future, he may be able to accept the invitation.

### Full Report of the Supervisory Yuan

(Continued from yesterday) Since the government promulgated the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade on November 17, 1946, and established the Provisional Import Management Committee to adjust the exchange rate to 3.350, in addition to individuals and other non-import foreign exchange needs that continued to be approved and settled by designated banks, applications for foreign exchange required for imported goods, where letters of credit had been opened by designated banks before November 17, and shipments had commenced to China before November 24 (November 20 for Hong Kong), except for items listed in the attached schedule which should be applied for at the secretariat of the Provisional Import Management Committee, all other imported goods should be applied for import permits from the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank. For orders placed after November 17, they should be sent to the various departments of the Provisional Management Committee for review according to the type of goods. That is, for goods listed in Schedule 1 of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, applications should be submitted to the secretariat of the committee; for goods listed in Schedule 2, applications should be submitted to the Quota Allocation Department or the Import Management Department; for goods listed in Schedule 3A, applications should be submitted to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank. Designated banks should not freely settle or sell foreign exchange applied for by importers without prior review and approval from the relevant competent authorities (however, designated banks may still approve and settle foreign exchange for goods listed in Schedule 1 and Schedule 3A if their value is less than US$2,000). As for the settlement and sale of foreign exchange for individuals and other non-import purposes (such as export insurance premiums and freight), the Central Bank stipulated in Notice No. 69 on December 16, 1946, that from that date onward, settlement and sale to designated banks must be approved by the Central Bank. As a result of this control, the quantity of imports gradually decreased, and instances of foreign exchange waste were rarely discovered.

In February of this year, a gold rush occurred, and prices soared. The black market exchange rate was 7,600 yuan on February 1, rose to 9,000 yuan on February 5, rose to 13,500 yuan on February 10, and rose to 14,000 yuan on February 14. Therefore, the government had no choice but to promulgate emergency economic measures to prohibit the free trading and use of gold and U.S. dollars, and at the same time adjusted the exchange rate to 12,000 yuan. At that time, exports were quite active in the short term, while imports became increasingly difficult. In recent months, the black market has revived, and the official price has become detached from the market price. Exporters also feel constrained. Overseas Chinese merchants evade imports in the Hong Kong area. The foreign exchange business of various designated banks has decreased sharply. Therefore, the government further adopted the method of changing the foreign exchange rate based on market conditions at any time on August 17, in addition to the fixed official price. For imported goods, from August 18, it was explicitly ordered that all those with self-provided foreign exchange should also temporarily suspend imports, in order to further tighten the use of foreign exchange.

(C) Analysis of Foreign Exchange Usage Figures

Since the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, there have been repeated changes in foreign exchange management institutions and usage policies, as mentioned above. Regarding the foreign exchange usage in each period, the following figures have been investigated:

The total amount of foreign exchange sold by the Central Bank and designated banks to general industry, commerce, and individuals for legitimate needs, excluding the US$64,200,845.95 sold from August 19, 1945, to March 3, 1946, as mentioned earlier, is calculated from March 4, 1946, to November 17 of the same year. During this eight-and-a-half-month period, according to the provisions of the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, except for the various goods listed in Schedule B that should be prohibited from import, and the various items listed in Schedule A that must be applied to the customs for permission before import, all kinds of goods not listed in the two schedules can be freely imported, only needing to apply to the customs for tax payment according to the prescribed tariff, without any specific quantity restrictions, and the foreign exchange required to pay the price should also be supplied according to the requested quantity. During this period, the Central Bank and designated banks sold a total of US$381,522,461.13, £16,761,660, and HK$24,325,589.88. From November 17, 1946, when the government revised the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, from November 18 of the same month to February 15, 1947, according to Schedule 1 of the revised measures, US$2,340,333.20, £77,177, and HK$81,720.83 were sold; according to Schedule 2, US$10,559,460.80, £349,698, and HK$255,375.00 were sold; according to Schedule 3A, US$7,212,246.80, £447,029, and HK$3,212,083.42 were sold. In total, from March 4, 1946, to February 15, 1947, US$401,663,501.93, £17,635,564, and HK$27,874,769.13 were sold. Among them, the amount sold from November 18, 1946, to February 15, 1947, was US$20,111,040.80, £873,904, and HK$3,549,179.25, accounting for only 5% of the total amount. In these two periods, in terms of the total amount, the quantity of foreign exchange used decreased significantly from November 18, 1946, to February 15, 1947, due to the promulgation of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade. In terms of the users, the Executive Yuan approved the settlement and sale of a total of US$20,434,085.66 to government agencies, and approved the import of goods worth approximately US$480 million, and approved applications from individuals and industries and businesses worth approximately US$23 million. From February 16 to August 30 of this year, the designated banks sold a total of US$4,981,878.52, £635,965, and HK$155,998.00 according to Schedule 1; US$100,655,688.00, £4,018,798, and HK$4,293,718.00 according to Schedule 2; and US$7,495,892.00, £945,582, and HK$2,099,633.00 according to Schedule 3. The total is approximately US$150 million (see Attachments 5 and 6 for details).

In terms of the content of imported goods, the largest quantity was cotton, with a total import value of US$120,794,178.00, £1,894,820, HK$176,737.00, and Indian Rupees 65,056,056 from March 4 of last year to August 30 of this year, totaling about US$180 million. The second largest was liquid fuel, worth approximately US$125 million, followed by tobacco leaves and cigarettes worth approximately US$45 million, chemical drugs worth approximately US$78.5 million, various foods worth approximately US$27.5 million, hardware and machinery worth approximately US$80 million, and transportation equipment (including automobiles) worth approximately US$26 million (see Attachment 5 for details). From this, it can be seen that a large amount of foreign exchange in the past year or so has been used more for consumer goods and less for construction purposes.

(D) The Central Trust Bureau, Materials Supply Bureau, and World Trade Corporation's Foreign Exchange Usage for Ordering Materials

Central Trust Bureau: It is found that the bureau's handling of overseas material orders is coordinated by the purchasing department, and the materials handled can be divided into three categories. The first category is materials imported from abroad on behalf of the government, including rice, flour, mobile housing, newsprint, pulp, coal, cotton, and automobiles from 1945 to the end of August this year (see Attachment 7). Among them, the automobile item was ordered under the order of the Executive Yuan (see the next section). The second category is materials ordered from abroad on behalf of various agencies, totaling 179 cases from September 1945 to the end of August this year, including 62 cases for gasoline, motor oil, and aviation oil ordered by the Liquid Fuel Management Committee, the Aviation Committee, the Ministry of Military Administration, the Joint Logistics Headquarters, and the Air Force Headquarters, most of which were approved for foreign exchange settlement by the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Finance. In addition, there are various items such as paper, machinery, medicines, chemicals, books, instruments, and burlap bags, with no extravagant items (see Attachment 8 for details). The third category is materials purchased abroad by the Central Trust Bureau itself, totaling 14 cases from September 1945 to the end of August this year. Among them, newsprint, burlap bags, tinplate, oats, and yellow Vaseline are necessary items for self-use or distribution. In addition, 213 tons of Zunlin paper cost US$91,950.00, 5,210,403 board feet of American pine cost US$515,441.42, and seven Chevrolet cars cost US$17,000.00. Because the bureau has the convenience of owning foreign exchange, it is inevitable that it is used for non-urgent needs (see Attachment 9 for details).

Materials Supply Bureau: The main purpose of establishing the Materials Supply Bureau is to supplement the government's budget balance of revenue and expenditure, use materials to absorb legal currency in exchange for foreign exchange, and at the same time concentrate and properly distribute the remaining materials from various parties after the Anti-Japanese War to avoid waste. According to the bureau's report, from its establishment to the end of August this year, the cases handled include Lend-Lease reception materials, World Trade Corporation materials, Canadian loan materials, Export Bank materials, Lend-Lease surplus materials, American surplus materials, British credit loan materials, receiving materials from the Chongqing Equipment General Depot of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, World Trade Corporation's stored materials in India, British credit loan stored materials in India, and other stored materials in India, totaling US$174,801,116.32, £345,075, and National Currency 5,860,846,863.00 (see Attachment 10 for details). The content of these materials includes military supplies, railway equipment, materials, machine parts, ordnance equipment, textiles and their equipment, aviation equipment, chemical engineering, and pharmaceutical instruments. However, there is a vehicle item in the U.S. military surplus materials, totaling US$7,794,352.15, and the vehicles were originally jeeps and trucks used by the U.S. military. In addition, there are automobile parts in the World Trade Corporation's materials, totaling US$185,927.26. In addition, it is learned that the bureau successively purchased 10 small cars, including five Austin cars imported on September 6, 1946. The factory habits did not exceed the prescribed quota, but they were put up for sale immediately without reporting to the customs for inspection. On February 28, 1947, five small cars were imported, including four Ford cars and one Cadillac car, which were said to have been approved by the Executive Yuan Secretariat in letter No. 11226 from the Congwu section, and were also not reported to the customs for inspection. In addition, on September 9, 1946, and April 17, 1947, three Buick cars were imported successively, all of which had permits and were inspected by the customs. In addition, the bureau purchased three refrigerators on December 22, 1946. It is found that the bureau's mission was originally to purchase and transport war-surplus materials on behalf of the government according to the law. The purchase and transportation of such cars and refrigerators has exceeded the bureau's business scope, and the bureau uses the convenience of transportation tools, and the usual import of materials does not need to be declared to the customs for inspection according to general import procedures. The import of these cars is actually not in compliance with the procedures.

World Trade Corporation (Universal Trading Corporation): It is found that the organization of the World Trade Corporation (referred to as the Unified Company by the Associated Press) was approved by the Trade Commission in October 1938 and registered in New York. At that time, the company's task was to sell domestic export tung oil and other products in the United States on behalf of the government to repay American loans. The Trade Commission organized the Fuxing Company and Fuhua Company in China to preside over the handling. The funds of each company were allocated by the Ministry of Finance. Although the loan was repaid, various parties needed more materials during the war, and the company was entrusted to purchase them in the United States. It is found that the company is located in New York, with Chen Guangfu as the chairman and Lechhead as the general manager, and Ren Sida and Xia Peng as the deputy general managers. In addition to the original entrusted work of the Trade Commission, the Executive Yuan instructed in July of this year to take over the work of the Washington Materials Supply Committee. All foreign ordering and urging of materials are handled by the company. However, since its establishment, although the company is a part of the Ministry of Finance in nature, it has no formal office in China, so the outside world is mostly unaware of the truth. Chinese and foreign newspapers even mistakenly regard it as an organization of "rich capital." Moreover, since the company is an affiliated institution of the Ministry of Finance, its annual operating accounts have not been reported (see the telegram from Lu Yinyou of the Ministry of Finance's Treasury Department). After urging in March of this year, the last year's balance sheet was submitted, in which general management and indirect expenses (General adminstiueand ceuerhead for expenses) reached US$361,290.06, and the reserve for contingencies (Reserueler contingencies) was US$1,800,000.00. In addition, the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee once suggested to the Executive Yuan that the representative office of the Resources Committee in the United States, the Chinese Materials Committee in the United States, the office of the Ministry of Communications in the United States, and the office of the Ministry of Health in the United States should merge and unify the institutions to save expenses. Except for the Chinese Materials Committee in the United States, which has been abolished, other institutions continue to exist. In this way, not only does the government's foreign procurement of materials have a divergent appearance, but it also wastes foreign exchange, and it is necessary to unify and merge them as soon as possible. The content of the materials purchased by the World Trade Corporation itself is based on its office in the United States, and it is impossible to audit it. In the future, there should be strict audit and supervision methods to avoid waste. Moreover, the business of the Materials Supply Bureau and the purchasing department of the Central Trust Bureau is also similar to that of the company (the entrusted materials of the Central Trust Bureau and the purchased and transported materials of the Materials Supply Bureau all have the company's entrusted items), and it is also necessary to unify them as soon as possible. (Relevant documents on the World Trade Corporation are stored in the Ministry of Finance). (Continued on page 5)

### The Formation of Confrontation Between the Eastern and Western Blocs, the Hope of Compromise Between the United States and the Soviet Union is Slim, the United Nations General Assembly Enters its Fourth Week with No Achievements

[Associated Press, Lake Success, October 6] The Soviet Union's new international communist organization plunged the United Nations General Assembly into chaos on October 6, shattering any hopes that the Eastern and Western blocs might reconcile at this session of the General Assembly and other meetings to be held soon. At the same time as this shocking news was announced, representatives of various countries in the United Nations felt more and more that the United States' original promise to strive for leadership could not be fulfilled. Secretary of State Marshall did not follow the expectations of the public and take on leadership, but has so far adopted a detached attitude. Some representatives to the General Assembly interpreted the Soviet Union's actions as a formal declaration of a "diplomatic war" that has been going on with Western countries for months. The collective organization of communist parties in nine European countries, the de facto new Communist International, is expected to soon be reflected in the various committees of the General Assembly. Representatives of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries have already launched a major attack in the committees on the United States' "war-mongering," "imperialism," and "domination of the world." The smaller countries now predict that a large-scale political war is about to break out in the coming months.

The United States' plan at the United Nations has produced the following questionable progress: 1. The American candidate for the President of the General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, has failed. 2. Despite being in the minority, the United States strongly refused to have Ukraine replace Poland as a member of the Security Council, and is now advocating for India. 3. The United States had previously condemned Iran, Burma, and Afghanistan in strong terms as aggressors, but now, if the three countries agree to accept a new United Nations mission and cooperate with it, the United States is prepared to step back. 4. The United States submitted the Korean issue to the General Assembly. The Soviet Union's response was to suggest that the U.S. and Soviet troops withdraw from Korea before the end of this year. The United States has not yet been able to agree on a detailed counter-mechanism. 5. The U.S. delegation is still making a fuss and studying countermeasures against Vyshinsky's "war-mongering" accusations. 6. Marshall is still refusing to express the U.S.'s position on the status of Palestine. 7. Marshall's "small General Assembly" plan has not been met with enthusiasm. Even the United States' best friends, such as Britain, are not interested. The stalemate and propaganda speeches of the past three weeks have raised doubts as to whether the 57-nation General Assembly committee can resolve the paralysis of the Security Council.

### The United States Upholds the Spirit of Unyielding Perseverance for World Freedom and Prosperity, Austin Rejects Communist Propaganda

[Associated Press, New York, October 5] The U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations, Austin, made a nationwide broadcast on October 5, which various parties recognize as a public statement in response to the European Communist Party's attack on the American capitalist system.

Although Austin did not mention the name of the Communist Party, nor did he directly mention the Soviet Union, he clearly stated that the United States is not intimidated by any propaganda campaign. At the same time, he refuted the Communist Party's attacks, saying that the United States has not tried to manipulate other countries economically or ideologically through the Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, or other methods. We are working to achieve a situation where no country can dominate another. We are willing to fight resolutely for world recovery, world peace, and world stability, freedom and prosperity. I believe that the constructive forces currently being vigorously pursued at the United Nations General Assembly, as well as the recovery plan recently drafted by the sixteen countries, will eventually be successful.

### Eaton Frankly Criticizes the Soviet Union's Intimidation Campaign

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, October 5] The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eaton, yesterday criticized the recent Soviet accusation that the United States is a "war-monger" as part of an intimidation campaign. He pointed out: "We should have long ago learned a lesson from another dictator (this dictator is no longer with us), that the loudest and most violent cries are a kind of psychological offensive, sometimes used to conceal defeats, and sometimes to divert the attention of the people, in order to cover up the casualties inflicted on the people by the dictator."

### The UN Special Committee Debates the Palestine Issue, All Parties are Waiting for the US to Announce its Attitude

[This newspaper news] New York, October 6 Radio: Lake Success news: At 11:40 this morning, the UN Special Committee will resume its debate on the Palestine issue, and the first speaker will be Panama's representative Reyes.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, October 5] It is heard that the United Nations' dispute over Palestine is approaching an important stage of development? Between October 6 and 9, the United States will definitely state its attitude regarding the future of Palestine, and what path it will take to resolve it. Although there are many rumors about Marshall's position on this issue, it is not known what his attitude is. Zionist officials believe that unless the United States adopts a friendly and firm position on the establishment of a Jewish state, the Zionist movement will have little chance of realizing its hopes. They deeply fear that the ambiguity of the United States' attitude will allow the Arabs to gain a practical victory and implement the demands of the independent Palestinian Arab state.

### Hopes for the Implementation of the US Aid to Europe Plan are Growing

[This newspaper news] New York, October 6 Radio: Moscow's announcement of the revival of the Communist International may strengthen the forces in the US Congress that support President Truman's aid to Europe plan. The government hopes to convene a special session of Congress before December 1, and is currently waiting for members of Congress to make a final decision. Experts studying the aid to Europe plan believe that the US government can find a way to allocate 200 million yuan to meet the various urgent needs of Europe before the end of this year. If Congress does not convene a special session, it may approve 600 million to 800 million yuan when it reconvenes in January next year, and then make a unified plan when implementing the Marshall Plan. Also, it is reported that Truman is currently looking for a capable civil servant to be responsible for planning the aid plan. Baruch, who previously drafted the international control of atomic energy, has a very high voice.

[Reuters, Washington, October 6] The Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bridges, convened the committee to meet on November 18 to review President Truman's temporary emergency aid plan of 527 million yuan to Europe. This is one of the four congressional bodies that must approve it before the plan can be implemented. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet on November 10.

### Truman and Marshall Broadcast to the Nation, Calling on People to Fast to Help Western Europe to Contribute to World Peace

[United Press, Washington, October 6] President Truman today launched an unprecedented "self-denial" offensive against the famine in Western Europe, advocating frugality in diet as America's contribution to peace. The President asked the people of the country not to eat meat on Tuesdays, eggs and poultry on Thursdays, and to save a slice of bread every day.

In addition, he also asked the grain exchange to increase the cash payable by the buyer to 33.33% to prevent speculation. Another White House request was that the brewing industry should stop work for 60 days at the earliest, which brewers called a bolt from the blue.

[Associated Press, Washington, October 5] Secretary of State Marshall broadcast that food is the most critical factor in American foreign policy, and the American people's attitude towards food can promote or destroy world peace and security. "From today until the end of winter at the latest, American men, women and children will exert their personal power in international affairs. The relationship between American individuals and world affairs has become clear. Our foreign policy has entered the homes of Americans and is eating at the same table with Americans. If there is a severe winter and scarcity, the European economy may collapse immediately, and we will also be severely affected."

[Associated Press, Washington, October 5] President Truman's Civil Food Committee initiated a campaign to save wheat by the bushel to help Western Europe, and today has secured a partial guarantee from the national industry, allowing the savings of 7.5 million bushels of wheat.

According to a resolution passed by the Hokkaido prefectural assembly last August, the government demanded that the three islands be returned to Japan.

### Itagaki Seishiro on Trial Claims Our Army Started the Northeast Incident

[United Press International, Washington, 6th] The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal began hearing the case of Itagaki Seishiro, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, one of the main war criminals, on the 6th. He insisted that the September 18, 1931 Northeast Incident was merely an accidental encounter and not a planned invasion, and was in fact caused by constant acts of sabotage by Chinese troops.

### Communist International Declares Revival, Launches Full-Scale Anti-American Campaign

[Reuters, London, 6th] Political figures here believe that the establishment of a joint bureau in Belgrade by the communist parties of nine European countries is intended to unite communist forces to resist the Marshall Plan and general American policy. The position of Italy and France in this new Communist International is intended to counter the importance the United States places on the development of the two countries. It is worth remembering that when the Marshall Aid proposal was first put forward, the Italian Communist Party initially supported Italy's participation, and the communist parties of Czechoslovakia and Poland did not oppose it.

Recent Activities of European Communists

Since the conference of communist parties from many countries in London in February to attend the British Communist Party congress, the efforts of Western European communist parties to take independent action have become increasingly clear. Subsequently, the communist parties of France, Belgium, and Italy withdrew from coalition cabinets one after another, and recently the British Communist Party has also changed from conditionally supporting the Labour government to unconditionally opposing the Labour government. The French Communist Party has announced that it will implement education for party members to instill trust in Stalinism. In Eastern Europe, the connection between the Communist Party and other parties has also been severed. The attempt by Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia to establish a Socialist Party agreement to merge political parties has failed. Recent executive committee meetings of the Socialist parties of Hungary and Czechoslovakia not only refused to merge with the Communist Party, but also refused to issue any joint declarations in the future. The relationship between the Socialist parties of Romania and Bulgaria and the Communist Party is still pending. It is expected that in Eastern European countries, the offensive against those within the Socialist Party who oppose merging with the Communist Party will be intensified. Since the new treaties with former enemy countries came into effect, the technical obstacles to the formation of joint organizations between Allied countries and political parties in former enemy countries have been removed. The communist parties in European countries that have not yet joined this new Communist International include those of Scandinavia, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, and the United Kingdom. Generally speaking, the communist parties in these countries are unlikely to have a reasonable opportunity to gain power.

Moscow Observers See Great Significance

[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] Observers here generally believe that the establishment of the nine-nation Communist Party Committee in Belgrade is the most important development in communist politics since the dissolution of the Communist International in 1943. It is the first time that the Soviet Communist Party, together with foreign communist parties, has openly declared that the world has been split into two major fronts. It is a public and concrete action to mobilize communist forces to resist imperialism, and its significance is increased by the strength of the communist parties in France and Italy. Its intention is to openly declare war on US-centered imperialism, to expand communist power everywhere in the world, and to jointly formulate a plan to resist financial imperialism.

Washington Closely Watching the Communist Party's All-Out Anti-American Campaign

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] The US government today believes that the European Nine-Nation Communist Party Conference and its political declaration against the US, announced by Moscow, show a revival of the pre-war Soviet-manipulated international communist movement. Moscow's announcement proves its determination to launch a full-scale campaign against the United States and its foreign policy and leaders in order to gain control of Western Europe and other strategic locations in the world. This action is identical to what the Soviet Union is currently doing at the United Nations General Assembly. Until recently, the Soviet side had openly denied that communism was an organized international movement. Stalin announced the dissolution of the Communist International during the war to strengthen relations with the United Kingdom and the United States, especially with the United States, in order to obtain military equipment under Lend-Lease for the war against Germany; however, times have changed, and the Third International seems to be reusable.

British Communist Party Expresses Complete Surprise

[Reuters, London, 5th] A member of the British Communist Party said that the news of the establishment of the Communist International organization came as a complete surprise to the British Communist Party. Left-wing Labour MP "rebel" leader Crossman said, "I believe that Moscow is not satisfied with the independence granted to the communist parties of various countries, and therefore it is necessary to correct it." But for the Socialist parties of Western Europe, this can serve as a warning to quickly organize a joint organization of Western European Socialist parties to implement a common policy.

French Political Circles Observe that the Soviet Union Will Adopt a New Policy

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] French political figures believe that the establishment of the new Communist International is a precursor to the Soviet Union's adoption of a new policy towards Western countries, especially France and Italy. Some observers believe that this move indicates the Kremlin's fear that the Soviet Union will become more isolated after the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference in November. The declaration of the leaders of the nine communist parties is intended to make the French and Italian communist parties completely embrace the Soviet Union. French Communist Party Secretary-General Thorez addressed 10,000 people in Béziers, southern France, today, condemning American bankers for oppressing the French government and preventing the Communist Party from participating in the cabinet.

De Gaulle and Austrian Foreign Minister Vigorously Criticize the Soviet Union

[United Press International, Paris, 6th] De Gaulle said at a political gathering here on the 5th that the United States's resolute anti-Soviet stance is extremely important for French security. De Gaulle said that the United States has preserved its strength to counter the Soviet Union's ambitions in the world. The people of our country especially understand this guarantee, although indirect, is very important.

[Reuters, Vienna, 5th] 50,000 members of the Austrian People's Party convened a conference here today, and Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber attended the conference and delivered a speech, commenting on the Communist Party's organization of international organizations, saying that the Communist Party has been mobilized and will use the needs of the Austrian people to seize power. Gruber then vigorously criticized the Communist Party's propaganda, and said that Austria's basic interest lies in hoping that neighboring countries, especially the Soviet Union, will not support the internal conspiracies launched by the Communist Party. Austrian Deputy Minister of the Interior Graf denounced the Communist Party for preparing a complete set of conspiracies and declared that Austria would never submit to its threats.

### Sino-US Air Route Officially Opens, "Nanjing" Arrives Safely in Guam, Flies to Honolulu Today, Arrives in San Francisco on the 9th, Journalists and Others Invited to Visit the United States

[Our Dispatch] The Sino-US direct air route, which has been in preparation for many years, officially opened its first flight at the Shanghai airport yesterday morning. A DC-4 type four-engine "Nanjing" "Sky Master" giant aircraft stood majestically in the center of the airport. Under the bright morning sun, the silver gleamed brilliantly, and the Chinese and American flags fluttering on the left and right sides of the aircraft's nose complemented each other, greatly increasing its magnificence. China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) General Manager Liu Jingyi arrived at the airport at 7:30 AM to warmly greet the guests. Mayor Wu and his wife, US Consul General Davis and his wife, Speaker Pan, and the press figures who were invited to visit the United States, including Zeng Xubai, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, Wei Jingmeng, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Information Bureau, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Chen Xunyu, General Manager and Editor-in-Chief of this newspaper, Zhao Minzhi, Editor-in-Chief of the Xinwen Daily, Fei Yimin, Deputy Manager of the Ta Kung Pao, Yu Bin, Chairman of the Yishi Daily, Bu Qingmao, Publisher of the Tianjin Minguo Daily, and more than ten others, as well as 15 CNAC employees traveling to the United States and 12 ordinary passengers, arrived one after another. Wang Xiaolai also took off his long robe yesterday and changed into a brand-new Western suit that he rarely wore, frequently nodding and saying goodbye to the business representatives and Shanghai Miss Wang Yunmei and others who were seeing them off.

The Sino-US air route opens, and journalists and others are invited to take the first passenger plane to visit the United States.

(Bottom photo) The Mayor's wife performs the bottle-breaking ceremony, pouring the seawater onto the nose of the plane. Standing behind is CNAC General Manager Liu Jingyi. (Our Dispatch)

At 8:40 AM, a simple opening ceremony was held. First, Liu Jingyi delivered a speech, briefly stating: "The opening of Sino-US flights not only shortens the distance between China and the United States and enhances friendly relations, but also opens a new page in the history of international civil aviation." The original speech was recorded by CNAC and made into a film, which will be combined with the Pan American Airlines commemoration of the opening ceremony in San Francisco and preserved as a permanent memorial. Subsequently, Mayor Wu's wife performed the bottle-breaking ceremony. The white long-necked bottle was filled with seawater brought from San Francisco Bay. Because it was carefully carried from a long distance, the mouth of the bottle was tightly sealed. Liu Jingyi used force to peel it off, and it took five minutes to open it. In front of more than 200 guests, Mrs. Wu slowly poured the bottle of water onto the nose of the plane. This ceremony was completed, and the engines started accordingly.

The "Nanjing" aircraft was piloted by pilot Chen Qifa yesterday. He joined CNAC in 1935. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was responsible for transportation work and flew over the Hump 600 times. He is one of the most outstanding aviation talents in our country. There were 44 seats in the cabin, and everyone took their seats according to their assigned numbers. Flight attendants He Shuzhen, Deng Xiuzhen, and Chen Menghua provided onboard service. The aircraft took off at 9:10 AM and arrived safely in Guam at about 7:00 PM. It is reported that after arriving in Honolulu today, it will stay for one day for all the tourists to visit, and it will fly to San Francisco at noon on the 9th.

After the personnel on the plane arrive in San Francisco, some of them will be accompanied by CNAC staff to visit New York, Washington, and other places. Others, such as Liu Jingyi, will go to Brazil, and Yu Bin will stay in the United States for a month and then go to Rome on a special mission. The aircraft will return to Shanghai on the 12th and will fly to the United States again on the 17th. The group of visitors will return to China in due course on appropriate flights.

The Sino-US air route was prepared based on the Sino-US Air Transport Agreement signed on December 20, 1946. In January of this year, the Ministry of Communications designated CNAC as the company to operate Sino-US flights. CNAC then sent aircraft for two test flights on January 23 and March 29, which were successful. The route via Guam, Wake Island, Honolulu, and San Francisco was officially decided. In May of this year, CNAC applied for permission from the US Civil Aeronautics Administration, and it was officially opened after President Truman signed and approved it recently.

According to CNAC officials, the company's South Pacific route has been in trial operation since August, and everything is now ready, and it will be opened soon. The company is also applying to the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo for the Sino-Japanese route. Once approved, it can be started.

### Classmate, Mother and Son, Lovers, A Triple Relationship, A Tortuous Marriage, A Strange Family Change, Free Love Disregards Ethics

[Our Dispatch] The District Court accepted a bizarre case yesterday, which was almost incestuous in nature, with a tortuous plot and full of dramatic meaning. The male and female protagonists were classmates six years ago, mother and son three years ago, and are currently "husband and wife". There is a person named Li Chengshan, who is a businessman from Guangdong. There is a daughter named Peihua, who is now 25 years old. She is of mixed Chinese and Korean descent. She is beautiful and graceful. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Chengshan's goods stored in Hong Kong were looted, resulting in huge losses. Chengshan wanted to make up for the losses and borrowed cash from his friend Jie Jing. Jie readily agreed, but on the condition that he wanted to marry Li Peihua as his second wife, as his wife had been bombed to death during the war. Li Chengshan readily agreed. Unexpectedly, Li Peiju and Jie Zixiong were classmates in middle school and had a good relationship and close contacts. If she married Jie Jingzhai, her future situation would be very difficult, and Jing was over half a hundred years old, and the combination of beauty and white hair was not suitable, so Peihua firmly refused to obey. Later, Li Chengshan threatened to commit suicide and forced Peihua to marry Jie Jing, and Peihua had no choice but to agree, and telegraphed Jie Zhixiong, who was studying in Berlin at the time, urging him to return. When Zhixiong returned to China, Peihua had already married Jie Jingzhai, and the former close friend had become a stepmother. In order to take care of the family, Jie Jingzhai ordered Zhixiong to get engaged to a woman named Su Yiyun. On the eve of the wedding this year, Jie Zhixiong suddenly fled from Guangzhou with his stepmother Li Peihua, each leaving a letter to Jie Jingzhai, roughly saying that modern marriage should be voluntary and free love, how can we still follow the feudal society's buying and selling method and force it to be implemented? Now we are far away from your evil family, even if you want to find us for thousands of miles, it will be in vain, etc. Jie Jingzhai did not investigate, but Su Yiyun intended to marry someone else. Because she had a marriage contract with Jie Zhixiong, she intended to request its dissolution. Guan Jie Zhixiong and Li Peihua are in Shanghai, especially stating the above process and applying to the Shanghai District Court for permission to dissolve the marriage contract.

### Extorting Comfort Money in Someone Else's Name, Civil Affairs Bureau Sends People to Investigate Thoroughly

Civil Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Xiaosong made a statement: Although Shanghai is richer than the mainland, the wealth of each district and bao is different. Citizens donate comfort money and physical objects out of willingness to help, and they naturally consider the differences in wealth in each district and bao, so they naturally cannot be uniform. However, recently, rumors have spread that soldiers from a certain unit have personally gone to each district and bao with fellow volunteers to solicit comfort money and cashmere sweaters, forcing districts and baos to pay car fees, and even forcing them at midnight. If there are people who come to extort money in someone else's name, the people of the district and bao can ignore them. This bureau has sent people to investigate.

### Fire in Nanjing Road at Dusk, Hualian Tongle Club Destroyed, Several Neighbors Affected

[Our Dispatch] The Hualian Tongle Club at No. 194 Nanjing Road caught fire due to carelessness in the kitchen on the second floor at 6:00 PM last night, which spread to the storefronts of Fenghua Tobacco Shop, Wenxin Stationery Company, and Shanghai Xingye Trust Company.

Fortunately, the fire trucks arrived one after another at 6:30 PM, and the business office of the Ta Kung Pao next door was not affected, only the second floor was slightly stained with water and suffered a false alarm. A quarter of an hour after the fire broke out, with the help of the wind, it quickly penetrated the roof. At that time, it was when the lights of Nanjing Road were just starting to come on, and pedestrians were bustling, so the situation was extremely chaotic for a while. Soon, police officers gathered, and fire trucks from various districts came one after another, and they tried their best to put out the fire. Traffic was not fully restored until about 8:00 PM.

### Base Pay, Index-Based Wages, Five Theaters Lost 300 Million, 1,000 Yuan Promise Resolved Happily

[Our Dispatch] The labor-capital dispute over the salaries of the troupe at the Tianchan, Huangjin, China, Da Stage, and Gong Stage five Peking opera theaters was mediated by the Social Bureau, which convened both labor and capital parties to negotiate at the bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday. It was resolved satisfactorily at 6:00 PM, and minutes were signed on the spot.

Yesterday, the representatives of the capital side who attended were Zhou Jianxing, Chairman of the Peking Opera Theater Association, Wang Qijun of the China Grand Theater, Zhou Xiru of the Huangjin Grand Theater, Zhang Shanshan of the Gong Stage, Fan Hengyu of the Da Stage, and Tang Pingfan of the Tianchan Wutai. The representatives of the labor side who attended were Ma Qingyun, Qiu Wangcheng, Wu Sibao, Bai Wenliang, Ju Zhenhe, and Shen Jisheng. Meng Song from the Social Bureau attended and presided over the meeting.

Three Conditions

In addition to discussing the issue of converting wages into base pay based on the cost-of-living index, the capital side also proposed three conditions: Compensation for the losses of the theaters on the evening of the 4th; employees publish an apology in the newspaper; and wages for employees who stopped performing that evening will be deducted. After Meng Song from the Bureau repeatedly persuaded and negotiated, the employees first published an apology in the newspaper. Regarding the deduction of wages for the evening of the performance, because the employees' income was limited, the capital side agreed that the employees would jointly donate 1 million yuan, half to the Peking Opera Theater Association and half to the Lingjie United Association. Regarding the loss of 300 million yuan to the five theaters due to the suspension of performances, the two sides argued fiercely. The employees could not afford it at all due to their meager income. Zhou Jianxing said that although he knew that the employees could not afford to pay compensation, even paying one yuan would be acceptable. After Zhou finished speaking, Ma Qingyun, a representative of the labor side, took out a piece of 1,000 yuan banknote from the Central Bank from his pocket and claimed that he represented all the employees to pay compensation. Zhou took it in the same way. The whole room was filled with laughter and applause, and the labor and capital sides signed the minutes in this harmonious atmosphere.

Agreed on Base Pay

According to the regulations, both parties agreed to the following base pay: Those whose wages are below 700,000 will be converted into base pay. It will be 40 yuan in October and 42 yuan in November, and it will not be changed again in the future. For those who exceed 700,000, 700,000 will be used as the base, converted to 42 yuan, and the rest will be extrapolated according to the monthly index, limited to the original salary of 2 million yuan.

Prices Will Rise Again

According to Zhou Jianxing and Wang Qijun, after this adjustment of employee treatment, the expenditure increased by 75% compared to before, so ticket prices will also be adjusted. However, the entertainment industry is already in a difficult situation, and ticket prices cannot be adjusted too high, otherwise it will be more difficult to develop business.

### Dongjiadu Robbery and Murder: A Mahjong Game Interrupted by Thugs, Three Deaths and Injuries at Wansheng Soy Sauce Shop

[Our Report] At around 9 PM last night, a robber in uniform suddenly appeared at Wansheng Soy Sauce Shop, No. 109, South District Street, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. Brandishing a wooden-cased gun, he encountered Hu Shiji (30 years old, residing in Fusantang Street, Shanghai), Huang Furong (40 years old, a local resident living in Xiaopi Lane), and others who were playing mahjong in the shop. They were forced into a room on the left (the Baozhang's office). When Hu and the others shouted for help, the robber fired several shots, fatally hitting Hu and Huang in vital areas, causing them to fall to the ground and die. A stray bullet also injured Zhang Fengbao (21 years old, from Chongming), an apprentice, in the left leg.

### Business Bankruptcy, Owed Taxes: Should Be Distributed Equally with General Creditors, Unified Interpretation by the Judicial Yuan

[Our Report] Regarding the case of how to collect outstanding taxes from businesses that have declared bankruptcy due to poor business performance, the Ministry of Finance requested an interpretation from the Judicial Yuan twice in February of this year. The response stated: "After deliberation by the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of this Yuan, it is resolved that when a taxpayer is declared bankrupt, the taxes owed before the declaration of bankruptcy, according to the provisions of Article 103, Paragraph 1 of the Bankruptcy Law, are not prohibited from being bankruptcy claims. If the law does not have provisions for priority of payment for such bankruptcy claims, they should be distributed equally with other bankruptcy claims." In short, after a store goes bankrupt, if there are no legal provisions for "priority of payment" for the taxes owed, they should be distributed equally with general claims. Otherwise, the taxes owed to the government should be paid in full before other debts can be paid. The city's Finance Bureau plans to implement this accordingly.

### Young Woman Flaunting Attire Hides Thief, Tricycle Driver Acts Righteously, Violent Thief Shoots Two People, Finally Shot Down and Captured, Turns Out to Be a Recent Ex-Convict

[Our Report] Jiang Chen Juan, a young woman, lives at No. 7 Dongsiwen Lane, Xinzha Road. At 10:50 AM yesterday, dressed elegantly and carrying a basket, she went to the Chenjiabang vegetable market to buy vegetables. She wore two gold bracelets on her wrist, which caught the eye of a thief. As she returned home and was about to enter the back door of No. 7, she was accosted by two thieves who snatched the gold bracelets and put them in their pockets. The woman screamed, angering the thieves, who fired a shot, hitting her left leg and causing her to fall to the ground. At the same time, Tang Asheng, a 68-year-old neighbor, saw what was happening and helped to shout for help, which resulted in him also being grazed in the left ankle by shrapnel. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the two thieves fled. As they reached the lane, a tricycle driver, Jiang Rongsheng, chased after them, along Xinzha Road from west to east, turning into Chengdu North Road. Many people along the way helped in the chase. At this time, police officer Zhou Jiting, No. 1545, from the Chengdu Road Police Station, heard the news and joined the pursuit. When they reached Chengdu Road, Jiang Rongsheng caught up with one of the thieves and grabbed him. The thief fired two shots, hitting Jiang in the right arm and buttocks. In extreme pain, he let go. Police officer No. 1545 then fired six shots, hitting the thief holding the gun, two in the left leg and abdomen. After capturing him, he also confiscated the fast/slow machine gun he was holding, and checked the chamber to find fifteen bullets remaining. The other thief had escaped in the confusion. At the same time, the Xin Cheng Police Branch was notified, and Deputy Branch Chief Ding led squad members Gu Qiguan, Police Chief Ma Renyong, Zhao Yongji, and a large number of police officers in police vehicles to investigate. They immediately sent the injured victim and the righteous tricycle driver Jiang Rongsheng to the hospital for treatment. The wounded violent thief was taken to the station for questioning. He identified himself as Tang Ruyou, 32 years old, from Nantong, and had been a farmer in his original hometown. Four years ago, he joined the bandit army as a squad leader. He recently came to Shanghai. Later, police officers checked his fingerprints and discovered that he had committed two robbery cases and was sentenced to ten years in prison. He had just been released last month. He was sent to the Police Hospital for treatment. The stolen pair of gold bracelets were still taken away by the escaped thief, and are currently being pursued.

### Zhang Shankun's Accusation Case: Prosecutor Discusses Reasons for Delay

[Our Report] The case of film figures Zhang Shankun, Chen Yunshang, and others, who were accused of being suspected traitors, has been under investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office for ten months without resolution. Yesterday, prosecutor Qu Rong, who is handling the case, stated: "Because it was rumored that Zhang Shankun and others were hiding in Hong Kong, a letter was sent to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, forwarding it to the Hong Kong government, requesting the extradition of Zhang Shankun and others. Unexpectedly, no reply has been received for several months, which has made it impossible to close the case. A letter was recently sent to urge them. The reason for the delay of the case to this day lies in this." When asked about Zhang Shankun currently being wanted by order of the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office, prosecutor Qu stated that he had not heard of it.

### Smuggling Silver Hidden in a Tobacco Shop: 10,000 Taels

[Our Report] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau raided Zhengyu Tobacco Shop at No. 507 Sichuan Middle Road yesterday afternoon and seized smuggled silver, including 8,100 silver dollars, 4,350 silver dimes, 17 silver ingots weighing 50 taels each, 55 weighing 20 taels each, 55 weighing 10 taels each, 15 silver bars, and a bag of small silver ingots, totaling over 12,000 taels, worth over 400 million legal tender at market prices. According to Liu Yusan, the manager of the shop, this silver was gradually purchased at the store during the occupation of Shanghai, fearing that the enemy and puppets would discover it, so it was secretly hidden in a specially made concealed wooden box, covered with rice and placed on a small shelf on the second floor. Recently, the structure collapsed due to excessive load, leading to its discovery and a confidential report that the shop was engaged in black market trading of gold and currency.

### Shanghai Kuomintang Party Headquarters Holds Grand Tea Party to Welcome Zhang Zhizhong, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Cheng Tianfang

[Our Report] The Shanghai Kuomintang Party Headquarters and district party branches held a grand tea party at the Police Recreation Center yesterday afternoon to welcome Zhang Zhizhong, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Cheng Tianfang. More than 600 people from all walks of life attended, including Wu Guozhen, Wu Kaixian, and Shao Shuiping. After Chairman Fang Zhi delivered a welcome address, Zhang Zhizhong gave a speech, saying that he came to Shanghai for a short rest and that it was inconvenient to talk about military or diplomatic affairs. He had seen the plays "Handsome Man" and "Fake Falsehood" in Shanghai, which were very humorous and relaxing, and implied two principles of life: "Honest people may suffer small losses, but ultimately benefit," and "If hypocrisy can be eliminated, any problem can be solved." He also said, "The merger of the party and the youth league is a wise and great measure. It is hoped that comrades can understand, tolerate, trust each other, and make the party a pure and revolutionary group. With the enemy at the door today, there is no room for disputes and friction. It is better for individuals to suffer small losses than to let the revolution suffer big losses. If we can do this, the current difficult period will surely pass quickly."

Creating a New Revolutionary Shanghai

After Zhang's speech, Chiang Ching-kuo was invited to speak. Chiang said briefly that he came to Shanghai to handle the merger of the party and the youth league, and would handle everything with a learning attitude. He said that he had traveled all over the country and liked Dihua the most and Shanghai the least. But Shanghai is the heart of our country and must establish a new spirit and create a new revolutionary Shanghai. Cheng Tianfang's speech detailed his impressions of the United States, saying that the United States was amazing in its development of transportation and telecommunications, its rapid technological progress, and the surge in the number of university students after the war, with more than three million students in colleges and universities across the country, many times more than before the war. Such widespread higher education has a profound impact on the future of society. The high standard of living of its people is unparalleled by other countries, with an average annual income of $1,300 per person. The high national income is enviable. The total number of unemployed people in the United States is only 500,000, which is not a threat to social security.

Shortcomings of American Society

But on the other hand, American society also has its shortcomings. The main ones are: extreme waste of resources, low social morality, and increased crime, especially the dramatic increase in juvenile delinquency, which is even more worrying. According to U.S. government statistics, there were 200,000 cases of juvenile delinquency in the past year, which is alarming. Prices continue to rise and have not been controlled, and labor strikes occur from time to time. Experts speculate that a recession is inevitable. Cheng then analyzed the United States' attitude towards China in detail, pointing out that the recent misunderstandings and prejudices of the United States towards China are due to the following reasons: The long-term and organized malicious propaganda of the American Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party in the United States. American journalists suffered material hardships in China's wartime capital during the war and were deeply resentful of the wartime news censorship system, so they made various comments unfavorable to China after returning home. And in today's America, only works that criticize China can gain both fame and fortune. For example, American journalist Theodore White, who had no reputation before, wrote a book "Thunder Out of China" after returning home, which completely distorted China, but sold 400,000 to 500,000 copies and made him famous.

Strengthening Publicity to the United States

U.S. Army and Air Force personnel who served in China during the war felt the hardship of material life and developed dissatisfaction. After returning home, they often made unfavorable remarks about China. Many officials in the U.S. government are left-leaning and often deliberately publish documents unfavorable to China, while refusing to publish those favorable to China. The anti-government propaganda of Chinese living in the United States, including senior officials and visiting professors, greatly damages the credibility of the government. For example, at the 200th anniversary of Princeton University, a lecture on Far East issues was held, and a Chinese professor criticized the government more fiercely than the Americans criticized the Chinese government, which local newspapers considered important news. At the same time, on the other hand, China's overseas propaganda agencies have never actively promoted the government's policies and the Kuomintang's ideology, which is also a reason why Americans misunderstand us. However, Cheng believes that there is no need to be pessimistic about this situation, and that we should consider strengthening propaganda and communication between China and the United States to correct the wrong impressions of the United States and South Korea about us. The conference ended at about 5 p.m. in a harmonious atmosphere.

### Difficulties Encountered During the Rehabilitation of the Zibo Mining Area

[Our report from Jinan, 2nd dispatch] My general impression of this trip to Zibo is: "The roads are fit for ghosts, the drinks are gruel, and the lodging is in widows' villages."

The expression "The roads are fit for ghosts" refers, on the one hand, to the fact that the roads are so bad that it is unimaginable. Our six-wheeled Dodge truck was driving on them as slowly and laboriously as a water buffalo plowing a paddy field. For example, on the first day, we used 25 gallons of gasoline to travel from Jinan to Longshan, a total of only 35 kilometers, overturning once and almost overturning more than ten times. Everyone was on high alert, ready to register with King Yama at any time, this is the first point. Secondly, the local guerrillas still often appeared along both sides of the road. We encountered a Communist attack when we visited the Nandings lightweight metal factory and a larger attack at Yazhuang between Zhangdian and Zhoucun. Before our car reached Mashangzhuang, before Yazhuang, the car

got stuck in the mud

and could not get out. With great difficulty, we found many wooden boards, used towing ropes and pulling, and drove out of the mud pit. When we reached Yazhuang, the village was on a tributary of the Xiaoqing River, and we happened to meet the Communists who had removed several stone slabs from the bridge, ready to install fuses and bury landmines. Fortunately, the car arrived a few minutes early and the mines had not been buried yet. When fifty or sixty guerrillas heard the sound of the car engine, they hid in the green gauze tents on both sides of the river. Even more fortunate was that we all got out of the car when it crossed the river. Otherwise, if the bandits concentrated their fire on the car, there would inevitably have been deaths and injuries. However, it was unfortunate that the twenty or so soldiers we were carrying were composed of various companies of the engineering corps, superficially led by a company instructor, but they did not obey orders in danger and fled on their own. The only two light machine guns we had could not fire a single bullet because the gunners were flustered and the bullets came loose. So, when our car had just crossed the river and the bandits in the sorghum fields on both sides of the river concentrated their fire on us, our soldiers, in addition to firing a few rifles randomly, only managed to break through the encirclement and flee on their own. After running wildly for five or six miles, we finally entered a safe zone. When we arrived in Zhoucun that day, it was said that five groups of returning refugees, a total of more than thirty people, had been robbed at the same location before and after us, with two deaths, three injuries, and five captured. The common people had no military force, became refugees, and were robbed. Isn't this the road to King Yama?

In the villages I passed along the way, I witnessed that the living standards of the common people had been depressed to the lowest level. Every day they drink soup made of bran, millet noodles, sorghum flour, etc. This kind of soup cannot be named, it can only be called "gruel". And in the villages along the way, except for old men and groups of naked children, there were only women. When asked about their "shopkeeper" (the Shandong term for husband), they either said: "He fled to Jinan and has not returned" or said that he had been killed or captured by the Eighth Route Army! Isn't this situation

a widows' village?

But Liang, the head of the Zhou branch of the United Logistics Headquarters who had just entered Boshan from the Yimeng Mountain area, told me: "Being able to live in a widows' village is considered good. In the Yimeng Mountain area, you often can't see anyone for hundreds of miles, you can't see a complete house, and the weeds grow taller than the trees. It is ten times more miserable than Ruijin Xingguo in southern Jiangxi in the past."

Since the original local military force in central Shandong was reorganized into provincial security regiments when they retreated during the Laiwu campaign this spring due to lack of funds, all the security regiments may not be stationed in their original counties after this rehabilitation. Therefore, the local military force is very weak. The refugees who returned to their hometowns from the rear were lucky enough to pass the road of King Yama. Except for those in the cities who could return home, the others who originally lived in the countryside still could not return to their hometowns when they arrived in the county seat. In better situations, they only returned home during the day and still lived in the city at night. The main reason for this is that the vast area of the entire countryside is still the world of the guerrillas. The Communists also organized "Home Guard Brigades" in various places to "protect the fruits of struggle distributed to poor farmers." At the same time, in order to facilitate their operations, they strictly prohibit the people from cutting sorghum, on pain of death. Although the crops in various places have

a good harvest, farmers

are still mostly hesitant and dare not harvest. The original system of township chiefs and Baos and Jias of the county government mostly live in the city and dare not go to the countryside. In this way, not only can government orders not be implemented, but it also forms the strange phenomenon that refugees who have arrived in their own county from the rear are still refugees. (Special correspondent of this newspaper, Litian)

### Wu Asks Zhejiang Province's Ten Districts and Counties to Change Field Tax to Coarse Rice, Cereal Department's Reply Denies

[Our report from Pinghu, 5th dispatch] The councils of the ten districts and counties previously sent a joint telegram to the provincial government asking it to forward to the central government a request to change the grain tax to coarse rice because they were not used to storing grain. Recently, they received a reply from the Ministry of Food, stating that it was not appropriate to allow it. The provincial government has forwarded the reply to each county for notification.

[Our report from Yixing, 5th dispatch] The county council of this county believes that the field tax for the 36th year is scheduled to be levied on October 1st, but the autumn harvest period in this county usually does not begin until the last ten days of October (around the Frost's Descent), and the medium-colored indica and japonica rice have not yet been harvested. With the start of the levy approaching, the people are unable to pay, and there are real difficulties. A separate telegram was sent to the provincial government and the Provincial Grain Office, requesting that the start date of the field tax be postponed by one month to November 1st, in order to relieve the farmers' difficulties.

[Our report from Shangrao, 4th dispatch] The Jiangxi Provincial Field Tax and Grain Management Office believes that Huang, the county magistrate of Yujiang County, has handed over the allocated and transported grain in full, and has even over-transported it, especially in assisting grain transport agencies on weekdays.

### Inspector Zhu Arrives in Haining, Talks to Our Reporter About Impressions of Trip

[Our Haining Dispatch, 5th] Zhejiang Inspector Zhu Zongliang, accompanied by his secretary Lu Qimei, arrived in this county from Chongde on the evening of the 4th to inspect. On the morning of the 5th, he inspected various county-level agencies and the county-run middle school. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, he convened a symposium with various agencies and organizations. The reporter visited him and he expressed: This inspection covered ten districts, including Jiashan, Tongxiang, and Chongde counties. He listened to reports from the people's representative bodies in each county. The most important issues that could potentially lead to corruption were military service and grain requisition. It is regrettable that the counties only provided oral reports on the lack of integrity among tax collectors, without providing substantial evidence. In all counties, household registration, land administration, and civil administration were generally completed on time, but opium and gambling could not be completely eradicated. The general state of hygiene in all counties was very poor, rivers were unclean, and education funding was limited. Inspector Zhu concluded: Simplifying county administration and enhancing the authority of county magistrates is an urgent matter. The tax burden on the counties in the ten districts is relatively high, which is very unfair. He hopes that the central government can find ways to rectify this in the future. However, self-sufficiency in food and military strength is a national policy already set by the central government, and he hopes that all efforts can be made to minimize all malpractices.

[Our Tongxiang Dispatch, 3rd] Zhejiang Inspector Zhu Zongliang and his party of three arrived in to inspect on the afternoon of the 2nd, and convened a grain industry symposium at the County Government Auditorium on the 3rd. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, accompanied by his secretary Qimei and two others, they took a boat to Chong to inspect.

### Falsely Accused of Stealing Clothes, Nearly Died - Villager Hanged from Beam, Rope Breaks, Seriously Injured - Liu Houqing Summoned by the Judicial Office of Chuansha County Government

[Chuansha Dispatch, 6th] Chu Gengsheng, a 22-year-old villager of Qingxiang Township, Chuansha County, makes a living by farming and has no siblings, relying on his mother and son to depend on each other. He was falsely accused of stealing woolen clothes from a neighbor surnamed Wu. On the 30th of last month, he was arrested by armed members of the Self-Defense Corps, Niu Hancheng, and others dispatched by Liu Houqing, the township head, and taken to the township office. That night, he was subjected to brutal torture, including the use of "tiger benches" and "three hangings", to force a confession. While being hanged from a beam, the rope broke and he fell to the ground, suffering serious injuries. He fainted on the spot and foamed at the mouth with blood. The perpetrators, seeing this, feared that he might die and immediately called for a doctor to treat him. After he woke up, he was sent back home and his family was threatened not to publicize the matter. Neighbors who witnessed this felt indignant. The mother of the victim, Chu Gengsheng, cried day and night. Later, with the help of relatives and friends, she sued the county government on the 4th. County Magistrate Wu was extremely angry upon hearing this and immediately ordered the Judicial Office to issue a warrant for interrogation, which is scheduled to begin today. The victim, Chu Gengsheng, hired a boat to go to the city to treat his injuries on the morning of the 5th. When he set off, he was threatened and enticed by people sent by the township head to stop him from returning home. The township head, Liu Houqing, relying on the support of influential figure Song in the county, usually incites his subordinates to be tyrannical in the village, forcibly collecting various unwarranted donations and arbitrarily detaining villagers, which has long aroused resentment among the people of the whole village. In this case, after the regular bureau's interrogation, Liu and others will find it difficult to escape the clutches of the law.

### Full Text of the Supervisory Yuan Report (Continued from Page 2) Full Text (E) Investigation of Automobile Imports

Since the victory of the War of Resistance and the return to the capital, the number of luxurious cars in Beijing, Shanghai and other places has been increasing. This phenomenon is unavoidable to be criticized by all parties during this period of thrift and national construction. After checking, these cars have been continuously imported from the following sources in the past two years, in addition to those left by public and private institutions during the enemy and puppet era. Before March 4th of last year, because all materials were freely imported, there was no limit to the amount or price, so during this period, many private individuals purchased luxurious cars from abroad. Since March 4th of last year, the import of cars with a factory price of more than US$1,200 has been prohibited. At the same time, the import of cars with a factory price of less than US$1,200 has been restricted. A total of 1,251 cars were approved for import in the winter of last year, with a total value of US$1,806,924.00, distributed among 46 Chinese and foreign companies, of which Ford Motor Company had the most, with 382 cars, worth US$500,984.00 (see Annex 18). Imports were suspended in the spring of this year. A total of 500 cars were approved for import in the summer of this year, with Ford having the most. The Executive Yuan specially approved the import of cars in two cases. The first case was the case of former President Song ordering the Central Trust Bureau to purchase 190 new and used sedans. The CTB received a telegram from the Washington Materials Supply Committee on July 9th, 35, stating: "President Song authorized the purchase of cars in the United States and shipped them to Shanghai, and reported the number to the bureau." The CTB approved the notification from the Executive Yuan Secretariat to handle it on its behalf, allocated it to various agencies for purchase and use, reported it to the Executive Yuan for approval, and approved the settlement of US$500,000 in foreign exchange. It also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to inform the Customs Administration to instruct the Jianghai Customs to allow import. At the same time, the CTB received a telegram from former President Song of the Executive Yuan on August 2nd of last year, ordering it to report the shipment of these cars to Shanghai at any time for unified distribution by the Yuan. On September 27th, the CTB settled US$500,000 from the Central Bank at the then exchange rate of 3,350 yuan to the US dollar, for a total of 1,685 million yuan in legal currency. As of June 16th, 26, a total of 98 new cars and 30 used cars had not arrived. 62 of the new cars had arrived and were distributed (distributed during the tenure of former President Song). 19 of the cars that had not arrived were pre-allocated, leaving only 43 cars unallocated (37 cars are now being shipped and only 6 have not arrived, which are being distributed to various agencies by the current President Zhang). All the allocated cars that belong to the central party and government agencies include the National Government, the Executive, Judiciary, Examination, Legislative, and Supervisory Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, and more than 30 units of the Central Party Headquarters. The local agencies and schools include the 11th War Zone, Jiangsu, Gansu, Nanjing, Hangzhou and other provincial and municipal governments and more than 10 units such as Beijing and Tsinghua Universities. Those who belong to private individuals or individuals with official titles (i.e., heads of agencies) include Mr. Song Ziwen, Mrs. Huang Yanbai, Mr. Li Shizeng, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, Committee Member Kong, Minister Bai, Deputy Secretary-General Zhu Zhongdao, Counselor Zhu Guangmu, Secretary Chen Kangqi, Counselor Jiang Jiping, Secretary Yin Zhongrong, Counselor Xu Shijun, etc. (all are counselors and secretaries of the Executive Yuan), etc. More than 30 people. The social organizations include the Central Women's Movement Association and the Chinese Red Cross Society (see Annex 11 for details). Because the Executive Yuan's files do not have the original file for the purchase of cars, the files related to this case only contain reports on car brand numbers, letters from requesting agencies and private individuals, and the amount of distribution, etc. There is no original text of the decision, so how the distribution method is, which agencies should be allocated and which should not, how many agency heads should be allocated, and what conditions must private individuals and social organizations meet before they can be allocated are all unclear and unreasonable. As a result, there is no standard for distribution, and it is done arbitrarily. Some are allocated to various agencies, some are allocated to the heads of various agencies, some are allocated to private individuals and social organizations, and some are allocated to a few counselors and secretaries of the Executive Yuan. The cars allocated to various agencies are public property and are listed for handover. The cars allocated to the heads of agencies, if the head changes, whether they will be left for the successor to use has become a problem, and the cars allocated to private individuals or social organizations, and even a few counselors and secretaries of the Executive Yuan, are their private property, which is undoubtedly. Thinking that the Executive Yuan is not a government business organization, its purchased cars are of good quality and low price, only worth about 10 million yuan in legal currency, and the market price is more than 10 times higher than this. If all of them are allocated to various agencies for public use, no Chinese or foreign businessmen will have any complaints, but the Executive Yuan, in addition to allocating them to various agencies, actually allocates two-fifths of them to the heads of agencies, private individuals, social organizations, and counselors and secretaries, which is not in accordance with the law. The second case is that in June of this year, Xinsui Company requested the Executive Yuan to specially approve the import of 800 trucks. The Executive Yuan Secretariat sent a letter to the Temporary Management Committee for Importation and Exportation for verification. The committee replied on July 7th with Letter No. 4362: "Because the trucks are listed in the attached table (B) of goods that are temporarily suspended from import, the Jun Yuan has ordered the temporary suspension of import, and because Zhu Bing, the general manager of Xinsui Company, stated in his report on August 26th of this year: The price of the batch of vehicles, including freight, is approximately US$1,900, and the total price of 800 vehicles is approximately US$1.5 million. Please approve the sale by designated banks at the listed market price. The foreign exchange of the above-mentioned 800 vehicles, the Executive Yuan, because the company previously claimed to have its own foreign exchange, is now requesting to purchase foreign exchange, which is inconsistent. Therefore, it replied to the company and inquired: "Whether the payment for the 800 cars has been fully raised, please report truthfully for verification." On September 12th, it urgently telegraphed the Import and Export Management Committee to "temporarily suspend the issuance of permits and wait for further notice." (The original file is stored in the Executive Yuan.) So far, the special approval for the import of this batch of trucks is still pending. The government has prohibited the import of general cars before, and now it has specially approved the import of a large number of cars, and the credibility of the government's orders has been adversely affected. In the future, the Executive Yuan should pay attention to this type of fact. (See Annex 11 for details). According to regulations: Any private individual who goes abroad and returns to the country can bring back a used car as part of their luggage. The standard is that it has been used for more than half a year, the depreciated price is less than US$1,200, and it has a license plate. In the past year, there have been many people who have gone abroad and returned to the country, so this type of vehicle has been imported a total of 1,860 vehicles from the victory to the end of August of this year, and most of them are luxurious sedans, and some people have tried to use this to import and resell for profit. In the future, there should be more stringent crackdown measures, or a complete ban on the import of this type of vehicle. When the envoys and consuls of various countries come to China, they can bring cars for their own use, and a total of 174 vehicles were brought in by the end of August. During the War of Resistance and in the past two years, many American officers and soldiers who were rotated to China brought in many jeeps and trucks for military use. Some of them were transferred to agencies or individuals during their return to the country (no detailed number can be found). UNRRA and CNRRA included jeeps and trucks in their materials transported to China for relief transportation, and some were officially sold. Cars smuggled from Hong Kong to South China and Central China. The above eight points are the reasons for the proliferation of cars in Beijing, Shanghai and other places today. Regarding the purchase of trucks by merchants, the Executive Yuan and the Customs have implemented the suspension of imports as follows: On April 20th, 35, the Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 12554 of the Ministry of Economy: "Trucks ordered by merchants abroad are not allowed to be imported, except for those that are already on the way." The Customs implemented it with Announcement No. 51 on April 29th. On May 18th of the same year, the Executive Yuan issued an urgent telegram: "If trucks ordered abroad before April 29th have paid the full price in cash or by remittance and have submitted proof to the Customs, they will still be allowed to be imported." The Customs implemented it with Announcement No. 55 on May 23rd. Because foreign merchants protested against the above orders, the Inspector General of Customs requested instructions back and forth, and the Customs issued Announcement No. 80 on October 9th: "Those who ordered before April 29th and are already on the way before the date of this announcement are allowed to be imported with accommodation." (See Annex 12 for details). The above orders have been changed repeatedly. Although it is said to be for the sake of international trade customs, merchants are at a loss, and society is prone to misunderstandings. (Continued on Page 2 tomorrow)

Essays

### Edgar Allan Poe and His Works

— Pei Yin

A Tribute to Poe Ninety Years After His Death

Among the many well-known literary giants in the United States, Edgar Allan Poe is one of the most outstanding. Although his life was dissolute and impoverished, his works possess a remarkable style. His poems and novels are revered in world literature and have been translated into more than a dozen languages.

Edgar Allan Poe was born on January 19, 1809, in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were both itinerant actors, and they abandoned him before he was three years old. Subsequently, he was adopted by his uncle, John Allan, and became his foster son. He then added the surname "Allan" to his original name, Edgar Poe. Poe was intellectually gifted from a young age and studied in England and Richmond, Virginia. His uncle was a wealthy tobacco merchant in Richmond, with ample means to support this orphan. In 1826, he was sent to study at the University of Virginia, where his talent was highly appreciated by the professors, and he received honors in Latin and French.

He began writing poetry at the age of fifteen (1824), and at the university, he was already able to write good poetry. Unfortunately, he lived too dissolutely, often indulging in alcohol and gambling, to the point where he accumulated a gambling debt of 2,500 yuan at the end of the year. Although this debt was paid off by his uncle, he lost the opportunity to study. Later, he served in the military and at West Point Military Academy, but was eventually dismissed because he could not control his private life. In 1835, he went to Richmond to work as an assistant editor for the "Southern Literary Messenger," during which time he published many poems and novels in the journal, and his literary reputation soared.

He became a celebrity in Boston. In 1836, he married Miss Jing Leimeng, and their married life was extremely happy. However, his dissolute and unrestrained nature remained unchanged, and he eventually lost his job again. Thereafter, he and his wife traveled aimlessly until they settled in New York in 1844. He once started a newspaper, but it soon ceased publication due to financial difficulties. In 1847, his wife passed away, and he was enveloped in melancholy. Although he had once reformed his life, he eventually died due to dissolute living and excessive drinking. He died on October 7, 1849, at the age of only forty.

There are several editions of Poe's complete works, the more common of which is edited by Henry van Dyke, totaling ten volumes, including literary criticism, novels, and poetry. His novels can be divided into two types: one uses scientific and meticulous reasoning to solve detective cases, with representative works such as "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" and "The Gold Bug"; the other is mysterious and imaginative, with representative works such as "William Wilson" and "The Fall of the House of Usher." Other famous novels include "Ligeia," "The Cask of Amontillado," "The Black Cat," "The Tell-Tale Heart," etc. The style of his novels has deeply influenced writers in Western European countries.

Poe's poetry is a precursor to later American poetry and has great value. Several French poets and novelists who were roughly contemporary with Poe, such as Baudelaire and Gautier, greatly admired his poetry. Baudelaire even regarded Poe's essay "The Poetic Principle" as the best theory of poetry. Later generations have criticized Baudelaire's masterpiece "Les Fleurs du Mal" as being deeply influenced by him. Poe's most famous poem is "The Raven," which represents his mysterious and profound style. Similar in style to "The Raven" are "The Bells," "The City in the Sea," and "The Sleepers." Poe also has a type of lyrical poetry that is praised by readers around the world, the most famous of which is "Annabel Lee." He also has pieces such as "To Helen," "Lenore," and "To One in Paradise." His literary criticism is also very rigorous and sharp, occupying a high position at the time.

Many different critics, domestic and foreign, contemporary and later generations, have unanimously recognized his creative talent. There is a passion and brilliance in his works, the source of which is contained in his love of feeling, love of color, and love of lively conditions. Although a few critics maliciously criticize his works as being too symbolic and decadent, his works will ultimately be transmitted with radiant splendor, remaining immortal. (Poe's portrait was published in this journal on June 18—Editor)

### Small Grass and Stone Blocks

— Ge Shangde

Small Grass

In the evening, I happened to run to the veranda facing the street. A crescent moon floated above the distant rooftops, obscured by the clouds, letting the streetlights illuminate the entire veranda. After all, the season had already turned to early autumn. The evening breeze was gentle, and the light seemed to carry a hint of coolness.

My gaze leisurely moved around. The sparse pedestrians on the street below at night, the vague outlines of the distant buildings, and the scattered lights in the buildings gradually came into view. Then, I turned back to look at the white walls and the iron drainpipe hanging down from the third-floor roof against the wall. At this moment, a clump of small grass suddenly attracted my attention.

This clump of small grass grew in the joints of the drainpipe. It probably had no other source of nourishment other than the dirt blown up from the street and the dust washed down from the roof with the rain. However, it grew so vigorously, so lush, so charming, and so full of vigor.

No one would pay attention to such a miraculous existence, and of course, no one would give it pity or caress it. However, it has already passed through the spring and summer seasons. It has had a thriving life course, and it has also had a flourishing golden age. Accompanied by memories of the past, it probably does not feel lonely.

I gazed at this clump of small grass for a long, long time. Its green branches and leaves sparkled in the light of the street lamps. It seemed to be looking down on the drainpipe, the walls, everything around it, including me, who had originally wanted to generously give it a little pity.

I silently left the veranda.

Stone Blocks

Every time I walk through that alley, I always look closely at the stone blocks that make up the road surface.

They have been trampled on by countless people and vehicles: vendors, merchants, citizens, carriages, rickshaws, and cars. They have been worn down by cloth shoes, leather shoes, and wheels, becoming flat and smooth. This flatness and smoothness is a record of their long history.

However, they do not sigh. They also have countless glorious memories to provide them with intoxicating material. Many years ago, they were part of a magnificent mountain range. They stood on the summit, accompanied by the bright moon and the gentle breeze. Mountain waves played music for them, and floating clouds praised their firmness. They proudly looked up at the dome of the sky and proudly looked down at the earth. They were pure and aloof.

I don't know in what year or on what day they were hewn down by stonemasons, subjected to a series of dissections, and finally transported here to pave the road surface.

This does not detract from their past glory.

Moreover, they also have spiritual pleasure in being trampled on today. Every day, they use their tongues to carefully taste the breath of passers-by. They understand who should be cursed and who is worthy of praise. They have strong hatred and love. They take pleasure in curses and joy in singing praises.

I could not help but salute the stone blocks.

Perverts can't remember, can't remember that they grew up from babies, and instead "repay kindness with enmity."

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

There is a saying in the north: "Ten local toughs are not worth one Jing oil dealer; ten Jing oil dealers are not worth one Wei mouth!" The Wei mouth refers to the people of Tianjin. This saying indicates the fierceness of the Tianjin people's mouths. It is said that like Sichuan people telling stories, if you want to ask a Tianjin person for a sentence, he can talk to you for three days and three nights, saying everything logically; in the end, he will still call you listen. Still confused.

Yaoqun is not very familiar with the situation in Tianjin. Yaoqun is just a lone goose in such a big Tianjin. Moreover, at this time in Tianjin, outside the urban area, there are still sporadic gunshots and plane bombings. The people in the city are panicked and can be said to be terrified. If a word is said incorrectly, it will be a terrible disaster. In this way, every "Wei mouth" has already sealed that "mouth," and where is there any willingness to leak half a word from the teeth? Yaoqun pondered slightly and thought of a way to start questioning.

"Annoying!" Yaoqun turned around and took two steps towards the house, saying these two words very loudly, looking at the two waiters sitting on the long bench in the hallway, as if talking to herself. This is the opening of an eight-legged essay. Immediately, she raised her eyebrows, and smiled slightly, nodding to the older waiter: "Excuse me, I have to trouble you to change the room for me!"

"Change the room?" This is the duty of the waiter, and he had to speak: "Let me tell you, young lady, your room is the best one on this bottom floor; it's big, bright, and ventilated, and it's good in every way. Besides, no room on the second or third floor is as cool as our bottom floor. In such hot weather, you..."

"It's okay if you don't change it. Or you can cancel the sign, just pretend that the room is unoccupied..." Yaoqun smiled innocently, "You know, I'm afraid someone will come to trouble me..."

"Cancel the sign?" The waiter shook his head early: "First, this is the rule of our small shop; when a room is vacated, it must be signed. Second, if there is no sign, and someone else comes and specifies this room, do we check in or not? ...... Miss, you are educated and reasonable, aren't you? ...... Besides, being afraid of trouble is your own business; if you want to pay attention, pay attention; if you don't want to pay attention, don't pay attention! ......"

"No way!" Yaoqun seized this sentence: "Pay attention or not? Like this lady who just called something something, she must be something from your store...something... Yaoqun intends to accuse him of injustice.

"Her? ...... Humph! ...... Are you talking about that woman in the Si clothing just now, that thing that looks three parts human and seven parts ghost? ...... She has nothing to do with the small shop, but you have to deal with it, you have to pay attention!" This waiter may not be from Tianjin? But he seems to be straightforward.

"Why?" Yaoqun was unwilling to nag and just asked this question in a provocative manner, saving himself from interrupting his interest.

"She is a surveyor for the Japanese..."

"Bah, surveyor, she is her mother's detective dog! ......" This person's voice was even louder. He supplemented this sentence from the side; the three words "detective maniac" were also spit out from the teeth with hatred. This is the second waiter. While saying that, he nodded vigorously to Yaoqun, adding to his words.

This person's addition gave Yaoqun a big surprise, not just a big surprise, but also a trace of astonishment, and not just astonishment, astonishment also mixed with joy, happiness; this joy and happiness seemed to be a little over the top, unconsciously invading a nameless feeling, almost moved to tears.

### Smoke

— Qian Jinxi

When the waterfowl feels the warmth of the river flow, the hospitable youth has become contemplative, listening intently to the weeping sound of the water clock in front of the lamp. What is that shining grain of sand in the sea? Even if there are newly sprouted tender branches in the flower garden, he misses an ancient statue. In that city, that imprisoned person has crossed countless turbulent waves and countless dangerous passes. When the dream is over, there are still brilliant afterdreams. When the smoke dissipates, it also takes away the truth. Therefore, in the chapel, the youth is still confused by the joys and sorrows of human life. Is that God's will? He doesn't believe it.

### Hiroshima—Is it a City of Peace?

— Bao Zhongqi

Translator's Note: The American Life magazine published this article about Japanese cities in its September issue, which is enough to illustrate how Japan is seeking revival after the war, and how American capitalists are helping them. Is it worth our consideration? August 6, two years ago, was the day when the first atomic bomb in history was officially used in war. Its power destroyed the entire Hiroshima. In addition to expressing deep condolences to the residents of Hiroshima, the Japanese could only feel surprised.

Now, a legendary story is unfolding in Hiroshima. The Japanese believe that it will become a new world of peace. They planted a camphor tree here. According to Japanese customs, this is a symbol of longevity. They pray for it day and night. The neat streets show that Hiroshima has been resurrected from death. The Japanese people intend to move this once-destroyed city back to the map. Their slogan is: "Forget the past war and look at our future!"

If a walking metaphor is used, then Hiroshima's revival should be an astonishing "strutting." Hiroshima, which had once been sharply reduced from 250,000 people to 175,000, has gradually increased to 210,000 people. 60,000 houses were destroyed in the war, replaced by 23,000 new buildings. The opening of shops has helped Hiroshima's prosperity. Although everything has not yet reached the pre-war level, however, in just two years, to build a new city on a ruined land, this spirit is admired even by Americans. Listen to what an American general stationed in Hiroshima said: "We don't know what the real driving force is that makes them work so excitedly. All I know are the residents of Hiroshima. Perhaps they need peace..."

Indeed, the people of Hiroshima today are working hard. They have a great ideal—the common goal of all the people in the city is to completely restore the shattered Hiroshima in a peaceful celebration day. They do not want to create a "Utopian Hiroshima in an ideal paradise," however, they want to do their best to form it into the most beautiful land, a Japanese fortress.

All kinds of renovations in Hiroshima are completely done in the American style. The streets, shop fronts, high-rise buildings, everything is similar to American cities. Regarding these, the Americans are very willing to invest gold dollars here and join hands with the Japanese to build a new Hiroshima.

This year's "Hiroshima Day" (August 6), Hiroshima held a grand and simple ceremony. The mayor personally planted soil under the camphor tree, and a wooden sign was hung high on the tree, with the inscription: "Tree of Peace Peace treein menorial." At the moment when the atomic bomb exploded two years ago, the entire Hiroshima was filled with memorial bells, and Japanese old women wiped their tears and mourned their children. Students of senior girls' schools, wearing neat navy blue and white uniforms, chanted "Ode to Peace" in a low voice. Children performed a bamboo spear military parade (bamboo is a sign of extremely rapid growth). Japanese mothers firmly believe that their children will grow like bamboo. Other students sold commemorative badges to raise funds for war orphans.

The people of Hiroshima have been fully mobilized, and Hiroshima is progressing by leaps and bounds. What do the Chinese people, who consider themselves "victors," think?

### "Sleeping in a Painting" and "Painting a Bedroom"

— Liu Yun

"Zai Yu slept during the day. Confucius said: 'Rotten wood cannot be carved; a wall of dung and earth cannot be troweled. What is the use of scolding Yu!'" - *The Analects*

Zai Yu took a nap during the day and received a scolding from Confucius! He was scolded as "rotten wood"; scolded as a "wall of dung and earth," and finally, hit with a stern sentence: "What is the use of scolding Yu!" Isn't that a bit too much? It is normal for people to doze off when the days are long and they feel tired. Why did the Master get so angry, exceeding the boundaries of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, all expressed in moderation? It's truly incomprehensible! To insist on being like the Master, always restless, without time to warm the seat, sitting upright with a solemn air, being strict enough, how can the body endure it? To use modern terminology, he just didn't understand the art of living! The affectation of sages is not as comfortable and unrestrained as the free and easy nature of hermits and recluses. Tao Yuanming said, "Lying high by the north window, a cool breeze suddenly arrives, I think of myself as a person of the ancient Xi Huang era." And "I am drunk and want to sleep; you may leave." What a noble sentiment! It truly makes one want to prostrate in admiration! Xunzi said, "Human nature is inherently evil; goodness is artificial." I also want to say, "Human nature is inherently inclined to ease and averse to labor; those who force themselves to be tense and solemn are being artificial." My saying this is not to advocate idleness and indulgence, but to say that one should be solemn when it is time to be solemn, and leisurely when it is time to be leisurely. That is, as Westerners say, work when it is time to work, and rest when it is time to rest. For example, if Zai Yu takes a nap, his body gets rest, and he should feel refreshed in spirit. When he picks up a book, he will surely have more energy! Confucius, however, did not understand this principle and insisted on implementing a "fatigue bombing" style of reading and writing. This not only goes against educational principles but also greatly hurts Zai Yu's self-esteem! No matter from what point of view, it is excessive.

Because of this, a friend once told me that there was an error in the original text of this passage. He said that the "畫" (huà, draw/paint) in Zai Yu's "畫寢" (huà qǐn, sleeping in a painting) should be "畫" (huà, to delineate/plan). Even if Confucius was a sage, he never scolded people. Even if he had to reprimand someone, it would be appropriate, neither biased nor excessive, neither too much nor too little. How could there be such an inappropriate and absurd scolding? As for how to interpret "畫寢" (huà qǐn), one can derive meaning from the text. Perhaps Zai Yu loved art and had some artistic talent and a strong interest! He wanted to decorate the walls of his bedroom, but I don't know what kind of tools he used to draw on the walls. It was just that Zai Yu's dormitory was not rich and magnificent! The walls and beams were only simple and crude, not far from Yan Yuan's humble lane. Therefore, Confucius saw no need for drawing and decoration. But the ambitious Zai Yu insisted on drawing a lot on it, so the Master saw it and taught him: Rotten wood is not good for carving, and the walls of dung and earth cannot be painted. In other words, the Master meant that there is no need to decorate a thatched cottage with embroidered balls, that is, everything should be appropriate and proportionate. Such an explanation is perhaps somewhat speculative, far-fetched, and contrived? But please forgive me for not being able to verify it. I will tentatively offer my opinion. However, I somewhat agree with the idea that "畫" (huà, draw/paint) should be "畫" (huà, to delineate/plan). Because this can exonerate and defend the sages, and it is the only wonderful method to complete the entire personality of the sages. Otherwise, we cannot help but harbor doubts and reservations about Confucius. Even regarding this midday nap incident, thousands of years later, we still have to stand up for Zai Yu and protest to the Master, asking him to make corrections.

### Human Emotion

— Yuan Sheng

There is always a force of steam rising upwards in a thermos bottle. If the stopper is not tight, it will "sigh" and jump out, releasing some of the pressure and relieving some of the force. If the stopper is too tight, the whole bottle may explode. If there is no stopper, the heat will escape, turning into cold water, and it will no longer be a thermos bottle.

The whole person is like a thermos bottle. The seven emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, and desire—are a powerful force that makes people lively and energetic. Each person's ability to suppress these emotions is like the stopper. If the ability to suppress is weaker, expressing some emotions is fine. If the ability to suppress is too strong, emotions cannot be released and can only turn inward, attacking the heart. Then, there is a problem with the body. If there is no suppression, emotions are excessively expressed, and one will inevitably suffer unexpected blows, such as illness and disappointment. In the end, one becomes disillusioned, without any emotions, becoming a cold-blooded animal, and of course, cannot be called a person.

Therefore, the thermos bottle can also teach us a lesson.

### Miss America

Miss America's View of Marriage

American men and women take marriage very lightly. When feelings are good, they can get married immediately. When feelings disappear, they can get divorced immediately. Women all have the ability to be independent. Divorce does not require alimony. Everything in the world is constantly changing. The union of men and women cannot guarantee that it will not change. Thinking it through thoroughly, naturally, marriage and divorce are seen as insignificant. Then, society will not have so many family tragedies, such as taking concubines and abandoning wives, etc. On the contrary, the United States will never have such a performance. If husband and wife disagree, they apply to the court for divorce, and tomorrow they each find their own lover. In our view, it seems like a family is being torn apart, but in reality, it is solving a miserable family where people sleep in the same bed but have different dreams and forming a happy and loving family. This is beneficial to society in every way. American women take personal freedom very seriously. If her husband pulls out even one hair, she immediately files a lawsuit. Only in this way can the rule of male dominance be overthrown. Why should a woman be subjugated to a man? American women put personal freedom before marriage. If there is no freedom, she can give up her husband and find another way out. She does not completely depend on her husband for life, so why should she be controlled by him? Miss America views getting married as moving house, even cheaper than moving house. There are countless cases of getting married in the morning and divorced in the evening. This method is certainly not to be emulated, but the old ideas of "remaining faithful to one husband until death" and "a woman not serving two husbands" have buried the lifelong happiness of many good women. One day, mankind will break free from the shackles of marriage and throw matchmakers into a corner. At that time, the "three aunts and six grannies" will lose their jobs, and matchmaking agencies will also lose business. The mayor can have one less wedding to officiate and devote his energy to reforming the city. Formal dress merchants will no longer be able to exploit the newlyweds for rental fees. One can also save tens of thousands of dollars on a wedding certificate. Wedding photos, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to take, are also a waste. Miss America spends much less money in these areas than Chinese brides.

Ningbo Road and Tianjin Road: No Need to Change to One-Way Traffic; Reply from the Police Bureau's Administrative Department

Received your letter of September 10, relaying a letter from reader Mr. Zhang Zixian, stating that "Ningbo Road and Tianjin Road are narrow, and stalls are lined up all day long. There are many banks and money houses in the area, and there are many vehicles coming and going, often causing congestion. It seems that they should be changed to one-way streets to facilitate traffic." We thank you deeply for your concern for municipal affairs. However, after investigation, the roads that run across Ningbo and Tianjin Roads are all major arteries for north-south traffic, with very heavy traffic. Therefore, the intersections of Ningbo and Tianjin Roads are often congested. This is the reason why traffic cannot flow smoothly. As for the proposal to change to one-way traffic, it does not seem necessary. In addition to instructing the Huangpu Branch Bureau to pay attention to guiding the vendors and diverting traffic at any time, we hereby reply to you. Please take note of this. Addressed to: Social Service Department, Shen Bao Newspaper; From: Administrative Police Department, Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau

### The Queen of the Netherlands Announces Her Abdication

— Zheng Fan

On the Lotingde Street in The Hague, there is often a short, plump old woman wearing a worn-out hat, riding a bicycle through the crowd. When she arrives at the palace, she enters the gate, gets off her bicycle, and a guard runs over to support her. She waves her hand and puts the bicycle on the rack herself.

She is one of the longest-reigning monarchs in the few remaining monarchical countries in modern Europe, Wilhelmina Helena Pauline Marie - "The Victoria of the Netherlands."

Queen Wilhelmina is sixty-seven years old this year and has presided over the affairs of the Netherlands for forty-nine years. According to a Reuters dispatch, she is preparing to abdicate in favor of her daughter, Princess Juliana. After the joint meeting of the two houses of Parliament passes the resolution, Princess Juliana will succeed her. The Queen's motivation for abdication was actually proposed ten years ago. But at that time, the situation in Europe was critical. The Nazi army under Hitler's leadership attempted to annex the Netherlands. Although the Netherlands was small and weak, it was not willing to succumb. Therefore, this stubborn old woman has persevered for ten years.

The Queen's stubborn personality had already developed in childhood. There is a famous legend in history:

When the former King William III of the Netherlands died, the Queen acceded to the throne at a young age, being just a ten-year-old girl (later she was crowned at the age of eighteen). At that time, her mother, the Queen Dowager, acted as regent and strictly controlled the Queen. But one day, after being excessively scolded by her mother, the girl finally lost her temper: "I will stand on the balcony of the palace and announce to the people of the country how you mistreat me!" This forced her mother to soften. This anecdote has spread throughout the Netherlands.

In 1918, when the German Emperor Wilhelm was defeated and fled to the Netherlands, the Queen sheltered him, which was met with dissatisfaction from various parties. British Prime Minister Lloyd George demanded that the German Emperor be extradited to London for trial, but she coldly replied, "You are too naive!" This shocked the British court.

Here is another example: Ten years ago, when her daughter Juliana - who will soon become the new Queen of the Netherlands - married Prince Bernhard of Germany, she forbade the hanging of the swastika flag in the hall. When Hitler found out, he was furious. She wrote to the dictator saying, "This is my daughter and her lover getting married, not the Netherlands and Germany getting married."

She has a strong and stubborn will, which has made everything in the Netherlands seem peaceful and good under the rule of a woman. The Second European War forced her to flee the Hague Palace in a hurry. Nazi partisans hunted her down and plotted to assassinate her. On the ship to England, she and Princess Juliana were almost killed by German naval mines. However, she finally arrived in London and formed a government-in-exile.

The Queen married Prince Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin of Germany when she was twenty years old. After the marriage, Prince Henry was subjected to many restrictions. He was given only an empty title of "President of the Netherlands Red Cross," and Parliament refused to grant him the title of "Prince of the Netherlands" or approve any salary for him. He also knew that resistance was useless and could only amuse himself by hunting and traveling. During the First World War, because he was German, the Queen ordered the police to closely monitor him. It is not known what happened to this unlucky husband now.

Princess Juliana was born in 1909. In view of the restrictions she herself had suffered in her childhood, the Queen specially allowed her to receive a new education, teaching her to go to public schools and be treated the same as other students. The princess was clever and loved music and sports. She met Bernhard in Paris. He was two years younger than Juliana, very poor, and worked for a German paint company in Paris. But they immediately fell in love and announced their marriage on January 7, 1937.

On the wedding day, Queen Wilhelmina broadcast a message saying, "Although Bernhard is only twenty-five years old, he is indeed a very hardworking worker." After the marriage, Bernhard announced that he had severed ties with the German National Socialist Party, and in spirit and soul, he was a Dutchman.

When the Princess and Bernhard were honeymooning on the French Riviera, they drank cocktails at a Sunday dinner (which was absolutely forbidden under the Queen's rules). A reporter from a Dutch newspaper disclosed this in the newspaper, and the Queen was furious. She immediately summoned them back to the country and confined them in Soestdyk Palace. A few months later, the princess became pregnant, and she gave birth to a girl the following January. - If the Dutch monarchy does not change, it is very likely that this girl will be the third Queen of the Netherlands in twenty years.
