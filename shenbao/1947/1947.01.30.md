### American Side Withdraws from Three-Man Group, Announces Abandonment of Mediation Work, Executive Headquarters Personnel Also Completely Withdraw

[United Press International, Washington, 29th] The State Department recently announced that the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China, which was involved in mediating the Chinese civil war, will soon withdraw. The State Department stated that the U.S. government believes that continuing to mediate the Chinese party dispute is a waste of time and energy. This opinion is related to the U.S. government's formal statement abandoning mediation of the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists. The State Department continued, stating that the United States has decided to terminate its relationship with the Three-Man Group and withdraw the American personnel from the Military Mediation Headquarters. They will soon leave the Military Mediation Headquarters.

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] State Department Press Officer McDermott issued a statement from the State Department stating that the United States is now withdrawing from all efforts to mediate the Nationalist-Communist dispute. In response to questions, McDermott stated that regarding the U.S. Marine Corps in China, "instructions will be issued shortly in accordance with the approved U.S. plan to cease participation in the Military Mediation Department."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] U.S. Embassy spokesman Connors announced at 6:00 PM on the 29th that the U.S. government has decided to terminate its connection with the Military Three-Man Group and the Military Mediation Department, and the U.S. personnel of the Military Mediation Department will withdraw as soon as possible. The Military Three-Man Group was composed of Marshall, Zhang Qun, and Zhou Enlai. It was originally established in Chongqing with Marshal Marshall as its chairman. The Military Mediation Department was organized by the group and was located in Beiping. The three parties' selections were decided on January 11th of last year.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] U.S. Embassy spokesman Connors issued a statement at the embassy at 6:00 PM on the 29th, stating: "The U.S. government has decided to terminate its connection with the Military Three-Man Group, which was established in Chongqing with the aim of ending the conflict in China, and Marshal Marshall was the chairman of the group. The U.S. government has also decided to terminate its connection with the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, which was decided by the Military Three-Man Group to be established in Beiping with the aim of supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement, repatriation, and the reorganization agreement of the national armed forces on the spot. The American personnel belonging to the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters will withdraw as soon as possible."

Envoy Conveys American Decision to Government and Communists

The spokesman also stated that at 4:30 PM on the 29th, U.S. Ambassador Stuart visited Chairman Chiang and conveyed the U.S. government's decision. On the same day at 5:30 PM, Ambassador Stuart also met with Wang Bingnan of the Chinese Communist Party at the embassy and asked him to convey the decision to Yan'an.

[United Press International, Nanjing, 29th] The U.S. Embassy announced the termination of its connection with the Beiping Military Mediation Department, which in effect means that the United States has completely ended its mediation of the Chinese civil war. The American personnel of the Military Mediation Department, led by Lieutenant General Gillem, will withdraw as soon as possible. The American personnel belonging to the Military Mediation Department number about 3,000, including transport personnel from the air transport team. The Marines belonging to the Military Mediation Department, who are responsible for transporting supplies and performing a small number of guard duties, will also withdraw at the same time. The Military Mediation Department began implementing the armistice agreement on January 13, 1946, and it has been approximately one year since then. Observers generally believe that the Military Mediation Department will soon end. The above decision was made today after Marshall's discussions in Washington. This is tantamount to the United States completely abandoning mediation of the Chinese civil war and eliminating the only factor on the battlefield that could potentially prevent war. The Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party will probably also soon withdraw their personnel in the Beiping Military Mediation Department and the executive groups in various locations.

### Military Mediation Department Decides to Dissolve, Gillem Guarantees Return of Communist Personnel, American Troops to Withdraw from North China Next Month

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] After the U.S. State Department announced the withdrawal of the Three-Man Group and the personnel of the Military Mediation Department, at 5:00 PM on the 29th, General Gillem, the American member of the Military Mediation Department, convened a meeting with Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the government, and Ye Jianying, the Communist member (Xue Zizheng attended as representative), and informed the Nationalist and Communist sides of the announcement by the U.S. State Department. The three parties decided to dissolve the Military Mediation Department, but the specific methods are still awaiting further meetings for discussion. Government member Zheng Jiemin is still in Beijing and has not returned. Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi did not say a word about this matter. The Communist spokesman stated that this is a natural result of the development of the situation and is not surprising. The fate of the Military Mediation Department was probably decided when Marshall returned to the country.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 29th] General Gillem, the American member of the Military Mediation Department, notified the government and Communist members today that the United States has decided to withdraw from the armistice organization. Gillem also guaranteed that "the American side will assist Communist personnel in returning to any location with the necessary time." It is expected that American personnel and their families will begin to withdraw immediately, which can be completed in about a month. The American part of the Military Mediation Department has one thousand officers and soldiers and female military service members, and at least 125 family members of officers and soldiers are also in Beiping. Another 21 family members have already boarded the U.S. Army transport ship "Whittier," which is scheduled to arrive in Tanggu on the 30th. The American part of the executive groups and liaison teams are scattered throughout North China and Northeast China, but it is expected that American personnel will not encounter difficulties returning to Beiping. There are sixteen executive groups in North China and eight in Northeast China, and airplanes can reach all of them. Although American personnel will begin to withdraw immediately, they still intend to maintain a sufficient number until the Communist representatives in the Beiping Military Mediation Department and the Changchun forward branch have returned to the Communist area. Currently, there are no Communist representatives in the groups in the government-controlled area, and there are no government personnel in the groups in the Communist area. The American part has a large amount of equipment in China, scattered in various locations, but they are all fully prepared to withdraw. Soon after the establishment of the Military Mediation Department, it formulated three withdrawal plans, two of which were intended to be implemented in an emergency. The third plan is more gradual, and there is no doubt that this plan will be implemented this time. It stipulates that officers, soldiers, family members, and female service members in China will be systematically transferred to the Pacific, such as Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and other islands, or returned to the United States to continue serving in the army. All equipment that would have to be abandoned in an emergency will also be transported out this time.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 29th] The 4,000 American personnel of the Military Mediation Department and the 8,000 officers and soldiers of the 1st Marine Division stationed in North China to protect the facilities of the Military Mediation Department will all withdraw. After the withdrawal of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel, the only remaining U.S. troops in China will be the military advisory group stationed in Nanjing. The entire group, including the naval part, will not exceed 750 officers and soldiers.

[United Press International, Beiping, 29th] The U.S. Marine Corps and the 332nd Detachment of the U.S. Army Air Corps in North China will withdraw from China soon. Well-informed sources predict that U.S. troops in North China will disappear next month. Because whether the Military Mediation Department itself is dissolved or not, since the American representatives have already withdrawn, there is no reason for the Marine Corps to continue to stay in China. At most, a small number of personnel will be stationed in Qingdao to assist the U.S. Navy in training Chinese naval students.

### Luo Longji's Remarks

[Our Newspaper] After the American side announced its withdrawal from the Three-Man Group, the Mediation Executive Headquarters, and the U.S. Marine Corps related to the mediation work, Luo Longji, the spokesman for the Democratic League, expressed his feelings as follows: The American withdrawal from the Three-Man Group and the Mediation Executive Department is a natural result after Marshal Marshall returned to the country. At the same time, it also indicates that the American mediation work in China has come to an end. It is hoped that the Chinese people can work hard in the future to promote peace and solve their own problems. At the same time, China-U.S. relations have always been friendly. In the future, it is hoped that the United States will stand on the basis of friendship and help our country carry out peaceful construction.

### CCP Will Have a Reaction

[Our Newspaper] A reporter recently inquired about the Chinese Communist Party Office's thoughts on the American action. The answer was: Yan'an will have a formal reaction to this matter.

### Full Text of Government Statement Delivered to U.S. Embassy

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department released the full text of the government's statement on the Communist Party's rejection of peace talks at a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 29th (see Central News Agency draft). When asked whether this statement had been delivered to the U.S. Embassy, Peng replied: Yes. When asked whether the government's statement indicated that the government's only policy in the future was to reorganize the government, and whether all parties could participate, and whether their places would be reserved if they did not participate temporarily, Peng replied: The government hopes that the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party can participate. As for whether the Communist Party and the Democratic League will reserve their places, it will be considered in the future. There is no such provision in Sino-British trade

### Inland Navigation Is Not Open

There is no such provision in Sino-British trade

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Rumors that the Chinese government will re-grant British merchants the right to navigate inland rivers and conduct coastal trade when negotiating the Sino-British trade treaty are absolutely untrue, according to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the government.

### American Side Withdraws from Military Mediation Department Work, Fails to Promote Our Peace, Remarks by a Political Observer

[Our Newspaper] Since the American side formally announced its abandonment of mediation work, withdrawal from the Military Three-Man Group, the Mediation Executive Headquarters, and the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China related to the mediation work, a certain authoritative political observer in this city expressed his feelings as follows:

This decision by the United States is clearly due to the fact that the American people and authorities do not understand the correct situation of China's political progress. The main reason why our country's politics cannot embark on the path of unity and peace is that the CCP insists on non-cooperation, non-participation in peace talks, and non-participation in the government, and restrains other political parties from adopting the same attitude. If the CCP continues to adhere to this position, it will be very difficult for China to achieve true unity. The Chinese people are well aware that the United States has provided us with various valuable assistance during the war. After the victory, it never requested the early withdrawal of the U.S. military. The so-called actions to demand the withdrawal of the U.S. military have clearly been initiated behind the scenes and cannot represent the true public opinion. Now, the sudden withdrawal of troops by the American side inevitably makes people believe that they are being used by people with a background and an intention. In fact, this sudden action will not only not promote China's peace and unity, but will increase the power of those who undermine peace and have ambitions.

### Government Decides to Expand the Foundation, Hopes that All Parties and Factions Will Participate in the Work

Special Important Statement on CCP's Rejection of Peace Talks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Zhong Yi Minister Peng Xuepei, at a press conference at 6:00 PM on the 29th, declared the National Government's statement on the CCP's rejection of peace negotiations, the original text of which is as follows: Since the government issued the ceasefire order on November 8th last year, it has been three months. During this period, the Communist Party not only did not jointly abide by the ceasefire, but also took advantage of this opportunity to launch a full-scale offensive from the Northeast to the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, and it has intensified to this day. The government, in order to earnestly hope for peace, has repeatedly exercised restraint and compromised in order to preserve a glimmer of hope for the country and the people and to achieve the goal of a political solution. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party formally rejected the government's proposal to send representatives to Yan'an to discuss the resumption of peace talks in advance, and now it has rejected the four-point peace plan proposed by the government, which is a great regret. The government is aware that the recently convened National Assembly has formulated a democratic constitution based on the principles jointly agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference. It is also aware that the government's reorganization plan is being actively discussed and prepared, so that all parties can participate in the work of the State Council Committee and the legislative, administrative, supervisory and other ministries, in order to realize the expansion of the government's foundation. Therefore, on the 24th of this month, Dr. Stuart was requested to inform the Chinese Communist Party of the government's following four wishes: (1) The government is willing to send personnel to Yan'an or invite the CCP to send personnel to Beijing to continue discussions or hold a round-table conference, inviting various parties and social figures to participate. (2) The government and the CCP should immediately order a ceasefire on the spot and agree on effective measures for the ceasefire. (3) The government is still willing to continue discussions on the principle of troop stationing, reorganization procedures, and the implementation of traffic restoration, based on the past agreements of the Three-Man Conference. (4) Before the implementation of the constitution, the government is willing to discuss with the CCP a fair and reasonable solution to the local governments in disputed areas. Now that the CCP has formally rejected peace talks and claimed that the government must first agree to its proposal to restore the military positions before January 13th last year and abolish the constitution passed by the National Assembly, this is tantamount to demanding that the National Government and the National Assembly be subject to the Communist Party and obey the Communist Party's orders, where will the Republic of China's nation and people be placed? Since the Political Consultative Conference and the Military Three-Man Group Conference were held last year, during this year, the government has done everything it can to expect the CCP and various parties to participate in the government, but it has failed to obtain their understanding. At this point, it can no longer hope for their participation. Since the CCP has made such a resolute statement, the only path that can be followed in the future is to implement the government's established policy and steps of political democratization, and it is still hoped that all parties and social figures will participate in the government with their patriotism and love for the people, so that the constitutional preparations can be completed as soon as possible and the constitution can be implemented as scheduled, and hope that they will work together with one heart and one mind to engage in construction, restore the economy, improve the lives of the general people, and work together on the great cause of nation-building. This is the only policy of the government in the future.

### Social Democratic Party Central Standing Committee Discusses Participation in the Government

Wu Tiecheng Will Return to Beijing in a Few Days

[Our Newspaper] Observers pointed out that the Social Democratic

### Central Standing Committee Regular Meeting Passes Organizational Regulations for Various Ministries

Proposal Committee of the Third Plenary Session Divides into Four Working Groups

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Central Standing Committee convened a regular meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 10:00 AM on the 29th, with more than 30 people attending. Chen Lifu chaired the meeting. First, there was a long exchange of views on the current situation. Secondly, the organizational regulations of the Proposal Committee of the Third Plenary Session were passed. The committee is divided into four groups: party affairs, politics, economy, and constitutional government. Each Central Standing Committee member serves in one or two groups. The organizational regulations for county-level executive committees and the organizational regulations for various central ministries were also passed.

It is currently difficult for the Youth Party and the two parties to participate in the government reorganization. As far as the Social Democratic Party is concerned, part of the party is idealistic, and the other part is realistic. They have different views on reorganizing the government, which is difficult to agree on. And Zhang Junle's scholarly demeanor did not exercise his due final decision-making power. As far as the Youth Party is concerned, there are also three major difficulties in participating in the government, namely: (1) the reorganization of local governments; (2) the selection of government personnel; (3) the unwillingness to participate in the government alone. Therefore, unless the situation changes or the government makes concessions, it is difficult to expect concrete results in the short term.

[Our Newspaper] The Central Standing Committee of the Social Democratic Party continued yesterday, but because the views on participating in the government were not unanimous within the party, there was no concrete decision after fierce debate. It is now planned to rest for a few days and then discuss it again. However, the spirit of establishing a responsible cabinet system and adopting talentism is unanimously agreed upon by the internal members of the Social Democratic Party. And the spirit of this political system is also consistent with what is stipulated in the constitution. Also, the party believes that the reorganization of the government should start from the central government, which is different from the Youth Party's request for the simultaneous reorganization of local governments. Regarding the resumption of peace talks, the party also believes that peace is the basic requirement of the people, and if there is an opportunity, it should not be missed at any time, whether before or after the reorganization of the government.

[Our Newspaper] The Youth Party convened the Central Standing Committee yesterday. In addition to the Shanghai-based standing committee members, the Beijing-based standing committee members also returned to Shanghai to participate, except for Zeng Qi, who stayed in Beijing due to business. The main purpose of the meeting was to review internal work and the reports of the standing committee members staying in Beijing. Some of the standing committee members plan to go to Hangzhou and Jiaxing for sightseeing after the meeting. Also, Zuo Shunsheng and Li Huang set off for Beijing on the night train yesterday.

[Our Newspaper] Wu Tiecheng will return to Beijing in a day or two. The visit to the Social Democratic and Youth Party members the day before yesterday was mainly for New Year's greetings and to exchange views on the political situation by the way.

### Gong Xuesui Talks in Beijing, Dalian Reception is Approaching

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Dalian Mayor Gong Xuesui repeatedly stated to our newspaper reporter on the morning of the 29th when talking about the Dalian issue that he believed that the reception of Dalian was not far away, and recognized that the legal basis for the reception of the area did not need further diplomatic negotiations. Various reports about Dalian are received here from time to time, but the details are difficult to ascertain. Only it is known that the people of the area are quite short of food, etc. due to being isolated from the outside world, and they all hope to return to the motherland soon. Gong himself has not visited Chairman Chiang or President Song recently, but before the real reception, he should ask for instructions on everything. Currently, all preparations for the reception are basically in place, and he can go there when the situation permits. In the future, all the municipal government personnel will retain those assigned by the former mayor Shen Yi at that time. If the local staff originally in the area are loved by the people, they should also be appointed as much as possible. From now on, the city's policy guidelines will be aimed at internationalization and centralization. The former is intended to make Dalian an important international port, and the latter is intended to clear the situation of specialization that has existed for more than 50 years. These days, he is busy collecting various materials related to the port, and is preparing to compile a Dalian guide. When the reporter visited, Gong was reading various books and showed the reporter a newly acquired large map of Dalian, explaining in detail where the harbor was and where the downtown area was. Gong promised to allow reporters from various newspapers to visit together during the future reception, so that the true image of this land that has been separated from the motherland for a long time can be known to the world.

### Central Propaganda Department Hosts Reporters, Minister Peng and Vice-Minister Liu Attend to Answer Questions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 6:00 PM on the 29th. Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice-Minister Liu made the following replies to inquiries from various reporters:

Economic Plan

(1) Can the minister tell us about the details of the economic five-year plan formulated by the government? Has a political five-year plan been considered? If so, what are the details? Peng replied: The Central Design Bureau once formulated an economic construction plan, which has been sent to the Executive Yuan. This was about a year ago. Due to the instability of the situation, large-scale construction cannot be carried out, and there is no news of a five-year political plan.

Recent War Situation

(2) The CCP claims that the war situation in the past three months has been favorable to them. Is there any factual basis for this? What has the government lost or gained since November 1st? What are the casualties of the government army during this period? Peng replied: You know from newspaper records that the Communist Party's claims have no basis. The National Army is said to be progressing smoothly everywhere. Although the Communist Army attempted to make a last-ditch effort in southern Shandong, the National Army is confident. Our goal is the unity and peace of the country, so we do not want to over-publicize the gradual recovery of cities. However, since you have requested it, I will ask the military authorities to publish a detailed table in the near future. There are no detailed statistics on casualties yet. (3) Is it true, as reported by the outside world, that General Jiang Dingwen went to the United States to conduct negotiations in order to receive a large amount of military supplies from the Philippines and India? Peng replied: This is a complete fabrication. (4) Is the government restricting the import of newsprint, as reported by the outside world? Peng replied: All imports must be approved by the government. It has not yet been determined how much newsprint can be imported this year.

Xisha Incident

(5) It is reported that French troops have landed on two small islands in the Xisha Islands. What steps has the government taken? (6) Has the Chinese government formally expressed anything to the French government regarding this matter? For the above two questions, Deputy Foreign Minister Liu replied: As far as the Chinese government knows, some French troops have landed on Batou Island in the Xisha Islands from a patrol boat. No one has landed on Wu Island. Today, I can only report this. However, I would like to take this opportunity today to solemnly deny the statement made by the French Foreign Office that China agreed to France's occupation of the Xisha Islands in 1938. China only reiterated its consistent position at that time. China's sovereignty over the islands is indisputable.

Overseas Chinese in Vietnam

(7) Does the Chinese government plan to evacuate overseas Chinese from French Indochina, especially Hanoi? Liu replied: The Chinese government is planning to restore air traffic between China and Vietnam. If the French authorities agree, we hope to have civilian flights between Nanning and Hanoi for relief purposes. The Chinese government is using various methods to supply rice and other grains to the overseas Chinese in Hanoi and Haiphong, and to provide them with air transportation to communicate with the country. The French authorities in Hanoi are also trying to provide rice, salt, dried fish, and other items to help the overseas Chinese.

### 定縣新樂相繼被陷　共軍大與窺保定　冀南國軍收復南樂縣城

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Military sources have confirmed that Ding County, on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, fell to the Communist forces on the evening of the 27th after several days of intense fighting.  Street battles raged throughout the night.  By noon on the 28th, the entire city was in Communist hands.  Major fires have broken out in several locations within the city, and important buildings are currently being destroyed.  The whereabouts of over a thousand defending troops, four hundred railway protection police, more than one hundred and sixty railway employees, as well as Ding County Party and government personnel, are unknown. This is the greatest loss in any of the many county-level city defense battles in Hebei Province.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] The fall of Xinle County, on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, has also been confirmed.  Zhengding and Xin'an stations, north of Shijiazhuang, lost contact this morning after being attacked yesterday. Xin'an and Dongweishou forces are still engaged in fierce fighting across the Mudao Gou (Wooden Knife Gully), so these two stations may not be lost.  Except for the ongoing fighting at Mudao Gou, the 250 li stretch between Baoding and Zhengding is now completely under Communist control.  A division of the National Army has arrived from the Chahar region to reinforce Baoding, but is currently held up at Beihedian and Gucheng on the Ping-Bao section due to six further instances of railway sabotage, which occurred this morning. Fierce fighting also broke out yesterday between Baoding and Nan Zijiazhuang. National forces are awaiting an opportunity to advance south.  With the concentration of National Army forces in Shijiazhuang, there is no cause for alarm. A division of a certain army is expected to arrive in Shijiazhuang via the Zhengtai Railway within days, and airborne reinforcements are also planned.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Due to the Communist army's second major offensive between Baoding and Shijiazhuang, the situation in Hebei Province has suddenly deteriorated. The plan to repair the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section has become a pipe dream. Relevant authorities say that the Communist army's offensive is a comprehensive one in response to Jin and Lu, with the main purpose of destroying railways and destroying National Army strongholds. Once National Army reinforcements arrive, the Communist army will retreat without a fight. Separately, qualified observers say that short-term chaos in Hebei Province is unavoidable. With the current situation, an additional two armies should be able to reverse the decline. Since peace talks have reached an impasse, the only way to resolve the matter is through strength. In the future, opening the Tianjin-Pukou and Ping-Han railways will be an essential means for the government. Compared with the two, the former is more important than the latter, so the restoration of the Ping-Han line will depend on the conclusion of the Battle of Southern Shandong.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] More than 5,000 Communist troops have arrived in Jiahe along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and more than 2,000 have arrived in Qing County. National Army forces in Cang County are watching their next move.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] According to aerial reconnaissance, the Communist army is mobilizing a large number of civilians to actively destroy railway bridges between Ding County and Dong Changshou. All bridges, large and small, made of iron, stone, and wood, have been destroyed by explosives, with the roadbed jaggedly displaced to form deep trenches. Railway track materials and sleepers have been burned. The extent of the damage is beyond calculation. In addition, the spring flood season is approaching, and the temporary pontoon bridges that were previously destroyed will need to be rebuilt to prevent spring floods, which is also a major difficulty in the repair work.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th] Nangle, which was previously captured by the Communist army in southern Hebei, has been recaptured by National Army forces on the 28th.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 29th] (1) More than 3,000 Communist troops from the Tenth Brigade are currently fleeing from Wangdu to Yujiazhuang, while another unit of more than 8,000 is fleeing to the Caoqiao area, thirty li southeast of Baoding. (2) Communist army forces in western Baoding have been frequently redeploying in recent days, constantly attacking National Army strongholds, but have been repelled each time. (3) Three divisions of Liu Bocheng's forces have fled from Anguo to Dali Gezhuang, Dongxi Wangli, and other villages, thirty li southwest of Baoding, with unclear intentions. (4) Communist army Commander-in-Chief Nie Rongzhen is leading more than 10,000 troops, currently stationed in Wu Village, Mount Yue, west of Baoding, preparing to launch a new offensive against Baoding.

### 郝鵬舉一度抵徐　謁陳總長等當日返海州　戰事重心已移魯豫邊境

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] Hao Pengju, the newly appointed Commander of the Lunan Pacification Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Army Group, arrived in Xuzhou by special plane from Haizhou at noon on the 29th, accompanied by Liu Cheng, Director of the Political Department. Chief of Staff Chen and Director Xue both sent representatives to welcome him at the airport. After disembarking, Hao and his party went to the Pacification Headquarters to meet with Chief of Staff Chen and Director Xue, report on the current situation, and make requests. Chief of Staff Chen and Director Xue hosted them for lunch, during which they praised Hao's loyalty to the government and gave words of encouragement. At 3 PM, Hao and his party returned to Haizhou on the same plane. When interviewed by reporters at the Xuzhou airport, Hao stated that the government has embarked on the path to democracy. Further internal strife would only waste the nation's vitality and destroy the people's happiness. The 42nd Army Group is now gathered around Haizhou and Ganyu, ready to launch pacification work in southern Shandong. Hao also said that Chen Yi's surveillance over him was extremely strict, and that his ability to safely lead his troops to pledge allegiance to the government is proof of Chen's declining power and impending doom. Hao was deeply moved by the warm welcome given to him in Xuzhou, saying that he will only work hard to pacify southern Shandong and accomplish his mission to repay the government.

[Another Cable] Hao Pengju's forces are substantial. Currently, they are actively attacking in both southern and eastern Shandong, threatening Chen Yi's headquarters in Linyi. It is reported that two divisions have already advanced towards Chenjialing, Huandunbu, and Dongjiagou, east of Linyi, and may cut off the Communist forces' rear supply lines in that area from Juxian in the future.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 29th] More than 1,000 troops from the Communist army's Hubian Detachment, led by Hu Degao, attacked Laozhai Fangcun, southeast of Yutai, on the night of the 27th. They were intercepted by local militia and retreated in defeat.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 29th] The Communist army thoroughly destroyed the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Coal Mine before withdrawing. National Army forces re-entered Zaozhuang on the 27th. The main force of the Communist army in southern Shandong has been gathering towards Tancheng and south of Linyi in recent days, preparing for a major battle.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 28th] The Communist army forces of Li Xiannian are once again harassing the Funiu Mountain area, and besieging Lechuan (40 li southeast of Lushi). Our local militia defended bitterly for more than ten days. Finally, due to exhaustion of ammunition and food, and being outnumbered, they broke through the encirclement on the 20th, moved to a new position, replenished ammunition, and launched a counterattack.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 29th] The situation on the border between Jiangsu and Shandong has completely improved. National Army forces have secured the safety of the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Eastern Railway, and firmly control the entire line from Taierzhuang to Zhaodun Station on the Longhai Eastern Railway. The defending forces in Taierzhuang, without fear of being cut off, are guarding more vigorously. Rumors that the Communist army is fiercely attacking Taierzhuang and that intense fighting has broken out have been proven untrue. The focus of the fighting has now shifted to the border between Shandong and Henan. Strong National Army forces are being reinforced from both the east and west towards Lanfeng, Minquan, Dangshan, Huangkou, and other places along the Longhai Line. According to qualified military sources, if the Communist army does not quickly stop its offensive on the border between Shandong and Henan, it will repeat the disastrous defeat of one year ago in eastern Henan and western Shandong. This can be stated definitively.

Adding Embankments at Huayuankou

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th] Following the recent heavy snowfalls in northwestern regions, ice blocks as large as square tables have been flowing down the Yellow River. The rocks dumped at the Huayuankou breach have reached a height of approximately seven meters. The breach in the pontoon bridge is approximately forty meters wide and ten meters deep. The blocking and restoration bureau is currently adding side embankments and lattice dams to both the north and south sides of the pontoon bridge, gradually extending them towards the middle. Although the water surface at the mouths of the original north and south diversion channels east of the breach has frozen, the water flow underneath has not stopped. In order to ensure smooth flow in the old channel, the blocking and restoration bureau plans to dig a diversion channel between the north and south diversion channels, and has begun surveying.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 28th] The head of the Yellow River's old course has passed Luokou and reached Huojialiu, which belongs to Licheng County. The flow velocity cannot be measured because the water surface is frozen. The water depth at Luokou has increased to three meters and two inches, and the width to forty meters.

### 陳總長吿新四軍官兵　勸速覺悟來歸　共軍淮陽軍區司令投誠

### Chief of Staff Chen Addresses Officers and Soldiers of the New Fourth Army, Urging Them to Awaken and Return; Commander of the Communist Huaiyang Military District Defects

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] Chen Yi's forces have felt extreme panic due to Hao Pengju's allegiance to the government. Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng today printed a letter to the officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army, dispatched a special plane to Southern Shandong, advising them to awaken and return.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] Since Hao Pengju telegraphed his defection, the morale of the Communist army has been greatly shaken. Today, Zhang Shaowu, commander of the Communist Huaiyang Military District, also defected to the National Army and took up the new post of commander of the 7th Detachment of Jiangsu, with his troops now stationed in the vicinity of Suqian. [Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 28th] The situation in Southern Shandong will have a similar and remarkable development to Northern Jiangsu in the near future. This is the impression I got after inspecting the front lines of Southern Shandong. During this trip, I witnessed thousands of pure and good farmers, supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing from the so-called liberated areas to the National Army's defense areas. On the western bank of the Grand Canal on the border between Shandong and Jiangsu, a magnificent scene of extreme human tragedy was formed. Conversely, the people in the National Army's defense areas, not a single family fled to the so-called liberated areas. The hearts of the people indicate the fate of the Communist army in Southern Shandong. The reporter arrived at the front line of Southern Shandong on the day that Hao Pengju telegraphed to take up his new post as appointed by the government. The military and civilians have always known that Chen Yi's surveillance of Hao's forces was extremely strict. Now that Hao has safely led his troops to pledge allegiance to the government, it shows on the one hand Hao's knowledge of great righteousness and general situation, and on the other hand exposes the gradual weakening of Chen Yi's forces and the loss of control over Hao. Front-line soldiers and civilians, receiving this good news, all felt that Chen Yi was approaching his end, and everyone felt excited. The reporter interviewed officers and soldiers of all levels on the front lines, who all held a belief of inevitable victory. One general even had the ambition to settle Southern Shandong within fifteen days. When the reporter inquired about the prospects of the Southern Shandong situation, he was told that the National Army had achieved a strategically advantageous situation after the Northern Jiangsu campaign. And give an easy-to-understand analogy, for the reporter to explain: In the past, the National Army spread its hands and was beaten, but now it clenched its fists, ready to fight.

### 熊式輝返原籍　故宅僅剩斷瓦殘坻　附近村落一片荒凉

### Xiong Shihui Returns to His Hometown; Only Broken Tiles and Rubble Remain of His Former Residence; Nearby Villages are Desolate

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 28th] I accompanied Director Xiong Shihui back to his hometown in Yaji in Anyi on the 28th. After Mr. Xiong arrived at the station, the elders in the township greeted him in the wild with firecrackers. Passing through the Wanjiafu Experimental Area, which was established during Mr. Xiong's administration of Jiangxi, all the office buildings and various equipment were completely destroyed by the Japanese army, with only one stone pillar outside the gate remaining, bearing the marks of bullets. During the war, our guerrilla forces often operated in this area, attacking the enemy troops on the Nansun highway. Xiong's hometown, Yaji Long Village, suffered greatly after being destroyed by the Communist army in 1928, and then burned and killed by the Japanese army, severely damaging its vitality. Xiong's residence was burned down by the Communists in 1928, and now only the foundations of the walls remain. The houses of his neighbors on the left and right were also demolished by the Communist army, and his family temple was destroyed by the Japanese army, and is now overgrown with weeds. Xiong said: Before the war, the scale of the experimental area was quite successful. During the war, up to sixty villages in the vicinity were burned down by the enemy, and more than a hundred people were either killed or died participating in guerrilla warfare. He now plans to borrow money from the bank to rebuild the villages, and the provincial government plans to establish an agricultural support experimental area within the original experimental area to try out supporting independent farmers, and then promote it to other counties after it proves successful. Xiong discussed the reconstruction project with the elders in his hometown and tried to enrich the Yanggong Elementary School, which was established to commemorate his late father. He returned to the provincial capital at 7:30 PM. He will attend a welcoming meeting in Nanchang on the 29th and may leave the province for Nanjing on February 2nd to go to the Northeast. During this return to Jiangxi, Xiong repeatedly expressed his willingness to assist Chairman Wang Lingji with utmost sincerity in completing the great construction plan of the new Jiangxi.

### Editorial: Congratulations on the Rebirth of Burma

The British government issued a white paper yesterday, announcing the agreement reached in the Anglo-Burmese negotiations: (1) Burma will remain within the British Empire as a dominion, or secede completely and become fully independent, entirely at Burma's own discretion; (2) Burma shall elect a National Assembly in April to draft a constitution, and the representatives of the National Assembly shall be exclusively Burmese; (3) Before the new constitution comes into effect, Burma shall organize a provisional government, with an Executive Council composed of Burmese officials and a Governor-General appointed by the British, similar to the situation in India; (4) In principle, Burma is recognized to manage its finances during the transitional period and to command the entire Burmese army; (5) How to handle the British troops stationed in Burma after the new constitution comes into effect shall be dealt with by an agreement between Britain and Burma; (6) The borders of Burma will be determined later. At the same time, British Prime Minister Attlee and Lord Lawrence, Secretary of State for India and Burma, also announced the results of the Anglo-Burmese talks in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, respectively. With this official announcement by the British government, the foundation for Burma's autonomous rebirth has been laid. After a very short transitional period and the enactment of Burma's fundamental law, Burma will inevitably begin its new life. China and Burma are not only geographically adjacent but also as close as brothers. We express our infinite joy at Burma's rebirth and imminent independence. Upon hearing this good news, we hereby extend our sincere congratulations to the people of Burma.

The Anglo-Burmese talks were initially announced by British Prime Minister Attlee in Parliament on December 20th and began in London on January 13th. Burma sent its delegation to the British capital, headed by U Aung San, Vice-Chairman of the Government. When our newspaper learned of this news, we published an article entitled "A New Dawn for Burmese Independence," discussing Burma's independence and the Anglo-Burmese talks, believing that the convening of the talks itself was a cause for joy because "it indicates that a ruling nation and a ruled nation are willing to resolve all issues concerning the adjustment of their future relations through negotiations. It indicates that a ruling nation is willing to change its position in a peaceful manner to satisfy the wishes of the ruled nation; at the same time, it also indicates that a ruled nation is willing to fulfill its wishes in a peaceful manner. The convening of these Anglo-Burmese talks is itself a manifestation of a spirit of harmony and is worthy of our praise." We also said: "We believe that since both Britain and Burma have the intention to resolve the Burmese situation peacefully, the Anglo-Burmese talks to be held in London will certainly be successful." Now, the news from London confirms the success of the Anglo-Burmese talks, making our wish come true. We cannot but deeply admire the outstanding talent and statesmanship of the leaders of both Britain and Burma.

Most of the nations of Southeast Asia are ancient countries with rich cultures, but since the rise of Western European imperialism in the 19th century, they have successively fallen. Naturally, the people of these regions all expressed indignation. The Western European imperialist powers maintained their rule in various parts of Southeast Asia with their superior military force. After World War I, the high tide of nationalism spread to the various ruled nations of Southeast Asia. However, President Wilson's Fourteen Points, which included national self-determination, conflicted with the interests of Western European imperialism. The status of the various ruled nations of Southeast Asia still could not be improved. The United States knew that its rule over the Philippines would end one day. Therefore, before the Pearl Harbor incident, it had already promised to grant the Philippines independence. After Japan surrendered, this promise was immediately fulfilled. Among the various ruled nations of Southeast Asia, we first saw the independence of the Philippines. In the Dutch East Indies, the Indonesian national movement became even more active after Japan's surrender. Although there is still no agreement between the Netherlands and Indonesia, judging from the surging Indonesian national movement, the wishes of the Indonesian people will be realized sooner or later. At this time, we see the success of the Anglo-Burmese talks, and another Southeast Asian nation that was ruled has now achieved its goal of independence.

We cannot but deeply admire the wisdom of the policies adopted by the Attlee government. Due to the adoption of this wise policy, the strength of the British Empire has not only not been weakened, but it may even be strengthened as a result. Unrest within the Empire is enough to weaken its power. Attlee recognized this and, with foresight, allowed Burma to be completely independent. Whether it takes a dominion status within the British Empire or secedes from the British Empire to become completely independent is for Burma to decide for itself. This cannot but show the breadth of mind of the British. In fact, in these troubled times, although Britain allows Burma to secede from the Empire and become independent, it is a real question whether Burma is willing to do so for its own benefit. Although the future status of Burma still depends on the convening of the National Assembly, the existing signs seem to indicate one fact, that is, Burma may still obtain a dominion status within the British Empire like Canada and Australia, because this seems to be the most beneficial for Burma. The British Empire is essentially a "co-prosperity sphere." For its own benefit, Burma seems unlikely to leave it and become independent.

The resolution of the Burmese problem makes us think of the situation in Vietnam. Since the outbreak of armed conflict in the Hanoi-North Border area, the French government has adopted a hard-line policy in dealing with the Vietnam issue, implementing high-pressure tactics. The style of the Governor-General of Vietnam fully embodies the face of early imperialists. It should be known that the growth and development of national movements may sometimes be frustrated by external forces, but no nation can rule another nation by force for a long time. This is bound to fail sooner or later. Recently, there have been changes in the French government. We hope that they can adopt a more enlightened policy in dealing with the Vietnam issue, so that the wishes of the Vietnamese people can also be satisfied, and the lasting peace of the Far East can be maintained.

### Japanese Reparations Materials All to Be Transported by Us Awaiting Approval from the US Secretary of State Before Shipment Can Begin

Talks with Gong Xuesui

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Gong Xuesui, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee, said on the morning of the 29th: The more than 500,000 tons of materials Japan is paying as reparations to our country can be shipped to China after approval by US Secretary of State Marshall. These materials will be transported by our own ships. One-third will be transported by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the rest will be the responsibility of other shipping companies. It is estimated that it will take two months to complete the transport. The handling of these materials will not involve the establishment of any new institutions but will be managed separately by the receiving agencies. Gong believes that the resolution of the entire Japanese reparations issue will not be delayed for too long. He believes that after the closing of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the European issue will come to an end, and the various countries will discuss Far Eastern affairs. The reparations issue will naturally be raised at that time, and we will present our views on the entire reparations issue. The number of materials that the Soviet Union transported from the Northeast is currently being incompletely investigated by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau and will also be raised in the future. In addition, the five-member delegation assigned by our country to handle the reparations issue has been formed from five personnel originally in Japan. The delegation will be responsible for liaising with the Allied General Headquarters and other agencies, with a term of two years. The Philippines also has a five-member delegation going to Japan. As for when Gong himself will go to Japan, it will depend on when the taking over of Dalian will occur.

### UNRRA Far East Regional Committee Meeting Concluded on the Day It Was Held

China to Allocate 160 Billion Yuan for UNRRA's Expenses

[Our City News] The 28th meeting of the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee was held yesterday from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM at the China Bank Building on the Bund. Those present included Dr. Yen Hui-ching, General Edgerton, and representatives from various countries: Australia's Hale, France's Bossin, the Netherlands' Stock, New Zealand's Shaw, the Philippines' Shawer, China's Li Zhuomin, the United States' Gilbert, Canada's Campbell, and other attendees, totaling dozens of people. However, the representatives from the Soviet Union and India were absent. The Soviet side was represented by observer Rhodesky. The representatives from the Philippines and Canada were attending for the first time.

The meeting concluded at 4:00 PM. The next meeting has not yet been scheduled, but it will likely be in about a month.

Regarding the issue of funding for UNRRA's relief work in China, according to Vice-Director Li Zhuomin of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), the Chinese government will allocate 160 billion yuan for UNRRA's expenses, of which 3 billion will be for the use of UNRRA's offices in China, 100 billion for the distribution and supply of materials, and 30 billion for other special purposes. In addition, another 800 billion will be allocated for the work expenses of domestic agencies using UNRRA materials and equipment.

Representatives from Various Countries Concerned About Relief in the Yellow River Flood Area

During yesterday's meeting, representatives from various countries were extremely concerned about the relief and supply of materials in the Yellow River flood area and the Communist-controlled areas of China. Xiang Jingyun, Director of the Investigation Department of CRRRA, Ling Daoyang, Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation and Relief Subcommittee, and Green, Director of the Agricultural Relief Group, successively reported on the flood situation and relief efforts in the area. According to Green, more than 2.3 million mu of land in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have been affected by the floods, affecting a total of 36 counties. The group has (1) an agriculture and immigration subcommittee, (2) an industry and transportation subcommittee, (3) a social and economic subcommittee, and (4) a public health subcommittee engaged in work. The main goal at present is to restore cultivation to such a large area of fertile land as quickly as possible. The important steps are: (1) Clearing accumulated water and tidying up farmland; (2) Massively searching for and transporting seeds, with an estimated 77,000 tons of seeds needed this spring; (3) Food for farmers must be prepared and supplied, as well as other necessities such as housing and medicines.

Jacques Sabben, head of UNRRA's Repatriation Group, reported on the repatriation of refugees from various countries. Regarding the repatriation of Chinese refugees, he briefly stated that 6,944 refugees had been repatriated to their original places of origin in the islands of Southeast Asia last year, and the total number as of the end of January this year was 8,700. In addition, 577 overseas Chinese were repatriated from Italy, and 803 were repatriated from New Guinea. Adding the refugees repatriated from the Philippines, the total was 6,471 people. In December of this year, due to the war, it may be possible to send back another 300 people from Annam, bringing the total number of repatriations to around 16,000. UNRRA has already allocated US$64 million for the repatriation of Chinese refugees, but refugees in shelters often have to wait a long time for their passports to leave the country, so this expenditure is a major burden for UNRRA. It is hoped that all parties will provide more assistance.

Principles Determined for Handling UNRRA's Unfinished Work

During the meeting, representatives had lively discussions on issues such as funding measures, engineering plans, and the distribution of transportation equipment. Regarding how to handle UNRRA's unfinished work after its conclusion in the future, the representatives also decided on two principles based on the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly: (1) The UNRRA Far East Regional Conference is willing to follow the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly and continue to handle social welfare work after the conclusion of UNRRA under the support of the United Nations. (2) The Social Group will pay special attention to this welfare work and, if requested by the countries of the Far East, will organize special committees to handle it.

The Philippine representative proposed a motion requesting UNRRA to allocate additional funds in addition to the 11.2 billion emergency relief funds, with the aim not to request the supply of food or materials, but to assist in the restoration and construction of Philippine agriculture, which would not only provide relief to the country but also help the people of other countries. As a result, the motion was passed.

### UNRRA's Medical Supplies to China - Proposal to Reduce Withdrawn

Liu Ruiheng Returns Home After Successful Negotiations

[Our City News] Dr. Liu Ruiheng, consultant to CRRRA and chairman of the Health Affairs Committee, went to the UNRRA headquarters in Washington a month ago to discuss the purchase and transportation of medical supplies and has now returned home after completing his mission. It is said that: "The results of this trip were satisfactory. UNRRA previously planned to reduce the value of medical supplies to China by US$6 million, but after Liu's negotiations, the proposal was withdrawn, and it was agreed to extend the deadline for the purchase of medical supplies for China to February 15. This year, UNRRA will transport medical supplies worth US$41,300,000 to China. For medical supplies that are not urgently needed or do not suit China, Liu suggested purchasing substitutes. All the goods have now been properly ordered by UNRRA and will soon be shipped to China in a steady stream." It is also learned that: Before returning to China, Liu represented the United China Relief, Shanghai District, in attending a special meeting held by the organization in New York.

Zhou knew that whether he was executed in the short term or not, his traitorous life would not last long. He has applied to the High Court to allow him to meet with his family more often. As for the news of Zhou's execution, it may have to wait a few more days because his wife has filed an appeal. However, no matter how Zhou's condition is, according to the provisions of Book VIII of the Criminal Procedure Law, unless he is in a state of mental incapacity and the highest judicial administrative authority orders the suspension of execution, it will not have any impact. The High Procuratorate will execute him within three days of the execution order. Therefore, it is difficult for Zhou to escape death.

### Differing Opinions on Establishing a City in Ningbo: Three City Area Maps Drafted

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 29th] Ningbo is located at the mouth of the Zhejiang Sea and is a well-known trading port in China. The issue of establishing a city is of great concern to all parties. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs previously sent Chen Zongen to survey and map the city area for submission to the Executive Yuan. According to Chen, he visited local people and solicited opinions. Older gentry oppose the establishment of a city at present. They claimed that the financial situation of Yin County before the war was indeed conducive to expanding the establishment of a city, and that a city should be established in the future, but at present, with the depression of industry and commerce, the economic conditions do not allow the establishment of a city. The county council still hopes to establish a city as soon as possible. As for the scope of the city area, there are three opinions: one is to establish a city according to the old map, the second is to expand the city area, and the third is to abolish Yin County and assign the three western districts to Siming County and the three eastern districts to Zhenhai County, so that the city area will be wide, close to the original Yin County territory. Chen has drawn maps separately and submitted them to Chairman Shen for approval.

### British Cabinet Meeting Reviews Treaty Revision Proposal: TASS Attacks British Policy Again

[United Press, London, 28th] The British government held a cabinet meeting here today. It is reported that the cabinet members discussed Stalin's proposal to revise the Anglo-Soviet Agreement. It is reported that Foreign Minister Bevin met with Soviet Ambassador Zarubin yesterday for concrete discussions.

[Reuters, London, 28th] Moscow Radio today re-broadcast a TASS commentary on Britain's policy towards the Soviet Union, stating that Britain's policy towards the Soviet Union cannot be said to conform to the principles and needs of the Anglo-Soviet Alliance. Foreign newspapers have commented a lot on the recent exchange of documents between British Prime Minister Bevin and Marshal Stalin. In fact, there are many examples in which Britain and the United States seem to have joined forces to resist the Soviet Union.

### South Pacific Conference Elects Chairman and Vice-Chairman

### US Government Condemns Poland, Believes Elections Did Not Meet Principles of Freedom, Declares No Immediate Intention to Sever Relations

[United Press Washington, 28th] The State Department today issued a statement formally condemning the Polish Provisional Government for employing widespread oppression and intimidation against democratic elements in the recent general election, failing to uphold its sacred promise to hold free elections.

[Associated Press Washington, 28th] The United States today declared that it does not recognize the Polish parliamentary elections of the 19th of this month, censuring the government's improper conduct. However, the US envoy in Warsaw will remain in place. In other words, the US will not sever relations with Poland immediately, but retains full freedom of action to determine its future attitude towards the Polish government. There is currently no indication as to what measures the US will take, but economic measures or even recalling US Ambassador Lane are possible. Lane could be recalled home for "consultations" without formally severing diplomatic relations. The aforementioned statement, approved by Secretary of State Marshall, was issued by the State Department and is the first major announcement of US policy towards Europe since Marshall took office, aligning completely with the declaration of former Secretary of State Byrnes regarding Poland. The US objections are based on the Polish government's suppression of democratic elements during the elections. It is claimed that "the Polish Provisional Government's oppressive measures are not limited to so-called 'underground elements,' but are a large-scale intimidation of democratic elements. Although these democratic elements do not belong to the ruling party, they are truly loyal to Poland." Therefore, the US government believes that the Yalta and Potsdam agreements' guarantees of free elections in Poland have not been fulfilled. The United States established diplomatic relations with the Polish government because of these two agreements.

### Anglo-Burmese Agreement Established, Permitting Burmese Self-Determination, British Government Publishes White Paper Yesterday

[Associated Press London, 29th] Regarding the Burmese independence case, the British government today published a White Paper detailing the contents of the agreement reached in the negotiations between the British and Burmese delegations here over the past two weeks, stipulating that (1) Burma shall determine for itself whether to remain within the British Commonwealth with dominion status or to secede completely and become fully independent. (2) Burma shall elect a National Assembly in April to draft a constitution. The representatives of the National Assembly shall be entirely Burmese. (3) Before the new constitution comes into effect, Burma shall form a provisional government, with an Executive Council composed of Burmese people, and a Governor appointed by the British, similar to the situation in India. (4) It is recognized in principle that Burma may manage its finances during the transition period and may immediately command all Burmese troops. (5) How to handle the presence of British troops after the new constitution comes into effect shall be decided by an agreement between Britain and Burma.

He said that the nation's overall military budget of $67 billion has already been greatly reduced, and the regular army will be reduced to one million and seventy thousand men by July 1, which is the absolute minimum limit. Patterson stated that the United States has ten regular army divisions, eight of which are currently stationed abroad. He also revealed that the Army Department will submit a recommendation to Congress within ten days to decide whether to extend the Selective Service Act, which expires on March 31. The number of new recruits this month is better, but still has not reached the minimum limit of 35,000 per month.

### Many Burmese Demands Not Fulfilled

Opinions of Two Burmese Representatives

[Reuters London, 29th] U Soe, a member of the Burmese Administrative Council, and one of the two who do not approve of the agreement reached between the Burmese leaders and the British government, told a Reuters reporter that most of the demands that the Burmese delegation made to the British government were not fully met. U Soe said, "We came here to discuss the issue of Burmese freedom with the British government. After we arrived, we unanimously put forward several demands in the name of the entire delegation. These demands were determined according to the wishes of the Burmese people, and all representatives agreed, including (1) granting Burma independence within one year, (2) establishing a constituent assembly through direct elections, (3) establishing a provisional government with full cabinet powers, (4) transferring defense and foreign affairs powers to Burmese cabinet members, (5) financial autonomy. In addition, there are several minor demands. Except for using the 1935 mechanism for direct elections to form the constituent assembly, none of the other demands were fully approved by the British government. The issue of independence within one year was completely dismissed. Everything decided by the constituent assembly must be approved by the British Parliament. The current lack of any legislative power over defense and foreign affairs, and the fact that the freedom to be granted to Burma is equivalent to that granted to India, makes me feel that what the Burmese people wanted to gain from the conference has become a pipe dream. This is why I am unwilling to sign the agreement." Another person who does not approve of the agreement is Burmese Transportation and Communications Commissioner Sein. It is said that everything stipulated in the agreement is quite different from the original demands and greatly disappoints the Burmese people. Therefore, he is unwilling to sign the agreement. The constituent assembly is the most important of all the demands, but the constituent assembly does not have the final power to decide on a constitution that it deems suitable for Burma. This power is held by the British Parliament. How can this be called independence?

### Debate on Austrian Peace Treaty, Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Fail to Reach Agreement, British Criticism of Yugoslavia's Territorial Claims on Austria

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 29th Radio: The four Deputy Foreign Ministers met for three hours today and failed to reach an agreement on any clause of the Austrian peace treaty. Soviet representative Gusev opposed the proposal of US representative General Clark, believing that the proposal was too general.

### Far East Tribunal Points Out That All Defendants Are Guilty, Tojo's Defense is Not Worth a Laugh

[Kaizo Sha Tokyo, 29th] The defense attorneys for the defendants at the Far East International Tribunal today summarized the following points to defend the criminals: (1) This war was a war for Japan to defend itself and did not violate the Paris Peace Conference, the Treaty of Versailles, or other international treaties. The evidence presented by the prosecutors makes one feel that all the defendants are guilty, and at the same time makes one feel that they are all innocent; (2) Regarding the crime of disrupting peace, the prosecutors failed to provide evidence to prove that Japan's military actions were planned and prepared by the defendants or by a joint conspiracy; (3) Regarding the crime of murder, it has been proven that none of the defendants ordered the Japanese army to kill people; (4) Regarding ordinary crimes and crimes against humanity, the prosecutors failed to prove that the defendants individually or jointly had a direct relationship with the individual actions of the Japanese army that violated the regulations. The humanitarian responsibility for prisoners of war and detainees is the responsibility of the local military commanders.

Ten Major Crimes

The prosecutors refuted the above points, insisting that all the defendants bear criminal responsibility individually and collectively as follows: (1) All evidence and testimony clearly show that the common goal of the defendants was to control the "Greater East Asia" region, including wars of aggression; (2) Between 1928 and 1945, it is clear that some militarists and civilians in Japan jointly conspired. Okawa Shumei's "Construction of the Greater East Asia Order" clearly expresses this fact. The joint conspiracy eventually implemented the March Incident, the October Incident, and the Shenyang Incident. Defendants Okawa, Hashimoto, Itagaki, and Doihara all participated in these events; (3) Regarding the Shenyang Incident, the then-South Manchuria Railway Minister and his successor Araki and others prepared to invade "Manchuria" and establish a puppet regime; (4) The defendants strengthened their alliance with Germany and invaded China; (5) The situation of the invasion of China after the July 7th Incident was an attempt to annihilate, kill, and subjugate the Chinese army. Then-Prime Minister Hiranuma affirmed this policy, and according to the policy proposed by Hoshino, Japan would utilize the resources of China and all of East Asia. Furthermore, puppet regimes were established in Nanjing and Beiping, violating the Nine-Power Treaty, etc.; (6) Japan's policy was not only to build a "New Order in East Asia" but also to expel the British and Americans from China. Matsui, Hashimoto, Matsuoka, and Koiso said that driving out all the British and Americans was their ultimate goal; (7) Regarding Japanese-German relations, the military alliance, the Anti-Comintern Pact, and attempts to invade the South Seas and other places were closely coordinated by the three military, naval, and foreign ministries, stipulating the spheres of influence of Japan and Germany, and forcing the Yonai Cabinet to resign, to be replaced by Konoe, Matsuoka, Tojo, Hiranuma, Oshima, Shiratori, etc.; (8) Thus, the three-nation military alliance sought to dominate the world; (9) There is sufficient evidence to prove that the joint conspiracy decided on the Soviet-Japanese war. Although the southward advance was later implemented, this did not mean abandoning the attack on the Soviet Union; (10) Japan, in order to dominate East Asia, withdrew from the League of Nations, expanded its land, sea, and air forces, and transformed the mandated territories into fortresses. The attacks on Pearl Harbor and Hong Kong were not the climax of the joint conspiracy. The attacks on Britain and the United States were merely a means to dominate all of East Asia. This is the final goal of the joint conspiracy's internal and external activities.

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 29th] At the opening of the Far East Military Tribunal today, Tojo's American defense attorney, Blewett, read Tojo's motion, denying war responsibility and wrongdoing, and stating that "the Greater East Asia War was not a war of aggression." Tojo showed no emotion when the motion was read.

### Roosevelt Poses Twelve Questions; Stalin's Answers

The American magazine "Look" published an article by Elliot Roosevelt, including an interview with Stalin on December 21, 1946, which contained Stalin's answers to twelve questions posed by Elliot Roosevelt. The questions posed by Roosevelt and Stalin's full answers are as follows:

Question 1: "Do you believe that a democratic system of government like that of the United States and a communist system like that of the Soviet Union can coexist in this world without either side attempting to interfere in the domestic political affairs of the other?"

Stalin: "Yes, of course I believe so. This is not only possible, it is wise and entirely within the realm of reality. In the most strenuous and tense times, during the war, differences in political systems did not prevent our two countries from uniting to eliminate our enemies. In peacetime, it is even more possible to continue this relationship."

Question 2: "Do you believe that the success of the United Nations depends on the agreement between the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States on basic policies and objectives?"

Stalin: "Yes, I think so. In many ways, the fate of the United Nations as an institution depends on the harmony and concord reached by these three powers."

Question 3: "Marshal, do you believe that a broader economic agreement between our two countries for the exchange of manufactured goods and raw materials would be an important step towards world peace?"

Stalin: "Yes, I believe it is important for establishing world peace. I certainly agree. The expansion of world trade would in many ways benefit the development of good relations between our two countries."

Question 4: "Does the Soviet Union support the immediate establishment by the United Nations Security Council of an international police force composed of all United Nations member states, so that it can immediately move into any place where armed conflict threatens peace?"

Stalin: "Of course, I support it."

Question 5: "If you believe that atomic bombs should be controlled by the United Nations, should the United Nations also control, through supervision, all research and manufacturing facilities related to armaments of any kind, and control the use and development of atomic energy during peacetime?" (At this point, Elliot Roosevelt interjected, saying: "Stalin asked a shrewd question: 'In general?' I said, 'Yes, but especially in regards to Russia's agreement in principle to this plan.'"

Stalin: "Of course, I believe so. Based on the principle of equality, there should be no exceptions made for Russia. Russia should abide by the same rules of supervision and control that any other country must abide by." (Elliot Roosevelt interjected again here, saying: "His answer was unequivocal, and the issue of reserving veto power was not even mentioned.")

Question 6: "Do you think that holding another tripartite conference to discuss all international issues currently threatening world peace would contribute to a beneficial goal?"

Stalin: "I think there should not be just one conference, but several. If there are several conferences, it will contribute to a beneficial goal." (Here, Elliot Roosevelt added: "At this point, my wife asked him if he thought such a conference would help government officials at lower levels achieve closer relationships. She also asked if wartime conferences had achieved such results. He smiled at her and replied, 'There is no question about it. Wartime conferences and the results achieved have greatly helped cooperation at lower levels.'")

Question 7: "Sir, I know that you are a scholar well-versed in the many other political and social issues existing in other countries. So I would ask: Do you not feel that the American elections in November indicate that the people have wavered in their faith in the policies of the late Roosevelt and are leaning towards the isolationist policies of the late Roosevelt's political opponents?"

Stalin: "I am not very familiar with the domestic life of the American people, but I think that the election indicates that the current American government is wasting the moral and political capital created by the late President, thus making it easy for the Republicans to win." (Here, Elliot Roosevelt added: "The Marshal spoke with great emphasis when answering my next question.")

Question 8: "To what do you attribute the reduction in friendly relations and understanding between our two countries since Roosevelt's death?"

Stalin: "I feel that if this question refers to the relationship and understanding between the American and Russian people, then there has been no deterioration. On the contrary, the relationship has improved. As for the relationship between the two governments, there have been misunderstandings, and there has been some deterioration. Later, there were many cries saying that this relationship would deteriorate further. However, in terms of the meaning of disrupting peace or military conflict, I do not see anything terrible in this regard. No great power is currently able to drive its army to fight against another allied power, against another great power, even if its government wants to do so, it will definitely not be able to, because in the current situation, a country cannot fight without the participation of the people—and the people do not want to fight. They are all tired of war. Moreover, there is no understandable goal to justify a new war. People will not know why they are fighting. Therefore, regarding the fact that some representatives of the American government are talking about the deterioration of relations between us, I don't see anything terrible. Given all these considerations, I do not think the danger of a new war is real."

Question 9: "Do you support the extensive exchange of cultural and scientific knowledge between our two countries? And do you also support the exchange of students, artists, scientists, and professors?"

Stalin: "Of course, I support it."

Question 10: "Should the United States and the Soviet Union formulate a common long-term policy of aid to the peoples of the Far East?"

Stalin: "I think that if this is possible, it would be useful. In any case, our government is prepared to pursue a policy in the Far East that is in common with the United States."

Question 11: "If the United States and the Soviet Union agreed on a system of loans and credit extensions, would such an agreement be permanently beneficial to the American economy?"

Stalin: "Such a system of credit extensions would certainly be mutually beneficial to both the United States and the Soviet Union." (Here, Elliot Roosevelt interjected: "Then I asked a question that was obviously related to many European countries.")

Question 12: "Does the Soviet government have significant reason to be surprised that the work of purging Nazis has not been thoroughly carried out in the American and British occupation zones of Germany?"

Stalin: "No, this is not a reason for great surprise, but the Soviet Union is certainly unhappy that this part of our common program has not been thoroughly carried out." (Reuters Moscow Dispatch)

### International Food Committee

Decides on Rice Quota for the First Half of the Year

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 28th] According to Xiao Songqin, my representative to the Siamese Rice Joint Committee, the International Food Relief Committee recently allocated a total of 240,000 tons of rice to China for use in the first half of this year. Of this amount, Siam and Burma are each responsible for delivering 100,000 tons, with the remainder to be borne by Vietnam and other regions. The amount of rice China will receive from Siam in the first three months of this year is estimated at 11,511 tons for January and February and 13,389 tons for March. Siam's reserves of old rice are exhausted, so the initial export volume is not high. The above estimates are based on the harvest of new rice and factory output. Although Siamese government officials are optimistic about future food exports due to the autumn harvest, local transportation experts are deeply skeptical, as the current transportation efficiency in Siam is much lower than before the war.

### Yoshida Cabinet on the Verge of Collapse; Socialist Party Does Not Accept Yoshida's Conditions; Forming a Coalition Cabinet Still Faces Difficulties

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 29th] Leaders of the Japanese Liberal, Progressive, and Socialist parties, Yoshida, Shidehara, and Katayama, held talks this morning to discuss the formation of a coalition cabinet. Yoshida stated that in order to overcome the national crisis, he was willing to resign en masse and form a coalition cabinet to overcome the major difficulties. Katayama stated that from a national standpoint, he had fully considered cooperating in forming a coalition cabinet, but the negotiation must be joined by the three opposition parties, the Ishibashi financial policy must be changed, and the Socialist Party members in the cabinet must be determined by the Socialist Party itself. Yoshida asked the Socialist Party to accept four cabinet seats, hoping to form a coalition cabinet on a fair and equal footing among the parties. However, there are legal difficulties regarding the entry of the Kyodo People's Party into the cabinet. Regarding the Ishibashi financial policy, he is willing to give it full consideration. As a result, today's talks did not reach a consensus. Katayama will convene the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party to decide on the final attitude. As for the Liberal Party, it held a meeting of its members in Tokyo this afternoon, resolving to absolutely oppose replacing Finance Minister Ishibashi. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether the Yoshida Cabinet will carry out a general resignation today. However, Yoshida himself seems determined to promote this move. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Joji visited the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives this morning to discuss the procedures for recommending the Prime Minister to the Emperor when a coalition government is established.

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 29th] The Japanese Socialist Party convened an emergency Central Executive Committee this afternoon to review the conditions proposed by Prime Minister Yoshida during the three-party leaders' talks this morning. The resolution was: (1) To not accept the conditions proposed by Yoshida; (2) The Yoshida Cabinet must first resign en masse, and then the five parties will negotiate the issue of a coalition cabinet. The Ishibashi financial policy must be abandoned, and both the Kyodo People's Party and the People's Cooperative Party must enter the cabinet. The above three points are absolutely non-negotiable.

### Five-Person Investigation Committee; Conducts On-Site Investigation of the Fire Zone; Based on Testimony of Disaster Victims; Two Firefighters Detained; Eyewitness Account of a Child Who Saw Looting During the Fire; Speaker Pan States That Witnesses Must Be Protected

[Reported by this newspaper] The five-person investigation committee for the Westmore Road fire case began its investigation work yesterday. Municipal Counselor Ge Kexin, Police Bureau Chief Inspector Zhang Da, Municipal Councilors Zhang Jiu Zuo, Jiangning District Chief Hou Junren, Supervisory Envoy Zhang Li-san, Public Works Bureau Survey Specialists Song Xueqin and Li Zhenqiu, victim Zheng Zaijian, and more than ten reporters from various newspapers arrived successively at the residence of Cai Guoliang, the Jiangning District Baochang at 350 Xikang Road, to gather and conduct the first detailed investigation of the disaster area. After interviewing the disaster victims, there was unanimous agreement on the dereliction of duty by the firefighters, and they all stated that it was true. However, it was still difficult to obtain concrete evidence of extortion and looting. However, in the answers of the victims, there were many clues to be found.

Also, when Speaker Pan arrived at Baochang Cai's residence at 4:45 PM, he repeatedly encouraged the victims to speak freely without reservation, saying that it concerned the welfare of all citizens and must be thoroughly investigated. The Municipal Council is a public opinion organ and must seek welfare for the citizens.

Chen Zhu Min, a tenant from house number 27 who was present yesterday, witnessed the looting behavior of firefighters 011 and 017. Speaker Pan said with emotion: This is good material and can be quickly reported to Mayor Wu and Director Xuan to discuss solutions. However, the municipal government must provide protection for such witnesses. The police bureau chief Zhang was responsible for handling this.

Ge Kexin, the chairman of the investigation committee, immediately telegraphed Mayor Wu, and the mayor ordered the two firefighters to be handed over to Chief Zhang for handling. Chief Zhang immediately notified the fire department to detain them. Firefighter 011 has now been detained, while 017 is a member of the Jing'an Temple District sub-team, and there has been no further information. It is reported that sub-team leader Li Xun has also been detained.

### Firefighters Appeared at the Window on the Third Floor; They Did Not Allow Residents to Enter

The investigators first visited Shunkang South Goods and Seafood Store at 442 Wuding Road, which is located opposite the fire site. According to the shop owner Qiu Bingshun, the fire started at 9:30 PM on the first night of the new year at the home of a coppersmith at 425 Wuding Road. According to A Qian, the coal ball servant who first discovered the fire, it was caused by a short circuit in the electrical wiring. Qiu Bingshun called the fire department from the neighbor's phone within five minutes to report the fire. The first fire truck arrived 20 minutes later. At this time, the wooden shed of Wang Yunfu's house at number 29 had already caught fire. This wooden shed was the residence of the sixteen servants of the Wang family and was closer to the fire. However, it was extinguished in just over ten minutes. Therefore, when the later eight or nine fire trucks arrived one after another, the fire had actually been extinguished. However, half an hour later, the third floor of number 29 suddenly caught fire again. At this time, the American fire truck also arrived, but because they could not connect to the water dragon, they could not assist in the rescue. Seeing their situation, there seemed to have been a dispute. But when the American soldiers saw those firefighters spraying water on the glass windows of the Wang house, and it slid down the glass, they shot and broke the glass to let the water pour into the hole to irrigate the flames. Although the irrigation did not stop for half an hour, most of it was because it was poured on the lead roof, which could not suppress the fire. The wind was not strong that day, so number 29 burned for a full three hours before it spread to number 27. According to rumors, there were more than a hundred boxes of soft leather goods on the third floor of number 29. Some people saw firefighters appearing at the window on the third floor, but they did not allow residents to enter.

Having Wine and Chatting at the Water Boiler Stove; A Wine Bottle Was Left Behind

Qiu Bingshun also pointed out that the firefighters were careless and had wine and chatted at the nearby water boiler stove. So the investigation committee called Ren Huanting, the owner of Juxingyuan at 448 Wuding Road. The boss Ren said: At about 4:00 AM on the second morning of the new year, several firefighters ran in to ask for boiling water to drink, and they brought a bottle of foreign wine. They were leisurely and self-satisfied, and ordered the stove to be lit quickly to heat water for warming. The committee asked Mr. Ren if he had provided dishes. He angrily replied, "The house is on fire and you don't put it out, who would be happy to give them food!" After drinking wine, the firefighters left an empty bottle, which is now preserved by Chairman Ge. That is not a yellow wine or mung bean wine bottle, but a vintage foreign wine called Peppermint. The stopper fell into the bottle, probably for convenience when eating. We know that only wealthy families have this kind of vintage foreign wine. But so far, the owner of the wine has not been found.

More Than 2 Billion Worth of Hog Bristles; Even the Foreign House Was Burned Down

Then, the committee members went to the fire site for investigation. Unexpectedly, although number 29 was the first to be set on fire, it was more complete than other houses, both inside and out. The kitchen was not damaged, the stairs did not collapse, the green paint on the walls was still there, and a brand-new Santa Claus on the window was still there. A fire hose extended from the back door into the house and was burned and pressed in the rubble. It is worth noting that there are firewalls between each foreign house. Chief Zhang said, "With firewalls, the responsibility of the fire department is even greater."

It is said that when the fire broke out, the entire Wang Yunfu family, the manager of Sanyou Industrial Company, the owner of house number 29, was at the Majestic Theatre watching a movie. The maids saw the fire and were only anxious and panicked. Although they asked the firefighters for help, they were all maids and could not make any decisions. As a result, 400 boxes of hog bristles worth more than 2 billion yuan in the garden, and the magnificent foreign house were burned down.

Wardrobes and Shoe Boxes; A Big Hole Was Chopped

Number 11 is the home of Tang Ruichan, the assistant manager of Qingfeng Textile Co., Ltd., which is the owner who has been burned into ruins. In the rubble of his house, a jar of fragrant snails was seen, which was probably left over from the New Year. His old nanny, Wang Yingjuan, said that the fire burned to our house at 1:00 AM. But from 10:00 PM, the firefighters who came in and out had been constantly flowing. They did not allow us to move things, but they chopped a big hole in the wardrobes and shoe boxes in the downstairs room. The nanny wanted to go upstairs to grab things, but she was hugged and teased by the firefighters.

The Captain Came to Make a Phone Call; Subordinates Chatting and Asking for Tea and Cigarettes

When the inspection was completed, everyone went back to lunch to prepare to visit the disaster victims in the afternoon, the reporter visited a neighboring family again. According to them, from the time the fire broke out at night, the firefighters who came to borrow the phone were constantly flowing. These calls were probably made to the fire association, such as: "Why did we come from Jing'an District, but Xinzha District has not come yet?" "The fire truck has no gasoline, hurry up and bring some gasoline." "The time has passed, why don't you come to change shifts? Do you think we are easy to bully?" In addition, they also saw a captain come to make a phone call and say to the subordinates who were sitting in the house: Why don't you go to put out the fire? But the firefighters were still chatting and laughing, asking for cigarettes and tea, where did it look like they were putting out the fire?

### Famous Calligraphy and Paintings of Tang and Zhu; All Turned to Ashes

At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, many victims were summoned by the Baochang to his home to meet with the investigation committee. The anger of the explosion made them no longer as weak as lambs. They spoke outrightly and exposed without selfishness.

The first to speak was Gu Ze-zhi from number 11. His house was next to the Westmore Road Elementary School. When the coppersmith's house caught fire, he moved his things out, but because the fire was extinguished, he moved them back in again. When the fire became vigorous again, the house was full of smoke and stench, and it was impossible to enter again, so he had to watch it burn. He asked a firefighter for help, but the fire hose that was being used was full of holes, and water was splashing everywhere. In addition to being drenched in water from the cracks in the hose, it was useless. So, he watched as his precious ancestral calligraphy and paintings of Tang Bohu, Zhu Zhi-shan, etc., were all turned to ashes. Then, he shook his head and sighed endlessly.

### Watching the Municipal School Burn; Laughing and Saying the Mayor Has Money

Gu specially pointed out the absurd actions of the firefighters at that time. When he discovered that the National Elementary School was burning, he encouraged the firefighters and said, "This is a municipal elementary school, hurry up and save it"! Unexpectedly, the firefighters sneered and said, "Anyway, the mayor has money"! Then, naturally came a concrete answer of inaction. Finally, Mr. Gu added that he had heard this sentence with his own ears and could take full responsibility for it. In addition, he hopes that the municipal government will assist in two points: (1) The responsibility for the delay in this fire and the facts of robbery and extortion should be thoroughly investigated. (2) The large landlord published an advertisement today, notifying the second tenants to clear the fire site within ten days, so that the owner can build a fence and renovate, and the original lease of the tenant is declared invalid. The authorities should stop this act of taking advantage of the fire and maintain the right of the victims to lease a new house.

Firefighters Fought Each Other; Three or Four People Were Twisted Together

The victim at the fire site at 425 Ximolu Road said: When the fire broke out, I was playing cards at Gordon Road. Suddenly, the lights went out. At that time, I only thought that the light was broken and wanted to buy candles to continue the fun. Who knew that it was my own house that was on fire? When I rushed home, my wife was dragging the child out. When we put the child down and went in to grab the quilt, we were immediately blocked by the smoke and fire and could not get out. In a panic, we had to cut off the fence of the Wang family next door with a knife and escape from their backyard. Poor children were shivering in the heavy rain without even having time to put on their clothes. He also said: At around 1:00 AM, he saw firefighters fighting each other at the gate of Dakangli, and three people were twisted together. Later, after the persuasion of several other firefighters, they stopped. Those present at the scene were extremely angry. It was hateful that the firefighters watched the fire from the other side of the bank, and it was even more hateful to fight before the fire!

Asking Where First Upon Entry; Turning Away Upon Knowing It Was A School

Ms. Pan Wenzhen, the principal of the Westmore Road National Elementary School, was even more emotional. She said eloquently: When I discovered it, number 29 had just caught fire, and firefighters ran into the house one after another. I told them to quickly tear down the house and spray water, but they ignored it and only asked: "What place is this here?" When they were told it was a school, they immediately turned and left. After that, until it was burned down, I never saw a water dragon come in. The teachers in the school, Pan Tianmin and Zhan Chunnian, personally ran to number 29 to see the rescue situation, but they saw that the water dragon never faced upwards, and asked: There is a big fire on the third floor, why don't you spray upwards forever? The answer was very simple: There is no water, what do you know? In this way, by 11:00, the school had been burned. Until about 4:00 on the first day, the school was still in flames. The rooms in the front door had already been burned, and only the library in the back door had not been burned yet. The teachers and others begged the firefighters to quickly give assistance, but to no avail, saying that there was no "seedling" (dragon head).

Finally Taking Matters Into One's Own Hands; Only Then Was the Library Preserved

In this way, after entangled with them for more than two hours, seeing that the fire was about to burn to the library, they had to take matters into their own hands and pull up the water dragon that was thrown on the ground and sprayed it hard at the library, and as a result, it was finally preserved. Principal Pan said: It didn't take much time at all for the fire to be extinguished. Therefore, everyone in the school believed that if they had their own tools, the fire would not have burned the school! Finally, Principal Pan concluded that the firefighters did not ask me for gold bars, so I would not read about hearsay, but it is a fact that they did not put out the fire. Their attitude was leisurely and slow, as if the fire had nothing to do with them!

### Rubber Factory Owner Denies Bribery

Tong Keqin, the owner of Yongqin Rubber Factory, vehemently denied that he had ever engaged in bribery. He said, "I can swear to heaven about this! At the time of the fire, he was not in the factory. He only got the news at twelve o'clock. He rushed back immediately, not even having time to put on his coat, and without even bringing money for transportation. When he arrived at the factory, the Wang family had already caught fire, and the rubber factory was also affected. He saw that there were belts in the factory, but they were not connected to nozzles, so they were useless. At that time, he saw a firefighter and asked him to get a nozzle, but he never returned. The fire in the factory was extinguished by his own brothers and three workers. The factory was equipped with more than a dozen fire extinguishers, all of which were used up. Then lead buckets were used to pour water, and the fire was finally extinguished. Tong said: I have also heard rumors that firefighters demand extortion money, so when I saw that the fire in my factory was extinguished, I quickly fled, so as not to be seen by them and invite trouble. This was about four or five o'clock in the morning."

### Attending the Police Affairs Committee to Fully Assist in the Investigation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Police Affairs Committee of the Municipal Senate held its seventh meeting at the committee yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. The fire case on Seymour Road and Wuding Road in this city was specifically brought up for detailed discussion, and the following resolutions were made: (1) As this case is currently under investigation by this committee, please the colleagues of this committee assist in the investigation as much as possible through personal relationships. (2) Mr. Chen Tingrui sent a letter to the Chairman and Vice Chairman of this council, stating that the fire on Shaanxi North Road and Wuding Road lasted for as long as thirteen hours, suggesting that the central district fire brigade should be privately run, and it seems that this case can be discussed in the municipal meeting. Resolution: This case will be brought up for discussion at this council's reconvened general meeting, and Mr. Chen Tingrui will be asked to provide a specific plan for a privately run fire brigade, and colleagues of this committee will collect information for the general meeting to refer to.

### Wang Xiaolai Resigns as Senator, Xian Bingcheng Fills the Vacancy According to Law

[Our Newspaper's Report] Municipal Senator Wang Xiaolai recently sent a letter to Chairman Pan of the council, requesting to resign from his position as a senator. The secretariat of the council has received an edict reply, reluctantly approving it, and according to law, alternate senator Xian Bingcheng will fill the vacancy.

### Two Prosecutors Re-examine the Scene, Summoning Bao and Jia Leaders and Other Witnesses; Ineffective Firefighting is Indeed a Fact; There is No Concrete Evidence of Extortion; A Maid from Wang Yunfu's Family States that the Fluorescent Lamp was Taken Away by a Firefighter

[Our Newspaper's Report] Shen Zusheng, the prosecutor from the District Procuratorate, went to the scene of the Seymour Road fire again yesterday morning with a clerk and a photographer to re-examine the scene and take photos. At the same time, he summoned Bao and Jia leaders and other witnesses on the spot to investigate the details of the firefighters' rescue efforts at the time. According to Bao leader Cai Guoliang, Jia leaders Sun Zhiping and Zhang Bingwen, etc., the firefighters' rescue efforts were indeed ineffective. As for the extortion of gold bars and taking advantage of the fire to loot, they are all rumors after the fact, and there is no concrete evidence to provide. Tong Xunde, the manager of Yongqin Rubber Factory, denied ever bribing firefighters. Tu Lianbao, a maid from Wang Yunfu's family, stated that a fluorescent lamp was indeed taken away by a firefighter. In addition, according to the report of Section Chief Wang of the Fire Department: The Fire Department has not received a fluorescent lamp. Prosecutor Shen believes that since the Wang family has proven that a fluorescent lamp was taken away, and the Fire Department has not received it, it is not difficult to imagine that it was taken away by someone taking advantage of the opportunity. From a legal standpoint, the criminal responsibility for looting a fluorescent lamp is the same as that for looting valuable property. In addition, Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang rushed to the scene of the fire at around 10:00 a.m. yesterday to personally inspect the scene and gave instructions to Prosecutor Shen, who was investigating on the scene.

### 15,000 Households Apply to Install Telephones, But There is No New Equipment

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Telephone Company previously ordered a large number of telephone equipment from the United States, Britain, France, and Belgium. Due to the shortage of raw materials such as lead, copper, and steel in various countries, only a small portion has been shipped to date, so the telephone supply situation in this city has not improved. At present, more than 15,000 households in this city have applied to install telephones, but except for some military and political-related agencies, they have not been approved. According to the person in charge of the company, if no new equipment arrives in Shanghai within one or two months, it will be impossible to install new telephones in the future.

Unexpectedly, when flying over Changting and Xiamen, the weather suddenly changed, with thick fog and extreme cold. Although the aircraft climbed to an altitude of 16,000 feet, it was still unable to break through the clouds and proceed smoothly, so it had no choice but to return to Shanghai, arriving here at 2:30 p.m. Chen and others are scheduled to fly to Guangzhou again at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. If the weather is good, it is expected to arrive at 2:00 p.m.

### Attending the International Labor Conference, Our Representative Returns Home to Shanghai, More Than 8,000 Members of Various Trade Unions Welcome Him; Liu Songshan Talks About the Main Points of the Conference Proposals

[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Songshan, the labor representative of China who participated in the 29th International Labor Conference, and consultant Zhou Xuexiang, after the conference closed, set off from France on December 18 last year to return to China. At 1:00 p.m. yesterday, the French ship Zephyr arrived in Shanghai. More than 8,000 members of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and trade unions such as shipbuilding, rubber, cigarette, and postal services went to the China Merchants Bureau Wharf in Hongkou to welcome them. After the two disembarked, the sound of firecrackers was deafening. Two female representatives of the trade union stepped forward to present flowers. The two then took a car to the Federation of Trade Unions on Penglai Road to rest. It is reported that the Standing Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is scheduled to hold a welcoming dinner for the two at the Fulai Hotel at 12:00 today. The entire Shanghai labor community is scheduled to hold a welcoming meeting at the Kangle Restaurant at 2:00 p.m. on the first day of next month, inviting the two to report on their attendance at the International Labor Conference. In addition to reporting to the Shanghai International Labor Office within a few days, Liu is also scheduled to go to Nanjing at the beginning of next month to report to the Ministry of Social Affairs.

According to Liu, the International Labor Conference, which lasted for three weeks, was held in Montreal, the commercial center of Canada, from September 19 last year. A total of 46 countries participated, with more than 400 representatives attending. The Chinese delegation consisted of 13 people, with Li Pingheng and Wu Xiufeng representing the government, Zhang Jianhui representing the capital side, and Liu representing the labor side. Liu continued to describe the significance of the conference and the main points of its proposals. Due to the two world wars in more than 30 years around the world, economic chaos affected political unrest. The conference focused on this point and strived to uphold justice and humanity in order to achieve a balanced development of the world economy. The main points of its proposals: (1) Revise the International Labor Charter, (2) Formulate new conventions based on and reviewing old ones, (3) Formulate measures to protect young workers and juvenile workers (i.e., child labor as we call it in China), (4) Formulate policies to improve the treatment of workers in colonies. Liu added that although China has no colonies, the lives of overseas Chinese workers in various countries should be improved, so he also agreed with this proposal.

After attending the International Labor Conference, Liu and Zhou Xuexiang also represented the construction and textile labor unions of China respectively on November 10 last year to attend the International Building and Textile Labor Representatives Conference held in Belgium. Liu finally expressed his feelings, saying that today's world has entered the atomic bomb era, and all aspects of our country feel inadequate. Both labor and capital should step up their efforts. The capital side should be humanitarian and pay attention to labor welfare, while the labor side should be self-sacrificing and self-regulating, and in line with national interests, coordination can be achieved and progress can be made. Any disputes should be avoided, which is unwise.

### Collision Case at Wusongkou, Both Sides Were at Fault, Both Captains Neglected Their Duties, District Procuratorate Filed a Public Prosecution

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of the collision between the Zhijiang Wheel and the Huatong Wheel, the captains of the Zhijiang Wheel, Xin Chengfang, and the captain of the Huatong Wheel, Zhang Jinsheng, were detained by the District Procuratorate after the incident, and Prosecutor Fang Zheng actively conducted the investigation. The investigation has now been completed and a public prosecution has been filed. The prosecutor believes that the defendants Qi Chengfang and Zhang Jinsheng are not only responsible for the affairs of the entire ship, but are also navigation and driving personnel. They should pay special attention to the matters that should be fulfilled in their duties in order to fulfill their responsibilities. But now they are negligent and neglect their due duties, causing collisions and capsizing, passengers to be drowned, and affecting navigation safety. Since both sides are at fault, they should be held equally responsible, and they have both violated Article 183, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law: "A person engaged in business who, due to negligence in business, capsizes or destroys a train, tram, or other water, land, or air public transport vessel, vehicle, or aircraft in which people are present shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for a term of not less than five years." Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law: "A person engaged in business who causes death to a person due to negligence in business shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years or detention, and may also be fined not more than 3,000 yuan." Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law: "A person who injures another person due to negligence in business shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, detention, or a fine of not more than 1,000 yuan; if the injury is serious, the person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than three years, detention, or a fine of not more than 2,000 yuan" The crime is suspected and should be sentenced according to Article 55 of the same law: "A heavier sentence shall be imposed."

The indictment of Prosecutor Fang states: "When the Zhijiang Wheel capsized and sank, a passenger named Cai Zhilin was crushed to death while escaping, and seven other rescued passengers were injured." It also states: "It was found that the two wheels were approaching the stone ridge in Wusongkou. According to the Navigation Administration Bureau's research on the nautical charts at the time, the width of the navigation channel in that section was at least 800 feet. The left lane of the Huatong Wheel should have 300 to 400 feet, proving that the defendant Wei Fang did not comply with Article 25 of the regulations for avoiding ridges and sail to the right, but turned to the left to avoid the ridge. The route taken was incorrect. The defendant Zhang Jinsheng drove the Huatong Wheel, the iron barge and the two ships abreast also violated Article 15 of the Port Director's announcement. The navigation errors of both parties caused the accident. It is clear reason."

### Director Xuan Summoned to See Chairman Chiang

It is now learned that Director Xuan has also been summoned and left Shanghai for Nanjing at 7:00 a.m. yesterday to see Chairman Chiang. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 2nd of next month. As for whether Xuan will be allowed to resign from the position of director of the Municipal Police Bureau, it will be decided after Xuan returns to Shanghai.

### Tossing Boxes and Overturning Baskets, Filling Pockets to the Brim; A Speech by a Representative of the Disaster Victims; Not Knowing What the World Has Come To

Zhou Qifang, the representative of tenant Zhou Xiuzhen of Room 27, brought the greatest help to the investigation committee. Zhou Qifang looked like a boy who was not yet twenty years old, but his alertness and composure surpassed ordinary adults. He saw with his own eyes the firefighters tossing boxes and overturning baskets, filling their pockets to the brim. And he remembered their numbers clearly. He said very methodically: There were seven families living in Room 27. There were many people coming and going, so when they found out that the coppersmith had started the fire, they closed the back door and all people went in and out from the front door. Not long after, they heard that the fire had been extinguished. Everyone was relieved. Unexpectedly, not long after, the fire rekindled. At this time, firefighters came to break down the back door to borrow flashlights and shouted: "Everyone get out, open the windows, open the doors." Not long after, their three-story building was burned down.

Zhou Qifang left the fire scene at 1:30 a.m. and returned to visit the next morning. It is said that the fire had not been extinguished by 11:00 a.m. on the second day of the Lunar New Year. Zhou Qifang had a relative, Li Shengyun, who was a squad leader in the Central Fire Brigade. He climbed to the roof to check the situation the next morning and told him that the situation was still good after the fire, and many boxes were preserved. Before leaving, he told Zhou Qifang that the captain of the team taking over this time was called Li Xun, and he could try to salvage the boxes after the fire was extinguished. After Li left, Zhou Qifang tried to climb into the fire several times, but was stopped. At this time, four firefighters were standing at the second-floor window rummaging through things. Finally, he borrowed a ladder and climbed up secretly. When they found out, he answered that he had contacted squad leader Li Xun. At this time, the firefighters forced him to open the box, which contained half a dozen towels, four dozen handkerchiefs, and cotton shirts, etc., all of which were stuffed into their pockets. They said: "Towels are good, handkerchiefs are good, give them to us to use!" Except that Qi Hang clearly remembered that the numbers of two of the firefighters were 011 and 017, one was not clear, and one was wearing a flat-topped hat, and the clothes were different from ordinary clothes, and he seemed to be the captain.

### Drifting in the South China Sea for a Day and Night; Talking About the Experience After Returning from Adventure; A Passenger of the "Miss Luzon" Saved Arrives in Shanghai

Guan Shengfu, a passenger who survived the crash of the Far Eastern Air Transport giant airliner "Miss Luzon" on the 11th when it caught fire and sank in the Philippine Sea after flying from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and who was responsible for handling the aftermath negotiations in the Philippines, arrived in Shanghai on the French postal ship Zephyr at 12:00 noon yesterday. According to his account, the four-engine giant aircraft he was on took off from Shanghai to Hong Kong at 7:30 a.m. on the 11th. At 12:30 p.m., he found that the weather in Hong Kong was not good and changed to fly to Guangzhou and Xiamen, but the conditions were the same. In the end, it was decided to fly to Manila. At 1:15 p.m., he found that one of the engines was on fire and emitting smoke. The fire was immediately extinguished, but the engine made strange noises and vibrated continuously. At this time, a beauty used difficult-to-understand English to instruct the passengers to "return to their seats, put on life jackets, and fasten the straps." In an instant, the giant aircraft plunged into the water. Fortunately, the Pacific door had been opened, and five rubber dinghies taken from the aircraft had floated to the side. Thirty passengers (including six British and twenty-four Chinese) died in the aircraft, and three sank after leaving the aircraft because they were unable to cling to the dinghies. The rest climbed onto the dinghies. At that time, the water was rapid and the waves were high, and the fuselage was heavy. The aircraft sank three minutes after falling into the water. The passengers who came out of the water were divided into five rubber dinghies and drifted with the water. By the time it was dark and the waves were high, everyone thought they were hopeless. By 6:00 a.m. the next morning, they saw a small island 15 miles away. They struggled to move forward for an hour, but they still could not make an inch of progress. As a result, they had to let it drift. At 10:30 a.m., they were discovered by five aircraft and looked for a ship to rescue them. At 11:50 a.m., they boarded the American ship General Collins. During these 22 hours, the dinghies were undulating and everyone was vomiting. The most painful thing was the lack of drinking water. Guan also reviewed the aircraft accident and expressed three points of feelings: (1) Philippine Airlines should be responsible, because the aircraft that departed this time had an engine that was not working, so one was replaced, and the engineers who performed the work were mostly unqualified. And this broken engine was still placed in the cabin, which only increased the weight. (2) There are no Chinese translators on foreign aircraft, and few of our Chinese passengers know English, so some did not put on life jackets or fasten the straps properly, and all were killed in the aircraft when they fell into the water. (3) After the British arrived in Manila, their embassy took good care of them, while our country's overseas authorities only sent personnel to express condolences the next day. Guan said that now, in addition to the impossibility of calculating the number of dead, the loss of luggage per person is between three and four thousand US dollars. He has hired lawyer Alexander to negotiate with the company authorities on behalf of all the passengers who encountered the danger.

### Temporary Suspension of Enemy Property Auctions is a Transitional Measure; Discussing New Methods for Collecting Usage Fees

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the auction of enemy property real estate due to repeated disputes, President Song of the Executive Yuan has ordered the China Trust Bureau Enemy Property Clearance Office to temporarily suspend the auctions. The reporter visited the person in charge of the Enemy Property Office yesterday and was told that this is a transitional measure. Because it is difficult to move out of the houses after they are auctioned, the original residents will continue to use them during this transitional period. However, once the time is right, the enemy property real estate will still be auctioned.

The person in charge of the Enemy Property Office said: The usage fees collected by the office for the enemy property houses it manages are not enough to pay the taxes of the Finance Bureau and the Land Administration Bureau. Therefore, it is currently discussing methods for collecting house usage fees with relevant parties, or it will collect usage fees of less than 8 per thousand per month based on the value of the real estate.

It is reported that the reason for the incident was that several sailors had a conflict with police officers at the Tiangong Skating Rink the night before, and the next night they gathered a crowd to retaliate.

### Central China Aviation Shanghai-Chongqing Plane Crash: Discovery at Tianmen, Western Hubei. All Twenty-Six Passengers and Pilots Perished. Company Representatives Fly to Hankou to Supervise Handling of Aftermath.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 29th] China National Aviation Corporation reports: After the crash of Flight 145, Shanghai-Chongqing route, on the 28th, a special plane was dispatched from here at 6 a.m. this morning to search. The wreckage was found, burnt down, near Yonglong River in Tianmen County. Due to the lack of an airfield, landing was impossible. Another special plane was dispatched for inspection this afternoon. Huang Yiwei, Director of the Wuhan Office of the company, will lead doctors and nurses, carrying medicine, by automobile to provide emergency assistance tomorrow morning. Furthermore, according to a telegram received by the Hubei Provincial Government on the 29th from the Tianmen County Government: The plane crashed near Yuxin River within the county, immediately catching fire. The local town head led a team to extinguish the fire. Among the twenty-six people on board, except for one foreigner who was seriously injured and has been sent to the county town for treatment, all others perished.

[This Newspaper Report] China National Aviation Corporation's C-47 model Flight 145, Shanghai-Chongqing route, departed from Shanghai for Chongqing on the 28th and went missing approximately thirty minutes from Hankou. Upon receiving the news, the company dispatched a plane yesterday to search from the air and at 9:15 a.m. it was discovered that the plane had crashed within Tianmen County, western Hubei, approximately one hundred kilometers from Hankou. It remains unknown as of last night whether all twenty-six pilots and passengers perished. The Hankou office of China National Aviation Corporation has organized a jeep team to rush to the scene to handle the aftermath.

Flight 145 departed from Shanghai at 7:20 a.m. on the 28th, piloted by Captain Babaji and Co-pilot Lu Wei (from Guangdong). The wireless telegraph operator was Qiu Yisheng and there were thirty-one passengers. At 10:40 a.m., it arrived in Hankou, where twelve Shanghai-Hankou passengers disembarked and four Hankou-Chongqing passengers boarded. Therefore, when continuing the flight from Hankou, there were a total of twenty-three passengers on board. Approximately half an hour after leaving Hankou, the plane lost contact with the ground.

Discovery After Search

After receiving the report, the head office in this city held an emergency meeting. General Manager Shen De and Chief Pilot McDonald, along with Secretary Wu Jingyan, traveled to Hankou on a scheduled flight early yesterday morning to supervise the search and handle the aftermath. At the same time, Pilot Lanbo was dispatched to fly Special Plane No. 123 to search from the air. Lanbo discovered the crash site at 9:15 a.m. From the air, it was seen that the plane had crashed onto a farmer's fence, with one wing detached from the fuselage and lying approximately half a mile away. Crowds were gathered around, presumably local villagers who had come to watch. After the plane was discovered, the company dispatched Plane No. 123 again at 4 p.m., carrying medicine to drop from the air at the scene, so that any injured survivors could be treated as soon as possible. At the same time, they attempted to communicate with the ground to inquire about the confirmed number of casualties and to investigate the situation at Zhongxiang Airport and Qianjiang Airport in the nearby Han River basin, intending to choose one for landing and to find ways to rescue.

The weather along the flight path of the ill-fated plane was not bad, and the crash site was also on a plain, so the cause of the accident has not yet been determined. It is generally speculated that it was due to a malfunction of the aircraft itself.

Passenger List

Among the twenty-three passengers, there were eleven foreigners (including five children and two women), all of whom were affiliated with the church. The twelve Chinese passengers included Min Tao Sheng, General Manager of Hua Wei Bank, and one woman. The full list is as follows:

### Jiang Shangda, Lying on a Rattan Chair in Court, Appears for Trial While Ill. Claims to Have Reported His Acceptance of a Puppet Position to the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Central Unification. Closing Arguments Concluded, Judgment Scheduled for the Fifth of Next Month.

[This Newspaper Report] Jiang Shangda, suspected of being a traitor, appeared for trial yesterday morning at the High Court, ailing and lying on a rattan chair with a cotton cushion underneath. Due to severe lung disease, he looked haggard with graying hair and a yellow-tinged beard. He wore a gray Russian-style hat pulled down low, only revealing his eyes and nose. He wore a blue silk-padded robe with a blue silk-faced black lambskin overcoat, tied-leg pants, black duck-tongue woolen shoes, and a light yellow woolen scarf. A light blue plaid woolen blanket covered him. A spittoon and a thermos were placed beside him, and a family member was taking care of him. He coughed, spat phlegm, took medicine, and drank water frequently, answering questions while lying down in an extremely weak voice, sometimes only nodding in agreement.

Jiang is a native of Wujin, 55 years old, and well-known in the textile industry. In March of the 31st year (of the Republic, i.e., 1942), he was appointed by the enemy as the Vice Chairman of the Shanghai-Zhejiang-Anhui Textile Industry Association. In the same year, he also served as a member of the Puppet Cotton Industry Control Committee. In the 32nd year (1943), he served as a director of the Puppet Commerce Association. In the 33rd year (1944), when the enemy wanted to collect spindles to contribute iron, Jiang stepped forward to negotiate and signed an agreement with the enemy Sino-Japanese Trade Federation, under which the enemy Sino-Japanese Trade Federation supplied raw materials. The raw materials were entrusted to the association to allocate to colleagues to make cotton cloth, and the cotton cloth was sold at a discount to the enemy Sino-Japanese Trade Federation to stop the exchange of iron.

Jiang Shangda replied in a weak voice, stating: His appointment as Vice Chairman of the Puppet Shanghai-Zhejiang-Anhui Textile Industry Association was due to the recommendation of his colleagues. His position as a director of the Puppet Commerce Association was forcefully appointed by the enemy. The situation was very complicated. He had always opposed the enemy's policy of buying up yarn and had consolidated the yarn factories in the market, moving them to the countryside, so that the enemy's policy of buying up yarn could not be implemented. Therefore, the Japanese side resented him and detained him in the Capital Hotel for three months. Regarding the Japanese's plan to collect spindles to contribute iron, the colleagues united to oppose it for the sake of survival, and ultimately the enemy's plan was thwarted, preserving more than two million spindles. As for the claim that he wove yarn for the enemy Sino-Japanese Trade Federation as an exchange condition, that does not correspond to the facts. He did not participate in the signing of the contract. His acceptance of a puppet position was secretly reported to the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Central Party Headquarters beforehand, and he was assigned by the bureau to serve as an intelligence officer in the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Group, which is documented, and so on.

Witness Han Zhicheng, manager of Guoxin Yarn Factory, testified: During the enemy puppet period, Jiang Shangda was extremely protective of yarn factories established by Chinese people and secretly instructed various yarn factories to consolidate and move to the countryside to sabotage the enemy's plan to buy up yarn and collect spindles to contribute iron. Afterwards, the defendant's lawyers, Zhou Yingcai and Li Mo, stood up to defend him.

At this point, Judge Liu declared: The arguments for this case are concluded, and the judgment will be announced on the morning of February 5th. Jiang Shangda was sent back to Cambridge Hospital to continue treatment, but he is not allowed to leave the hospital on his own. Then, two hospital workers carried the rattan chair into a car, which sped away.

### Defu and Bayer Factories: Actively Preparing for Nationalization.

Raw Materials to Be Purchased from Germany Through Barter.

The liquidation work of the German Overseas Property Liquidation Office has been nearly completed by the end of last year. The issue of how the Defu and Bayer factories will supply raw materials to the Chinese market in the future has aroused widespread concern. It is now known that the office is actively preparing to form the two factories into a state-owned joint-stock company, and the original machinery and raw materials of the Weixin Chemical Factory in Tianjin and Qingdao, both enemy assets, will be assigned to Defu for acquisition. The factory price concession for the Qingdao side, totaling 7 billion yuan, was concluded last week. The Tianjin side is under negotiation. Yesterday, the China Trust Bureau also purchased manufacturing raw materials from Germany through barter to facilitate production, and the surplus assets of the two companies will be used as a portion of the shareholders' equity. Once the supply of pigments and medicines returns to normal, all shares will be sold at market prices. Although the amount of fixed capital has not been determined at this time, the above organizational principles have recently been approved by the Executive Yuan, and it has been ordered that the China Trust Bureau, as a representative of the government, engage in operations.

### Puppet Finance Minister Zhang Deqin Dies in Prison Hospital.

[This Newspaper Report] Zhang Deqin, the puppet Finance Minister of Zhejiang Province, who had been sentenced to ten years in prison, died in the Shanghai Prison Hospital at 3:50 p.m. yesterday. His illnesses were diabetes and lung abscesses. When Zhang was critically ill, the prison authorities notified his family to visit him. The body was temporarily placed in the Shanghai Prison last night.

Zhang was a native of Baoshan, Jiangsu Province, and was 56 years old. He studied at Lincoln Jefferson University in the United States and obtained a doctorate in law. During the enemy puppet period, he served as a specialist in the Puppet Ministry of Social Welfare, a member of the Puppet Frontier Affairs Commission, the Puppet Finance Minister of Zhejiang Province, and the manager of the Insurance Department of the Puppet Central Trust Bureau. Zhang became seriously ill during the trial period. When he was tried on June 22nd of last year, he was carried to the court on someone's back. On June 29th of last year, he was sentenced to ten years in prison by the High Court.

### Case of Enemy Property Encroachment on Dengtu Road: Jiang Customs Replies to the District Prosecutor's Office.

[This Newspaper Report] Regarding the case reported by Sun Zhuting and others concerning the encroachment of a large batch of enemy property worth over 1 billion yuan at No. 340 Dengtu Road in this city (details can be found in this newspaper on the 7th of this month), after the District Prosecutor's Office began its investigation, it involved Ding Guitang, the former Deputy Commissioner of the Maritime Customs and concurrent Commissioner of the Jiang Customs. Yesterday, Liu Bingyi, Commissioner of the Jiang Customs, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office, stating: On November 5, 34th year (1945), he was ordered to organize the "Office for the Reception of Enemy Puppet Wharf Warehouses," which was jointly managed by the Customs, the Third Theater of Operations, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Naval Headquarters, and the Bureau for the Handling of Enemy Puppet Property. It was also stated that the office was actually presided over by Ne Prou (American), the Standing Secretary, and Qian Zongqi and Guo Yourong, the Deputy Commissioners, and not directly by Ding Guitang. Moreover, Ding has now been transferred to the position of Deputy Commissioner of the General Customs Administration, and Ne Prou has also returned to his country. Therefore, when the District Prosecutor's Office has inquiries, Qian Zongqi, the Commissioner of the Secretarial Section of the current General Customs, and Han Zhaolian and Guo Yourong, the Deputy Commissioners, can come to answer questions. Finally, it was stated: However, these people are very busy with official duties, and it is requested that they be sent back immediately after the interrogation, and it is guaranteed that they can still be summoned at any time.

### Runway at Longhua Airport: Transporting Sand and Gravel in Preparation for Repair.

[This Newspaper Report] Since the repeated accidents involving civil aviation aircraft, various sectors have expressed many complaints about civil aviation equipment. The Ministry of Transportation has allocated 9 billion yuan to improve Longhua Airport and established the "Longhua Airport Repair Engineering Office," appointing Chen Zudong as the Director and Shi Yuze as the Deputy Director, responsible for repairing the north-south runways of the airport.

Longhua Airport originally had four runways, but due to financial constraints, only the most frequently used north-south runways can be repaired first, as the wind direction in this city is mostly south wind and north wind, and airplanes land against the wind.

According to the original plan, the north-south runways can be completed by the end of March. Currently, due to the slow transportation of materials, it is feared that completion will be delayed until mid-April.

The repair of the north-south runways at Longhua Airport is still in the preparation stage, and stones, yellow sand, and cement are constantly being transported. Because wooden boats are used for transportation, it takes a long time. Various repair tools, such as stone crushers, road graders, rollers, and cement mixers, are mostly leased from the Zhenru Mechanical Road Construction Team of the Highway Administration, and a portion is purchased from the "Executive Headquarters." However, all kinds of equipment are very heavy, and transportation is particularly difficult.

The entire repair project is contracted by Zhonglian, Tao Guiji, and Baohua Construction Companies.

The Longhua Airport north-south runway repair plan has a length of 6,000 feet and a width of 150 feet. On the left and right sides, shoulders of 25 feet will be added, and there will be drainage ditch equipment. Straight expansion joints are laid in the middle of the runway, with transverse expansion joints laid every 120 feet. The upper layer of the runway will be paved with 11.2-inch thick cement. After the completion of the runway repair, it can be used for the landing of airplanes weighing more than 40 tons. (Bottom picture: The situation of transporting sand and gravel at the airport)

### Female Knitwear Workers: Strike Over Year-End Bonus.

[This Newspaper Report] There are approximately 2,000 to 3,000 female workers in the electrical machinery group of the knitwear industry in this city. At the end of last year, they requested a year-end bonus of 500,000 yuan per person. The employers stated that the business situation last year was not good and there was no precedent for this. After requesting mediation from the Social Affairs Bureau, it was ruled that it would be handled in accordance with the law and would not be issued. After the Lunar New Year, some factories resumed work a few days ago, but the workers immediately implemented a go-slow strike. The Social Affairs Bureau, believing that the labor union was unaware of this strike beforehand and fearing that someone was manipulating it from behind the scenes, summoned the responsible persons of the industrial labor union to the bureau yesterday afternoon and repeatedly emphasized their responsibilities. It is reported that the employers have agreed to a year-end bonus based on one dozen pairs of ordinary socks per person (approximately 20,000 to 30,000 yuan), but the labor side has not agreed and is demanding approximately 100,000 yuan.

### Suspects in Street Vendor Incident: District Court Formally Rules for Dismissal of Charges.

[This Newspaper Report] In the street vendor incident last year, Fang Daosheng and 46 others who were detained on charges of disrupting public order were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office after the investigation was concluded and transferred to the District Court for trial. The court opened on the sixth of this month. As the crimes of all the defendants fell under the amnesty provisions of the Great Amnesty Order, bail was granted and they were released in court. Yesterday, the District Court formally ruled on the case, dismissing the charges in accordance with Article 294, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. This sensational case has now come to a complete end.

### Participating in Public Utilities Committee Meeting: Discussing Street Vendor Locations and Electricity Conservation.

[This Newspaper Report] The Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council held its eighth meeting yesterday, with Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, in attendance. Regarding the matter of how to select responsible personnel to survey and determine the location of street vendor stalls, it was decided to jointly select Yun Qing and Yan Guodong to handle the matter together with the police affairs group. Also, regarding the cancellation of electricity conservation, the Public Utilities Bureau requested that the point regarding electric cooking be retained and not canceled for the time being. It was resolved that the electric cooking portion would be allowed to be temporarily retained and not canceled.

### Industrial and Commercial Crisis Becomes More Serious: If High-Interest Loans, Etc. Are Not Resolved, Dismissals Are Bound to Occur.

[This Newspaper Report] Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that if problems such as high-interest loans, dumping of foreign goods, and transportation cannot be resolved, the economic crisis will become more serious. This year, there is a risk that the industrial and commercial sectors in this city will face a serious dismissal problem. Although dismissals are legal, an increase in the number of unemployed people will inevitably have a significant impact on social order. Therefore, he is deeply concerned about this issue. Since the industrial and commercial sectors are facing this crisis this year, employers should be enlightened, and workers should also use great patience to overcome this difficulty. At the same time, the government should do more to provide unemployment insurance, worker education, and other welfare work.

Director Zhao continued to review the work of the Labor Department over the past year, claiming that it only addressed the symptoms and did "firefighting" work passively. Treating the head when it hurts, and the foot when it hurts. The unemployment insurance and other matters that were originally planned could not be taken care of due to being busy with mediating labor-management disputes every day. He felt ashamed of this. However, he asked himself to do things with conscience, and the workers all regard me as a friend, not as an official, which is very comforting to myself.

Regarding Director Wu's resignation, Director Zhao said: He fully sympathized with him. Like someone who has been fighting on the battlefield for a long time, he should be transferred back to the rear to rest. Director Wu has been busy with affairs for the past year, and recently his brain nerves have been aching, extending to his neck, and he feels pain even when turning his head. This time, he submitted his resignation in order to rest. His intention to resign seems very firm.

### Social Services Reader Consultation

Legal Inquiries

(1) Abandoning the Old for the New

Lu Guiliang asked: After someone named Jia married Yi for more than a year, they began cohabiting with a woman named Bing. This has continued for four years, and they each have children. Now Jia sees Yi as a thorn in his side. There are several legal questions now, and I ask that you answer them. (1) Jia and Bing have already had children and everyone in the family knows about it. Does this constitute bigamy under the law? (2) Even though there is no written evidence, can the household registration form be used as evidence under the law? (3) If Yi divorces Jia, can she demand compensation for losses under the law? (4) If the daughter born to Yi is adopted by Yi, can she demand education and living expenses from Jia? (5) If Yi and Jia divorce based on a written agreement by relatives or close friends, is this legally effective?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin's Answer] (1) If Jia and Bing did not hold a formal wedding ceremony and are only cohabiting, then it is not bigamy. (2) As answered in the first question. (3) She can request compensation for damages. (4) According to the law, the children should be adopted by Jia, but if there is another agreement, that agreement shall prevail. (5) A consensual divorce should be in writing and should have the signatures of two or more witnesses.

(2) Forced Marriage

Wang Zhengqing asked: Someone named Jia was engaged to a woman named Yi at the age of sixteen, with his mother acting on his behalf based on the words of a matchmaker. Jia absolutely disagreed with this marriage. During the War of Resistance, the National Army moved west, and the public order in the countryside was quite chaotic. Yi's family asked Jia's family to take her back to avoid accidents. Jia's mother had no choice but to take the girl back and treat her as a child bride. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Jia was studying in Shanghai, and the family situation was not good. However, he heard rumors that Yi was not behaving properly in the countryside, but there was no evidence, and he also heard that Yi had contracted a venereal disease. The following year, Jia married Yi on his mother's orders, but his inner pain could not be described in words. Now Jia has another girlfriend, and the two have already become engaged. Therefore, Jia wants to divorce Yi. There are several questions, please provide guidance. (1) The combination of Jia and Yi was not in accordance with his own wishes and was completely forced. Is it legally valid? (2) Yi has suffered from venereal disease (suffered before marriage). Can Jia use this as a basis to sue for divorce?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin's Answer] (1) Marriage contracts should be entered into by the man and woman themselves, but marriage contracts entered into by parents on behalf of their children must have the consent of the child, otherwise they are invalid. Also, marriage cannot be forced to be performed. This is clearly stipulated in Articles 972 and 975 of the Civil Code. (2) Those who have suffered from a dishonorable disease can use it as a reason for divorce, but it is not a condition prescribed by law that constitutes divorce.

Furthermore, importers are limited to one application per week thereafter. Before processing their first application, they should register with their designated bank. At the same time, they should also confirm to the bank that they will not make the same application to other designated banks. This is hereby announced in combination.

### Central Bank Continues to Face Pressure, "Boiled Red" Trend Remains Steady

The "boiled red" [currency] market saw a slight stabilization in sentiment yesterday, but the Central Bank continued to face pressure. The morning opening ranged from 3.9 million to 3.92 million. After opening, there was a slight dip to 3.89 million. However, due to general anxieties about gold reserves and the suspension of gold sales by Mexican authorities, sentiment remained relatively stable. The Central Bank officially allocated 1,680 bars at a price of 3.9 million, which briefly boosted the price to 3.96 million. The Central Bank sold when the price rose, causing it to drop back to 3.905 million before stabilizing again. Around noon, the price hovered around 3.93 million. In the afternoon, the Central Bank released several hundred more bars for next-day settlement, resulting in minimal change in the market price. The final result was a slight increase compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were listed at 410,000. Silver dollars remained stable. Informal short-term lending rates eased slightly, with daily interest rates ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 fen.

Foreign currencies remained quiet and stable. The informal market for U.S. dollars continued to hover between 6,700 and 6,900, though the buying and selling prices were close around noon. The market became even more stagnant in the afternoon, fluctuating between 6,800 and 6,900. The final result was a slight stabilization compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were similar, consistently struggling around 1,350 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose slightly to around 1,320 yuan, with limited transactions. The Indian exchange rate was 1,600 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 21,000 yuan, both with prices listed but no market.

Government bonds remained sluggish yesterday, with just over a million changing hands. Room 660 saw some purchases, while Room 604 saw slight sales. Unified bonds C opened in the morning at 1,980 yuan, with a high of 2,050 yuan, ultimately fluctuating between 2,020 and 2,040 yuan. The final result compared to the previous close was stable for bonds A, B, and C, while bonds D and E each rose by 100 yuan.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Market Returns to Weakness; Oil, Soybeans, Sesame, and Flour Perform Well

The amount of rice arriving from the source yesterday remained low, while destocking was active but not strong. A total of around 3,000 shi arrived in the northern and southern markets. The reason was that the weather was severely cold the previous day, and the rivers in the countryside were still not thawed, hindering the supply. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to supply Saigon rice, with only 130 packages sold. Retail stores were normal. Japonica and Indica rice prices were tight in the morning but weak in the afternoon, unable to rally, and ultimately trending towards weakness. In the oil market, soybean oil remained scarce, with limited trading for the time being. Unrefined oil outside the market rose informally by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Refined oil and sesame oil saw little movement. The intake of soybean cakes from Shantou and Taiwan showed signs of slowing, with only Xinghua seeing slight activity, with a price decrease of 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean oil factories had a strong appetite for raw soybeans, and local traders competed to buy them for transshipment, leading to a further increase of 500 to 1,000 yuan. Cowpeas and coral beans were selling well and dried quickly, leading to another increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Red beans remained temporarily stable, and mung beans were similar. Sesame was stable. Raw kernels were selling well, and prices were gradually rising, reaching new highs and continuing to rise sharply by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans' arrivals could not keep up with demand, leading to a sharp increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Corn alcohol was in high demand, rising sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat bran also rose, increasing by 200 to 300 yuan, while small packages soared by 600 to 700 yuan. Flour from the mainland continued to rise gradually, with strong market sentiment, and prices soaring by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the Edible Oil Review Committee met to discuss adjusting oil prices and the allocation of oil from the China Planting Factory.

### Yarn and Cotton Markets are Both Firm; Fine Cloths are Lacking Except for "Five Blessings"

Cotton – Yesterday, the spot cotton market saw Xin Xin Yarn Factory purchase over 50 dan of fine short-staple cotton, and private small factories transacted 200 bales of white cotton. Because the supply of spot goods was drying up, traders were generally optimistic.

Cotton Cloth – Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw 12-pound colored ball Yang He cloth decline by 500 to 1,000 yuan per bolt due to the China Textile Construction Company's large sales of fine cloths. "Five Blessings" fine cloth was doing particularly well, with a shortage of chips, selling for an additional 1,000 yuan, while the rest were stable.

### Police Bureau Orders Submission of Transaction Forms; Rayon Market Temporarily Suspended

The Artificial Silk Industry Association received a notice from the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday, stating that every transaction of artificial silk must be written on a transaction form, which must include the name, address, purpose, and transaction price of the buyer and seller. According to rayon traders, rayon merchants have had no business since the China Trust Bureau took over unified management and distribution. All rayon firms have long been ordered to stop distribution by the China Trust Bureau, and the stocks from the enemy and puppet periods have gradually been sold out. Those who want to eke out a living can only make a small profit by manipulating the colors of the factories. Now that the Municipal Police Bureau has ordered the filling out of transaction forms, the "purpose" item cannot be filled out truthfully. Moreover, rayon transactions have been extremely rare recently, with only a few boxes changing hands each day. Under these circumstances, trading is temporarily suspended, and there was no rayon market today.

Yesterday, only medium-thick broadcloth and melton from the US, and Zhanghua Australian wool tweed, etc., saw some actual transactions. Otherwise, there were few sales. Standard quotations at public tea meetings remained on the red side after opening, with little change.

### Expanding Tea Loans; This Year's Total Exceeds 16 Billion; The Farmers Bank of China to Implement In-Kind Agricultural Loans

In order to assist the tea industry, the Farmers Bank of China has decided to expand tea loans this year, not limited to the areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. It will be held uniformly in all tea-producing areas of the country, in order to adapt to the needs of the tea industry. This approach was decided at the tea loan conference convened by the bank last year. It is reported that the bank is gradually advancing in accordance with the established methods. The bank is now dealing with tea loans as the tea leaves are about to mature and the tea factories are preparing to purchase. In the tea-producing areas of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, such as Qimen, Pingshui, Wenzhou, and Tunxi, the bank's branches have separately handled tea factory registration. According to the amount of green tea purchased after registration, the loan amount for each factory will be determined. The total amount of tea loans this year will be above 16.1 billion.

The Farmers Bank of China is launching in-kind agricultural loans, and the scope of implementation this year will be larger than last year. The bank is currently launching fishing loans in the Shengsi Islands first, and will send personnel there within days to sign contracts with the local fishermen. Secondly, water conservancy in-kind agricultural loans, fertilizer agricultural loans, etc., will be gradually promoted. As for other agricultural loan businesses, once the entire plan is approved by the head office, it will be implemented sequentially.

In order to support the silkworm seed industry, the Farmers Bank of China, in addition to providing seed production loans last year, has recently launched spring silkworm seed mortgage loans in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Methods have been formulated, and loans will be issued separately by branches and offices in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, etc. The amount for each seed production farm is set at 2 billion yuan, and each sheet of seed is loaned 2,000 yuan, with an interest rate of 3%, for a period of three months. The silkworm seeds stored in the warehouse will be the first collateral, and the factory buildings and furniture will be the second collateral.

The Guild's allocations of medium-grade white sugar for spot goods were 136,000 yuan, and warehouse receipts were 132,750 yuan to 132,500 yuan. Raw sugar initially started at 135,000 yuan, but later caught up with the price of medium-grade white sugar at 136,000 yuan, due purely to the shortage of goods. Other green and red sugars saw small decreases again. The Guangdong gang opened up Shunde Green at 94,500 yuan, and Chi Chi at 126,000 yuan, with over 200 packages transacted. The Ou gang opened up Wenzhou Green at 92,000 yuan, with dozens of packages.

Among them, 1,355 were head offices and 3,553 were branch offices. There were 3,644 banks, including 852 state-owned, 1,089 provincially-owned, 531 county and city-owned, and 1,172 commercially-owned. There were 458 silver firms, 454 money shops, 29 trust companies, 492 insurance companies, and 364 cooperative treasuries.

### Lack of Power Affects Production

According to textile industry sources, almost all factories in Shanghai are currently forced to stop work due to the impact of electricity. Recently, not only must work be stopped for two days each week, but there are also several hours of power outages each day. The Shanghai Electric Power Company has a total of 110,000 kilowatts, supplying only slightly more than 3 million spindles. But in addition to 2 million spindles in Shanghai, there are also many weaving and other industries, which require no less than 150,000 kilowatts. Therefore, it is questionable whether the existing power can be sufficient in the shortest period. Moreover, how many hundreds of enemy and puppet factories and newly established factories in Shanghai have not yet started work? Therefore, the lack of electricity in Shanghai is a predetermined fate, and if some textile factories in our country do not set up their own generators at this time and place, the losses from stopping work will be considerable.

### Rayon Factories' Transactions are All Cleared

The artificial silk market in Shanghai yesterday saw a boost in sentiment due to limited allocation of goods, but the market required signed receipts for transactions in order to prevent allocated goods from flowing into the market. Therefore, the market wanted to rise but stopped, and there were no transactions. Yesterday, the quoted price for No. 120 Toyo Orilon was 3.5 million yuan, and the quoted prices for Takayama and Asahi were 3.4 million yuan, slightly firmer than the previous day.

Factory Jingyin businesses saw limited transactions due to the fact that loans from the banking industry were not yet available and money was difficult to turn over. Yesterday's quoted prices were slightly weaker than the previous day. D-grade was quoted at 5.3 million yuan, and Qianjing was negotiated at 4 million yuan, but there were no transactions. Silk fabrics also saw very weak buying due to financial constraints, and yesterday's market prices were the same as the previous day.

### The City's Coal Reserves are Abundant; Coal Allocation Next Month Will Remain Normal; Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, Xu Letian, Releases a Statement

There were widespread rumors that the prices of coal sold by the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs would be adjusted next month. A reporter specially visited Mr. Xu Letian, the chairman of the committee, yesterday. According to him, the decision to adjust the price of allocated coal has indeed been made. The main reason is to consider the costs of the miners, and the adjustment can slightly reduce losses. At present, the city's coal reserves are quite abundant. Coal arriving from various places is slightly affected due to the unresolved freezing of Qinhuangdao. Coal from Taiwan is continuously being shipped. The amount of coal allocated next month can be maintained at a normal state and will not change from this month. Mr. Xu also solemnly stated that the committee is making every effort to procure and transport coal dust, which is the raw material for household coal briquettes. A batch has been ordered from Annam, but due to transportation issues, it has not been able to arrive as scheduled.

### Dried Longan Steps Upward

As both the arrival and storage of dried longan are scarce, although the increase in the negotiated price is very small, the cost of the goods and cargo prevents it from being suppressed and instead sees an increase. Large ones initially started at 460,000 yuan, then rose to 480,000 yuan, and have now reached 500,000 yuan, and there is still upward pressure.

### The Issue of Qualification for Educational Personnel; The Jiangxi Education Department Requests the Ministry of Education to Specify Measures; The Ministry of Education is Consulting with the Ministry of Personnel

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Teachers at all levels of schools and civil servants at all levels are both national workers. Therefore, the issue of teacher qualification is extremely important. All matters such as salaries, grades, seniority pay increases, and treatment guarantees should have explicit regulations so that teachers can participate in qualification when transferred to administrative agencies, based on their past qualifications. The Jiangxi Provincial Education Department has requested the Ministry of Education to specify measures for the qualification of educational personnel. The Ministry of Education has instructed that regarding the qualification of educational personnel, consultations have been held with the Ministry of Personnel, and once the measures are decided, they will be notified.

### Yesterday's Meeting of Private School Principals in This City: Independently Deciding Tuition Standards; Mayor Wu's Earnest Address Respecting the Resolutions of the Attendees

[Report from this newspaper] The Private Primary and Secondary School Principals' Association of this city, to discuss the tuition standards determined by the City Council, specially convened its fourth general meeting at Yucai Middle School yesterday afternoon. Over four hundred and thirty people attended, including Shi Jiadong, Xu Wenxiang, Xiang Enyuan, Yu Chuanding, representing over six hundred units. Mayor Wu, as well as Director Gu of the City Education Bureau, Deputy Director Li, Section Chief Zhu, Section Chief Xie, and others also attended as observers.

Mayor's Address

Jiang Jizhou, Gao Erbo, and Shen Tongyi formed the presidium. After Chairman Gao Erbo reported the purpose of the meeting, Mayor Wu delivered a speech stating: He personally believes that education is the fundamental undertaking of the nation; if education is not done well, China has no hope. The ancients said: "Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parents, Teacher," and he has always placed great importance on the way of the teacher. He came to Shanghai to take office as mayor last May, and before the City Council convened in September, he automatically increased the education budget from nine percent to twenty percent. This time, the City Council determined tuition standards, and the principals of private primary and secondary schools published notices in the newspapers. After reading them, he felt very distressed. When private school teachers petitioned the other day, he had already stated that there were two conflicting mentalities: to do education well, the lives of teachers and staff must be stable, but at the same time, due to price increases, the burden on parents should also be considered. Moreover, the treatment of teachers and staff in private schools is even more constrained by public schools. We must respect the way of the teacher, promote education, but at the same time, we must consider democratic politics. Shanghai is an international city, and to achieve democratization, we must respect the decisions of the representative body—the City Council. If a stalemate develops, it will either leave teachers and staff without a way out, or democracy will fail in Shanghai. He believes that 99% of the private school principals in this city are good, and 99% of the private school teachers and staff are good, because he has confidence and believes that China has a future and that the intellectual class has a future. If he, as mayor, is scolded by others every day, as long as he asks himself if he is at peace and is true to himself, he will not care. The intellectual class cannot be emotional and must consider the overall situation. He now has three suggestions: (1) Respect China's democratic cause; (2) Seek stability in the lives of teachers and staff; (3) Take this opportunity to rectify all private schools in this city so that 100% are good. The implementation methods for these three suggestions are: (1) To ensure the protection of the democratic cause, each school should temporarily comply with the tuition standards set by the City Council. (2) Compile statistics comparing school expenditures and teacher/staff compensation before and after the war, and submit them to the Education Bureau. The City Government will submit a request for reconsideration to the City Council, which will reconvene soon, based on the facts. This is a reasonable path. (3) Remove the one percent of bad actors to demonstrate that private schools are solely for the service of society and the people. A committee should be organized by principals and teachers/staff, and all school finances should be made public. If the above three methods are implemented, the stalemate can be broken, parents can understand, society can sympathize, the democratic cause can be protected, and a stable solution can be negotiated for everyone's livelihood. He hopes everyone will adopt these suggestions!

Director's Address

Director Gu then delivered a speech stating: The Education Bureau feels ashamed that the tuition standards proposed for discussion by the Council were misunderstood regarding the work of educators despite his explanation. The general mentality of society always points out the bad aspects of the education community. As the saying goes, "Conceal evil and promote good," but so far, good is concealed and evil is promoted. At that time, the tuition standards proposed by the Education Bureau were said by the principals of various primary and secondary schools to be only barely sustainable, but the discussion by the Council resulted in this outcome. Today, it is not a matter of increasing a few tens of thousands of yuan, but rather a matter of misunderstanding and lack of sympathy for private schools, which makes everyone feel uncomfortable psychologically. Many parents are willing to provide their children with a good education and do not care about tens of thousands of yuan. Moreover, last year, he contacted and negotiated with the City Bank and agreed to provide loans to students' parents, but very few parents applied. Although there are now a few councilors who are unsympathetic to private schools, they are not responsible to the outside world. He hopes that everyone will correct the points they criticize if they exist, and if not, encourage themselves. Moreover, during the discussion, 51 votes were in favor of increasing tuition, and 50 votes were against it, so everyone can be satisfied in terms of morality because the majority sympathize. Regarding the free quota for middle schools, the Council decided on 25%. There is a way to solve this problem, that is, each school board member will bear several quotas and solve it through fundraising. Now the City Government does not have the strength, but we can find ways to subsidize. Looking back at Shanghai's industry and commerce, which one is improving? It can be said that only the education sector is thriving, so there is still reason to be optimistic. He believes that the education sector will definitely gain the sympathy of society and the assistance of all parties in the near future.

Principals' Opinions

The principals attending the meeting spoke enthusiastically, stating that due to the economic downturn in the industrial and commercial sectors, the burden on parents should indeed be considered, but recalling the beginning of the last semester, teachers left their jobs one after another due to low salaries, and the principals could not find teachers. This pain can still be imagined. The circumstances of each private school are different, and the facts must be considered legally and reasonably, so rigid regulations cannot be made.

Resolutions

(1) After discussion and decision, in order to strive for the right of principals to decide tuition fees themselves, it was voted that the tuition standards for private schools for the second semester of the 36th year [1947] are as follows: Elementary school tuition: 120,000 yuan, miscellaneous fees: 40,000 yuan, totaling 160,000 yuan; Junior high school tuition: 170,000 yuan, miscellaneous fees: 80,000 yuan, totaling 250,000 yuan; Senior high school tuition: 220,000 yuan, miscellaneous fees: 80,000 yuan, totaling 300,000 yuan. This resolution will be submitted to the City Government for record. The schools will charge according to these standards for this semester. The above tuition fees are all maximum amounts, and each school does not necessarily have to charge the maximum amount. (2) Regarding the free places, the City Council set the free quota at 20% and the half-price quota at 10%, totaling 25% full exemption. It was resolved to change the elementary school to 20% and the middle school to 15%, with the remaining amount subsidized by the Education Bureau. (3) Regarding the issue of financial transparency, the following implementation methods were resolved: (A) The accounting methods currently used by each school vary, and schools also differ in size, making it difficult to uniformly audit the finances using one format. It was resolved to hire two accountants to create two types of account books, A and B, based on the size of the school, for the use of private school accounting. (B) Regarding the verification of whether the finances of each school are used reasonably, it was resolved to notify the audit committees to be fully responsible. (C) The finances of each school will be reported to the school board at the end of the semester, and then disclosed in the regular publications issued by the board. (4) After discussing the case of the 500 million yuan subsidy for private schools set by the Education Bureau for the first semester of the 35th year [1946], which was passed by the City Council but has not yet been allocated, it was resolved to request the City Government to allocate it for student loans for impoverished students in this semester. (5) Regarding the 60 million yuan raised by the Education Loan Committee, about 40 million yuan has been allocated to teachers in various schools, leaving more than 20 million yuan. The director of the Loan Committee, Chen Ruhui, advocated depositing it in the Dacheng Bank, but the bank declared bankruptcy in December last year. The authorities are asked to investigate the issue of responsibility.

The British army occupied the midfield, controlling the time by 80%. Zhang Banglun, the Shanghai team's goalkeeper, who had won the audience's praise in recent days, did not know where the ball came from when the penalty kick was taken. Li Yichen, the Shanghai team captain, who was overweight and over the age limit, also did not participate.

Yesterday, the principals of private primary and secondary schools in this city held a meeting at Yucai Middle School to discuss tuition issues. (Photo by this newspaper)

### Dr. Ai Wei Arrived in Shanghai from Australia Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] Dr. Ai Wei was recommended last summer by the joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the Federation of Education and Academic Organizations. At the same time, he was selected by the Ministry of Education to go to Australia to attend the international conference of the New Education Fellowship. After the conference, he traveled to famous cities throughout Australia for six weeks, giving over twenty academic lectures, over ten general lectures, and three radio lectures. He returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that Professor Ai has written a detailed account of this education and academic conference in the style of travel notes. After returning to Nanjing and visiting the education authorities, it will be published.

### Zhengzhong & Commercial Press Publish University Textbooks Compiled by the Ministry

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing] After the Ministry of Education stipulated the course catalogs for various faculties and departments of universities years ago, it organized a university textbook committee to carry out the compilation of university textbooks. It then entered into contracts with Zhengzhong Bookstore and Commercial Press, stipulating that textbooks for the faculties of law, engineering, agriculture, and teacher training would be published by Zhengzhong Bookstore, and textbooks for the faculties of arts, science, medicine, and commerce would be published by Commercial Press. Previously in Chongqing, more than thirty types of these university textbooks were printed. All books adopted a royalty method, and royalties were paid in full after the book was published, regardless of the first or subsequent editions. Although the burden on the bookstores was relatively heavy, the benefits that the authors should enjoy could be adequately protected. Now the University Textbook Committee has returned to Nanjing and hired Professor Shen Gangbo of National Central University as a committee member and secretary. A large number of manuscripts will be submitted for printing in the coming days.

### The Thousand Wonders and Mysteries of the World's Capital

— Special Correspondent Wang Yizhi of This Newspaper

Paris, 10th [of month not specified], Airmail

Since Paris reconvened the peace conference in 1946, and with the publicity of "science, literature, and education," it can stand first among the major cities of the world, worthy of being the world's capital. There are more than ten things that contribute to this. To illustrate, one is the Capital of Jewels. In French, Joaillerie (jewelry or gem trade) shares the same origin as the French word Jole (joy) or the Portuguese word Joia (jewel). Western customs value fashion, novelty, and women's crowns, shoes, clothing, which are constantly changing. Thus, they cannot be stored for long nor used for a long time. Only gemstones and jewelry can endure and are valued for the skill of the craftsmen and the elegance of their form. Diplomats purchasing jewels invariably seek them in the large stores around Place Vendome in Paris. Upon returning to their respective capitals, they flaunt them as archetypical Parisian style. In the past, Vienna was known as Little Paris, and Viennese-style gems and fine crafts were also valued in the world. Two is the Capital of Fashion (La Mode). It has been over a year since the end of the European War. Although there are still cumbersome restrictions on buying cars in Paris with US dollars or Swiss francs, the source of gasoline has widened, and the number of cars traveling on the streets is increasing daily. Thus, women's clothing before 1946, due to the difficulty of going out and riding in cars, was simple and resistant to wind and rain. The latest fashions, because social engagements all involve riding in cars, follow the meaning of the idiom "adding flowers to brocade," and are often seen with large floral decorations. The hats worn are adorned with tall, elegant feathers, and the colors all strive to be light and bright. A certain pink color that is currently popular in the Paris market is a new invention of the fashion industry. Three is the Capital of Perfumes (Parfums). Grasse perfume factories in southern France extract the fragrances of flowers from various countries, permeating them into fat, sealing them tightly for ten years without a slight release, and then extracting the fragrance to create the most famous and best-selling perfumes. The quality and variety of French perfumes are unmatched in the world. New perfumes currently on the market, such as Jndiscret (Indiscreet) perfume, are meant to be strongly fragrant. The French usually call a light and indistinct fragrance a "restrained fragrance" (parfum discret), so Indiscreet is the opposite of discreet. Perfumes such as Mystere (Mystery) and Vertige (Vertigo) are all meant to describe the novelty of the fragrance. Perfumes like Nuit de Longchamp (Longchamp Night) refer to Longchamp, a famous racetrack in Paris, which is also a place for nighttime dances and entertainment, so those who see the name can understand its meaning and imagine the prosperous atmosphere of Paris. The fragrance of Cuir de Russie (Russian Leather) is commonly used by men, while Quelques fleurs (A Few Flowers), which is obviously exclusively for women, is its opposite. Four is the Capital of Antiques. Antiques, referring to interior furnishings, should mainly consist of valuable old wooden furniture, accompanied by old paintings. Paris was not bombed during the war, so sales of old paintings and old wooden furniture are excellent. During the war, connoisseurs collecting old wooden furniture preferred items from the 18th century, starting from 1700 to 1800 (similar to objects from the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong reigns of the early Qing Dynasty). After the war, the aforementioned objects were difficult to obtain, so social customs changed and people competed to search for objects from the following hundred years, such as the "Napoleon III style" and the "Sarah Bernhardt style" from the late 19th century. Bernhardt was a Jewish French actress who died twenty-five years ago, and whose fame and glory were no less than those of great generals and wise kings. Today, Western art history highlights this famous woman, and her name marks an era, comparing her to emperors such as Napoleon III, Jiaqing, and Tongzhi. How fortunate this woman is to have been born in France, a country that respects artists, and to rival Xi Shi and Wang Zhaojun of our Eastern lands. Five is the Capital of Dance. New dances in Paris include Lac Cyrnes (Swan Lake) and Le Spectre de la Rose (The Specter of the Rose), both of which are meant to describe the emotions of dance and are different from social dances, considered "artistic dances." Those who are skilled often display their talents on stage. There are also dances such as Fire Dance, Desire Dance, and Amour Dance (Danse de 1'Amoru). Six is the Capital of New Art. Paris is known for new artistic paintings (an example is attached), which knowledgeable people often find difficult to appreciate. Being unaccustomed to it is one reason. At the same time, Paris can be the world's capital because of its unique strengths, such as exhibitions, concert halls, theaters, movies, circuses, puppet shows seen by the roadside, delicacies, fine wines, and rare ancient books that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Paris has them all. Great is Paris, lovable is today's Paris.

The train passes through the Great Salt Lake (report from special correspondent Mao Shuqing)

### Crossing North America: A 10,000-Li Journey in Five Days and Nights (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent to This Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing

Deep into the Rocky Mountains

California, 13th (by airmail)

The second day after the New Year, the reporter Maurice of the Telegraph wanted to take a vacation on both coasts and I accompanied him. In haste, I left New York.

From New York to San Francisco, over three thousand two hundred miles, is equivalent to going from Shanghai to Xinjiang. Before the construction of the railway, Americans of the previous generation, relying on their enthusiasm and courage, dragged heavy wooden carts and arduously developed this American continent, which was considered mysterious.

Taking the Pullman Train Instead of a Cheaper Airplane

The transcontinental railway of America was not built until after the Civil War, less than eighty years ago.

The fastest train takes three nights and four days. Therefore, after the development of the civil aviation industry, many wealthy merchants, or prominent military and political figures, and even those with slightly less straitened circumstances, have switched to taking airplanes. The air ticket costs 118 US dollars, plus transportation tax, which is still cheaper than a full-journey "sleeper car ticket." The flight time is less than twenty hours.

However, when winter comes, many people are still willing to take the train. Last month, a plane departing from New York crashed in Nevada two hours before arriving in San Francisco. Like the plane crash in Shanghai, all the passengers perished, except for a three-year-old child, who survived unscathed.

Therefore, I also decided to take the train.

I took the "Pullman" train to Chicago and stayed in Chicago for a day. Chicago has snowdrifts over a foot deep, which is even more spectacular than the "silver world" of New York State. A friend's private car was stuck in the snow, and it took seven black laborers to push it out. At night, walking on Lake Michigan, the blood seemed unable to circulate. Experienced Americans in Chicago treat winter as their season for hibernation. They huddle around the stove waiting for summer; "Summer belongs to us! Doesn't it? Soon it will be spring, and after spring, won't it be summer?"

Half a year ago, I came here, and it was Chicago's golden season. The young men and women who usually floated on the lake, and the thousands of people who usually enjoyed the green grass, are now nowhere to be seen! Desolate, lonely, and bleak, winter is the end of Chicago!

I rushed to the Northwest Station in the piercing wind. The "Challenger" train, which departed at ten o'clock in the evening, went directly to San Francisco. Around nine o'clock, the iron gate outside the station was already crowded with people, mostly GIs whose Christmas holidays had expired. They were rushing back to the barracks in San Francisco, and a small part of them were going to embark on ships to Japan and China.

The station was filled with disorderly noise, irregular military songs, mixed with loud shouts and roars. In the ten minutes before the train departed, the scramble was so fierce that it could not be seen even in the most "free" China and France. An old lady broke her arm in the crush and fell to the ground groaning. A little girl had the "handle" of her suitcase squeezed off. Unsophisticated "country folk" choked back tears, but those brave "strong men" still shouted and laughed wildly.

I remembered what a certain congressman said in Congress a month ago: "A long-term conscription system will weaken the quality of American soldiers and further reduce the moral standards of American citizens"!

I told him that I had stayed in Switzerland for a week, and he happily compared it to me: "In the states of Nevada, Utah, and Colorado, there are many small towns in mountain valleys, with green mountains and clear waters, and skiing and ice skating in winter, just like Lausanne, Locarno, Bern, and Geneva in Switzerland."

In reality, the Rocky Mountains are not as ideally undulating as one might think. An old man of Greek origin told me: "The Rocky Mountains cannot be compared to the Alps or the Himalayas at all." The United States itself has more plains than mountains. Although the land area is similar to that of China, according to my rough estimate, the arable land in the United States is more than twice that of China. In Iowa and Nebraska, many very fertile black soil areas are still left uncultivated.

Along the way, Wyoming is considered the poorest state, an endless semi-desert grassland where many herds of cattle and sheep are looking for pasture. An army officer said: Wyoming is very similar to Arizona, Arizona is an arid desert area, and Wyoming is a semi-desert area. He said: "A long time ago, in a place in Wyoming, a farmer threw a cigarette butt on the ground, and suddenly, the wilderness burst into flames, a lone wildfire that burned crimson in the sky for thirty-five years."

This is not a myth. Later, geologists discovered oil deposits there.

Trendy Things in the "Rocky Mountain Empire"

Entering the state of Utah from Wyoming means stepping into the Rocky Mountain region. Local residents have a special name for themselves: they call themselves the "Rocky Mountain Empire." On the train, I bought a newspaper from the state of Colorado, which contained a large "Notice from This Newspaper," roughly saying: "In order to enable readers in the Rocky Mountain Empire to understand the changes in American women's clothing in 1947, this newspaper has specially dispatched female reporter Miss Krings to be stationed in New York all the time, providing weekly reports on New York fashion."

Unfortunately, I did not meet any "subjects" from the Rocky Mountain Empire on the train. I have no way of knowing what differences there are between their current clothing and that of New York and Chicago.

The Rocky Mountains stretch from Canada to Mexico, extending north and south. There is a gap near Ogden, which the railway used for construction purposes. If this gap is equivalent to the "Hexi Corridor" in Gansu Province, China, then the city of Ogden is equivalent to the Jiayuguan of the United States. Ogden Railway Station has a slightly Japanese-style architecture, with Chinese-style black tiles on the roof. There are a few large characters on the station: "Gateway to the American West."

### Western Journey: The Railway Belongs to Four Companies

On the "Challenger" train, I sat for four days and nights, traversing three-quarters of the North American continent, passing through the fertile agricultural areas of Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska, as well as the semi-desert arid grasslands of Wyoming, and crossing the spine of the United States, the Rocky Mountains, as well as the states of Utah and Nevada where the Rocky Mountains are located, finally arriving at the "Golden Homeland" of California on the West Coast.

If New York is compared to Shanghai, China, Chicago should be Wuhan, China. To build a railway from Wuhan to Tacheng in Xinjiang, one must pass through the agricultural areas of Henan and Shaanxi, the grasslands of northwestern Gansu, and finally enter "China's California" - Xinjiang Province. (Note: Time magazine has referred to Xinjiang as China's California several times).

All the railways in the United States are privately owned (with only one exception). The ownership of the main lines crossing North America is divided among four companies: the section from New York to Chicago belongs to the New York Central Railroad Company; the section from Chicago to Omaha (at the junction of Iowa and Nebraska) belongs to the "Northwestern Railroad Company"; the section from Omaha to Ogden, Utah, is jointly operated by several Pacific railroad companies, who have specially established an organization called the "Union Pacific Railroad Company"; and the section from Ogden to San Francisco belongs purely to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company.

### The Gateway to the Great West: Ogden City

The train stopped at Ogden Station for several hours. I toured the entire city of Ogden. The streets and buildings are just like those in Lausanne. Outside the city, in the distance, one can see the folded peaks of the Rocky Mountains and the white snow that never melts on the mountaintops.

The city is full of small shops selling souvenirs, specially prepared for passing travelers. There are many Japanese people, selling small toys and the like. I chatted a lot in a Japanese shop. The owner's name is Nakamura. His tall son interrupted and said, "Please don't talk to us about Japan, okay? Because we are all American citizens now!"

They said that Ogden has many tourists because travelers from Los Angeles, Seattle, and San Francisco all have to pass through Ogden before going to Chicago, Boston, or New York.

### The Train Crosses the Great Salt Lake: The Journey Takes Fifty-Five Minutes

West of Ogden is the beautiful Great Salt Lake, and southwest of Ogden is the prosperous Salt Lake County. Salt Lake County was developed by an American named Mormons a hundred years ago (January 1847). He defeated the Red Indians and established Western social institutions. Today, Salt Lake City is a major metropolis with a population of 150,000, one of the largest in the "Rocky Mountain Empire."

The train to San Francisco does not pass through Salt Lake City, but it crosses the Great Salt Lake. At both ends of the Great Salt Lake, there are long embankments, and the railway tracks are built on the embankments. In the middle of the lake, there is a very long iron bridge, specially for trains to use. I calculated that the time crossing the lake took a total of fifty-five minutes. The construction of the embankments and the bridge is very impressive.

The Great Salt Lake produces huge amounts of salt, and the production situation is like that of Zigong, Sichuan. But in terms of the similarities between the geography of China and the United States, the Great Salt Lake is like Qinghai Lake in China. The lake water is dark blue, and there are no small boats with oars or sails on the lake.

Around the lake, one can see the undulating peaks of the Rocky Mountains in the distance. At five o'clock in the evening, a ray of sunset shines on the mountain light, snow shadows, and water colors, bringing a sense of natural beauty.

### Professor Guo Qilan Talks About Railway History: East-West Convergence and Traffic Failure

Before departing, I heard Professor Guo Qilan of New York University talk a bit about American transportation, especially the history of American railway construction. This professor has written several books on the history of American economic construction, and in each book, his conclusion is: "The economic prosperity enjoyed by the United States today can be said to be entirely due to the foresight of the previous generation, that is, the large-scale railway construction between the 1870s and 1880s."

According to Professor Guo Qilan, famous railway entrepreneurs of the time all intended to build a railway from the Atlantic coast across to the Pacific coast, but: first, they did not have enough financial resources, and second, it was difficult to construct through the Rocky Mountains. But: Why was it finally completed in the end? That was entirely due to government assistance. The government issued bonds, sparing no effort to help these emerging Pacific railway companies. The federal government used unconditional sacrifices to reward private enterprises that contributed to the country.

Professor Guo also said: "At that time, the instruments and materials were simple, and the talents of the engineers were limited, but in order to open the line as soon as possible, it was decided to rush to construction from both the east and west ends at the same time, so as to converge in the middle and open the line. But, alas, when it was built to the middle, it could not be connected, because the maps were inaccurate, and the engineers' designs were too hasty"!

This railway has been renovated several times in the past seventy years. I have no way of knowing, but based on my observation along the way, I feel that it is still extremely simple. The sleepers are all laid flat on the ground, without the raised "earthwork projects" like the Jinghu and Huhangyong lines. In the severe winter, the white snow adds a lot of difficulty to the driving.

### Silver World: A Chorus of "Cold"

The three thousand plus miles of the North American continent are all a silver world. Compared to the whole United States, the Midwest lakeside states are the coldest. On the dining car, I said: "Chicago is the coldest." An old man interjected: "Wisconsin is even colder than Chicago." Another old lady chimed in: "What is Wisconsin? Do you know how thick the snow is in Minnesota?"

An old man of Greek origin, Kostkoless, sitting next to me, gently told me: "Don't argue with her. What's so great about Minnesota being cold? Go to Ogden and look at the snow in the Rocky Mountains! It snows there all year round, just like Switzerland!"

### The Premier Rice Market: Wuhu

— Special Correspondent Yu Ning Po of This Newspaper

Wuhu Dispatch, 16th

Wuhu, located more than forty miles upstream from Nanjing, is the largest commercial port near the capital and the premier rice market in China.  It occupies a vital position in the Yangtze River waterway transportation, and in land transportation, it has the Jiangpu Railway, which connects with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Before the war, a passenger train left Shanghai North Station every morning, directly reaching Wuhu. The nearby Chaohu irrigation area and the Qingyi River basin are highly productive in rice. Most of the grain needed annually in places like Guangde, Chao County, Xuancheng, and Ningguo is supplied from here, earning it the name "Wuhu Rice."

A Glimpse of the Rice Market   The annual rice production in the various counties of southern Anhui, after supplying the local population's food needs, still has a surplus of six to ten million shi. Most of this surplus is exported through Wuhu. The rice sold is exchanged for money to allow the villagers to pay taxes and to regulate the national food supply. Therefore, a large part of Wuhu's commerce and the entire economy of Anhui are based on Wuhu's rice market.

During the war and in the year after the recovery, the Wuhu rice market experienced sluggish sales, and the accumulated malpractices and customary fees became even more aggravated than before, becoming the focus of general industrial and commercial criticism. Recently, there has been a proposal to move the rice market to Yuxikou in He County. The already tottering Wuhu rice market certainly cannot withstand the cold winds. It has caused rice merchants to feel confused, hesitant, and anxious, leading them to launch a joint movement to save it.  Amidst the attention and hopes of all parties regarding this issue, the reporter will provide a transparent view of the past situation of the Wuhu rice market and its current changing trends:

The Jiangnan rice market used to gather in Zhenjiang. If Jiangsu had a poor harvest, it would move to Wuhu; if Anhui had a poor harvest, it would move to Zhenjiang. The gathering of the rice market depended on the abundance or scarcity of the Jiangnan harvest.

Anhui is the richest rice-producing area among the southeastern provinces. Both banks of the river, extending over a thousand miles, are fertile plains. This plain area is irrigated by the Yangtze River and has the Wan River, Chaohu Lake, Shuiyang River, Qingyi River, and other waters networked within it, thus forming a vast paddy field area in central and southern Anhui, producing large quantities of rice.

(Above) The Gate of the Rocky Mountains - Mountain and Water Scenery on the Outskirts of Ogden City (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)

Quality of Wuhu Rice The purchasing and transporting industries are divided into four groups: Guangde, Chao County, Xuancheng, and Ningguo. The quality of the rice they purchase is mostly determined by the living habits of the local people. An analysis yields the following three categories: (A) Brown rice, needed by the Guangde and Chao County groups for re-milling. (B) High-grade white rice, needed by the Xuancheng and Tianjin groups for northern people's rice porridge, with a constant stream throughout the year. (C) Broken rice, most popular with the Ningbo group, commonly known as rice crumbs, used as a raw material for brewing alcohol due to its low price. In addition to the above three types, there are also special high-grade rice (produced in southern Wuhu), second-grade high-grade, medium-grade, high-grade (produced in Jiangbei), high-grade brown rice (produced in Nanling), and pounded ripe rice, among other varieties.

Regarding rice varieties, in 1934, the Wuhu County Government, under orders, organized a rice variety verification committee, hiring Zhang Jiazheng, director of the Wuhu Rice Improvement Farm, and Li Suanyu, professor at the Agricultural College, as members. Zhou Shilu, a technician specially dispatched by the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, provided guidance, collected excellent rice seeds, and instructed the production areas to follow and improve them.

Organization of Rice Groups Since Wuhu is a city based on rice, the exchange of agricultural products and trade relies on it, and all industries depend on its turnover. Due to the large scale of operations, organizational structures are indispensable. The same industry has the following organizations: (1) Rice Purchasing and Transporting Industry Association: These merchants specialize in purchasing rice in Wuhu and transporting it to other places. The Guangde, Chao County, Xuancheng, and Ningbo groups all collect and transport rice to Guangdong, Chaozhou, Yantai, Ningbo, Shandong, Zhejiang, Pingjin, and other places. The rice shops established by each group total more than twenty. (2) Rice Trading Industry Association: These buy rice from the countryside and resell it to the purchasing and transporting industry. There are more than forty such rice shops. (3) Machine Rice Milling Industry Association: These process the brown rice transported to Wuhu from the countryside into milled rice or rent storage space to rice shops and rice trading companies. There are eight or nine companies. (4) Rice Hulling Workshop Association: These are old-style rice hulling workshops that specialize in hulling rice for a fee. There are forty such workshops. (5) Miscellaneous Grain and Rice Shop Association: Their business nature is to specialize in selling rice for the daily consumption of the city's residents, so they are also known as small markets. The above belongs to the merchants' organization.

The workers' organization also has the following five types: (1) Sail Transport Industry: This industry is responsible for transportation. All rice coming to Wuhu from the countryside must be loaded onto their sailboats. In addition to the considerable compensation they receive, they can also earn extra rice, resulting in substantial profits. (2) Measuring Industry: This industry is responsible for measuring rice. When a rice boat docks, after the shop and the company have completed the transaction, the rice shop hires workers from the measuring industry to measure the rice on the boat for packaging. In addition to the regular wage (measuring labor), there is also a "measuring allowance." (3) Bag Stitching Industry: This industry specializes in loading rice into bags and then stitching the openings with hemp skin for transportation. (4) Bag Carrying Industry: This industry specializes in carrying the completed rice bags into the warehouse or from the warehouse to the dock. (5) Dockworkers: These workers specialize in transporting rice bags to barges or lighters for transportation.

Extensive Sales Channels The destinations for Wuhu rice are extensive. Yantai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Dalian in North China; Guangzhou, Chaozhou, and Xiamen in the southeast; and Shanghai, Ningbo, and various places in northern Jiangsu in the east are all basic markets for consuming Wuhu rice. The Wuhu rice consumed in Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and Dalian is transported by merchants from the Yantai group. The rice sold in Shanghai and Ningbo is transported by the Ningbo group. The rice in Shantou and Xiamen is transported by the Chaozhou group, and the rice in Guangzhou is transported by merchants from the Guangdong group. The amount consumed in each place is the largest in Guangzhou, at three to four million shi per year. Yantai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yingkou, Dalian, and Longkou consume about one million shi per year. Ningbo consumes four to five hundred thousand shi per year. Shanghai, Tongzhou, Nanjing, and other places are mostly transported and sold directly by Anhui merchants.

Rice Market Transactions The annual sales of Wuhu rice, amounting to several million shi, cannot be considered a small amount in terms of quantity. This rice is accumulated from the countryside in small quantities. After the harvest, a portion of the grain goes to the landlord's warehouse, and another portion belongs to the farmers themselves. The landlord can hoard the grain and sell it when the time is right. The farmers, compelled by the need to repay loans for fertilizers, seeds, cattle rent, wages, and other expenses incurred during the busy farming season, have no choice but to sell a portion or all of their rice to repay the debts that are due. Every year, after the early and late rice harvests, the rice that cannot be stored is carried by manpower, transported by wheelbarrows, or transported to towns and cities in small boats and sold to rice hulling workshops, grain shops, and rice dealers in towns and cities, waiting for the rise and fall of the Wuhu market to determine the size of their purchases. The purchased rice is then loaded onto sailboats and transported to Wuhu.

After the rice boats from the surrounding villages arrive in Wuhu, the rice sellers stay in the rice shops. The rice shops contact the rice trading companies. The buyers and sellers do not need to meet to conduct transactions. All procedures are the responsibility of the rice trading companies. The sellers' accommodation is provided by the shops, and the buyers' accommodation is provided by the companies, free of charge. After the transaction is successful, both parties deduct commissions from the customers. The expenses deducted by the shops from the sellers include shop commission, return commission, labor fee, discount fee, return slips, labor fee, packaging fee, liquor fee, tobacco and alcohol money, discount, opening warehouse fee, liquor fee, etc. The expenses deducted by the companies from the buyers include education donation, warehouse rent, hemp skin fee, usage fee, insurance, stamp duty, etc.

Customers can pay for rice purchased in the large market every other day. Rice purchased in the small market must be paid for in cash. When purchasing rice from rice companies or rice shops, the customers bring the money and deposit it with the shop, which provides a receipt and assumes full responsibility. After the customers have purchased the rice, whether it is packaged or not, they only need the original shop to handle it temporarily stored in various warehouses. If the customers need money, the shops and warehouses can also provide loans, with the loan amount based on the amount of rice stored.

Heavy Malpractices

Heavy Malpractices   The Wuhu rice market has a long history of several decades. The total number of merchants and workers who depend on rice for their livelihoods is no less than seventy to eighty thousand. The long-standing malpractices are indeed unbreakable. The rice is produced in the countryside. After it is transported from the farmers' hands, the process is extremely complex, and the expenses are higher than in other ports. It is divided into two parts: industry and commerce. The buyers are the merchants who purchase and transport rice. The sellers are the rice shops. The rice processing industry includes rice milling workshops and rice hulling workshops. The retail merchants include miscellaneous grain shops, among others. Among the workers, there are five types: sail transport workers, measuring industry workers, bag stitching workers, bag carrying workers, and dockworkers. These workers not only receive wages but also engage in illegal malpractices. For example, the boatmen add sand and water to the rice to increase its weight, which is the biggest cause of rice spoilage. In addition, the measuring allowance and bag stitching also have tricks. The dockworkers use a pointed tube to leak rice without revealing any flaws. Besides, there are extra odd jobs, local security, gangsters, beggars, and helpless widows who all have expenses, and the amount of expenses per day is very large, which makes the rice merchants feel headache and criticized. Although they have repeatedly requested the authorities to ban them, it is actually impossible to eliminate them.

New Opportunity   In the year since the recovery, the sales channels of the Wuhu rice market have changed abnormally, like a reversed magnetic needle, from south to north, from Hunan and Guangdong to Tianjin and Qingdao. This is an unprecedented phenomenon. This phenomenon is certainly related to changes in time and situation because the large army stationed in the northern country consists of Jiangnan rice eaters. Therefore, military rice is transported to the north in a constant stream, but the actual sales market in Tianjin is limited. Good times do not last long, and they will soon fade away. In addition, the price of rice in the north has been falling like running water. In the second half of last November, the rice transported from Wuhu to Tianjin was affected by the falling price of rice, causing all rice merchants to return empty-handed. The Wuhu rice, which was about to be revived, suffered this blow, presenting a gloomy picture.

Last month, people from the Chao Lake basin - Lu and other seven counties advocated moving the Wuhu rice market to Yuxikou in He County. Although this rumor lacks objective conditions and is unlikely to succeed, if it unfortunately comes true, the Wuhu rice market will inevitably be diminished. The reason why it suffered the attack of moving the market is that the long-standing fees and malpractices have become the target of criticism.

In the spring and summer of last year, the industry and commerce sides almost turned red in the face for the sake of eliminating malpractices and reducing expenses. They maintained their position for half a year but failed to resolve the issue. They watched the peak sales season of September and October pass lightly. During this period, Wuhu rice only sold more than 300,000 packages to Tianjin. All the people in Anhui who calculated to recover the Wuhu rice market believed that without eliminating the malpractices and fees, the Wuhu rice market would have no hope of recovery. Therefore, rice industry people and Wuhu business community launched a campaign to reduce fees and attract customers last month. Representatives of rice merchants from various industries gathered in the Chamber of Commerce and voluntarily reduced fees by 30%, simplified transaction procedures, and urgently tried to save the situation.

In the two months when Wuhu rice suffered misfortune, it happened that the Wuhu branch of the Agricultural Bank was ordered to purchase rice in Wuhu, transporting in large quantities to the production area without restriction, which led to Wuhu rice market being in a situation of no external source and internal difficulties. Fortunately, the meeting ended satisfactorily and decided to telegraph the Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the County Assembly, County Government, Sixth District Commissioner's Office, Four-Union Headquarters, and the Central Agricultural Bank. Regarding the improvement of the Wuhu rice market, such as the reduction of rice shop commissions, the original commissions will be reduced by 30% from now on and announced for implementation, so as to avoid excuses from all parties. According to the current rules, calculating the rice price at 40,000 yuan per shi, the shop commission is six points, totaling 2,400 yuan, reduced by three points, totaling 727 yuan, which is more than two-thirds less than before. Other malpractices and fees are, of course, also subject to elimination. At a minimum, there is a possibility of gradual elimination. In this way, the rice merchants deeply feel that the shackles of heavy burdens have been relieved, and their psychology feels lighter because the merchants' trade is first in reducing costs, and moving the market to other places and selling directly are all hoping to reduce costs. Now that the existing market can eliminate the accumulated habits that are hated by everyone, why would the rice merchants not be happy to choose this over that? The trend of the Wuhu rice market in the future will really be "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and you doubt there is no road, a willow is dark and the flowers are bright again" and "when things reach the extreme, they will reverse, or is it that the Wuhu rice market will recover from the extreme"?

### Lingering Years in Guilin: A Brief Account of Stinky Rice Noodles

— Liang Xiaozhong, Correspondent for This Newspaper in Guilin

Guilin Dispatch, December 30th

Someone suggested: forcing the relief sub-office colleagues to try stinky rice for a month, fearing that this would inevitably involve a bit of "emotional involvement," it is truly: "stinky rice should only be eaten by refugees, how can the sub-office get a taste of it!"

The transformations in Guangxi from its fall to its recovery have been like a terrible nightmare. From the Great Exodus to the Great Famine, and then from the Great Famine to the Great Exploitation, it has been left completely devastated, with not a single intact tile in any home. Though today’s Guilin is moving towards prosperity, the magnificent Cross Street Square, where the people fought tooth and nail but failed to open two years ago, is now easily completed. New buildings, row upon row, are appearing before the world. The provincial government is also working on reclaiming the old site within the Imperial City. Everything seems so rushed, one cannot help but fantasize with the notion that "If winter is here, can spring be far behind?" But who will bother digging out those who are forever mired in this harsh winter? Yes, Guangxi’s construction is progressing, and we need not gild the lily, just as we need not cover up the signs of decline. From calm observation over the years, I always feel that Guangxi’s popular sentiment is progressive and willing to work hard. On the other hand, one also senses that the people of Guangxi are constantly preparing some kind of resistance to backward politics. At first glance, it may seem a bit abstract, but it is, in fact, a rather concrete observation. To govern does not require much talk, and to observe politics does not require much talk. The people need spring so desperately!

In the tranquil atmosphere of street leaflets, there are always small storms that arouse people's interest, allowing a glimpse into the inner workings of officialdom, often revealing a part of the whole. For instance, half a month ago, the streets and alleys were plastered with a leaflet accusing a newly appointed bureau chief of using connections to buy his position. It also implicated the speaker of the provincial assembly, who was supposed to be the voice of the people. The leaflet listed how much the bureau chief spent, how much so-and-so received, as if counting treasures, making it hard to disbelieve, and even harder not to sigh! It is precisely for this reason that I admire Guangxi's political democracy...

Getting Back the Investment Recently, the provincial government announced a list of over forty heads of county tax collection offices. One of them told the reporter, "I don't expect to make any money, just to get back my investment." The implication was bewildering at first, almost making me think I had misheard. But after careful consideration, I suddenly understood. Doing things is one thing, and "being a person" is another. When one cannot have both fish and bear's paw, who would not give up the fish for the bear's paw? Therefore, doing things and being a person are "no big deal." As long as one can put in the investment, one can generate profit on top of that, and that's all there is to it!

New Tricks The one who loves to play fresh and foolish tricks the most, many people would unanimously nominate "none other than the Relief Sub-Office." Muddled to the extreme, and rotten to the core! Here, there is no personal prejudice on the part of the author; it is the unanimous view of the people of Guangxi. Facts are facts, and a flowery work report cannot stand if the facts are brought out.

The recent "broken rice case" that caused a sensation in Guilin is another good show put on by the Relief Sub-Office. On the second of this month, the Sub-Office transported fifty tons of "Japanese rice" to Guilin. It allocated thirty tons to the Municipal Labor Relief Committee for the implementation of "labor relief." The people were delighted when they heard the news and were almost ready to sing and dance. But when they opened the rice bags, they wondered if the Relief Sub-Office was afraid that the refugees would not digest whole grains, or if they had mistaken white rice for flour? Thirty tons were all stinky and moldy "rice flour!" Checking the other twenty tons, they were also a mess. How could they be cooked, how could they be eaten? The Labor Relief Committee was puzzled and simply returned the shipment, politely declining. The Relief Sub-Office's storage and transportation station saw that things were not going well and, perhaps because it had something on its mind (it is generally estimated that if good rice were used for a "bait and switch," fifty tons could yield a net profit of twenty million yuan), or perhaps because it knew something, simply transported the rice away, planning to sell it elsewhere.

Thorough Investigation This incident immediately aroused public outrage. The Labor Relief Committee immediately asked the police to guard the storage station's warehouse. However, the storage and transportation station was sometimes "wise and anticipated the problem before it arose" and had already moved all the rice away. This caused a public uproar, with everyone demanding a thorough investigation to see if the refugees should be eating stinky rice flour of unknown origin! All the newspapers in Guilin mobilized to attack the issue, determined to get to the bottom of it. Various government agencies also sent staff to inspect the warehouse, and they brought back a bag of stinky rice with the official ruling: "It is already rotten, as broken as chaff, and unfit for consumption." The High Court also sent staff to investigate, preparing to file charges. Heads of relevant agencies visited Chairman Huang, who expressed his concern... A series of cannons frightened the Relief Sub-Office. As a result, there were repeated calls for a "thorough investigation!" Who knows, the investigation may end with "there was a reason, but no evidence was found," lightly dismissed without resolution. Someone suggested forcing the colleagues of the Relief Sub-Office to try the stinky rice for a month, but this would probably lead to "emotional involvement." It is precisely: "Stinky rice should only be eaten by refugees, how can the Relief Sub-Office get a taste of it!"

Reducing Loan Quotas The people's view of relief work is simply that it is "a boring farce." For example, when distributing winter relief supplies, some people received a glove, and some people received a rag. How could they not be annoyed and amused!

To return to the topic, what can bring joy to the people is not a nondescript relief effort, but the news that the central government has reduced Guangxi's borrowing quota by 500,000 dan, the most fortunate gain from countless requests. In addition, it is said that after the counties report the actual disaster situation in detail, the tax and purchase quotas may be reduced accordingly. When the news came, everyone smiled and said "Amitabha." The wise central government saw the suffering in the hearts of the people of Guangxi, and the people of Guangxi wept for joy!

### Ambassador Stevenson in Guangzhou

— Liang Feng, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Guangzhou

In recent months, so many unfortunate incidents have occurred one after another between Guangdong and Hong Kong that the people of Guangzhou cannot suppress their sad and indignant emotions. This bad atmosphere has greatly hindered the prospects of Sino-British friendship. Although British Ambassador Sir Stevenson's visit to Guangzhou this time is in a professional capacity to visit the Guangdong provincial authorities and inspect the British community, his arrival will be enough to ease this bad atmosphere.

Answering Five Questions at the Reception for Southern Journalists

During his visit to the south, in addition to official visits to the military and political authorities here and giving lectures at Sun Yat-sen University and Lingnan University, the British ambassador also hosted a reception for a group of journalists. At the reception, the ambassador answered some questions raised by the journalists: (1) His opinion on the recent Wang Shuixiang and Zhang Tianxiang cases in Hong Kong, (2) The progress of the Sino-British trade agreement, (3) His views on the current commercial situation in China, (4) The difficulty for overseas Chinese in Burma to enter the country, and (5) Whether the United Kingdom will participate in the mediation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

Among these questions, the one that the general public here is most concerned about is, of course, the Wang Shuixiang and Zhang Tianxiang cases, but in the eyes of the ambassador, they are not as serious as we see them. He said that these are just small things, and it is inevitable that such things will happen in Hong Kong, which has a population of more than two million. The British government has already provided considerable compensation to the relatives of the deceased in the Wang case, and the Hong Kong government has also consulted with the Guangzhou authorities on the Zhang case, but has not yet received a reply. He emphasized that the spirit of British law requires substantial evidence before a defendant can be convicted, so it takes more time for thoroughness, which is the biggest reason why it cannot be resolved quickly. He also said that the news media must report these events truthfully and not deliberately exaggerate them to promote Sino-British friendship between Hong Kong and Guangdong. The ambassador may think that the news media here is "deliberately exaggerating" and ignores the fact that all of this is the opinion of our general public and the most truthful reporting of the news media.

Sino-British Trade Agreement to Be Signed Based on Reciprocity

Since the signing of the Sino-American trade agreement, the Sino-British trade agreement is also worthy of everyone's attention. The British ambassador said that the draft agreement was sent to the Chinese government in June last year. In November, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added China's opinions to the draft agreement, which was forwarded by the ambassador to the British government for study. It is believed that it will be signed soon. This trade agreement is based on the international reciprocal trade agreement. It is estimated that the United Kingdom will also receive the same benefits as the United States. If the conditions proposed by the United Kingdom are not included in the US trade agreement, the United States can also request it in the future according to the regulations. Conversely, China can also request it from the United States. The ambassador also said that China and the United Kingdom may also sign an aviation treaty based on reciprocal relations.

Transportation, Monetary System, and Politics Affect Business Development

Regarding the current dismal situation of Chinese business, the ambassador's view is that the main problems are the difficulty of transportation in China and the instability of the monetary system. At the same time, if China's political problems are not resolved, business cannot develop. However, the ambassador is still very optimistic about China's future. He believes that China's political problems can certainly be resolved. Here, someone mentioned the question of whether the United Kingdom will participate in mediating the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The ambassador said that the United Kingdom has not considered it. He believes that Chinese affairs should still be resolved by the Chinese themselves. If foreigners can help, then Ambassador Stuart is the most suitable candidate.

The ambassador also admitted frankly that British business is currently facing some difficulties because 80% of British industry was converted to wartime industry during the war. Now it will take two or three years to return to peacetime industry, so the United Kingdom is currently unable to supply China with what it needs. He hopes that the supply to China can be gradually increased in the future. The British business delegation's visit to China has shown the United Kingdom's concern for Chinese business. Their report will be completed, and it is believed that it will contribute to both China and the United Kingdom.

Chinese and Indian Residents Still Being Refused Entry by Burma

As for the Burmese government's refusal to allow overseas Chinese to return to Burma this time, the ambassador's answer was that the Burmese government is not refusing overseas Chinese to enter the country. The reason is that Burma was devastated after its fall, and everything has not yet recovered. Therefore, the Burmese government is unwilling to allow a large number of non-Burmese people to enter unless it can be guaranteed that they are self-sufficient. Because 12,000 overseas Chinese are still stranded in Guangzhou, but this is not only the case for overseas Chinese, but also for 400,000 Indians who want to enter Burma, and there is no way. The ambassador also said that he had consulted with the representatives of the Hong Kong United General Association and asked them to find a way to send them away.

Finally, the ambassador talked about the issue of Sino-British cultural exchange. He said that the British Council will send representatives to Guangdong in the future to maintain regular contact with our cultural authorities.

### Review of Mr. Zhan Wenhu's New Book "Newspaper Management and Administration"

— Shao Derun

Although running a newspaper is a well-known endeavor in China, few understand how to manage and develop such an enterprise. Everyone is content with knowing *what* to do, without seeking to understand *why*. Consequently, success is often accidental, while failures are numerous. This is entirely due to a failure to learn from the experience of predecessors. For those who wish to start a newspaper but are unsure of how to do so effectively, and for those who want to enter the newspaper industry but don't know where to begin, I would like to sincerely recommend reading Mr. Zhan Wenhu's "Newspaper Management and Administration."

This is a highly practical book. For those with the ambition to join the newspaper industry, this book provides encouraging inspiration. For those already engaged in the industry, this book offers powerful guidance. In the first chapter, "Background of Experience," the author cites the stories of many newspaper people, offering encouragement for continuous effort. Stone's policy of honesty, Nelson's dedication, and the arduous struggles of Ochs and Lord Northcliffe all serve as valuable "stones from other hills." In the second chapter, "Creating Your Own Enterprise," Mr. Zhan sincerely offers invaluable experience to those aspiring to work in the newspaper industry: (1) You must create a distinctive feature to achieve a "catching up from behind" impression, and (2) Cultivate your reputation with an honest attitude and a spirit of service. To illustrate these two points, he uses the story of the New York *Globe's* struggle as an example, demonstrating that a new newspaper willing to be original and sincerely serve the public can certainly find a way to succeed and achieve a position of catching up from behind.

The author insists that a newspaper must maintain a distinctive feature as its weapon to "stand out from the crowd." At the same time, he also argues that a newspaper should possess a courageous sense of justice to guide society toward the right path. He cites the New York *Globe's* clean food campaign and the *China-America Daily's* campaign against traitors as examples. These two movements had a tremendous impact on society, and these two newspapers also succeeded. Regarding other secrets of running a newspaper, the author points out "attracting readers" and "understanding readers." He believes that newspapers, in order to obtain more and newer information, should not hesitate to spend heavily on assigning reporters to work in various locations. He agrees with Mr. Chen Bosheng's advocacy of employing more reporters, believing that even if these people do not write a single word, as long as they are engaged in the work of gathering information, they are good. He also believes that the most important thing for a newspaper's managers is to understand their readers and value their interests and benefits. He quotes Mr. Stone, believing that "readers are more valuable than advertisers, and the status of readers is higher than that of advertisers." This opinion is still a valuable lesson in the current Chinese newspaper industry.

Starting with the third part of the book, "The Way of Organization," the author elaborates on "Principles of Distribution," "Newspaper Advertising," "Typesetting Problems," and "Financial Principles," offering many opinions. Although these chapters may seem a bit specialized to ordinary readers, the consistently engaging writing style and the down-to-earth and insightful views will keep you reading in one breath. For readers engaged in the news business, these chapters should be carefully pondered and studied in detail. For example, in the area of distribution, the book provides many specific and effective methods for organizing news vendors, strengthening promotion, and attracting readers. In the area of advertising, the book pays special attention to classified ads, and suggests many worthy-of-emulation methods, and also emphasizes the training of advertising staff, which is a problem neglected by newspapers across the country. Regarding "Typesetting Problems," the book also reviews many technical issues, with special insights into the arrangement of Chinese characters and the management of ink and paper. Although it may be just a few words, obtaining this experience can save a newspaper a lot of waste each year. "Financial Principles" is the last chapter, and also the most difficult to write. Few people in China study this issue, because almost all newspapers lose money. When losses occur, publishers try to make up for them by borrowing and patching together, without regard to the two words "financial management." Mr. Zhan has received materials from the Inland Daily Press Association of America for comparison and reference, establishing a designed budget for Chinese newspapers, stipulating some accounting items as a basis for Chinese newspaper operators to follow. Among them, the chapter "How to Deal with Emergency Situations" can provide valuable reference for many Chinese newspapers with no economic foundation. In short, this book is worth consulting for anyone interested in the news business, and it is worth reading for those who want to start a newspaper but are unsure of how to do so effectively, and for those who want to enter the newspaper industry but don't know where to begin.

### On Emotions

— Naya

William James, Translated by Tang Yue

The Commercial Press, First Edition, Year 35 of the Republic

Anyone who pays attention to psychology, whether in the fields of philosophy, sociology, or medicine, will know about James's "theory of emotion," right?

James's theory occupies an important position in the history of psychology. He prompted more research on emotions by later scholars, leading to greater progress. His fundamental standpoint still lies in James's theory.

"On Emotions," "On the Stream of Thought," and "On Habit" are the three most popular and historically valuable chapters in James's "Principles of Psychology." "On the Stream of Thought" has already been introduced in the publishing world. Now, I am introducing "On Emotions" to all readers.

Firstly: It provides precise explanations of emotions such as sadness, fear, hatred, and anger.

Secondly, it derives a question from the classification of emotions: How did any existing "expression" of anger or terror develop? This question concerns physiological mechanisms on one hand, and historical truth on the other. This question is difficult to answer, and the author provides various interpretations.

The author's explanation: First, it verifies the difficulty of this question in terms of experiments, and then considers various refutations. This consideration fully explains from all sides, and also clarifies the question.

As for "subtle emotions" and "crude emotions," many examples and explanations are also given regarding: joy, affection, ambition, indignation, and self-esteem, which are also expressed by feelings of emotional pleasure and pain.

"There is no brain center dedicated to emotions." It makes its own conclusions by comparing various fields of knowledge.

Differences in emotions between individuals. It also discusses various differences such as "spread excitation," "adaptation," "lingering," and "attendant."

Finally, it explains the origins of various emotions, explains its topic in more detail than before, and raises many questions, answering them. This allows readers to gain a deep understanding.

In short, James's writing is not "plainly stated." He cites opinions from all sides, merges them into one, and then makes a full and precise explanation.

The translator also made many annotations to help readers understand easily, making it easier to understand difficult places.

"On Emotions" is a book that everyone must read to cultivate their body and mind and understand the development of psychological emotions.

### Atlas of Chinese Climate

— Cheng Yifan

Drawn by Lu Wenfu, published by the Central Meteorological Bureau

Topography and climate are two major natural factors in the human living environment. Topographic maps and climate maps are essential reference materials for formulating all economic construction plans. Without these maps as a basis, the plans must be completely empty and impractical, and impossible to implement. China's topographic maps have been sufficient for application since the publication of the *Shenbao's* *New Map of China*, *New Provincial Maps*, and *Large Wall Maps*. However, there are still no complete and exquisite climate maps. In the past, although there were some scattered climate illustrations in the publications of the Meteorological Institute of the Academia Sinica, the Chinese Meteorological Society, and the Xujiahui Observatory, they were fragmented, and because too few records were collected, there were many unrealistic aspects, especially the maps published by the Xujiahui Observatory. Isotherms and isohyets often disregarded the influence of topography, crossing mountains and ridges, which did not conform to climatological principles. It goes without saying that it was difficult to rely on them. Until the recent publication of the Central Meteorological Bureau's *Atlas of Chinese Climate*, we finally have a relatively reliable climate map.

According to Mr. Lu Jiong's preface at the beginning of the collection, the records used in the map are entirely those collected by the Meteorological Institute of the Academia Sinica and the Central Meteorological Bureau over the years. Because the length and timing of records in various regions varied, they also underwent a series of sorting and correction work. The breadth of the collection and the precision of the drawing can be imagined. However, in China, where meteorological records are scarce, especially in the mountainous areas of the west, there are certainly many doubtful places. At the same time, because the printing is slightly poor and the proofreading is negligent, there are quite a few small errors. Moreover, each map does not have a single word of explanation, which is hoped that it can be corrected and supplemented in the reprint.

The entire collection contains a total of ninety-six maps—one to thirteen maps are surface pressure and wind direction maps for the whole year and each month. Fourteen to seventeen maps are cyclone frequency maps for the four seasons. Eighteen maps are the number of thunderstorm days for the whole year. These eighteen maps can roughly represent the outline of surface atmospheric circulation and atmospheric disturbance activity in the East Asian region. Although the relationship with practical applications is slightly less, it is an indispensable basic map in climatology. Isobars are spaced at two millimeters, and wind direction is indicated by arrows, which are clear. It is a pity that wind force is not indicated, and the quantitative aspect is unclear. If the length of the arrows could represent the wind force, it would be even more perfect. There are no upper-air current maps, so there is no way to see the whole picture of atmospheric circulation, which is a pity. However, it is thought that this is due to the lack of upper-air records, so we can only find ways to supplement it in the future.

The second part of the atlas is all about temperature. The quantity is heavy and it is quite complete. There are thirteen maps from 19 to 31 showing actual temperatures throughout the year and each month. Five maps from 32 to 36 showing sea level temperatures for January, April, July, October, and the whole year. Four maps from 37 to 41 showing annual diurnal range, continentality, and spring and autumn temperature differences. Two maps from 41 to 42 showing absolute temperatures. Three maps from 43 to 45 showing frost period. There are twenty-seven maps in total, a magnificent view. In terms of drawing, it is much more accurate than the temperature maps published in the past. The side-by-side arrangement of actual temperature maps and sea level temperature maps takes into account both climatological theoretical research and practical application, which is a major feature. The frost period map is very important for agriculture and deserves special mention.

The thirteen relative humidity maps for the whole year and each month from 46 to 58, the thirteen cloud cover maps for the whole year and each month from 59 to 71, the six sunshine maps for the whole year and each season from 72 to 77, and the fog and haze days maps from 78 to 79 form the third part of the atlas, totaling thirty-four maps. Humidity, cloud cover, and sunshine maps are important references for studying agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and medicine and health, while the distribution of fog and haze days is directly related to aviation and navigation. However, for application purposes, two more annual fog and haze days variation curve maps should be added to complete the whole picture.

The fourth part includes sixteen maps of rainfall, rainy season, rainy days, and variability, etc. The maps from 80 to 92 are rainfall distribution maps, drawn according to the whole year and each month, taking into account the influence of topography everywhere, which is quite ingenious. The isohyet interval is also very appropriate, the interval is a multiple of twenty-five, and the conversion to inches is very convenient. The rainy season map of 93 divides the country into thirteen regions according to the month in which the rainfall peak and sub-peak appear, which is concise and to the point. However, there seems to be only one map for the whole year for rainy days and rainfall variability maps, which is not enough. At least four seasonal maps should be added, because these two climate factors are very important in agriculture.

The fifth part is the Chinese climate zone map of 96 maps. Although there is only one map, it is a summary of the aforementioned 95 maps. The zoning seems to be based on the Koppen classification method and then further subdivided. Each zone is marked with the letter symbol of the Koppen classification. People who study climatology can of course know the climatic characteristics of each zone at a glance, but for the convenience of other people, detailed explanations should be added.

### Reading "A Nest of the Gentry"

— Du Ruo

In the summer of 1858, Turgenev, tired of touring Western Europe, returned to his country. The serf life under Alexander and Nicholas Russia was nakedly displayed in front of him; the complacent words of the frail and incompetent old new party members stimulated him; the memories of youth lost in middle age and the mood of the setting sun hurting him.

Thus, after four months of hard work, through his beautiful writing style, "A Nest of the Gentry" was produced. The strong atmosphere of French Romantic literature, Pushkin's poetic purity, Gogol's satire and abundance, combined with the author's own lyricism and melancholy, were tempered into a great work of gray and gloomy "legendary style."

This novel depicts its theme from the side, the unique thoughts of that era, the narrow nationalist view of Slavism, overcoming the symbol of truth, the great and loving humanism; this obviously violated the author's original intention. Turgenev, a stubborn Westernizer, should have extremely supported the latter, but loyal to the ideas of the times, he did not hesitate to let the former win.

Its content is roughly as follows:

Lavretsky, a progressive Russian landlord, went to Moscow to study after his father died? In the first two years of entering university, he only met one classmate, Mikhailovich.

One evening, Lavretsky met a girl, Warwara, in the theater and fell in love with her beauty. Finally, through Mikhailovich's introduction, they became acquainted, fell in love, and got married.

The happy newlyweds traveled around Germany and Switzerland and came to Paris. Warwara's artistic talent, beauty, and social skills made her a wonderful flower in Parisian high society, known as a stunning Russian beauty? Lavretsky himself buried himself in books. He originally planned to travel to Baden-Baden in Germany with his wife, but an unexpected accident overturned all his plans.

One day, Warwara was not at home, and Lavretsky accidentally found her infidelity to him in her private room; in a rage, he fled to Italy and hid himself in a small city. He learned from the newspaper that she had gone to Baden-Baden, and later learned that they had a daughter. Then, scandalous news came one after another, and Warwara became a "celebrity."

Four years of drifting life passed, and he returned to his homeland to cultivate the land, and went straight to his hometown to sort out his industry. And he visited a relative, his cousin Maria, and aunt Marfa, the second-generation widow of the Kalitin family, but he did not want to fall into love again, entangled and unable to extricate himself.

He fell in love with his cousin Lisa Veda, a pure, pious, and kind girl, the most perfect female type in Russia. His kindness and enthusiasm finally won the girl's heart. At the same time, there was a vulgar official, Panshin, a distorted Westerner, who was also pursuing Lisa by relying on Maria's favor. They were extremely incompatible and argued sharply. Because of the conceited tone of the vulgar official, she was disgusted, and his contempt for Russia hurt her heart; Lavretsky's defense of Russia further promoted her love for him. So, one night, in the Kalitin garden, they kissed each other, the first kiss, which was also the most decisive kiss.

Then misfortune came to his head again, his wife Warwara, who was rumored to be dead, suddenly arrived with their young daughter. Maria orchestrated a "broken mirror reunited," and he was forced to admit reconciliation with her, re-cohabiting, and forgiving her, entirely for the sake of their innocent child.

The next day, Sunday, in the morning, Lavretsky ran to the church and finally found Lisa after the Mass. She was satisfied that he had fulfilled the common obligation she had put forward, reconciling with his wife, and of course, guaranteed fulfillment. Another part that belonged to herself was the decision not to marry Panshin; at the same time, thinking that happiness was in the hands of God, she decided on "self-sacrifice" and said "farewell forever" to Lavretsky.

That winter, Warwara betrayed her husband again, captured Panshin, and moved to St. Petersburg. The following spring, news came that Lisa had veiled herself in the B Monastery, located in the most remote corner of Russia.

Eight years later, Lavretsky went to O City again in the spring and revisited the Kalitin family. Many of the former owners were dead, and what replaced them were joyful young people: those happy, fleeting memories that never returned threw him into a heavy sense of loss. Later, although he also visited the monastery where Lisa was hiding, and saw her, he could not catch a glimpse of her.

After reading this story, it can be seen that the author uses a plain and fruitless love as a context to fully express the perception of the heroes of the transitional era: giving the departing era a final gaze and mourning, and welcoming those new young people who are the drivers of the wheels of history.

Lavretsky was hit hard and fought back to cultivate the land. Shouldn't his strong and resilient Russian national character give us purely empty talkers a sharp warning!

Lisa is a devout religious believer. Her enthusiasm for religion surpasses everything in the world, even the highest inspiration between human sexes, love; withdrawing from the circle of happiness, her self-sacrifice fully expresses the spirit of Christ's love.

What about Warwara? Romantic things, art, literature, philosophy, and music have all become her tools of communication. Only in the vulgar Panshin does she have supreme, irresistible authority over him without any real responsibility.

"A Nest of the Gentry" is worthy of being called the crystallization of art.

Spring and Autumn

### Old Shoes

— Xiao Chuanwen

The old shoes have been placed in the corner of the house for more than half a year. They are with the dustpan, broom, and uncleaned garbage. The dust on the shoe surface is piled up very thickly. The straps are untied, and it is unknown whether a mouse has bitten off half of them, leaving only a very short section exposed on the edge of the shoe opening. Except for the thick, intact, and like-new rubber sole, which can still evoke memories of its past glory, the impression it gives is one of decline and fall, like an aging and faded prostitute who, in her lonely and desolate twilight years, has been unfortunately abandoned. The open shoe opening is even more like a lonely and helpless mouth, silently sighing.

Obviously, these old but not broken leather shoes have now completely lost their owner's favor.

So, in these lonely days, the old shoes can only comfort themselves by recalling the past.

It was in an old city on a plateau, known as the "Mountain City" because of its rugged and mountainous terrain. Among the famous mountain cities in the southwestern plateau provinces, this city can indeed be called a typical mountain city. Every three or five steps, there is either a large slope or a small slope. The houses and streets in the city are all built on the hillsides and at the foot of the mountains, following the uneven terrain. Therefore, people living in this city must have a pair of strong and agile feet and a spirit of enduring hardship. That is indeed true. The people who originally lived in this mountain city had already developed this kind of training due to generations of living there. As for the people who came from other places, in order to adapt to the environment, they were all influenced by this spirit of perseverance. Whether they were young masters and young ladies from the most pampered families or tycoons who were used to enjoying luxury, once they arrived in this city, they had to train their feet to be able to climb slopes and mountains. Perhaps it was because of this precious and unyielding spirit, which symbolized the resistance of the Chinese people against violent aggression, that this city became the heart of China's resistance against Japan.

Therefore, due to the needs of the people and the environment, a kind of sturdy and durable leather shoe that could withstand the threat of the rugged terrain of this mountain city came into being—these old shoes belonged to a pampered young lady with a noble status.

When China's War of Resistance was in full swing, this mountain city was gathering patriotic and steadfast people from all over the country. Every corner of the mountain city was filled with the passionate fighting spirit emanating from the hearts of these people. Because people were engaged in active resistance work, old shoes and their companions became the pets of the people of the mountain city at that time, striding proudly and actively on the slopes and streets.

At that time, the old shoes followed their owner from morning till night, running around the mountain city, because the owner was also one of the ardent patriots. On sunny days, the dust on the streets and slopes flew like fog, and people had to cover their noses to walk. The old shoes were covered in dust. On rainy days, the streets of the mountain city were really difficult to walk. The streets were full of deep mud. People relied on their strong legs and ran with great effort, covered in sweat. At this time, the old shoes and their companions could really show their skills. It was thanks to them that they could climb and run freely on those slippery and dirty mud roads. Therefore, although the old shoes looked a bit bulky and ugly, they were sturdy and durable, so they were happily worn by the people of the mountain city.

However, the old shoes' misfortune finally arrived.

Since the news of China's victory in the War of Resistance against Japan shook this mountain city like a thunderbolt, people, after a moment of excitement, returned to their respective homes. Soon, the old shoes followed their owner to Shanghai, a famous metropolis in China.

At that time, the old shoes and their owner were so excited that they almost shed tears.

However, before long, the old shoes, like many people who longed for victory, were disappointed. Once in Shanghai, they lost their owner's favor and were abandoned.

Replacing them was another favorite, a pair of bright red and brilliant glass slippers.

The new favorite was indeed beautiful, with a thin and light sole, and the shoe surface shimmering with dazzling brilliance, like wearing two flowers on the feet, adding a bit of beauty and liveliness to the owner. This was something the old shoes sighed was beyond their reach.

But the old shoes did not despair because of this. They still harbored a extravagant hope, perhaps a naive idea. They thought that although the glass slippers were more beautiful and attractive than themselves, they might not be as sturdy and durable as themselves. Perhaps that was their advantage. Once the owner discovered this advantage, perhaps they would change their mind. Therefore, the old shoes often comforted themselves with this, waiting patiently, day after day, always hoping that one day they would regain their past favor.

Every morning, when the owner wore the brand-new and beautiful glass slippers out the door, or when they came back from outside at night, the glass slippers always showed an arrogant look as they passed in front of the old shoes, emitting dazzling flashes and loud noises.

Although the old shoes regarded this arrogant attitude of the glass slippers as an insult and felt angry, they still tolerated it, pretending not to see it. But what made them feel most sad was seeing the owner's happy smile when wearing the glass slippers (which clearly showed how much they loved this new favorite), and they could no longer bear it. They sighed sadly and finally shed tears.

"Am I doomed to despair from now on?"

When the old shoes waited for their owner's favor in the corner of the house day after day, and were disappointed day after day, they sighed like this.

Then one day, the old shoes saw their owner hurrying out, and then hurrying back a little later, followed by a buyer of old goods. The owner didn't say much, took the old shoes out of the corner of the house, and threw them into the old goods dealer's basket.

The old shoes immediately knew what was about to happen, knowing that they were truly abandoned by their owner. They saw that there was no trace of pity on their owner's face, so they were angry, cursing, trying to struggle and resist, wanting to shout loudly, wanting to break free from the old goods dealer's hands.

When all efforts were in vain, the old shoes had no choice but to lie silently in the basket, entrusting their fate to the old goods dealer.

The old goods dealer arrived on the street, and the old shoes were suddenly awakened by the noise of the street. They opened their eyes and looked out from the basket. This time, they truly saw Shanghai: prosperous, lively, and new. It seemed that everything was different from their hometown mountain city. At least, they couldn't see so many glittering things on the streets of the mountain city. The old shoes were dazzled and couldn't even recognize what these glittering things were. They only saw that people's heads, bodies, hands, and feet were all shining brightly, dazzling the eyes. When the old shoes calmed down and looked carefully, they were greatly surprised. It turned out that glass slippers like the ones worn by their owner could be seen everywhere on the street. This was no different from encountering an enemy, and they were so angry that they almost wanted to roar.

Indeed, there were many things in the world that the old shoes' simple mind could not understand. Why were they abandoned by their owner once they arrived in Shanghai? Why did people change once they arrived in Shanghai? These questions lingered in the old shoes' mind, and they couldn't figure them out.

Later, the old shoes finally thought of some irrelevant things that seemed to answer those questions, but also seemed impossible. They thought that they couldn't smell the clean and fresh air of the mountain city in Shanghai, they couldn't see the boundless sky of the mountain city, and the wildflowers blooming everywhere. Because of these things, they began to dislike Shanghai for no reason and miss the mountain city. They loved that mountain city, loved the quietly flowing river there, loved the grassy slopes there, and even loved the cold fog in winter and the scorching sun in summer.

Now, lying in this cold basket, the old shoes cherished the soil brought from that mountain city that remained on their soles. This made them even more nostalgic for the past days. It was truly a dream, a distant dream!

### Idle Talk on Couplets

— Zhan Weng

Li She of Min County (Zongyan) was the grandson of Grand Scholar Shen Wen Su. When Wen Su was defending Guangxin, he went to Hekou to raise military funds. The Hong Yang army suddenly appeared. Lady Lin wrote a bloody letter to the Zhejiang General Rao Tingxuan for help, and held the seal by the stone next to the well, vowing to coexist with the city. Rao led his troops in the rain and lifted the siege. Forty years later, Li was appointed as the prefect of Guangxin and brought his mother, the Dowager Lady Shen, to the yamen. He built the Baojing Hall and inscribed a couplet: "Three hundred miles from Wuyi, pointing to the distant home mountains, welcoming the litter carriage, still the kind mother's teachings under the green lamp. Forty years after Grand Scholar Wen Su, temporarily holding the county seat, stroking the remaining steles, ashamed of having no extempore writing like my maternal grandson."

When Ni Bao Cen was defending Jingzhou, he wrote a couplet for the Yamen Hall: "Ask who has the talent of Yima, please try ten thousand words, absolutely not allowing an inch to be gained before the steps. I wish to advise each other to stop the pig-herding game, practice diligence in everything, and carefully value every second of the world." The first line is from Li Bai's letter to the governor of Jingzhou, and the second line is about Tao Kan's defense of Jingzhou. The local scenery is truly a wonderful saying.

### Arrived in Shanghai

— Jie Ding

The small steamer traveled all day and did not feel tired. Its speed in the Huangpu River was even faster, constantly hitting the waves of the river. Looking out from the ship's window, I saw planes with red and green lights taking off and landing at Longhua Airport; we passed by the American battleships, and the sailors were laughing; avoiding the river reefs with flashing red lights, rows of foreign buildings with bright square windows were receding; gradually I could see the big clock on the Jianghai Customs. Then we arrived at the corner of the Bund Park. It was a quiet winter night on the Bund. Next to it, the cars on the Waibaidu Bridge flashed back and forth like shuttles.

"Arrived," everyone stretched their tired bodies and hurriedly tidied up their belongings and changed into clothes for landing.

"We arrived at seven o'clock, this ship is considered fast." People said. I looked outside, and the clock on the Jianghai Customs was showing exactly seven o'clock.

Suddenly, the ship turned outwards, the engine room's motor had stopped temporarily, and the ship swayed drunkenly. Some people grabbed the window sills.

"What's wrong?"

"We can't get in, the ships are so crowded." The boatman on the ship said.

The boatman was poling and shouting, and the large wooden boats were slowly drifting outwards, the masts and ropes were in a chaotic mess.

"Hold on, hold on!" The boatman saw a wooden boat ramming sideways, quickly jumped over, held his own boat with both hands, and pushed his feet hard to push it away.

"Damn it, are you blind?"

"There are so many ships, how can you let it go?"

People on the ships were cursing each other, not knowing which ship it happened on.

I stuck my head out to take a look, it was really busy! Many people were scrambling to drag the poles and run on the ships. The entire Wusong River was full of wooden boats. The sailors on the wooden boats near the shore were eating under the lamplight as if nothing had happened.

With a "thump," a bamboo pole suddenly poked over, right on the window sill I was leaning on. I quickly pulled back my protruding body.

The ship was closer to the Bund Park. Under the round lights at the corner of the park, a man and a woman were embracing; two people wearing peaked caps were leaning on the iron railing watching the ships. The dark yellow river water was rushing against the collapsed stone embankment. Behind us were two more steamboats pushing our butts, the ding-dong bell rang, the motor stopped and started, the heavy sound of ships colliding, mixed with shouting, clamoring, bamboo poles, river water... The river surface was as noisy as the Joint Commercial Market in the middle of the day.

Trams, cars, and trucks on the Baidu Bridge rumbled brightly, "Du-ba!..." Various horns honked, "Woo!" The warships in the Huangpu River roared angrily.

One by one, large wooden boats, empty and full, people running, masts and planks in a mess, spewed out from the Suzhou Creek, slowly, endlessly.

A square landing craft rushed up from behind, the motor vibrated and rattled, "Woo woo" loudly, "Get out of the way, get out of the way!" The sailors on the boat shouted loudly. The wooden boats squeezed out a gap with great difficulty, the ships were even more chaotic, and the sound of collisions was even louder. The boat squeezed into the river, and the wooden boats closed in again, slowly poling and poling outwards endlessly.

The embracing couple in the Bund Park had already left, and there were three people wearing peaked caps, gesticulating as if they were just talking about something. The blood-red cigarette fire shone on the inky black figure. The round lights in the park never moved. The Broadway Building with its blocks of light squares stood tall in the dark sky, drawing an even darker scissor shadow. The Huangpu River had been made into a dark shadow by the wooden boats. The Suzhou Creek was still spewing out endlessly...

Finally, the boat in front moved, our boat also started its motor, and the river seemed to be a little looser. Looking at the clock on the Jianghai Customs, the long hand was still pointing at twelve, but the short hand had already reached nine. We could faintly hear the sound of the bell ringing, and a large string of steamboats and wooden boats followed behind our boat.

### Feeling Inspired on the First Day of the Dinghai Year

— Zhang Shizhao

In my declining years, I am still experiencing the Dinghai year again. When I first entered the Dongshu school, things were just like that. In that year, I learned poetry and knew the Great Odes, but now I am afraid of the boundless laws. A crude official is caught in the cycle of poverty and success, and is still confused about the past. Why should I cherish the rest of my life like this? I will change the connection and follow fate.

Note: The previous Dinghai year was the thirteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. The teacher first entered the school to receive books, and began to read poetry from the Wen Wang section of the Great Odes. The poetry classic was published in two volumes, and the second volume was the Odes and Hymns. One year later the second volume was finished, but the first volume, although not read, could be recited easily. It was because a classmate was reading the first volume, and the teacher could recite it at the same time. In this way, the entire Book of Songs was completed in one year. Huan Ji is a name translated by the teacher from both sound and meaning, to correct the errors in names such as "Logic" or "Nomenclature". It has long been agreed upon and become a convention. Respectfully noted by Pan Boying

### Winter Sunshine

— Yang Lida

——Dedicated to Sylvia

You are the winter sunshine, giving me warmth in the cold.

You are the winter sunshine, giving me health in weakness.

You are the winter sunshine, giving me light in the darkness.

### Napoleon Visiting the Plague Victims

— Gros

Gros (Baron Gros 1771—1835) was considered one of David's more influential students. He began studying painting at the age of fourteen and was valued by David from a young age. Later, he was summoned to the palace by Napoleon as the court painter. His works mostly praised Napoleon's achievements. His style differed slightly from David's, and the unrestrained passion in his colors and composition greatly influenced his younger brother, Delacroix (leader of the Romantic school). This work depicts the hero Napoleon conquering Italy, visiting the plague victims after the war. The original is very large and is now in the Louvre Palace in Paris. (Lion)

### Sail

— Jiang Dun

——A sail is poetic, giving people wisdom

The sail, full of wind and waves, full of sunshine, drifts on the boundless ocean...

The sail carries full of sorrow, full of joy, from the ends of the earth to the corners of the sea, like a wandering singer who has experienced the vicissitudes of life, tired of this unstable life, longing for a happy and tranquil harbor. But the sail is destined to be a wandering destiny. After a thrilling voyage is completed, it approaches the familiar shore, and a new voyage awaits it. In order to ferry more people to the other shore they aspire to, the sail once again carries everyone's hopes and ideals, leaves the quiet harbor, leaves the shore that has comforted its hard work and knows its pain, and goes to the sky to meet the full sky of wind and waves!

The sail sways with silver shadows on the vast blue lake, comparing its beauty with the white clouds in the sky. The sail shadow is like a beautiful dream. On the river bank greened by the spring breeze, the sail reflecting the sunshine is so young, giving people encouragement and life force. The sail shows you forward, forward, towards the place you yearn for.

In front of the window facing the river, a sail shadow will take you into the painting; on the misty Jialing River, when you see a sail, you know there are people on the same journey as you, and you will not feel lonely. On the treacherous beach, beside the ferocious cliffs in front, a sail shadow fluttering will reduce your fear, knowing that the beach cannot stop the sail from moving forward, and that there is a wider road ahead!

Those who are not content with their own warmth and fullness, but pursue more happiness for the majority of people, those who are not content with the hardening of their hearts, but are always searching for newer things, will all be lovers of sails, and they are all stubborn sails in the sea of people!

The sail is poetic, and the sail gives people wisdom.

### The Moon over the Songhua River - Random Memories from the Tong Window, No. 5

— Ye Dingluo

Is there no beautiful scenery outside Shanhaiguan? If you think so, why did the war break out from that place? In fact, the three northeastern provinces are a good place. The winter in the north will especially show the greatness of the north. From Dalian, take the train on the South Manchurian Railway, next to the heating pipe, through the double glass, looking out from the window, it is a piece of white snow. Except for the snow, you can't see anything else. The particularly small moon hangs high in the cold sky, shining on the silver-plated earth. It is the scenery of "the cold sky shines on thousands of miles, ice and snow cover the mountains and rivers." What a large piece of land this is! From Dalian to Shenyang, the train takes a day and a night. From Shenyang to Harbin, to Changchun, Jilin, there are even longer distances, more places, thicker snow, and colder ice. On this vast land there are forests, coal mines, gold deposits, soybeans, and sorghum. The moon illuminates the vastness of this land.

But the most interesting thing is the moon over the Songhua River. The name "Songhua River" is so beautiful. Is it a river where the flowers from the pine trees float on the water? If you think so, then it must be the flowers from the pine trees on Changbai Mountain, floating along the river. But that's not the case. The beauty of the Songhua River is on a moonlit night. Outside Jilin City, between Nanshan and Beishan, the water of the Songhua River flows through here. This place has the name "Little Jiangnan". Why wouldn't there be spring outside Shanhaiguan? In the spring, this place is full of flowers, green trees swaying in the wind, and the ice and snow have all melted away. People seek pleasure in the suburbs, and the Beng Beng Opera and the drum performance are art that is often appreciated by the public. The language spoken here is better than in other places

### The Yellow River - Random Memories from the Tong Window, No. 6

Before the War of Resistance, I took the Jinghan train across the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Because the bridge's insurance period had expired, the train carefully and slowly drove across. Sticking my head out of the window, I could overlook the famous Yellow River. But the Yellow River is not as wide as the Yangtze River, nor does it have as much water. The riverbed is piled with sand and mud, like countless islands, and the water flows turbulently in the sand seams. This sand is often rolling in groups and constantly changing its position. Therefore, the Yellow River is really not a suitable waterway for navigation. Otherwise, why are there no ships speeding in the Yellow River? In places where the water is deeper and there is less mud, a Yellow River ferry has formed. Here, people and objects can be transported by civilian boats, but the boats can only find waterways to walk through the sand seams. Groups of people pulling ropes work hard on the sand dunes to help those who are poling, walking as smoothly as the boats in the Yangtze River. Except for the lower reaches, there really isn't any on the Yellow River. Therefore, the Yellow River is not necessarily a river that is conducive to transportation. Conversely, sometimes, when the water comes from the upper reaches quickly, and the lower reaches are full of sand and mud, the water will break the river堤, which becomes the "Yellow River disaster." I lived in Kaifeng, on the edge of the Yellow River, for some days. Kaifeng is still not flooded, which is an unexpected luck. People can see that the terrain of Kaifeng is much lower than that of the Yellow River. The tip of the iron tower, a relic of the Jin Dynasty in the city, is often below the water level of the Yellow River. If it breached, the people here would become fish and turtles. During the late Qing Dynasty, the government specially set up a "River Terrace" for the Yellow River, spending a huge amount of national money every year to repair the river堤. There were frequent breaches. Since the Republic of China, this official position and funding have been abolished, but the Yellow River has not breached. Please think, what is the reason? Some people once suspected that officials often made the Yellow River unleash its power in order to justify the use of that huge amount of money. Later, since this money was abolished, people no longer had any ideas about the Yellow River. Over the years, there has also been the establishment of the "Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission" here. Many people disassembled this title to read: "Yellow River water, profit for the committee members, association." But fortunately, the Yellow River does not breach much, because it is possible to receive funding even if it does not breach, which shows that democratic countries are really much better than monarchical countries.

The Yellow River does not deliberately make things difficult for people. It is still people who cause it to breach. Historically, for the sake of war, people often breached it, so the Yellow River often changed its course. During this War of Resistance, the Yellow River changed its course again. For the Yellow River, it is also a kind of pain!

### Poetry Talk

— Wu Tunwu

"The most noble poetry can exist without metrics."

Coleridge's words are a bit too extreme.

Without metrics, how can noble poetry convey all or one aspect of its nobility?

The content of some works is "poetic," but when I pass through the shallow, artistic hands of a technician, I can't smell any poetic meaning at all!

### Frequent Aerial Mishaps and Discussion of Parachuting Knowledge

— Xu Shuyuan

Air transport is inherently very safe, and parachuting requires prior training, so ordinary passenger planes are not equipped with parachutes. However, recently air transport has been plagued with misfortune, with accidents happening in the East and the West. If you have some parachuting knowledge, it seems you'll be better off than others!

Parachutes come in various types such as "seat pack," "backpack," "chest pack," and "chest-backpack." The seat pack is for pilots, while the chest pack is more suitable for passengers. Before boarding the plane, the straps should be put on, and the straps around the thighs should be tightened. When standing straight, if it feels too tight, it will be just right when sitting down and parachuting. Both the parachute and the straps are marked with small colored strips, red matching red, yellow matching yellow. If mismatched, they cannot be fastened. When boarding the plane, carry the parachute pack in your hand, and after boarding, keep it close to you. It is best to carry it with you when moving around in the plane, so you don't have trouble finding it in an emergency.

In an emergency, the pilot determines that the aircraft has a malfunction, and the mechanic cannot repair it in the air, or the fuel is exhausted, and the terrain is not suitable for a forced landing, so an abandon-ship signal is issued, either by radio broadcast or by red light. Passengers prepare to jump, fasten the parachute pack to their chest, and open the cabin door. There is an emergency opening method, marked in red. If this method is followed, the cabin door will detach from the aircraft. Those sitting near the door should jump first, without rushing or pushing. There are various opinions on parachuting methods, but they all emphasize a few points. First, the legs should be together, not apart, so that the body forms a pendulum in the air, preventing excessive rotation. Second, the hands should be placed on the chest. This not only reduces resistance, allowing for a quick exit from the aircraft, but also keeps the parachute's pull handle right in front of the chest. As long as one is mentally clear, one will definitely be able to find the pull handle. After jumping out of the aircraft, a calm person will certainly see that they are a considerable distance from the aircraft before pulling the handle forcefully. The parachute will then open. Pulling it too early can cause the parachute to become entangled in any drooping part of the aircraft, which is very dangerous!

Floating like an immortal, if the parachute is shaking too violently in the air, you can use the parachute's risers to adjust it, changing the shape of the parachute and maintaining its stability. Generally, people are absolutely clear-headed in the air. When approaching the ground, you must fall with the wind. Practicing somersaults in the military is an essential skill for parachuting. Those who can do somersaults and those who can do the "hanging hair" move in Peking opera are less likely to be injured upon landing. When I was at the Williams Flying School, the parachute instructor compared the landing posture of parachutists to that of a drunkard, which was very apt.

The packaging and storage of the parachute are prerequisites for safety. Every few days, it must be opened, dried, and repackaged. The person responsible for packaging must sign on a card. If the parachute fails to open during a jump, the packer is responsible and can be severely punished. Parachutes must not be stained with oil or water, and must not be used as cushions in the airfield or in the aircraft!

The material should ideally be domestically produced silk, and imported materials should be nylon (commonly known as glass silk). The number of warp and weft threads per square inch and the tensile strength are all specified. The carrying capacity of this type of parachute is about dozens of times the weight of a person, so it is absolutely safe to land and there is no risk of rupture mid-air.

Parachute material is the best quality of silk and is suitable for women's formal wear. I have several classmates who survived parachute jumps during the war in Europe and used their parachutes to make their new wives' wedding dresses, which was novel and unique, and also implied a beautiful story of heroes and beauties.

### Sweet and Delicious, Endlessly Useful - Casual Talk About the Omnipotent Sugar

— Cheng Cong

In wartime, sugar is an extremely important raw material for military industry. Without alcohol, synthetic rubber would fail, and the production of alcohol requires large quantities of sugar. There are also other military needs, from small K-ration boxes to hundreds of types of paint for battleships, all requiring huge amounts of sugar. In 1944 alone, military confectionery consumed 100 million pounds of sugar.

Now that the war is over, sugar is still scarce. To understand the reason, our attention cannot be limited to candies, ice cream, and sweet wines. Before the war, sugar was as unremarkable as water. Although 15 percent of a person's energy relies on sugar, most people are not very clear about sugar and do not know what it is actually used for.

Besides being the most economical source of life, sugar has other extremely important uses. In the eyes of chemists, sugar is like a magic wand, with endless types of chemical products, all requiring sugar as a manufacturing material. Thousands of tons of sugar are used in pharmaceuticals and dyes, and hundreds of thousands of tons of sugar are absorbed in the manufacturing process of paint and soft glass. For this precious sugar, there is not a week without new needs emerging, and these new needs are all the masterpieces of scientists in laboratories.

The Age of Sugar - Sugar manufacturing experts believe that before the atomic age, we have already entered the age of carbohydrates. They predict that in the near future, large amounts of super-fuel will be made from sugar or sugar by-products to supply cars and airplanes.

Sugar is truly the storage of sunlight, and it is the packaged heat supplied by nature. In green leaves, sunlight combines the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans with water to produce sugar, which is the basic chemical of human life and the element on which human survival depends. No other compound can store the power of sunlight for human use at any time.

This secret method of nature absorbs and preserves the heat emitted by the sun on the earth. The total amount of heat stored in sugar on earth each year exceeds the heat emitted by burning 300 trillion tons of coal.

It is commonly believed that sugar is the sweetest substance, but this is not the case. It is almost at the bottom of the list of sweeteners. Substances like saccharin, although not as palatable as sugar, are 300 times sweeter than sugar.

Everyone knows that there are two kinds of plant-based sugar: one extracted from sugarcane and the other extracted from sugar beets. The method of making sugar from sugar beets was not known until 200 years ago. In 1747, Dr. Marggraf of the University of Berlin in Germany was the first to invent this method.

During World War II, sugar substitutes appeared in the United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture produced a special apple pulp for household use. It has an amber color, tastes unlike apples, but is very sweet and has the advantages of sugar.

Vast Demand - Besides being eaten during meals, used to make candies, and ice cream, sugar has many other uses. It plays a role in the manufacture of high-strength cement, penicillin, paper, explosives, and synthetic rubber. Large amounts of sugar are used in the manufacture of nylon fibers. It can prevent extremely fine fibers from sticking together when they are first made. Many high-quality gasolines are now also made with sugar. In addition, the manufacture of blood plasma, soft glass, and leather, and the preservation of meat, all require sugar. Sugar is also very important for the preservation of tobacco. It can make the flavor of tobacco particularly fragrant, and it can also be used to make glass. Several important substances, such as lactic acid, acrolein, and citric acid, are also made with sugar as a material.

In addition to pharmaceuticals, dyes, paints, and fuels, there are endless products coming out of chemists' sugar bowls. Sugar is still the most economical and powerful food for humans. The heat emitted by one pound of sugar is equal to ten times the heat of one pound of spinach. One penny's worth of sugar provides 270 calories of heat, while one penny's worth of meat provides less than ten calories.

Sugar is a product of nature, it has a future, it has production, and it is extremely related to human welfare and cultural progress. The future demand will definitely increase day by day.

### Firecrackers

— Sui

——According to reports, the total consumption of firecrackers in the city during the Lunar New Year reached 1.5 billion yuan, and the gunpowder reached 1,500 tons. I am moved to write this, not just a doggerel——

To welcome spring, there are gongs and drums, why burn firecrackers?

Ascending to heaven for promotion, landing is the usual cannon.

Why are the sounds so urgent? Crackling spreads smoke;

The new year, old habits, everywhere a mess!

Wasting people and hurting wealth, could it be a sign of war?

I advise the citizens! The market is still depressed!

### Dialogue

### Easy to Form, Easy to Break - Sorrow, Joy, Separation, Reunion - Reno, The City

— Yu Qiang

The name of "Divorce City" Reno has long been known all over the world. Even wives brought back from foreign countries by GIs, when they discover their husbands' embarrassment or have other affections, will go to Reno to live for six weeks and file a divorce complaint with the court.

Reno is a small city in Nevada, but at the train station, a line of words is written: "The biggest little city in the world"! According to Nevada law, one only needs to reside in the state for six months to obtain citizenship. However, even faster, one can file for divorce after only living there for six weeks and making a showy oath.

Usually, divorcees arriving in Reno often look very sad. Unless they (three-quarters of the people going to Reno for divorce are women) have friends there "waiting out the time" or are genuine locals, no one is at the train station to greet them—except for a suave gentleman she doesn't know who immediately introduces himself as a local lawyer.

"Don't worry about anything now." His opening line is often like this. "You'll love it here, I'll take care of everything."

He will indeed take care of everything. And the lawyer's bookkeeper will temporarily write "everything" on the bill, the amount depending on the divorcee's situation—roughly from 350 US dollars to 100,000 US dollars. Women who obtain huge alimony payments are the best clients for lawyers.

The first step is for the lawyer to solve her accommodation problem. Because accommodation solves not only the problem itself, but also confirms that she lives in Reno. She may live in Reno's most fashionable "Riverside Hotel." Maybe she lives in a small house next to a beautiful ranch, spending six weeks fishing and hunting. If she is prestigious, rich, or has other outstanding qualities, the lawyer will not let go of the "God of Wealth" and will welcome her into his own home, treating her as an honored guest. When Barbara Hutton, the heiress of the Woolworth fortune, came to Reno to divorce, her lawyer vacated his own house, sent his family on a "vacation," and rented it to his client for $3,000 a month.

How did Reno become "Divorce City"? It happened in 1900, when a lawyer named Peer Schmitz in Reno placed advertisements in film manuals, newspapers, and magazines across the United States:

Do you want a divorce? "Please read Nevada's divorce laws. Do you have family disputes? Do you want a divorce? Do you want a quick and reliable lawsuit? Please notify me"!

As a result, divorce cases flowed to Reno like a tide. However, lawyer Schmitz was deprived of his lawyer's license because of this. But this was only a face-saving measure by the Nevada government at the time, which was more conservative. Schmitz was later allowed to appear in court again.

Divorce cases not only made lawyers rich, but also made the Reno court's annual surplus considerable. Apart from divorce lawsuits involving child adoption or alimony adjustments, other divorce lawsuits, no matter how far-fetched and trivial the reasons, are granted without exception.

When the six-week "statutory time" expires, the usual litigation procedure is as follows: In the morning, the plaintiff submits the complaint to the court. Lawyers and witnesses are all present. When the court session begins, a whole set of reasons such as "mental abuse" are brought out, and at the same time, a "permanent residence" "oath" must be sworn. Although Reno's settled population does not increase because of this, the judges still solemnly and without guilt listen to this kind of formulaic oath. Later, the judge pronounces the verdict, which is almost always "divorce granted."

In terms of the number of divorces and marriages, Reno should be praised as "Marriage City." Because the number of marriages in the city each year is actually more than the number of divorces. This phenomenon seems a little strange at first glance, but on closer inspection, it is indeed reasonable. Because most divorcees already have new partners beforehand, and once they are free from the "old person," they immediately combine with the new person. Two divorcees can become four married people, so marriage actually exceeds divorce. In addition, since Nevada has no legal restrictions on the date of re-marriage, anxious re-marriers from other states flock to Reno to obtain re-marriage qualifications. As a result, there are even more marriages than divorces. The difference between the two was as much as five to one, which happened in 1939, with 11,061 couples married and 2,231 divorces approved by the court.

What kind of city is Reno itself? It is like other small American towns. The settled people live normal lives and are not disturbed by the city's "marriage trade." Reno has its schools, churches, golf courses; it also has its celebrities, bankers, brokers, lawyers, cowboys, and college students. One thing that distinguishes Reno from other American cities with 25,000 residents: Reno has the opportunity to see how those "temporary neighbors" live, quarrel, drink, and cry. From these tragic examples, Reno has become a more stable city that is not very influenced by those who come and go.
