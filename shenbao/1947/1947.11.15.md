### Washington Responsible Agencies Study Stabilization of Our Country's Currency Plan; Disbursement Method for 300 Million Loan Decided

[United Press Washington, 13th] American officials stated on the 13th that in the past few days, the responsible agencies within the US government have begun preparations for studying possible methods to reduce Chinese inflation and stabilize finances. They explained that the research on China's current complex financial and economic problems is still in its initial stages. Their consultations are also a recent development, so the relevant departments of the US cabinet have not yet begun studying specific recommendations. They stated that they are still discussing various general principles. It is understood that the initiation of this action followed Secretary of State Marshall's report to the Senate on Tuesday. US officials particularly value Marshall's opinion that the end of the Chinese civil war is especially important for China's economic situation, and pointed out that the initial research may largely concern whether it is possible to reduce the hostile situation in China at least. They stated that when most of the funds are used for military purposes, empty talk of financial stability or foreign financial assistance is ineffective. They stated that unless China can greatly reduce war expenditures, this is obviously impossible, and any attempt to stabilize or improve the economy during wartime will be useless.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Foreign Minister Wang reported on foreign affairs at the State Council meeting on the morning of the 14th, and explained in detail the issue of US aid to China. Wang stated that he had discussions with President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall in the United States. Regarding the expiration of the previous 500 million yuan loan, Wang stated that because the loan was of a commercial nature, there had to be certain commercial procedures and guarantees, which caused the negotiations to expire without success. The US government believes that it should consult with the US authorities. It is not yet known whether Marshall's 300 million US dollar loan is part of the 500 million yuan. Wang also stated that his long-term aid to China plan will not be submitted for discussion in Congress until January of next year. Furthermore, the disbursement method for the 300 million yuan loan has now been decided, with 60 million US dollars to be paid immediately, and 20 million US dollars to be paid each month starting from January of the 37th year.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Ambassador Stuart visited Foreign Minister Wang at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th and did not leave until 5:30 PM. According to reliable sources, the topic of discussion between Ambassador Stuart and Foreign Minister Wang centered on the issue of US aid to China. It is said that Ambassador Stuart conveyed Secretary of State Marshall's opinions on this matter, and it is not impossible that there were guarantees regarding the form, content, and timing of aid to China. However, it is not yet known whether Foreign Minister Wang considers these guarantees satisfactory.

[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] According to senior officials familiar with the issue of US aid to China, Marshall's 300 million yuan aid to China project is only about one-fourth of the overall aid to China plan to be discussed by the US Congress next spring. It is firmly believed that a larger amount will be available to assist China's reconstruction and the military suppression of the Communist army. They listed the assistance that the Chinese government has obtained or is very likely to obtain as follows: 30 million in post-war relief supplies (already obtained). A 50 million cotton loan under negotiation (according to US sources, these negotiations are being conducted by the Chinese government and Chase Bank). The 300 million economic stabilization loan announced by Marshall. A 500 million credit loan from the Export-Import Bank, which the Chinese government firmly believes will eventually be approved to assist China's construction plan. Assistance in the form of munitions and services.

### Ambassador Koo Visits Secretary Marshall to Discuss Economic Issues; China's Need for Assistance Is as Urgent as Europe's

[United Press Washington, 13th] Chinese Ambassador Koo Vi-kyuin met with Secretary of State Marshall on the 13th for 45 minutes. Afterwards, Koo told reporters that he only discussed economic issues with Marshall and said, "China needs US aid, even if it is not more urgent than Europe, it is equally urgent. I asked Marshall to explain his aid to China proposal submitted to the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee. It is not convenient to say whether Marshall's proposal to subsidize China with 300 million US dollars in installments over 15 months is sufficient, but China's needs, no matter how urgent, are less than the US four-year aid plan for Europe." As for Marshall's response to Koo's request for explanation, Koo did not specify, but said, "The situation in China is actually a part of the overall post-war world situation. Using a tripod as an analogy, the United States, Europe, and Asia are its three legs. If Europe and Asia are weak, and one of the three legs is missing, this tripod cannot stand." Koo also talked about the issue of Japan, saying that China, as well as the United States and the Philippines, have urged the speedy resolution of the issue of Japan's reparations distribution in the Far Eastern Commission.

### The Opportunity to Expand the Government's Foundation Has Been Lost; A Certain American Commentator's Words

[This newspaper report] When US Secretary of State Marshall reported to the Congress on aid to China, he mentioned the hope of expanding the foundation of our government. An American commentator in this city expressed his opinion on this, saying: "It is quite problematic to talk about the Chinese government expanding its foundation today, because the opportunity has been lost. Before the National Assembly convened, there was such an opportunity, but now the Democratic and Youth parties have joined the government, and the Democratic League has automatically disbanded. It is a bit impractical to talk about this again. I believe that Marshall's proposal is a political tactic to make the purpose of the loan to China noble and easier to gain popular support." When the reporter asked whether the loan proposal could be passed in Congress, he replied: "It is hoped that it will be passed, but the amount will not be large, and the conditions for supervising its use may not be accepted by China. In the loan to England, the United States only approved the major items of use and did not interfere with the details. The supervision of the loan to China is stricter than this, which may cause dissatisfaction among the Chinese people and the government. A loan of 20 million US dollars per month will not be of great help to China. As for whether military assistance can be realized, it is difficult to say at present."

### Sino-US Education Agreement Submitted to the Legislative Yuan to Complete Procedures

This was submitted by the Ministry of Communications. The ministry was ordered to repair the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and it is expected that Jinan can be reached within the year. Because the original allocation of funds was insufficient, a request was made to increase it to 48.3 billion yuan.

In addition, the State Council also approved an additional 2.1 billion yuan for the repair project of the Jin-Feng Highway in Jehol Province.

### US Authorizes Advisory Group to Help Train New Soldiers for Us; More Than 5,000 Air Force Personnel Are Trained in the United States

[United Press Nanjing, 14th] It is reported that the US government has authorized advisors stationed in China to begin training Chinese troops to resist the Communist army. Observers here believe that this, together with Marshall's economic aid to China proposal, is a concrete proof that the US policy towards China has shifted from "no action" to actively supporting President Chiang's government economically and militarily. The first batch of US advisory officers has flown to Taiwan to assist General Sun Liren in starting to train Chinese infantry. More US officers will fly to Taiwan before the end of the month.

[United Press Nanjing, 14th] Deputy Commander of the Air Force Mao Bangchu said that the technical cooperation between the air forces of China and the United States can be determined at least in this generation. More than 5,000 Chinese Air Force personnel have been trained in the United States.

### Vice President Sun's Remarks: China Should Be Self-reliant and Not Rely Solely on Foreign Aid; Will Try to Remain Neutral in Another World War

[United Press Nanjing, 14th] National Government Vice President Sun Ke declared on the 14th that US Secretary of State Marshall's proposal to aid China with 300 million US dollars is no different from a drop in the ocean. Marshall is probably more concerned with the happiness of Europe than with the happiness of China. I have always suspected the unreliability of American friendship, so China must be self-reliant and not rely solely on American charity. But this does not mean that China no longer values ​​American friendship, only that China should remember the unreliability of foreign aid. China welcomes American economic aid, such as short-term loans, necessary materials, and long-term loans, to restore railways, develop factories, and engage in other construction. But as Marshall's proposal, a total of 300 million US dollars, only 20 million US dollars per month, cannot achieve the above goals. I have heard that Marshall has proposed to aid Europe with 7 billion US dollars per year, and he probably thinks that Europe is a hundred times more important than China. The proposal of Pulitzer in Life magazine is broader and more thorough than this. Marshall's aid to China proposal seems to pay more attention to comforting the majority Republican Party's opposition in Congress rather than truly aiding China. The Republican Party wants to make China receive the same attention as Europe in the economic field. When reporters asked American legislator Zhou Yide about his thoughts after inspecting China, who advocated giving the National Government military and economic aid, Sun said: "This aid can speed up the suppression of the Communists militarily, but we still need to aid the Communists ourselves, and because of secret agreements, they can obtain Japanese munitions that can equip one million people. As for the current tense international situation, it is caused by misunderstandings between the United States and the Soviet Union. If the two countries can understand each other, the situation will surely improve greatly." Sun does not believe that a third world war is unavoidable, but he said that in another world war, China will try to remain neutral as much as possible, but China must be strong to remain neutral, otherwise it will be dragged into the vortex.

This list was decided after the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist parties bargained for days and agreed on both sides. At around 11:00 PM, Lei Zhen returned the list to the Democratic Socialist Party, which was then sent to the General Election Office for announcement. After verification by the General Election Office, except for one person who should be subject to the restrictions of Article 28 of the Implementation Regulations for the National Assembly Election and Recall Act and the candidates in two counties in Xikang Province and the Jinxiu Administration Bureau in Guangxi Province were temporarily suspended from being announced, there were a total of 238 candidates in the first batch of 191 and the second batch of 47.

The Democratic Socialist Party issued a statement at 12:00 midnight on the 14th, describing the process of submitting the list.

Today, we participate in the election to shoulder the responsibility of jointly implementing the constitution. It is our inescapable duty. Although this time, the submission of candidates has too many discrepancies with the original consultations, which has caused trouble, we have always consulted with friendly parties in order to overcome the difficulties in implementing the constitution. Fortunately, we have been impressed by President Chiang's spirit of fairness and justice in handling the matter, so we have accepted it. Now, we will present the National Assembly candidates from various provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Liaoning, Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou, Jehol, Ningxia, Chahar, Xikang, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Shenyang, Mongolia, and Taiwan, as well as various units of professional women's organizations, totaling 242 people.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] At today's joint meeting of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the Central Election Steering Committee, in addition to discussing the list of the Democratic Socialist Party, another topic was: the election issues of central and local military and political leaders. President Chiang previously stated that those who can avoid running for election need not run for election, except for those who are necessary. The Central Standing Committee formulated standards in accordance with this instruction and prepared a list to ask the President for approval. It is now known that after verification, there are 35 people who have been nominated as candidates but should still withdraw. The candidates to be replaced after their withdrawal are still waiting to be submitted, but because the procedures are complicated, it is often decided to submit them to a group for review first.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 14th] At a press conference today, the Beiping Headquarters officially announced that the Rong Zhen Department of the Communist bandits, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Columns, as well as the Ma Yutang Department of the Bohai Military Region, the Jin-Ji 12th Brigade, the Taihang Independent Brigade, the Ji-Zhong New 7th and 8th Brigades, the Field Brigade, the Teaching Brigade, and "militia," totaling about 100,000 people, moved to the Shijiazhuang area one after another at the beginning of the month.

### Provisional Compilation Methods for the 37th Fiscal Year's General Budget; Unanimously Approved by the State Council Yesterday

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The State Council meeting on the morning of the 14th discussed the provisional compilation methods for the general budget of the central and provincial governments for the 37th fiscal year. This is a special problem that occurred during the preparation period for constitutional government. The general budget for the next fiscal year is formulated based on the next fiscal year's national administrative guidelines. Now, because constitutional government is imminent, the Executive Yuan believes that it is inconvenient to formulate it in advance, and it has been submitted to the State Council for temporary non-determination. It is also inconvenient to prepare a provisional budget in advance, and after the implementation of constitutional government, the organization and work of governments at all levels will be different from the current situation, and the status of provinces and counties will also change. In addition, some facts that have not been stipulated in the constitution still need to be supplemented by legal determination after the establishment of the constitutional government. Therefore, it is also difficult to compile and review the budget for the 37th fiscal year at this time. However, the organization of the constitutional government will be completed after the beginning of the 37th fiscal year, and it will take some time to prepare the budget according to legal procedures. During this period, government affairs cannot be stopped for a day, and the necessary funds should still be properly planned. The Budget Review Committee of the Executive Yuan, together with the Accounting Office of the National Government, proposed a six-month provisional compilation method for the general budget of the central government and the governments of various provinces and cities for the 37th fiscal year, which requires various agencies to attach a list of core tasks for reference when reporting the first half of the year's expenses. During the discussion at the State Council meeting, it was felt that since the constitutional government will be established next year, the time for formulating administrative guidelines and the general budget may not necessarily be six months, so the time should not be rigidly stipulated. However, the budget preparation method can be implemented in accordance with the proposed principles, and it was unanimously approved. (The principles of the provisional compilation method for the general budget are published in the first column of page 2)

### The Chairman Clearly Indicated that the War Situation Is Optimistic; The Area North of the Yangtze River Can Be Completely Renewed; The Joint Defense Conference of Six Provinces Has Successfully Concluded

The Chairman's words fully demonstrate his firm confidence in the war situation, and it is heard that the National Army is currently doing its best to end the war south of the Yellow River, so the Chairman's words are quite sufficient to express his optimistic view.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Joint Defense Conference of Six Provinces continued to be held on the 14th and closed in the afternoon. In the evening, Chairman Chiang summoned the governors of the six provinces and gave instructions.

In addition, about 1,000 bandits who fled from Lihuang to Jiabao on the 12th arrived in the northeastern area of Yucheng on the 13th.

Editorial

### Revision of Interest Rates and Its Consequences

The issue of raising interest rates has gradually transitioned from theory to reality. According to official sources, a draft of specific measures has been prepared and is currently under discussion.

Interest is the compensation for borrowing capital, which, under normal circumstances, rises and falls according to market supply and demand. To regulate finance and channel idle capital, national banks may appropriately adjust surpluses and deficits, expanding or contracting as needed, to realize their leading role. However, if separated from reality, deviating too far from the subject, or being too rigid and unaware of how to adapt, the result will inevitably be a state of being stretched thin, struggling to cope, and causing extremely unfavorable effects on the entire economic sector. The current unrest in China's economic sector naturally has many causes, but the low-interest policy of national banks and bureaus, which has been followed for too long and failed to adapt to the times, is certainly one of them.

The so-called low-interest policy began as far back as the beginning of the War of Resistance. At that time, the interest rate of the Discount and Loan Committee was set at five percent. Later, the Four Banks Joint Office took over various loans, and their names, nature, and conditions changed frequently, and the interest rates in various local markets also continued to rise, but the loan interest rate of national banks and bureaus is still fixed at five percent today; the deposit interest rate is, of course, also kept low accordingly, not allowed to rise. The intention behind this seems very obvious: nothing more than to ease high-interest loans, facilitate industry, reduce its costs, and smooth its circulation, to achieve the goals of supporting industry and commerce and promoting production. Over the past ten years, the convenience and assistance that agriculture, industry, commerce, and export industries have received based on this policy cannot be easily dismissed.

The current criticism of the low-interest policy from all sides is, of course, not intended to increase the burden on borrowers, but rather because its scope is too narrow, and too much currency is flowing, making it impossible to achieve the expected goals. Because the effect of low-interest loans now is that, apart from direct borrowers enjoying special benefits, other general interest rates have not been lowered accordingly; high-interest loans in the market still exist, so they have nothing to do with the majority of people. In fact, because of the increase in loans, the increase in currency in circulation, and the increase in issuance, the general public has suffered obvious losses from rising prices and falling currency values. Some people say that these benefits enjoyed by a few are paid for by the majority, which is not an exaggeration.

If, because of these losses, industry can indeed develop and all production can indeed increase from now on, then, as a result of the increase in materials, prices will tend to stabilize, and currency values will also tend to stabilize. What is lost in the east is gained in the west. The temporary sacrifice of the general public may not be without meaning. It is a pity that the price increase is too drastic, and the profits of normal enterprises are far less than those of speculation and hoarding. Driven by the trend, even idle capital, even loans, and even all production capital, all inevitably flow into speculation and hoarding. Therefore, the price of raw materials and finished products often becomes inverted, and the prices of actual sales and hoarding, production areas and sales areas, wholesale and retail, often become upside down. As a result, an increase in low-interest loans does not necessarily lead to an increase in production; sometimes, production is reduced because production capital is plundered and flows into speculation. What increases is only the need for goods, the speed of circulation, the issuance of banknotes, high interest rates in the market, the rise in prices, and the rampant black market. This is completely contrary to the authorities' purpose of providing low-interest loans, so it is no wonder that it causes people to doubt and criticize them.

Following low-interest loans naturally comes low-interest deposits. Because lending rates are not high, deposit rates naturally cannot be raised. As a result, all working capital avoids banks and flows into the so-called underground banks, or is lent out privately, or is used for speculation and hoarding, or is deposited in commercial firms. The paths taken are different, but the destination of speculation and hoarding is the same. Most of the money temporarily deposited in banks is also demand deposits rather than time deposits. According to statistics, the current deposits in various banks, when converted to pre-war currency values, are only one-tenth to one-fifth of what they were, and demand deposits account for more than one-tenth of that. There is no doubt that the current frenzy of speculation and the rapid rise in prices are caused by this batch of idle capital that cannot find a home.

Raising deposit interest rates is intended to give this batch of idle capital that cannot find a home a proper home. Raising lending rates is also intended to plug the leaks and restore the natural adjustment of capital supply and demand. This cannot be said to be unrelated to stabilizing prices and reducing speculation. Therefore, although there are various concerns about raising interest rates, such as stimulating prices, oppressing legitimate industry and commerce, and increasing the burden on the financial industry, on the whole, it is indeed worthy of sympathy.

As for how to raise them, although it is a technical issue, the areas for discussion are far more complex than in theory. Some people now advocate: adopting a gradual approach, raising rates slowly, in order to avoid drastic reactions; only raising time deposit rates, not demand deposit rates, because demand deposit holders are not interested in interest, and demand deposits are not easily used for production; the so-called time deposits should only be set for short terms, such as one or two months, in order to make them easier to attract. All of these have considerable justification; only raising deposit rates, not lending rates; commercial banks should raise rates first, while national banks should not raise rates for the time being. From the perspective of merchants and the public, these two proposals are naturally very appealing. Regarding the latter, one only needs to ask about the attitude of the national banks; regarding the former, the state must increase its burden and increase issuance, and the problem may be significant; only raising the interest rates on commercial loans, not on industrial and mining loans, is only fifty steps away from the current approach; lending rates are not raised, but loans in kind are used to replace cash loans; production subsidies are used to replace low-interest loans. These two proposals focus on correcting the flaws of low-interest loans and are less relevant to the current issue; still advocating raising interest rates to a level close to the market, but not necessarily equal to the market interest rate, the intention is to absorb idle capital without making interest rates too high, in order to avoid oppressing legitimate industry and commerce.

The government's specific plan has not yet been announced, and it is impossible to speculate whether there are other better ways. We believe that it is difficult to deal with long-standing problems; no matter how the new interest rate is set, it seems to be a luxury to expect all idle capital to be brought into the fold at once. Because the current interest rate is only one cause of the flooding of idle capital, there are other factors as well. Among them, the most powerful must be the instability of currency values. Looking at the deposit rates of commercial banks, they have now been raised to around eight percent, but deposits have still not been enthusiastic. Ordinary borrowing rates are often in the range of two percent per month, but speculation and hoarding have not decreased as a result. It can be seen that although raising interest rates is a reasonable measure to correct abnormal phenomena, it is probably not a fundamental solution from the perspective of stabilizing finance, prices, and production.

### List of Hui Muslim Candidates Announced to Election Headquarters and Publicly Notified to Various Locations

Upon investigation, there are still Xi Yuzhong, Weng Yi, Xiang Ershou, Ma Duzhe, Feng Yaoxuan, Ma Peiqiong (female), Ma Ce, An Juncai, Xu Xiaochu, Cai Jian, Ma Cong, Shi Rong, Wang Gengtian, Xia Zihua, Ding Zhengxi, Gu Xixian, Wu Jiuru, Ye Faxiu, Ma Gelin, Ma Fuxiang, Lü Cunzhi, Shi Juemin, and 25 others, whose reports have been submitted by various organizations and reviewed as qualified.

### State Council Re-Examines Election Methods for Professors and Others

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The State Council once again deliberated this morning on methods for university professors, various professional technicians, and special trade union workers to participate in elections. One of the key points in this case, namely that special workers should be allowed to participate in elections even before trade unions are formed, was discussed at this State Council meeting. This issue arises because Article 6 of the Regulations for the Implementation of the National Assembly Representative, Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law stipulates: "Occupational and women's organizations participating in elections are limited to those that have been legally registered with their competent authorities." However, the Public Enterprise Trade Union Law has not yet been promulgated, resulting in the failure to formally establish various special trade unions. Such groups will inevitably lose their right to participate in elections, which seems to go against the government's original intention of supporting workers' participation in politics. In addition, educational organizations, technician associations, and trade unions not organized according to administrative regions are all groups participating in the election of representatives to this National Assembly. The attached schedules for this general election also allocate quotas according to precedent, but they all share the same situation as special worker groups. The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that, in light of the great contributions of these practitioners in the past and the high expectations for the future, they should not be excluded from this constitutional general election. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to ask the National Government to add the following clause after the original text of Article 6 of the two Implementation Regulations for the National Assembly Representative and Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law: "Practitioners of various industries who have participated in the Constitutional Assembly representative elections, if they have not been able to form organizations and complete registration procedures due to incomplete laws and regulations, may have their qualifications strictly reviewed by the competent authorities, compile and submit a list, and be approved to participate in elections." It should be implemented first and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan to finalize the legislative procedures for remedial action. During today's discussion, the government officials considered the matter to be related to legislation and decided to first submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review before making a final decision.

### Jiang Tingfu Reiterates China's Position, Korea Should Achieve Independence Soon, US and Soviet Representatives Engage in Heated Debate at the UN General Assembly

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 14th, Broadcast: Lake Success, During the meeting of the UN General Assembly, Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu spoke, demanding prompt action to enable Korea to achieve independence as soon as possible. Jiang requested the immediate adoption of the Political Committee's recommendations on the Korean issue, dispatching a UN delegation to Korea to supervise general elections, and advocated for the withdrawal of US troops before July 1 next year, if possible. Jiang emphasized China's concern about the Korean issue, forcefully stating that if Korea cannot achieve independence soon, it will inevitably become the Balkans of Asia.

[United Press, New York, 14th] US and Soviet representatives clashed again last night at the UN General Assembly over the Korean issue. Soviet representative Gromyko stated that the US insisted on holding elections and establishing a unified Korean government before the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops, which was nothing more than an attempt to rig the elections with foreign troops on the scene, turning Korea into an American colony. Gromyko concluded by saying that since the Korean representatives were not present, the UN General Assembly had no right to discuss the Korean issue, and the Soviet Union would not participate in the vote.

[Associated Press] US representative Dulles spoke next, requesting the passage of the US proposal on Korea and hoping that the Soviet Union would welcome the UN representatives to visit North Korea. Dulles said that if the Soviet Union sincerely believed that North Korea was a paradise, then it should not oppose the UN investigation team visiting the area and monitoring the general election to produce a central government. Dulles reiterated the US view that if troops were withdrawn immediately before the establishment of a central government, chaos and even civil war would ensue. He stated that the final proposal included the "constructive additions" of China, India, and the Philippines, whose governments understood Korea and were deeply concerned about its achievement of genuine independence. The Philippine representative then spoke, requesting the Soviet Union to cooperate with the United Nations. The General Assembly then adjourned to reconvene today.

### UN General Assembly Passes "Little Assembly" Resolution Despite Opposition from Soviet Bloc, First Meeting to Be Held in Early January Next Year

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 14th, Associated Press] The Little Assembly is tentatively scheduled to convene on January 5th or 6th next year. This is the hundredth attempt since the war to resolve world political issues without the presence of the Soviet Union.

### Britain to Withdraw from Holy Land Before August Next Year, But Will Only Be Responsible for Security in the Stationed Area

[Report from the UN Office in Shanghai] British representative Cadogan reiterated the British position in the Palestine Subcommittee on the 13th, stating that British troops cannot be used as a tool to confront Arabs or Jews in implementing the Palestine solution.

### Emergency Budget Leaked in Advance, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Resigns, Cripps Appointed to Concurrently Serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer

[Reuters, London, 13th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, due to leaking information about the emergency budget two hours before it was announced to the House of Commons, has resigned, which was immediately approved. The government immediately appointed Minister of Economic Affairs Sir Stafford Cripps to concurrently serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Londoners were all surprised by this unexpected development.

The reason is that before the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced his emergency budget in the House of Commons, the London evening newspaper "London Star" of the Liberal Party had already published a prediction of the contents of the emergency budget. After the budget was officially announced, a Member of Parliament asked Dalton whether he had investigated the source of the news published by the newspaper. Dalton replied: "I inform the House with great regret about the course of events: when I entered the House of Commons yesterday to announce the budget, I met a reporter from the London Star in the lounge. In answering his questions, I told him the contents of the emergency budget. I admit that this was a serious oversight and I am deeply sorry to the House." Churchill, upon hearing this, expressed the satisfaction and sympathy of the opposition party with Dalton's extremely frank attitude. Another Member of Parliament asked whether the Star reporter knew that the information was not yet public. Dalton said that this was purely due to the oversight of this person, because he had not known the reporter and other reporters interviewing in the parliament before. He was unable to judge the reporter, but could only apologize to the House personally. Afterwards, Dalton wrote to Prime Minister Attlee, resigning in self-reproach. He also stated that after his resignation, he would continue to support the government in promoting its plans as an independent. Attlee's reply stated that although the leak did not harm the country, the confidentiality of the budget was a very important principle, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer must strictly maintain confidentiality, which was indisputable. After careful consideration, I had to accept the resignation with great regret. The budget was announced in the House of Commons at 4 pm on the 12th, and the London Star publicly released the news at 3:45 pm.

[Associated Press, London, 14th] Churchill and other opposition leaders demanded an investigation into the resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton on the 14th. Churchill wrote to Dalton: "I believe it is necessary to organize a committee to investigate this matter."

### Public Utilities Bureau Explains Benefits of "Joint Electricity", 90,000 Workers Can Gain Employment, Senate Review of Contract Draft Still Yields No Results, Seven People Designated to Revise Clauses for Further Discussion

[Report from this Newspaper] The Special Review Committee for the Joint Electrical Company Contract Draft of the Senate Council held its second review meeting at the City Senate Council at 4 pm yesterday. More than 30 senators, including Xu Shih-hao, attended, and Zhao Zeng-jue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, was present.

The Public Utilities Bureau provided the following written replies to the four points of inquiry raised by the Review Committee last time: (A) Organization of the Syndicate: The syndicate is composed of Qian Xinzhi (Zhabei Water and Electricity Company), Du Yuesheng (Huashang Electric Company), Tong Shiheng (Pudong Electric Company), Li Ming (Huxi Electric Company), He Qing (Shanghai Electric Company), Chen Guangfu, Li Shuming, and Pan Mingsin. Its mission is to engage in preliminary discussions on raising foreign capital. In order to attract this foreign capital, it is necessary to first discuss and sign a contract with the government for the operating rights of the Joint Electrical Company, in order to prepare the government to guarantee the funds and declare it to the lenders in the United States to strengthen their belief. After the operating rights contract is signed, the Joint Electrical Company will be organized, and the operating rights contract will be transferred to the company. (B) Source and Amount of Capital: The goal is to complete a 100,000-kilowatt power plant and its transmission and interconnection equipment within the first five years, which requires foreign currency capital of US$14 million, and domestic currency capital equivalent to about US$8 million. The foreign currency funds are planned to be borrowed from the American financial industry for a term of more than ten years, and the domestic currency funds are to be paid by the participating companies, and supplemented by the strength of the financial industry. (C) How Participating Companies Invest and Specific Methods: The draft stipulates that each participating company should hold a minimum of 5% of the shares of the Joint Electrical Company, and there is no limit to the maximum amount. At least 50% of the shares are held by Chinese nationals. In addition to five of the eight members of the syndicate being representatives of the city's five electricity companies, these five electricity companies are naturally participating companies. Other electricity companies and financial institutions already established in the city may also participate in the investment. (D) Source of Machines and Development of Joint Electrical Company: The Ministry of Economic Affairs has previously approved the allocation of 50,000 kilowatts of Japanese compensation machines, but when they can be obtained and whether they are suitable is still a problem. Therefore, after the operating contract is signed, if applicable compensation machines can be obtained at that time, they should not be easily abandoned; otherwise, new equipment should be ordered as soon as possible. As for how to develop in the future, it depends on the future needs of the electricity companies that purchase electricity from the Joint Electrical Company. After the establishment of the Joint Electrical Company, the existing machines in the city's factories that are currently idle due to lack of power can be put into operation immediately. According to experts, about 90,000 workers can gain employment, and goods worth the equivalent of US$17 million per month can be produced.

After the Review Committee read out this reply from the Public Utilities Bureau, it conducted research based on the six items decided at the last meeting, proposed to be added to the study on how to restrict the requisition of land, which must be requisitioned in accordance with the Chinese Land Requisition Law. Shorten the term of years, but the original plan of 30 years will be maintained. The remaining items will be left to the subcommittee meeting to revise the text, and it was decided to elect Senators Zhan Wenhu, Xu Shih-hao, Shao Yongsheng, Wu Zheng, and the three conveners to form another meeting, responsible for revising the text, and submit it to the next special review meeting for a decision. It is convened by the original convener. The work of revising the text is limited to seven days. The subcommittee meeting may invite representatives from the municipal government and the syndicate to attend. A subcommittee meeting is scheduled to be held at this meeting at 7 pm on the 17th.

### Two University Students Suspected of Being Communist Bandits, A Large Number of Reactionary Books and Publications Found, Detained by Police Station and Will Be Transferred to Court

[Report from Central News Agency] According to the police station, the details of the case of Jin Yunyu, a student at Guanghua University, and Su Shuyuan, a student at Shanghai Law College, being detained by the police station on suspicion of being communist bandits are as follows: Jin Yunyu was reported to have been suspected of being a communist bandit. The Hongkou Branch took her to the bureau for interrogation and found a large number of reactionary publications and mimeographs in her handbag, including "Mao Zedong's Main Ideological Methods," "On the Party Spirit of Communists," "Historical Punishment," and "Teahouse Gossip." Her testimony was also evasive. Su Shuyuan is a student at Shanghai Law College and has also been reported to have been suspected of being a communist bandit. Su recently posted reactionary slogans and reactionary wall newspapers at the school, and under the pretext of sympathizing with the Zhejiang University students who committed suicide, she attempted to incite the school term. She has been detained by the North Sichuan Road Branch and collected a large number of reactionary wall newspapers and slogans, which are kept at the police station. The police station will transfer the above two people to the court for investigation and trial.

### Improper Disposal of Ferry Company Assets, Seventeen Residents of Yangjing District Request Investigation by the Censorate

[Report from This Newspaper] Regarding the dispute over the city's ferry company, recently, Zhou Mo and 17 other residents of Yangjing District have filed a petition with the Jiangsu Censorate requesting an investigation into the Public Utilities Bureau's improper disposal of ferry assets. It is claimed that before the war, the total assets of the ferry company were worth about 1.6 million yuan. After the victory against Japan, the Public Utilities Bureau took over the company. Although a small number of ships were lost, most of them were still intact. If the Public Utilities Bureau felt that the dispatch was insufficient, it could rent ships to operate. On the one hand, referring to the achievements before the war, negotiate bank loans and build new ships. How could they go in the opposite direction and hand over the company to others, and form a joint public-private company?

The competent authority also registered in the newspaper on November 5, 1946 to participate in the initiation of the solicitation of shares, and even invested in it, serving as directors and supervisors of the new company. There is obvious suspicion of drawing authority, manipulating organization, and valuation. Therefore, I request the Censorate to thoroughly investigate. The petition also put forward three points: The ferry company was transferred to the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company in August 1933. After the victory, the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company had to wait longer. Therefore, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau took over the company. Later, the property rights of the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company were transferred. According to laws and regulations, the ferry company should not be run by merchants. It is also appropriate to reorganize it into a public-private partnership company. The estimated price is too low. The current capital of the new company is set at 1.5 billion yuan, and the original assets are only estimated at 500 million yuan. In fact, the retained ships are more than a hundred times more than 500 million yuan.

### Another Appeal to Delay Demolition of Houses on Tianmu Road

According to Yu's report, the widest part of Tianmu Road is 35 meters, and the narrowest part is more than 24 meters, which is already wider than Nanjing Road and other roads, so there is no urgent need for expansion. Moreover, the total amount of the compensation announcement is less than 100 million (currency not specified). When calculated per household, some households receive as little as 12,000 (currency not specified). Regardless of the basis for the distribution calculation, it is obvious that the city government is unaware of the situation and disregards the people's difficulties.

He hoped that Speaker Pan would be able to visit Tianmu Road with the municipal government to investigate the actual situation.

### Heated Discussion in the Municipal Government Meeting: Tightening the Municipal Government's Organization Is Impossible

The municipal government's officials all stated that the current organization could not be further reduced, and unanimously insisted on requesting the central government to allow the current number of personnel to be maintained. Mayor Wu reiterated that he could immediately ask the Executive Yuan to send personnel to Shanghai for an on-site inspection and then make a decision. Wang Zhaoji, the chief counselor, and Wu Kaixian, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, who were sent by the municipal government to Nanjing to attend the review committee for the municipal government's organizational regulations, have returned to Shanghai. According to Counselor Wang's report, the review committee decided to change the News Office and Personnel Office into sections. The Public Works Bureau currently has 14 departments, which should be reduced to 8 departments. The number of secretaries should be reduced from 8 to 4. The number of technical staff should be reduced by half. Other bureaus should also not exceed 8 departments, and the number of senior personnel should be reduced. On average, the current organization should be reduced by about 10%. This principle has been approved by the review committee and must be submitted to the Executive Yuan's routine meeting for approval before it can be implemented.

Zheng Tianmu, the deputy director of the Municipal Government's Personnel Department, who celebrated his birthday and noon, stated that before the war, the total number of employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and the former Shanghai Municipal Government reached more than 5,000. The current total number of employees of the Municipal Government is only more than 3,000. It is indeed difficult for the Executive Yuan to order further reductions.

### Red-Mouthed, Soft-Bodied Worms Discovered in the Xiangtan and Hengshan Areas

Hiding in granaries, exclusively eating rice grains, causing severe damage

We earnestly hope that the Central Agricultural Improvement Institute will send personnel to intensify prevention and control efforts.

[Our newspaper Xiangtan 12th dispatch] Since the autumn, a type of red-mouthed, soft-bodied worm has been discovered in the Xiangtan and Hengshan areas. The local people still do not know its name. It hides in granaries, and the number is very large. It can eat up an entire granary of rice in a few days, leaving only the husks. Recently, it has gradually moved south, and it has also been discovered in the rural areas of Hengyang. The local people are extremely fearful of this pest. Some people with nothing better to do have fabricated myths and spread them in the villages, saying that when this worm was first discovered, two beautiful women stayed overnight in a temple in Xiangtan. After being politely refused by the monks, they insisted on staying. The monks had no choice but to allow them to stay for one night. In the evening, the two beautiful women asked for water to bathe. A young novice, driven by curiosity, peeked through the crack in the door and saw that there were no beautiful women bathing, but rather two red-mouthed worms. He warned the old monk, who then asked them about their origins. The two women, seeing that their true forms had been revealed and knowing that they could not hide it, confessed that they had been ordered to come down to earth to seek food. First, they said they would eat people, but the old monk politely refused. Then, they said they would eat livestock, but the old monk also politely refused. Finally, they decided to eat grain for one year, and then return to heaven when the new year's couplets are changed. The local people, unable to eliminate this worm, had no choice but to rely on the myth and celebrate the New Year early, hoping to deceive the worm into returning to heaven early. As a result, in the Hengyang area, every household is changing new year's couplets, firecrackers are heard everywhere, and there are dragon lanterns, lion dances, and gongs and drums, creating a lively New Year scene. The only difference is that the timing is different, with some holding it a month earlier, and some currently holding it. The reporter once went down to inspect and visited a middle school in the rural areas of Hengyang. According to the biology teacher of the school: this worm is not a new product. In biology, it is called "", (pronounced yang), and it specializes in eating rice grains, causing the same damage as locusts. Celebrating the New Year early to drive away this worm is purely fantasy. The Hengyang Grain Administration is also reporting that the granaries have suffered heavy losses and has telegraphed the provincial authorities to request that the Agricultural Improvement Institute send personnel to Xiangtan to prevent and control it.

### The Problem of Overseas Chinese Merchants Returning to the United States Has Been Resolved Satisfactorily

Those Who Have Resided for More Than Seven Years Have Permanent Residency Status

[Our newspaper Fuzhou 10th dispatch] According to the current US immigration law: Any foreign national who entered the country with a license before July 1, 1924, can enjoy the right of permanent residence. Those who entered the country after July 1, 1924, are temporarily residing. Once they leave the United States, they cannot obtain a return permit, which is inconvenient for overseas Chinese. The Chinese Embassy in the United States has repeatedly negotiated with the US government. On May 21 of this year, the US House of Representatives submitted an amendment and passed it at the meeting on July 7. According to the provisions of the bill, any foreigner who has resided in the United States for more than seven years, regardless of the capacity in which they entered, can apply for a deduction of 50% of the original annual immigration quota in accordance with the law. However, this still needs to be finally approved by Congress. Before this bill is formally implemented, the embassy has agreed with the US government on a temporary transitional measure. Anyone who is indeed doing business in the United States, if he intends to return to his country, and will still go to the United States in the near future, can send his business name, address, capital, and business situation in detail to our embassy and consulate in the United States, which will be forwarded to the US State Department and transferred to the US consulates in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. Visas will be issued according to the qualifications of Chinese and American international trade merchants. After that, the difficulty that once they leave the United States, they cannot go back will be solved. This is a great convenience for overseas Chinese merchants. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has ordered the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office to notify relevant parties.

### Exceeding Expectations and Shy Smiles: Young Women in Spring Outings in Tibet, Singing and Dancing

[Our Reporter] On the third day of the Games, the exciting events gradually unfolded. In various track and field events, there was intense competition. Occasionally, the athletes on the field faced tense situations, while the cheerleaders outside the field cheered them on. Therefore, despite the strong west wind, the emotions of the young men and women were extremely high.

In the 1,500-meter finals, the first places in both the senior and junior high school men's groups were won by Jinghu Middle School. During the senior high school finals, Gezhi and Jinghu competed fiercely. Before the third lap, Gezhi maintained the lead throughout, until Li Fengchun of Jinghu overtook them 70 meters from the finish line. At that time, the tension among the spectators on both sides of the track surpassed any performance of the previous two days.

The high school men's high jump final was also the most fiercely contested event of yesterday's games. When the height reached 1.62 meters, only three people were left competing for the top spots, and all three touched the bar while jumping, making it precarious. At that time, no one dared to predict who would win the championship. In the end, Wang Junbing of John's Middle School won first place with a score of 1.645 meters, only two fingers' distance away from the original three "fighting" together. Wang Junbing is five feet eleven and a half inches tall, the tallest among the athletes yesterday.

In the morning, a child got lost and was taken to the podium by Boy Scouts, who called for the parents to claim him. However, there was no response for a long time. A referee then carried the child to the "microphone" and had him cry loudly for a while, sobbing twice. Using this novel and touching method, they called the child's parents out of the crowd.

Yesterday, the number of athletes injured in the arena exceeded ten. All of them suffered from cuts and bleeding, and the demand for mercurochrome exceeded supply. Some people saw the injured being carried past on canvas beds by six Girl Scouts, with nurses attending to them, and exclaimed how comfortable it was, suggesting that they might as well pretend to be injured as well.

Missionaries also appeared on the field yesterday, preaching their faith. "Children of the Lord" gathered for a while, but the speaker was earnest, and the listeners were indifferent, and they quickly dispersed.

Female athletes in each competition often showed expressions of joy and shyness when they had the lead. Especially when the photographers pointed their cameras at them, they would shyly say, "How unlucky, the wind is so strong, and my results are not good at all!"

The photos taken by this newspaper at the games every day were enlarged that evening and displayed around the tents, attracting a large number of visitors.

In yesterday's group calisthenics performance, six schools simultaneously performed "acrobatic exercises," each with its own unique interest, fully showcasing "muscle beauty." More outstanding was the "Spring Outing in Tibet" by the Municipal Women's Normal School, with its colorful border costumes, accompanied by a series of quiet and profound classical music, singing and dancing, pleasing to the eye and delightful to the heart.

Yesterday, a large number of preliminary events were held. Today, all the finals will be held, and college men and women athletes will also take to the field to show their skills. The 10,000-meter open group final will also begin this afternoon. Heroes and athletes are all under pressure, creating a heated and tense atmosphere.

Yesterday, this newspaper published the scores of the National Games, but the champion, No. 17 District Central Elementary School, and the runner-up, Fuxin Middle School, were reversed. "Fuxin" was also mistakenly printed as "Fudian." We hereby make this correction.

### The Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Rises Again Yesterday; The Yarn and Cloth Market Situation is Chaotic; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Exceeds 40 Million

[Our Reporter] The cotton yarn negotiated pricing team decided yesterday to adjust the negotiated price of 20-count yarn to 22 million yuan, and the negotiated prices of other counts of yarn will be adjusted accordingly. The negotiated price of 20-count Golden Double Chicken brand yarn is 20.93 million yuan (tax included), 6-count Fu Riguang is 11.3 million yuan, 8-count Riguang is 15.4 million yuan, 10-count Yanghe is 15.4 million yuan, 32-count Xiantao is 26.85 million yuan, 32-count Double-Strand Fengnian is 33.2 million yuan, 42-count Fengniao is 30.45 million yuan, 42-count Variable-Strand Lima is 34.15 million yuan, 42-count Double-Strand Shuiyue is 34.65 million yuan, 60-count Riguang is 46 million yuan, and 60-count Double-Strand Riguang is 62.5 million yuan. It is also reported that the cotton yarn negotiated price adjusted by the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Association is 1 million yuan higher than before. The black market prices of yarn and cloth were extremely chaotic yesterday. 20-count yarn once soared to 28 million yuan, and top-quality fine cloth soared to over 1.1 million yuan. The Economic Police Brigade of the police station dispatched a large number of police officers to closely monitor the market and prevent non-industry personnel from manipulating it. According to related sources, the inventory of yarn and cloth in this city is quite large, enough to meet long-term needs, and the sources of cotton at home and abroad are increasing. The electricity shortage has also gradually eased, and the city can produce more than 2,200 bales of cotton yarn every day. Therefore, in the absence of unexpected stimuli, there should be no price surge.

Fellow Traders Hold Meeting; Yarn Prices Soar

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was chaotic and extremely turbulent due to the issue of yarn allocation to licensed dealers. The market rose sharply again. Finally, 42-count Jianfeng fine yarn reached a high of over 40 million, at 41.1 million, an increase of 2.8 million yuan compared to the previous day. 40-count Lanfeng, 32-count Yinyue, 20-count Shuangma Jincheng, and 16-count Guangming Tiannv yarns also rose by 1 to 2 million, while there was little trading in other brands.

Cotton Cloth Rises, Breaking Records

In the cotton cloth market, as merchants were reluctant to sell easily at the start of trading, the North Road brokers searched for fine cloth, reaching a total of over 70,000 bolts. Furthermore, due to the scarce supply from the Textile Construction Corporation the next day, and reports that the China Trust Bureau was exchanging yarn for cloth, dyeing factories also purchased aggressively. Retail investors and industry insiders also showed strong buying interest, and prices rose sharply across the board, setting unprecedented records. Subsequently, as inspectors from the inspection authorities arrived at the scene to monitor, transactions became scarce, and the market fluctuated. Prices remained high at the close, and as a result, 12-pound Longtou and other grades of fine cloth all rose sharply again by 40,000 to 100,000 yuan. The market prices of other coarse and fine cloth, twill, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth also rose, ranging from 30,000 to 40,000 to 120,000 to 130,000 yuan.

Buying Interest is Strong; Spot Cotton Soars

Yesterday's spot cotton market suddenly accelerated, with prices chaotic. Due to soaring cotton yarn prices, industry insiders were firm, and buying interest was strong. Prices soared all the way. Yarn factories initially wanted to wait and see, but as prices continued to rise, the market could not be suppressed, and they seized the opportunity to hedge. As a result, Lingbao traded at a maximum price of 4.29 million, an increase of 150,000 yuan. The other grades followed, rising by about 100,000 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was about 2,000 bales. The factory delivery price opened at 4.2 million to 4.13 million for Lingshi, 4.25 million for Shashi, 4.1183 million for Zhangde, and 3.65 million for Tongzhou, with a transaction volume of 750 bales. The warehouse delivery price opened at 4.24 million for Luoyang, 4.11 million to 4.29 million for Lingshi, 4.2 million for Shashi, 3.43 million for Chongsha, 3.885 million for Hanxi, and 2.9 million for Huoji, with a transaction volume of 1,200 bales. Zhoupu seed cotton was priced at 680,000.

### Oil, Rice, and Grains Rise Across the Board

Yesterday, a total of over 14,200 stones arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market situation was affected by price fluctuations, and both japonica and indica rice saw a rebound of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan were still scarce. Beihua flour was active, and sentiment was firm, rising sharply by 10,000 yuan. Bran also increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Shantou continued to purchase soybean cake, and it rose frequently by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Brokers continued to purchase yellow soybeans, rebounding by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Nanyang continued to handle broad beans, and the situation was firm. The arrival of red beans was congested, and they fell sharply by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Benniu red beans rose by 10,000 yuan, and Nanjing cowpeas rose by a small amount. Corn was stable, and scattered buyers from Beiyang competed to buy red sorghum, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. With continued aggressive purchases by the Guang brokers, raw peanuts rose again by 20,000 to 50,000 yuan. Sesame rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Oil merchants were also firm, crude oil rebounded by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, clear oil also rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, sesame oil rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, rapeseed oil increased by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and soybean oil supply was mostly increased, following the rise of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

Only in terms of procedures, we will strive to be as simple as possible to facilitate exports.

### The Cotton Harvest in Shashi is Better; This Year's Harvest Could Reach 400,000 Dan

Cotton Inspection Work Has Not Yet Started

Joint Price Negotiation is Out of the Question

[Our Reporter, Shashi, 13th] Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Corporation, and a group of reporters arrived in Shashi on the 11th at 11:00 AM on the Chu Guang transport. According to local estimates, this year's cotton available for purchase for spinning in Shashi is about 400,000 dan. In recent days, due to the easing of credit in the market and the influence of the rebounding yarn and cloth prices in Shanghai, the price per dan has also reached about 3 million yuan. Although this year's cotton harvest is better than last year, mixing is still inevitable. There is quite a bit of seed cotton in the original bales of raw cotton. The water content is also high. Each dan of raw cotton yields only 70% of actual raw cotton after processing. Cotton inspection personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Cotton Production Improvement Office were scheduled to begin implementation in all cotton-producing areas across the country early on, but no cotton inspection personnel have been dispatched to Shashi so far, which is highly anticipated by all parties. Before the cotton inspection work is carried out, there is no standard for the quality of goods, and joint price negotiation is simply out of the question.

### Chinese Stocks are Booming; Slight Fatigue Seen at Closing

Chinese stocks yesterday showed good profits midway due to external stimuli. However, Xinyi was particularly weak due to labor disputes. In the afternoon, night reports had some bearish records, and the short-selling group took the opportunity to suppress the market, and the market's appearance changed suddenly, ending with a tired state. The morning opening saw high prices. Yongsha opened from 307 yuan and 318 yuan, reaching highs of 320 yuan and 325 yuan. After a slight pullback, the external stimulus reappeared, rising again to a high price of 321 yuan for spot delivery and 328 yuan for forward delivery. The injured interest rate opened at 1.65 cents and 2.1 cents, and then leveled off slightly. It once fell back to around 33 yuan and 312 for spot delivery, and finally, encouraged by the black market, sentiment was bullish, and prices were forced higher again near noon, and then closed at prices of 318 yuan and 326 yuan. Xinhua's new stock rose slowly after debuting at 11.2 yuan, rising to a high price of 12 yuan at the close.

In the aftermarket, spot delivery rose to 321 yuan, but forward delivery only stopped at 325 yuan. In the late night, there was news of Ambassador Gu's commercial loan, which caused the short-selling group to take the opportunity to suppress the market, causing a wave of selling, and the market immediately fell to 307 yuan and 312 yuan. At closing, it retreated to a low price of 303 yuan for spot delivery and 30 yuan for forward delivery. The closing prices were 307 yuan and 310 yuan. After the close, No. 152 had a buy offer, and the asking price was high. Xinhua Department Store was maintained by No. 226 and closed at a high price again. As a result, compared to the morning closing price of spot delivery shares, Xinhua rose slightly, Yonggong was still flat, Huaxin, Zhabei, Xinyi, Meiya, Zhongs, Jingfu fell by half a percentage point, Xinyi rose slightly, and the rest suffered minor setbacks. Of the forward delivery shares, Yongsha, Xinyi, Meiya, Xinguang, and Jingfu fell by half a percentage point, Dongxing was flat, and Huafeng suffered a slight setback. Old off-market shares and cultural shares stabilized, Dasheng rose slightly, and the Bank of China rose again by 10%. Lian An Department Store is processing capital increases and will suspend trading from today.

### Ample Credit

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, the market credit was loose, and there was no shortage of those who absorbed credit, creating a balanced supply and demand situation. The National Bank had a net inflow of 73.1 billion, the Four Banks and Two Bureaus had a net outflow of 5 billion, the Grand Exchange Line Bank had a net outflow of 9.3 billion, foreign banks had a net inflow of 25.6 billion, small exchange lines had a net outflow of 11.3 billion, the Bank of China had a net outflow of 18.8 billion, the Bank of Communications had a net outflow of 26.3 billion, the Agricultural Bank of China had a net outflow of 14.4 billion, and the Cooperative Treasury had a net outflow of 1.8 billion.

As a result, compared to the previous closing, Grades A, B, and D each rose by 200 yuan, Unified Grade C rose by 400 yuan, and Unified Mao was still flat.

Foreign stocks were still stimulated by the off-market black market and showed hypocrisy. Hot stocks broke new high prices. Securities brokers and foreign merchants offered supply, while northern and幫幫幫進進. Yisha rebounded from a high price of 236,000 yuan, and British United rebounded from a high price of 305,000 yuan. In the afternoon, Chinese stocks could not support themselves and retreated further to the edge of the 220,000 yuan mark and closed within 290,000 yuan.

Other domestic sales are still frequent, and buyers continue to snap up goods, and the number of transactions is rapidly increasing.

### The Textile Adjustment Association Sets the Standard for Negotiating the Purchase Price of Domestic Cotton

The Supply Committee of the Raw Cotton Group of the Textile Adjustment Association held its fifth meeting the day before, because the quality of cotton varies, and there are many grades and types of fiber uniformity, length, and grade, and there is no standard for the negotiation ratio. In order to enable flower-receiving agencies in various places to have something to follow in the implementation of price negotiation, a percentage table of price increases and decreases for the purchase price of each grade of cotton is specially formulated. It is stipulated that cotton with fiber uniformity longer or shorter than 7/8 inches is the standard for increasing or decreasing the negotiated price. The cotton length listed in the table is based on fine velvet. If it is coarse velvet, it should be calculated by reducing the length by one grade according to the fine velvet. And notify the cotton spinning associations and local price negotiation committees to be informed. The grade table is listed as follows:

### Silk Prices are High, and Transactions are Scarce

The artificial silk market rose sharply yesterday morning and fell back in the afternoon. No. 120 Xu character 1A glossy opened at around 97 million yuan. The midday closing price was 80 million yuan for spot delivery, and the largest transaction for forward delivery was 103 million yuan. In the afternoon, it was rumored that there was hope for an increase in loans to the United States, and sentiment suddenly turned weak. The final transaction price was 96 million yuan, 6.1 million yuan lower than the previous day. 4A Dongyang asked for a price of 90 million yuan.

The factory warp market rose sharply yesterday. Because actual sales households shifted their targets and adopted real silk, which was more cost-effective, the market was booming, and single-item goods of five-dan weight still lacked transactions, and asking prices rose unanimously. Zero-lot transactions were quite active. The high zero-lot price was 69 million yuan, and the intermediate zero-lot price was between 7 million and 8 million yuan, about 2.5 million to 3 million yuan higher than the previous day. After thousands of processes, the special grade zero-lot was transacted at 50 million yuan.

The silk market rose sharply yesterday, but finally fell due to news of profitable sales, ending up 1 million yuan higher than the previous day. The opening price of Dazheng and Huaqiang goods was 5.4 million yuan, and the market absorbed them slightly.

In the afternoon, it continued to rise, reaching a maximum of 6.5 million yuan. After 3:00 p.m., sentiment suddenly weakened, falling to a selling price of 5.5 million yuan. Huajin crepe asked for a price of 65,000 yuan in the morning, Minsheng special grade flower crepe 72,000 yuan, and Linji feather yarn 68,000 yuan, but actual sales were sluggish, and transactions were very scarce.

### Sugar Market Has Both Ups and Downs

Yesterday's sugar market saw both red and white sugar rise sharply. Green sugar was slightly loose. The Liu Pan spot price of the Association was 1.09 million yuan for 24 coarse white sugar, and the warehouse receipt was increased to 198,000 yuan to 185,000 yuan.

### Random Notes of Zhimo

— Xu Zhimo's posthumous works, compiled by Chen Congzhou

"Random Notes of Zhimo" consists of ten sections, being posthumous manuscripts of the poet Xu Zhimo. Mr. Xu became famous for his new poetry, but the world does not know that he was proficient in ancient learning in his early years. The collection here was obtained from his son, like grandson Ruan Chu, after the disaster of Ding Chou. It was entrusted to the late Dongli for publication. There are also notes on Shuowen and Lisao, as well as several letters to his teacher, Liang Qichao of Xinhui, which will be published later. Although they are scattered brocade and broken jade, they are not treasures in the eyes of the world. However, like footprints in the snow and traces of a swan, they are enough to leave behind the fleeting clouds of that time. Alas! The poet has turned into a crane and gone west. If he were to return to Huabiao, he would not recognize what era it is in the human world! I am filled with sorrow after recording this. Recorded by Chen Congzhou in August of the Dinghai year.

Tangshan Hot Spring

Kong made You invite me to visit Xiaotangshan, bathing in the hot springs, enjoying the wind among the remaining lotus and maple leaves. Climbing the earthen mountain to look at the winding mountains of the western mountain range, chanting and answering each other under the crescent moon in the desolate village, leaning on my staff and sighing at the remaining tiles of the imperial palace: This is the forbidden area of ​​the palace, and ordinary people are not allowed to observe it at will. Now, we are letting loose and splashing around like this! It cannot be easily changed. As I was about to leave, I looked at Kong Jun and smiled and said: "I only regret that I did not bring pine resin and deer jerky to get drunk with you among the strange rocks of Tangshan."

Tianjin Flood

Heaven is not satisfied with the people of Tianjin and Zhili, who have suffered from war and are now submerged by water. Half of the market is submerged, and boats travel everywhere. Those who have escaped are exposed to the elements, and those who remain are in distress. Dogs bark on the bridge, and chickens crow in the morning. Boats travel on the fields, with no end in sight. Good fields and lush millet have become huge pools. Old willows and ancient locusts have their green branches swept. Heaven has not taken pity on the disaster, and the cries are not heeded. Alas! If one village falls, a hundred miles can be saved. If one prefecture is hungry, it can be provided for. Now that the disaster has spread all over China, who will provide assistance? The rich throw away leftover meat, and the hungry carry bones on the road. Heaven and earth are divided, and suffering and happiness are uneven. Even with great power, there is no way to save them.

Liao Chuanwen - Juan Jie told me that Liao Chuanwen is truly a seed of infatuation in this world. Since childhood, he has been fond of the Dream of the Red Chamber and has always considered himself to be Baoyu. It happened that a female cousin lived in his home, was sickly and melancholy, and was also like a reincarnation of Xiaoxiang. The two depended on each other like fate, and were inseparable day and night. Before long, the woman died, and Liao cried until he lost his voice, and then became demented and crazy. His parents forced him to take a wife, but he was still unhappy. After a few months of marriage, he took the opportunity to escape, shave his head in Dongting, and build a thatched hut there. He once passed by the Ten Temples of Shichahai in Beijing, the place where Daiyu burned her manuscripts, and rushed to cry bitterly there for three days and nights, with tears and blood coming out, but the family members advised him in vain. When his father was the governor of Hangzhou, he would often take his female cousin in a flat boat to tour the lake, with a small maid serving ink. When he was inspired, he would compose couplets, no different from people in the world of immortals.

Wu Dialect

The soft language of Wu is favored for a time, because it is gentle and smooth, making people feel happy. However, when men speak it, it is not correct and vulgar. Even when women speak it, if their voices are rough, then their language is not pure. Most people in the workshops speak the Wu dialect, but in fact, there are few who are truly from Suzhou. Juan Jie told me that she once went to Suzhou, where there was a Miss Zhang Qi, who was truly wonderful and beyond this world. Her tone was as smooth as jade beads rolling on a plate, and her voice was especially clear and melodious, differing from the ordinary. Even without her soft language being charming, even if she coughed slightly, it would be enough to make your soul fly away. Moreover, it is not just her language that is wonderful. Her eyes, her white wrists, her dimples, her cherry lips, all flow around harmoniously, as if in rhythm, suitable for anger and joy. This is what is meant by "national beauty," which should be possessed by such a person. Vulgar people only know how to examine appearance, but they do not understand this.

Wild Boar

(From Congzhou; the original manuscript has no title below)

Wild boars are the fiercest and most difficult to catch. The farmers watch their groups and steal the last one. Their nature is to rush at fire, so they do not use fire, but use solid bamboo with sharp ends, coated with oil as weapons. One hunter once faced a boar, and the boar pierced his abdomen and ran, its internal organs dragged out, hanging between the thorns. He followed it for several miles, and the boar lay in a stream, and he pierced its abdomen again. People rushed forward when it violently jumped. The next day, its companions saw the boar lying dead, and the man and the bamboo were broken. (The record is simple but not without meaning. The initial manuscript of this draft was probably twice as long, and this was achieved after three reductions. I believe that nothing can be added or subtracted. But how can I know that looking at this again in the future, I will not see more redundancies.)

Rat Repellent

Jiang Houzong said that there are people selling rat repellents in Longfu Temple. They are two small boxes with mixed bricks and stones. One is hung, and one is placed. Then the rats will disappear from the room, without exception. Once, a foreigner wanted to hire him generously, but he refused.

### Preface to Shi Chongpeng's Painting Exhibition

— Pan Gongzhan

Mr. Shi Chongpeng loved calligraphy and painting since he was a child. When he grew up, he specialized in art. After he finished his studies and put them to use, he still thought it was not enough. He then followed Mr. Xiao Wuquan as his teacher. As a result, his art became more refined and his reputation became more prominent. He has studied the principles of painting in great depth. He has seen many famous works since the Jin and Tang Dynasties. He once wrote a travelogue of Chinese famous paintings for the world. He has identified the truth accurately, and his comments are appropriate. He has been praised by the art world for a long time. He has devoted much effort to promoting art movements. His landscapes not only have the strength and vigor of his teacher, but also capture the beauty of the hills and valleys and brushstrokes of the Song and Yuan people. Therefore, his works are full of charm and vitality, and he enjoys the reputation of surpassing his teacher. Recently, at the urging of friends, he has taken out his excellent works from the past and will hold a solo exhibition at the Youth Association on Baxianqiao from the 16th to the 19th for four days, and a preview will be held on the 15th. I know that those who love Chongpeng's art will be eager to see it first. Chongpeng is engaged in social and cultural undertakings, but he is still diligent in building his own academic achievements, which is commendable and valuable! This is the preface.

### Snow After Rain on Wenfeng Peak

— Shi Chongpeng

### An Idler

— Hong Weifa

—— Twenty-fifth of the Yangzhou Continuing Dream

Whenever we talk about Yangzhou, we are easily reminded of its past prosperity, and a series of poems related to Yangzhou, such as "Going down to Yangzhou in the third month of smoky flowers," "Lying and blowing the flute to Yangzhou," "The lights are bright late at night in Yangzhou," and "Recording Yangzhou City, time is in Yangzhou," as well as "The spring breeze is ten miles along the Yangzhou road," and "A ten-year dream of Yangzhou," will naturally gather in our minds or on our lips. This past prosperity, coupled with the old ways of enjoying life, recruiting singers and selecting beauties, enjoying the moon and composing poetry, has left the people of Yangzhou with only a leisurely state of mind. It seems that many people still maintain a common view of life, that is, in terms of diet, they only seek to be comfortable, but in terms of career, they do not necessarily seek to be progressive. Among these many people, there are even idlers who go in and out of tea houses all day long, but do not do anything all year round.

As for the typical idler, based on what I personally saw in the past, it is worth recounting two examples. Yangzhou was indeed a prosperous place in the past, although it has already embarked on the road to decline, but a centipede dies hard, and its old frame is still there. Therefore, there are still many Fengwu agencies and charitable organizations. Mr. A took this into consideration, and got a nominal position in one agency, earning ten or eight yuan a month. He got a nominal position in another agency, earning another ten or eight yuan a month. He got a nominal position in yet another agency, earning even more ten or eight yuan a month. Thus, the more agencies Mr. A held nominal positions in, the more his monthly income would accumulate, and it would be quite considerable. In the fourteenth and fifteenth years of the Republic of China, a small newspaper called "Perspective" was published in Yangzhou, which once published a list of Mr. A's positions, which was truly a grand sight. However, although he held many nominal positions, the income under each name was not much, and Mr. A never contended for more. He seemed quite indifferent, but in fact, Mr. A had his own unchangeable reasons for this. Because Mr. A knew very well that if the salary was high, there would be people who would covet it and compete for it. Moreover, if the person in charge changed, they would also notice this and use it to place personnel. Only with a small salary would no one come to covet it, and he could maintain this position for a long time. Later, Mr. A actually used this strategy to hold nominal positions, receive dry salaries, live leisurely years, and freely build a beautiful house, plant flowers and grow bamboo, and he looked like a refined person. This is one example.

In addition, although Yangzhou is very different from twenty days ago, there are still many people who love elegance, are good at calligraphy and painting, and collect calligraphy and paintings. Mr. B took this into consideration. He would be sure to get to know anyone who was good at calligraphy and painting. He would also prepare paper and ask them to write characters and make paintings, and repeatedly ask them not to write inscriptions. It turned out that Mr. B used these calligraphy and paintings to give to those who collect calligraphy and paintings, in order to exchange for some remuneration to maintain his own life. Mr. B was originally a regular customer of Fuchun Tea House. Although he did not necessarily have a well-stocked mind, he was courteous and polite. At that time, painters thought he was not vulgar, and were happy to pick up their brushes for him when the mood struck. Collectors also liked to give him some assistance because what he got was not counterfeit. Thus, Mr. B spent his leisurely life all year round. Although he could not be as well-off as Mr. A, he would not sigh to the roof for his own food and clothing. This is another example.

In addition to the above-mentioned Mr. A and Mr. B, there are naturally other types of idlers, but none are as unique as Mr. A's leisure, and as elegant as Mr. B's leisure. It is a pity that these two people passed away one after another before and after the Anti-Japanese War. If they were still alive, in today's more declining Yangzhou, I don't know if they could still be so unique and elegant, so that they would not, like the current idlers, often post festive couplets or reach out to people for help, playing all kinds of ugly roles?

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"I know!" Little Tiger muttered, as if talking to himself, while his hands were still not lowered. Looking at his movements at this time, he was like a child suddenly waking up from a nightmare, or like a person whose nerves suddenly changed, and who suddenly became chaotic for no reason; but he also looked somewhat like he was under hypnosis, and someone was hypnotizing him from a distance.

"Uncle... Aunt Ji... something happened to Uncle Shen!" Little Tiger was still stretching out his hands, holding the posture he had just assumed, as if a great enemy was in front of him, ready to leap forward and kill this scoundrel. Although he was calling me and Yaoqun, his head was turned towards the door of the thatched house, with one ear tilted, as if listening to where it was coming from. The "Uncle Shen" in his mouth is Da Youzi "〇4".

Based on my personal experience with spiritual techniques, Little Tiger's state at this time was definitely not due to being hypnotized. People who are hypnotized can also speak and act, and their eyes are wide open, but their eyes are dull, like people who are suddenly lost in thought, sadly looking into the distance, but in fact, they are not thinking about anything; and there is no expression of concentration on their faces. Little Tiger at this time, however, clearly showed that he had received an alarm and was preparing to act immediately, but he was still waiting for a second alarm, and at the same time, he was also planning his own reasonable actions.

"What's the matter?" Because Little Tiger did not allow us to speak, I looked at Yaoqun and asked her in a low, husky voice, as if whispering in her ear.

"Shh..." Yaoqun also stopped me from speaking with a hissing sound and a gesture, her posture was the same as Little Tiger's, as if she was listening intently.

"That's right, Tiger!" After a while, Yaoqun seemed to have heard something, and said to Little Tiger: "Go, ... but don't mess around!"

"Understood, Captain!" After hearing Yaoqun's half-admonishing and half-commanding words, Little Tiger suddenly turned his body, returned to his normal form, saluted Yaoqun and me, turned around and rushed out of the house with a whoosh. His movements were as fast and agile as a "runaway rabbit."

"Hehe!" Yaoqun exclaimed in surprise, as if everything that had happened was in her mind, as she watched Little Tiger's quickly disappearing back.

"What exactly is going on, Miss Ji?" I had become a curious good student.

"I'm not sure yet... you'll know later." Yaoqun frowned and smiled: "Anyway, it's just that... I don't think there's any danger; because Mr. Shen only sent out the second alarm."

"The second alarm?" I was a little wooden, staring blankly, "I..." I wanted to say: "How come I didn't hear any sound?" I couldn't even feel a trace of anything.

"Yes;" Yaoqun nodded, adding a mysterious color to her smile, like a clever girl recalling the candies she had collected, "You know..."

"Wait!" I raised my hand and pressed it down on Yaoqun, stopping her from continuing to speak. Because at this time I suddenly remembered something about a mysterious whistle.

I seem to remember that American scientists invented a kind of sound wave whistle; called a whistle, but in fact, it cannot produce sound, or rather, the sound produced, because its sound waves are too short, cannot be heard by human ears, only animals such as cats, dogs and bats can hear it. Yaoqun's Italian teacher had extensive knowledge, perhaps he used some method or some training to be able to use this kind of whistle as a means of transmitting signals and alarms; presumably Yaoqun learned it from her teacher, and now taught it to Da Youzi and Little Tiger?

### Living in the Mountains

— Tang Shixia

It is impossible to sell one's skills for ten thousand gold, and it is impossible to destroy one's tools to exhaust their purpose. Zhimo said: "Since the Wei and Jin Dynasties, the art of talismans has emerged. The methods of overcoming demons that are passed down in the villages today are mostly unreasonable and unverifiable. Taoists take water and draw a circle on the wall and chant a spell, and all the mosquitoes in the room will gather; but they are released in the evening, and if they are killed, they will not be effective later. This is similar to the rat repellent, but why do they not pass on the secret recipe?

Strange Photography

A woman took a photo at Tong Sheng Photography Studio. One day, she went to pick it up, but they declined, saying it was accidentally damaged. She took it again, but again declined with the excuse that it was damaged. After three times, the woman was angry, and the photographer said, "I dare not deceive you. The photo is actually fine, but there is something scary about it." So he showed one of the photos. The woman was not in it, but there was a man standing behind her. Yu Chongxian told me this, saying that the man was her ex-husband.

Beijing Dialect

Southerners who come to the north often suffer from language difficulties. When they first learn the Beijing dialect, their absurdities are enough to make people laugh. Mr. Chen Jieshi is an example. Mr. Chen thought that what the Southerners called wiping their faces with a cloth and water, the Northerners generally called wiping their faces with a cloth and water, so he used the example of the general loan in Shuowen, thinking that the noodles of noodles should also be read like face. One day, he went into a dining hall and said proudly to the servant, "I want chicken shreds stir-fried face." The servant said he didn't understand. Mr. Chen stomped his feet and said, "How can there be Beijing people who don't understand chicken shreds stir-fried face!" It was spread as a joke for a time.

Fortune Telling

Although fortune-telling is not reliable, it is enough to make people think, thinking that a gentleman does not discard medicine. As for some subtle and skillful orders that are never inaccurate, there are also those who are enough to be shocked. A fellow villager of someone was good at fortune-telling. There was a Xu Jun whose wife had repeatedly given birth without raising a son; moreover, she was pregnant again, and Xu Jun went to have his fortune told. He said, "If your wife's left side of her abdomen has two black moles, and her left foot is unwell, then she will give birth to a male." The other things he said were as accurate as if he had heard them himself. He hurried back and verified it, and it was indeed as the fortune-teller had said. In the future, she gave birth to a son.

Domino Numbers

Domino numbers are sometimes particularly ingenious. My uncle, Mr. Jiang Jinchan, once took the imperial examination and drew a lucky number. There was a line that said: "Even more delighted to be by their side, always with noble people." On the day the list was released, he walked alone up East Mountain, and when he looked back, he saw Mr. Fei Jinghan slowly coming down from the tower. They asked each other why they had come, and laughed together. After a while, they went down the mountain to buy wine and climbed up again. Just as they were about to step on the stone steps, Fei galloped, and Jiang also galloped. Fei climbed up first, panting in the mountain pavilion, and poured a drink. They then discussed the examination. Fei said: "Last night I dreamed that the horse injured its foot." Jiang then congratulated him on passing, saying that galloping today, you climbed up first, is a sign of quick feet, it should be! I remember that the domino poem said, "Could the noble person be Fei?" I was still hoping to get a second seat, and when it was released? Fei was sold, but Jiang was actually dismissed.

Also, Mr. Jiang Baili, in the first month of the Gengxu year, was about to take office as the principal of the military officer school, and he drew the last number, the poem saying: "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, when they meet, the number is complete, the old Yang has not changed and cannot be born; the diviner meets this and stillness is auspicious." Later, Mr. Jiang committed suicide due to an incident(?), and at that time, Jin Yang was in the ninth month, and the lunar calendar was August, which can also be said to be a coincidence.
