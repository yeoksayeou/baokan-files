### Guidance Committee on Trade with Japan Composed of Representatives from Seven Agencies; Business Delegation to Postpone Trip to the East

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The organizational measures for the Business Delegation to Japan were submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion and approval on the 5th. The selection of personnel was also put forward for discussion, but because further opinions from various parties were still needed, a final decision was not made. The original plan to depart before the 15th is now impossible to achieve. The organizational measures for the delegation stipulate that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will establish a "Guidance Committee on Trade with Japan," composed of one representative each from the Ministries of Economic Affairs, Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Transportation, the Resources Commission, the National Economic Commission, the Central Trust Bureau, and other relevant units. This committee will be responsible for guiding all matters related to trade with Japan.

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] The Executive Yuan discussed today the establishment of a Guidance Committee composed of representatives from seven agencies to handle trade issues with Japan. The committee, under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, will exercise supreme authority over private trade between China and Japan. It is reported that the committee will pay attention to ensuring that companies or individuals trading with Japan do not violate the three principles passed by the State Council: that trade with Japan must not affect the private economy of the Chinese people, that reparations goods from Japan must not be included in the list of permitted imports from Japan, and that the government and business community should jointly organize a delegation to Japan for investigation before formally resuming trade with Japan.

### Procedures for Distributing Compensation Goods Requested by Four Countries Approved by MacArthur

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] The Reparations Section of the Allied Headquarters announced that the list of machine tools to be distributed to each country requesting compensation will not be finalized before October. Therefore, the distribution of the 30% of Japanese pre-reparations goods is unlikely to begin until October or November at the earliest. However, the Reparations Section, with the assistance of the Eleven-Nation Reparations Technical Advisory Committee, has made some minor progress. It is understood that the procedures for distributing pre-reparations goods to the four countries requesting compensation—China, France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands—have been approved by MacArthur. China, which will receive 15% of the pre-reparations goods, will be allocated the first set of tools. The second set will be divided into three equal parts, each accounting for 5% of the assets, to be distributed by lot among France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. After the list of tools to be distributed to each country requesting compensation is finalized (around October), each country can review it and submit its requests for the equipment it actually needs. The transfer of reparations goods can only proceed after the above procedures are completed. The initial 30% of reparations goods, including machine tools and secondary metal casting machinery, are all dismantled from the former Japanese Army and Navy arsenals. Tools from privately-owned munitions factories and aircraft factories are not included in this partial distribution.

### American and Canadian Ambassadors Return to Nanjing from Jinan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] American Ambassador Stuart, and Canadian Ambassador Davis, concluded their pleasant trip to Jinan on the 5th and returned to Nanjing at 6:00 PM.

[Taibao, Jinan, 5th] The American and Canadian Ambassadors, bid farewell amidst a warm send-off by Wang Yaowu and representatives from all sectors at 3:40 PM on the 5th and flew back to Nanjing. Before his departure, Stuart Leighton attended a symposium with representatives from all sectors of Shandong. The representatives pointed out that the problem of China is not only a domestic war, but that there are indeed international conspirators secretly orchestrating it. The suffering and misery of a large number of students and refugees fleeing from the communist areas, the destruction of rural industrial and mining areas, and the small amount of relief supplies allocated to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have caused deep regret among the people. The ambassador said that he could not comment on international relations, but that what the American government and people want to do is exactly what the Chinese people most hope for. The basic spirit of the United States is to help the government supported by the people of any country. There is no problem with the principle of the policy towards China, only with how to help China without increasing or prolonging the civil war, and that helping China is not helping any one faction. He hoped that the Chinese government could reform its policies, gain the support of the people in the communist areas, and automatically serve the government. If the central government, local governments, and the people work together, there will be no problem with American assistance.

### Councilors Hold Social Gathering to Discuss US Far East Policy, Will Submit Memorandum to Special Envoy Wedemeyer

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Telegram] The National参政会, a representative of public opinion organizations, is paying close attention to Special Envoy Wedemeyer's visit to China. At 3 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, it held a special gathering of参议 members to express their opinions on the current US Far East policy, the purpose of Special Envoy Wei's visit to China and the understanding of his mission, and our expectations for the US. 参议 members from the three parties expressed their opinions enthusiastically. The gathering on the 5th was presided over by Xu Xiaoyan, and more than 30 people attended, including Zhang Qianhua, Jin Weixi, Jin Zhichao, Qian, Zhang Weizhen, and Da Pusheng. The opinions expressed by the参议 members will be sorted out and submitted to the Foreign Affairs Group of the驻委会 for discussion and supplemented and revised before being submitted to Special Envoy Wei in the form of a memorandum. Qiu Changwei said: The US should be responsible for the current disputes over the CCP issue. The US should stand on a neutral position and recognize that the CCP issue cannot be resolved peacefully. The government has now entered the stage of armed suppression. If there is foreign aid, we will be very welcome, but we should still be self-reliant. Lu Yunzhang said: There are errors in the US policy toward China. Special Envoy Wei should understand the CCP's massacre of compatriots and the suffering of the people. China needs assistance, which is for world peace. If China cannot be peaceful, world peace is impossible. Wu Jingxu said: We should express our attitude to Special Envoy Wei to explain China's view of the world, because foreigners can hardly fully understand China. Zhao Yunfeng said: We should explain to Special Envoy Wei in a fair manner that China absolutely needs peaceful unification, and that it is inseparable from world peace. At the same time, we should explain to Special Envoy Wei the fact that the CCP is hindering China's peaceful unification. Yin Shuxian said: Special Envoy Wei should attach importance to the opinions of representatives of public opinion organizations, and should not be biased towards the opinions of party representatives, and hoped that Special Envoy Wei would face up to the expansion of forces in the Far East that threaten world peace, and hoped that the US would provide assistance. Zhang Qianhua said: There are two major opposing groups in the world, namely the US and the Soviet Union. The policy adopted by the US is that Europe is more important than Asia, and Japan is more important than China. We believe that the US should first re-examine its policy, and its attitude towards China should also be re-determined. At the same time, it should respect the existence of China's democracy and independence and help shorten China's war. This is not only beneficial to China, but also beneficial to the world. Luo Mengce emphasized the need for US aid to China, and said that China is a country that needs revolution but has failed in revolution. At present, China should be able to embark on the path of revolution in a moderate way, refreshing politics and economics, producing a strong government, and embarking on the path of moderate socialism. Huang Jianzhong said: The error of the US Far East policy really started when Roosevelt signed the Yalta Secret Agreement. He hoped that the US Far East policy in the future could face up to the harm of the communist forces in Asia. For the sake of world stability, the US should provide assistance to China. Zou Luowen emphasized that China should strive for construction to benefit China and the world.

The National Army, transferred from between Baoding and Shijiazhuang, continues to advance eastward, crossing Anxin and heading straight for Renqiu, rushing into the territory of Dacheng, and tightening the encirclement and suppression of the bandits. It will soon be able to establish contact with the National Army in the northern section of Jinpu Railway, completely clearing the remnant bandits in the middle area of Pinghan and Jinpu Railways. Another corps of troops crossed the Zhu Bazhou River yesterday and went straight to Hejian to attack.

### Autumn Harvest in Northern Jiangsu Flood Area Hopeless, Wang Maogong Appeals for Disaster Relief, Provincial Government Asks Executive Yuan and UNRRA to Send Planes to Survey

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Telegram] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, told reporters when meeting with them on the 5th to discuss the situation in Jiangsu Province, that he was deeply concerned about the flood in northern Jiangsu and hoped that all parties would be able to give more assistance to rescue the thousands of victims in northern Jiangsu from the mud and water. Wang pointed out with great sorrow that Jiangsu Province has had many disasters over the years. Northern Jiangsu began to report stability last year, but recently it has heard of floods again. It can be said that it has suffered many disasters. The cause of this flood was due to the flooding of the Yi River and the Shu River. More than 20 counties in Xuhaihuai were flooded, with more than 10 million mu of disaster-stricken areas and more than one million victims. In this area, the autumn harvest is hopeless, which is a major worry. The Huang and Huai Rivers are now continuing to rise. If they continue to flood, the 36 counties in northern Jiangsu will become foreign countries. It is really unthinkable if we do not seek to rescue them urgently. Before the flood, the provincial government had already prepared a rescue plan and asked the central government to allocate 5.7 billion yuan for emergency relief. Recently, Construction Director Dong Zanyao was dispatched to Xuzhou, and the provincial government has asked the Executive Yuan and UNRRA to send planes to the disaster area to survey the actual situation in order to prepare for rescue. For the US relief work, in addition to asking the central government for assistance, Jiangsu Province itself is doing its best, but it still hopes that other provinces will provide more assistance.

If they do not report themselves, once discovered, they should be levied at the full amount and the reduction and exemption measures should not be applied.

### Jiangsu-Suining Area Local Public Grain, Provincial Government Allows Counties to Retain for Local Use

[Central News Agency Zhenjiang News] 30% of the local public grain levied in each county in the Suijing District in the 35th year, half of which was given to the province. It was previously approved by the Finance and Food Department to be retained by the county for local use. Recently, according to the instructions of the Executive Yuan, the province and county should still each have half to make up for the provincial finance. After receiving the order, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, on the basis that the case had previously been notified to be retained by the county for local use, seemed difficult to comply with the change, and the finances of the counties in the Suijing District were very difficult, and the levied public grain would be supplemented. Therefore, it was decided at the 123rd meeting of the Provincial Government to maintain the original plan, exempt from the release of the province, and report to the Executive Yuan for approval.

### Editorial: Improving the Treatment of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants

"Improving the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants" is currently the most urgent and critical issue. The Executive Yuan has conducted multiple discussions in recent months, but no decision has been reached, causing public school teachers and civil servants to be restless and uneasy. However, it is reported that the Executive Yuan's Budget Review Committee concluded its meeting on the 4th and decided to adjust the salaries and benefits of civil and military officials and teachers across the board starting in August. It was also decided that civil and military officials would receive equal treatment. However, the specific increase and its base number are still being determined, and the final approval will be made at the political affairs meeting on the 12th. From this, it can be seen that the government attaches importance to this issue. The reason why it has been reluctant to make a hasty decision in recent months is to avoid being careless. This time, the Budget Review Committee decided to make a comprehensive adjustment and implement equal treatment for civil and military personnel, which is a valuable principle and of great significance. We only hope that the government will quickly enact the legislation.

The so-called treatment refers to the remuneration that public and private organizations provide to all personnel for their work. In other words, it is the price of the workers' own labor. Before the War of Resistance, due to low prices and stable living conditions, even elementary school teachers who lived frugally could maintain a basic standard of living. Although active-duty soldiers and civil servants did not receive equal pay for equal work, their livelihoods could be maintained. Therefore, most public school teachers, civil servants, and military personnel were able to live and work in peace and contentment, and there were no complaints. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the situation has changed dramatically, prices have soared, and the burden has increased. The general income has obviously been insufficient to meet the needs of reality. However, under the banner of "Victory First," public school teachers, civil servants, and soldiers in the War of Resistance, in order to win the War of Resistance and strive for national survival, felt at ease and had no complaints. Today, it has been almost two years since the victory of the War of Resistance, and the price index has exceeded 40,000 times, while the salaries and benefits of public school teachers, civil servants, and military personnel are still at meager levels. How can we enable public school teachers to live stable lives and enjoy their work? How can we inspire active-duty soldiers and ensure that their morale is high and their horses are well-fed? In contrast to real life, the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants is really unreasonable.

It is true that men of high ideals should not forget their responsibilities even in adversity, and public school teachers and civil servants, given their honored position, should endure hardship and be selfless, forgetting their families for the sake of the country. The more difficult times are, the more diligent and vigilant they should be. However, while public school teachers and civil servants can use these words to admonish themselves, the government should not use them to unilaterally blame public school teachers and civil servants. Life is realistic, and society is harsh. Today's junior and senior officials are far inferior to bank clerks, university professors are barely comparable to rickshaw pullers, and active-duty soldiers are virtually beggars. As a result, most public school teachers and civil servants are impoverished and live in cramped alleys, becoming objects of contempt and ridicule in modern economic society. Public school teachers and civil servants also see themselves as inferior and compete to seek other paths, which has a profound impact on the country and the nation. The authorities of the Executive Yuan have recognized this problem and are actively seeking to improve the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants, and to achieve equal pay for equal work for military personnel. This is indeed a very forward-looking measure, and we believe that public school teachers and civil servants across the country will support it.

Speaking of improving treatment, the first thing that is needed is money. There is a large disparity between the existing national treasury's revenue and expenditure, and the finances are extremely difficult. The government's comprehensive adjustment of the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants and the implementation of equal pay for equal work for civil and military officials will inevitably lead to a huge increase in the budget. If we use inflation to solve everything, it will not only stimulate prices but also increase the financial crisis. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the government will improve the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants on the one hand and implement military and administrative streamlining on the other. Modernized armies adopt a policy of elite troops. All units with low morale and weak combat effectiveness should be reduced in size or converted from military to civilian work. Local security forces should be supported by local finances. This is what we hope to see in military streamlining. The organizational structure of central and local agencies and schools is large and extravagant, forming a bloated phenomenon. Moreover, many agencies are redundant and inefficient. We should conduct a thorough review, streamline personnel, and save expenses. This is what we hope to see in administrative streamlining.

In short, improving the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants is necessary today. Equal pay for equal work for civil and military officials can further enhance morale and create new rules for the civil service system, which is very reasonable. However, we want to call the government's attention to the fact that increasing salaries to adjust treatment is only a passive administrative measure and cannot truly solve the livelihood problems of public school teachers and civil servants. Because the trend of rising prices and increasing living expenses makes it difficult for the income of public school teachers and civil servants to adapt, the government must overcome the economic crisis, eliminate the factors of rising prices, and move towards the rational path of economic recovery, which can have practical benefits.

### The Consequences of the Dollar Panic

The result of the British Labour Party's two years in power is that it has not only failed to overcome the difficulties in the economy but is still mired in a predicament from which it cannot extricate itself. The social democratic party is facing a major test. The British Labour Cabinet, under the leadership of Prime Minister Attlee, has been struggling with the dollar panic in recent days, consulting with the relevant cabinet ministers day after day on the countermeasures to be taken in the future so that Britain can safely overcome the economic difficulties. The British Parliament is also scheduled to meet today to discuss how to cope with the panic of lacking dollars. From this, we can see the difficult situation of the British economy after the war.

According to a report by the Associated Press, Britain has become a tragic world after ten years of recession, six years of arduous war, and two years of the Labour Party's socialist experiment. Today, in London, slogans are posted everywhere, warning the people: "If you don't work, you will freeze and starve!" When we study the reasons for Britain's economic difficulties, in a nutshell, it lies in the lack of dollars. There is nothing in the daily necessities of the British people that is not in a state of shortage. If they want to import from the United States, they must use dollars to buy from the United States. It is said that of the 1 billion dollars that the United States loaned to Britain after the war, 700 million dollars had been used by July of this year, leaving only 300 million dollars. How can this small amount be enough to meet Britain's needs? This is indeed a serious problem.

Former British Prime Minister Churchill, in a speech to 50,000 listeners in Watestock City, Oxfordshire, the day before yesterday, blamed the Labour government entirely for Britain's economic difficulties. He said that the Labour government did not know how to use dollars to buy industrial equipment but completely wasted them on luxury goods. Churchill's words inevitably have the effect of making an issue of something in an attempt to attack the Labour government. However, there are also many undeniable facts in his speech, which not only make it easier for us to understand the economic difficulties in Britain but also allow the American people, especially American businessmen, to know that the difficulties of international trade in the future are far from over.

Britain is now experiencing a dollar panic, and the United States is also worried about the depletion of dollars. This is the case in other countries as well. The dollar panic is certainly the main reason for the economic difficulties of various countries, but for the United States, it is also a serious economic crisis. If the United States does not realize this as soon as possible, make long-term plans, and save others and itself, and still focuses on seeking trade surpluses with various countries, then the United States will eventually have a day when it cannot export goods to trade with other countries, causing a phenomenon of overproduction in the country. Therefore, the consequences of the dollar panic in various countries deserve the close attention of the American government and the public!

### Egyptian Prime Minister Asks Security Council: British Troops Should Withdraw from Egypt and End British Rule in Sudan

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council began discussing the Anglo-Egyptian dispute today. After the meeting, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy Pasha personally requested the Security Council to order all British troops to withdraw from Egypt and Sudan and end the current British administration in Sudan so that Egypt could be liberated from the shackles of British imperialism. The Egyptian Prime Minister pointed out that the continued presence of British troops in Egypt is a "latent threat" to peace in the Middle East.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: Egyptian representative to the Security Council Nokrashy Pasha warned the Security Council today that in today's world, the existence of imperialism can no longer be tolerated and that the United Nations Charter should not be ignored. The Security Council should urge Britain to end its long-term rule over the Nile River Valley and the Suez Canal. Otherwise, the anger of the Egyptian people will inevitably erupt. Pasha requested the Security Council to take the following steps: (1) British troops should withdraw unconditionally and completely from the Nile River Valley; (2) Britain should cease its actual rule over Sudan so that Sudan can merge with Egypt; (3) The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 should be abolished because, from Egypt's point of view, the treaty violates the United Nations Charter and will allow British troops to continue to be stationed in Egypt for nine years.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: A spokesman for the British delegation said that if a majority of the member state representatives on the Security Council do not object, British representative Jebb will refute the points made by Nokrashy Pasha.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 5th] The Chairman of the Security Council announced that the Council will discuss the Egyptian issue at 12:30 PM today (Shanghai time 9:30 PM). U.S. officials said that the United States will participate in the discussion of this matter with an open attitude. Before the Anglo-Egyptian parties state their positions, the U.S. representative will not state its attitude. However, the State Department has been studying this issue in detail for several months. Personnel at the Egyptian Embassy here expressed optimism that the United States would directly support Egypt in the Council, arguing that the Egyptian Prime Minister had received expressions of sympathy during his visit to Truman and Marshall last week. Furthermore, the support of U.S. newspapers for Indonesia shows that the United States may support Egypt.

### Security Council Discusses Greek Issue: Soviet Proposal Rejected; Situation on Greek-Bulgarian Border Suddenly Becomes Tense

[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] Soviet representative Gromyko accused Western powers in the Security Council on the 4th of plotting to enslave Greece politically and economically, but the Soviet attempt to overturn the Truman Doctrine suffered a crushing defeat in the vote. The Soviet Union proposed that the Security Council order all foreign military personnel to withdraw from Greece, place all foreign economic assistance under United Nations supervision, and blame the recent disputes between Greece and Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia on the Greek government. In the vote, only the Soviet Union and Poland voted in favor, while the other nine member states of the Security Council voted against it. Before the vote, Gromyko accused "certain countries" of interfering in Greek internal affairs, saying that although this interference was euphemistically called "aid," it was in fact interference. Gromyko did not mention the names of the United States or the Truman Doctrine, but the meaning was quite clear. Gromyko also said that the Soviet Union also felt that Greece did need economic assistance, but at the same time believed that the purpose of this "aid" was not to meet the needs of the Greek people but only to meet Greece's military needs, thus making Greek internal affairs so chaotic. The Polish representative put forward a resolution asking the four Balkan countries to take measures to restore friendship, but the British representative Jebb often dismissed it as a ridiculous suggestion, which was tantamount to admitting the incompetence of the Security Council and was more harmful than beneficial.

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 4th] According to the Turkish News Agency, there was heavy artillery fire in the border areas of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey today, and it has now been confirmed that the shells came from within Bulgarian territory. Greek insurgents and their Slavic accomplices are launching a full-scale offensive into Greek territory from the Bulgarian border. The railway connecting Turkish border cities in Greece has been constantly attacked, and bridges and intersections are particularly targeted for bombing. Thousands of Turkish refugees have now fled from Greece into Turkey. Well-informed foreign sources in Istanbul said that heavy Turkish troops have been assembled in the western border region. They also pointed out that the guerrilla offensive launched from within Bulgarian territory indicates Bulgaria's open support for Greek insurgents, using Bulgarian territory as a strategic base. International observers believe that although the situation may explode at any moment, Turkey is still cautious about sending troops into Greece.

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 4th] The situation in the Balkan Peninsula has been urgent in the past 18 hours. According to Turkish sources, Bulgaria is mobilizing a large army on the Greek border. Since yesterday, the sound of artillery fire has been heard in the western border region of Turkey. The nature of the Bulgarian army's shelling remains to be determined. The rebels in Greek Thrace have rapidly expanded in the past week and are now threatening the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki. The first batch of U.S. military supplies arrived in Greece yesterday. The 100,000 Turks living in northeastern Greece are now returning to Greece. The turmoil caused by the rebels has caused the Turkish government great concern. At present, there is much speculation about Turkey sending troops to help the Greek government suppress the rebels. It is said that Turkey's move is encouraged by the United States.

### World Bank Loans to the Netherlands and Denmark

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The World Bank will announce tomorrow that it will lend $175 million to the Netherlands and $50 million to Denmark. To date, the Bank has only lent $250 million to France.

### Britain Pays Attention to the Yugoslav-Bulgarian Agreement

[Reuters, London, 5th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government believes that the agreement signed by Yugoslavia and Bulgaria over the weekend is the first diplomatic alliance treaty signed by a former enemy country and an allied country since the end of the war, and that it believes that its target is not Germany but another allied country, Greece. The Foreign Office believes that this alliance will be a turning point in post-war history, and its consequences and impact are being studied closely. Officials here are paying close attention to the fact that the Yugoslav-Bulgarian treaty explicitly mentions the border incidents currently being investigated by the United Nations agencies and the friction with the Greek government. What Athens is most concerned about is whether the treaty also contains secret agreements regarding Greek Macedonia. London has not yet obtained any information on this.

### U.S. Fully Supports Italy and Austria's Membership Applications

[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 4th] The applications of Italy and Austria to join the United Nations today received strong support from the U.S. representative on the Security Council Membership Committee. The committee alone defeated a Soviet resolution with six votes against, which advocated that Hungary, Austria, Italy, and Romania be considered together for membership. The committee also voted separately to consider Austria's application separately from Hungary, Italy, and Romania. After lengthy discussions, the committee adjourned without reaching any resolution on the applications of the four countries and postponed the discussion until Wednesday.

### US to Send Investigation Team to Dutch East Indies to Observe the Actual Situation; Indonesia Opposes Mediation by a Third Country

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: Since the Dutch and Indonesian sides issued a ceasefire order, the US side has been in contact with the Dutch side. It is reported that the United States is about to send an investigation team to inspect the actual situation. The investigation will be led by the US military.

[United Press Batavia 5th] According to unconfirmed sources on the 5th: Former President Roosevelt's naval advisor, Admiral Leahy, may be the head of the US delegation to mediate the war in Indonesia, in accordance with the US policy of "good offices." Sources close to the Dutch headquarters here point out that Admiral Leahy's position is the same as the roles Marshal and Wedemeyer played in China. The Dutch High Command believes that the US "mediation" is more impartial than that of Britain, as Britain still has to face the responsibilities of India, Burma, and Malaya in Asia. The most important question now is what form the US "good offices" will take. They hope and expect the US to send a mission to investigate the situation on the ground.

Dutch Military Blockades Indonesian Areas

[United Press Batavia 5th] The Dutch Navy announced on the 5th: Despite the ceasefire order, the Dutch Navy will continue to prohibit the transportation of military supplies into Indonesian territory and prohibit the export of agricultural products from Indonesian territory. It also stated that patrol teams will continue to maintain order. Vice Admiral Helfrich, Commander of the Dutch East Indies Navy, issued an order stating: "Military operations have now ceased. It is the duty of the Dutch military to restore and maintain law and order within the territories currently under our administration." Maintaining law and order apparently includes preventing Indonesian troops from infiltrating these territories.

[Reuters Batavia 5th] Dutch and Indonesian troops in Java and Sumatra ceased hostilities starting at midnight today. Indonesian President Sukarno, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian Army, personally broadcast an order for his troops to cease hostilities at midnight. As of now, no reports of violations of the ceasefire order have been received here.

Indonesia Accuses the Dutch Side of Breach of Contract

At the same time, Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir announced that due to the Dutch abandonment of the Linggadjati Agreement, with the establishment of autonomous regions in the Belitung Islands, Bangka Islands in eastern Sumatra, and the Riau Islands outside Singapore, the Republic considers the Linggadjati Agreement to be no longer valid. The Republic now seeks to resolve the Indonesian dispute on a new basis. It does not want mediation by a third country but wants arbitration by an international committee. Radio Yogyakarta reported that Prime Minister Sjahrir telegraphed the President of the Security Council, Mr. Coray, that he had accepted the Council's ceasefire proposal and expressed gratitude for the Council's swift action. Sjahrir also requested that the Dutch military withdraw to the demarcation line before July 20 and establish a committee to implement the ceasefire order.

Australia Suggests Sending Personnel to Investigate

[Reuters Lake Success 4th] At tonight's Security Council meeting, Australian representative Hodgson suggested sending UN officials to Indonesia to keep the Security Council informed of developments there. Hodgson also criticized the Security Council's method of notifying the Indonesian government as extremely inappropriate and accused the Dutch authorities of delaying the transmission of the Security Council's notification, preventing Indonesian officials from conveying the notification to their government. The chairman stated that he would consult with the Secretariat to decide on the Australian representative's suggestion to send personnel to Indonesia.

[United Press Washington 4th] President Truman returned here this afternoon after spending the weekend at the Shangri-La mountain resort in Maryland.

### US Export-Import Bank Approves a Portion of Loan to Italy; Italian Assets in the US to be Unfrozen

[Central News Agency Washington 4th] The Export-Import Bank today approved a $23 million loan to Italian industry, guaranteed by the Italian government. This loan is part of the $100 million loan earmarked for Italy in January, to restore and expand the production of additional goods needed for the Italian domestic economy and to stabilize the value of the Italian currency.

[United Press Washington 4th] The US Export-Import Bank has recently approved loans to Italian factories as follows:

(1) $10 million to Fiat Automobile Company; (2) $9 million to Montecatini Chemical Company; (3) $4 million to Breda Company. It is expected that other small factories in Italy will also apply for loans from the board of directors.

[United Press Washington 4th] Italian officials here recently announced that the agreement to unfreeze Italian assets and the commercial treaty are expected to be signed here on the 14th.

### Churchill Condemns the Government, Saying that Forming a Coalition Cabinet Cannot Solve the Crisis; British Conservative Party Launches Election Campaign

[Reuters London 4th] Opposition Leader Churchill delivered his first public speech since undergoing hernia surgery in May to 50,000 listeners at Blenheim Palace in his native Woodstock, Oxfordshire, under the auspices of the Conservative Central Office. He stated that the Conservative Party will support all conscious programs, no matter how severe, in daily life and work to overcome Britain's economic crisis, rather than in Parliament. At the same time, he reiterated that the Conservative Party would oppose any suggestions deemed unwise or unnecessary or aimed at inciting class envy or party hatred. He again severely criticized the Labour government, stating that there was no possibility of forming another coalition cabinet to solve the economic crisis, and that the only hope for national recovery lay in the British electorate removing those who had clearly failed in their duty. "It is only after a national vote removes the culprits whose arrogant theories and personal incompetence are leading Britain to ruin that the current misfortune can be eliminated." Churchill's appearance on the political stage today, when Britain's economic crisis is nearing its peak, is intended to give his actions a historically important position. This speech is the opening salvo of the Conservative Party's election campaign. Churchill himself has made it clear that he and his party will use Britain's economic crisis as their campaign capital and will, if possible, change the situation this autumn.

### British and American Experts to Hold Meeting to Discuss Increasing German Coal Production; Date is August 12, Location is Washington

[US News Agency Washington 4th] A State Department spokesman stated today that talks between British and American experts on the development of the Ruhr coal mines will begin on August 12. The British and American delegation, led by Sterland (political advisor to the British Commander-in-Chief in Germany), is scheduled to arrive in Washington next Monday. The leader of the US experts has been determined to be Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Thorp.

[United Press Washington 4th] The "Ruhr battle" between the US and Britain after the war is entering a new stage. It is planned to increase Ruhr coal production by one-third by the end of the year as a major contribution to the Marshall Plan for European aid. Currently, the Ruhr area produces about 220,000 tons of coal per day, only half of wartime production. In London, Foreign Secretary Bevin tonight reiterated to the House of Commons the UK's established policy of nationalizing the coal mines and factories in the German Ruhr area. Bevin asked: "If these industries do not belong to the people, to whom will they belong? Will they belong to business combinations or the Krupp Company?" Bevin also expressed opposition to France's proposed four-power control plan for the Ruhr. He said, "I do not intend to participate in the four-power control plan for the Ruhr unless the four powers control German industry." When discussing the level of German industry, Bevin advocated that German steel production be increased to about 11 million tons, in line with the German standard of living before Hitler came to power and before the war preparations. He said: "Our goals for Germany are twofold: on the one hand, to enable Germany to live in peace and happiness, and at the same time, to ensure our safety."

### Britain and the United States Are Considering Continuing to Reduce Troops Stationed in Europe; British Troops Plan to Withdraw from Italy and Greece Immediately

[United Press Washington 4th] The United States and Britain are considering further reducing the number of occupation troops in Europe to save manpower, not to save American dollars. Washington and Berlin have agreed on various temporary measures to reduce troops, ensuring that they do not hinder American policy and do not overturn the balance between the Western occupation zone and the Soviet occupation zone. It is reported that the number of American troops will be reduced by more than half. However, British Prime Minister Attlee wants to reduce Britain's military burden to save the economic crisis, which is a new factor. The United States has no choice but to continue to study before making a final decision.

The US Army authorities originally believed that with Germany divided into four, international relations chaotic, and the Soviet Union delaying the ratification of the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, the 150,000 American troops stationed in Europe could not be reduced any further. However, with the cessation of conscription in the country and the lack of manpower in the army, the Army Department had to re-examine this. Britain has about 350,000 troops stationed in Europe, of which less than 300,000 are stationed in Germany, about 28,000 in Austria, 20,000 in Italy, and 60,000 in Greece. Attlee stated that the troops stationed in Germany would be greatly reduced, and the troops stationed in Greece and Italy would be withdrawn immediately. The withdrawal of British troops from Italy seems to make the US uneasy.

### British Defense Committee Discusses Troop Reduction Plan

[Reuters London 4th] The British Cabinet Defense Committee discussed the emergency plan to reduce British troops today, without waiting for the return of Imperial Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery. If the plan is approved by the full cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the Prime Minister can announce it to the House of Commons on Wednesday. It is said that the number of people to be laid off will be 300,000 from now until the end of the year, reducing the strength of the British army to about one million people.

### British Cabinet Meeting Discusses Emergency Economic Measures

[United Press London 5th] Prime Minister Attlee is scheduled to submit an emergency measures plan to the Cabinet today in order to cope with the national economic crisis. The new plan is expected to require strict implementation of the rationing system and reduce the expenses of the British occupation forces in Germany.

### Outer Mongolia Not Allowed to Participate in Freedom of Information Conference; Soviet Proposal Rejected

[Central News Agency Lake Success 4th] The Social Committee of the United Nations Economic and Social Council today rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to invite the Mongolian People's Republic to participate in the upcoming international freedom of information conference. However, the committee decided today to invite the following non-UN member states to participate in the freedom of information conference and have full voting rights, namely Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Pakistan, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland, Transjordan, and Yemen. A final decision has not yet been made on whether to invite Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, and Southern Rhodesia to attend the meeting.

### Reno's Rocket Bomb Undertakes Round-the-World Flight; Forced to Turn Back Due to Mechanical Failure

[United Press Chicago 4th] Renowned pilot Tudden took off in the "Reno's Rocket Bomb" plane, taking the route of Paris, Karachi, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Alaska around the world, attempting to create a new solo flight speed record. After departing from Orchard Airport here at 9:31 pm this afternoon (6:31 am Shanghai time on the 5th), he had been in the air for five and a half hours. When flying over Halifax, Nova Scotia, he turned back to Chicago due to mechanical failure.

[United Press Chicago 5th] According to Orr, who disembarked from the plane, the auxiliary wing that controls the horizontal movement of the plane failed, so he had to return. The distance traveled was almost one-sixth of the entire journey. Orr plans to rest for one day today, and after the mechanical parts are repaired, he will depart again on the 6th.

### The San Pao Long Branch of the Kuomintang and Youth Corps Urges the Government to Protect Overseas Chinese with Military Force

[Central News Agency Batavia 4th] The San Pao Long branch of the Chinese Kuomintang and Youth Corps today called on overseas compatriots to unanimously request the government to protect the overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra with military force. They stated that after the outbreak of the Indonesian-Dutch war, irresponsible Indonesian elements in various places took advantage of the situation to rob, plunder, and kill, causing significant losses to the overseas Chinese. This action is a violation of international law.

### Soviet Union and Poland Sign Trade Agreement

[Central News Agency Moscow 5th] The Soviet Union has now signed another trade agreement with Poland. The agreement stipulates that within one year, the Soviet Union will export cotton, iron, manganese ore, ferrosilicon, alloys, oil products, chemicals, and other items to Poland. Poland will import non-ferrous metals, cotton fabrics, sugar, coking coal, window glass, and other Polish-made industrial products.

### British Search for Irgun Members Throughout Palestine; Three Mayors and a Large Number of Jews Arrested and Imprisoned

[United Press Jerusalem 5th] In a nationwide search for suspected underground elements, British authorities here arrested the mayors of Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, and Netanya, and dozens of Jews on the 5th. Troops and police in various parts of Palestine launched simultaneously, arresting Jewish leaders who were considered to sympathize with the Irgun underground organization. Most of the Jews were taken to prisons in Arab areas to prevent the Irgun from rescuing them. The reason why the British Mandate government ordered the search was to crack down on the violence of underground elements. This is the first major operation since the British arrested the leaders of the Jewish Executive Committee during the same period last year. In addition, the arrested included a member of the Tel Aviv City Council and a member of the Revisionist Party of the Ramat Gan Council, as well as dozens of other members of the Rashando Revisionist Party. The British authorities believe that this group is right-wing and most are suspected of conspiring with the Irgun.

### All Sectors Discuss and Decide to Establish an Organization to Comfort and Welcome Servicemen Passing Through en Route to the Front

Due to the large number of servicemen from various places passing through Shanghai recently, braving the midsummer heat for long marches, their loyalty and bravery are commendable. In order to express condolences and welcome them, the municipal government, the municipal party headquarters, and the municipal council jointly initiated a meeting at 3 pm on the 5th in the municipal government conference room, inviting relevant agencies and organizations to discuss and plan condolence and welcome measures. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Xuan Tiewu, Fu Zhengmo, Xie Renzhao, Zhang Wei, Zhang Xiaosong, Wang Xianqing, Liu Deming, Xu Xiaochu, and many others attended. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting. First, Director Fang of the Committee reported on the living conditions of the servicemen and provided suggestions for comforting the servicemen. Subsequently, Deputy Commander Liu Yaohan of the Port Command and Director Zhu Jingning of the News Division of the United Relief Federation reported on the servicemen's diet, living conditions, and hygiene. Then, discussions began, and detailed decisions were made on the address, meals, hygiene, and comfort of the servicemen passing through Shanghai.

It was also decided to organize the "Shanghai Committee for Welcoming and Comforting Servicemen Passing Through," with all the agencies and organizations attending the meeting as members, and jointly elect the municipal government, the council, the municipal party headquarters, the garrison command, the municipal chamber of commerce, local associations, the port command, the division headquarters, and the Friends of the Military Association as nine standing committee members.

Five groups were established: (1) General Affairs Group, undertaken by the Port Command; (2) Meals Group, undertaken by the Friends of the Military Association; (3) Hygiene Group, undertaken by the Health Bureau; (4) Comfort Group, undertaken by the Municipal Party Headquarters; (5) Finance Group, undertaken by the Municipal Bank.

increase nutrition. The Health Bureau will also administer vaccinations, organize mobile medical teams, and provide bathing and hygiene services. In addition, singing groups, film screening teams, and current affairs photo exhibitions will be held to welcome the servicemen and show respect.

### Four Agencies Accused of Hiding and Selling Assets Worth 300 Million; Allegations of Hiding and Selling Assets

[Our Newspaper News] Ding Guitang, Deputy Chief of the Jianghai Customs; Qian Zongqi and Guo Yourong, Jianghai Customs officials; Liu Gongyun, former Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau; Lü Shishang, former Chief of the Investigation Team of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau; Chen Shouzhi, former Chief of the Audit Section of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau; and Wu Rencang, concurrent Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office of the Central Trust Bureau, and six others. Sun Zhuting, Zhu Shengyao, and Cao Haishen recently filed a lawsuit with the judiciary, accusing them of hiding and selling enemy and puppet property, totaling an estimated value of about 300 million yuan. The original complaint stated: During the Shanghai occupation, the warehouse of Ruichang Hardware Store at 340 Dengtu Road was a secret Japanese warehouse, covering an area of about four acres, with materials piled up like mountains. In September of the 34th year of the Republic, the plaintiffs secretly reported it to the Frontline Military Supplies Receiving Committee. At that time, the person in charge of receiving enemy and puppet property was the head of the Materials Group, Lü Shishang. After the plaintiffs secretly reported it, four large military trucks suddenly came to the front of the warehouse, transporting materials back and forth. This lasted for three days.

After the Frontline Military Supplies Receiving Committee was abolished, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau was established, and Lü continued as the head of the Investigation Team of the Bureau. The warehouse was handed over to the Bureau, and then transferred to the Jianghai Customs. The handover was completed on December 11 of the 34th year of the Republic. However, the handover documents did not include the account of the materials transported by the trucks for three days in advance. On December 3 of the 34th year of the Republic, the Jianghai Customs publicly auctioned more than 26,000 pig iron pipes (approximately 600,000 kilograms), more than 800 tons of coal, and countless other rice, wheat, and hardware materials. The confidential informants went to collect the bonus after the auction. According to the Jianghai Customs, only 400 tons of scrap iron were sold, and the previously announced 26,000 pig iron pipes were a clerical error. The plaintiffs refused to receive the bonus at that time and submitted a report to the Enemy Property Liquidation Office of the Central Trust Bureau. The Office replied, stating that the 26,000 pig iron pipes were from the Qiwupu Road warehouse and had nothing to do with the Dengtu Road warehouse mentioned by the confidential informants. The plaintiffs believed that the above four agencies had jointly colluded to hide and sell enemy assets and jointly submitted a statement to the Procuratorate to request a thorough investigation. It is reported that the Procuratorate will summon the relevant personnel in the case for interrogation.

### Heard Lantong's Retrial Announced; Sentence Reduced to Three and a Half Years; No Unfavorable Actions Toward the People, Reduced Accordingly

[Our Newspaper News] Heard Lantong, one of the "Three Old Men of Shanghai" during the enemy and puppet period, completed his retrial, and the sentence was announced in the High Court yesterday morning. After Judge Xiao Liang of the Criminal Court took the stand, Heard's defense lawyers Zhu Fuju and Sha Yanka said: "The defendant is unable to attend court due to serious illness. The sentence will be announced by the defense lawyers on behalf of the defendant." Judge Xiao then stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Heard Lantong, colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist our country, sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for three years, and confiscation of property except for the necessary living expenses for the family." Then, he sat down and briefly stated the reasons for the judgment: "The defendant served in a puppet position for more than three years, during which he participated in matters such as collecting military rice and cotton yarn for the enemy, colluding with the enemy and puppets. Although the defendant argued that the matter had been submitted to the Central Bureau of Statistics for approval, considering what he did, it cannot be said that he did not benefit the enemy. Considering that the defendant did not engage in any unfavorable actions towards the people during his tenure in the puppet position, the original sentence of eight years seems a bit heavy. The sentence is reduced to three years and six months after considering the crime and circumstances."

### New Public Bus Routes to Extend to Wusong

[Our Newspaper News] It has been two years since the transportation between Shanghai and Wusong has been formally restored after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, causing public grievances. Previously, Dong Fei, director of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, repeatedly wrote to Chen Bozhuang, director of the Two-Way Administration, urging him to find a way to restore the Shanghai-Wusong transportation to facilitate commercial transportation, but it has been delayed until now and has not been repaired, which has greatly affected the commerce of Wusong, especially the pig industry. It is now learned that the Public Works Bureau is first trying to run public buses, extending from the intersection of Shishan Road in Shanghai to Wusong Outer Ma Road. The road signs for each station have been arranged, and the Public Works Bureau is rushing to repair the road surface through which the buses will pass. A trial run will be conducted within days.

### Stamp Tax Revenue Greatly Increased; Reaching 500 Million Yuan Per Day

[Our Newspaper News] Recently, the stamp tax revenue of the Direct Taxation Bureau has greatly increased, reaching 500 million yuan per day, the best record since the restoration. According to past experience, late autumn and early winter, and around the Lunar New Year, are the peak months for stamp tax, while spring and summer are relatively quiet. The current increase in tax revenue during the height of summer indicates that citizens have gradually understood their tax obligations. The recently revised Stamp Tax Law stipulates that stamp tax should be paid on certificates (including purchase invoices) of more than 5,000 yuan. However, with the high prices of goods today, costing tens of thousands of yuan for a haircut, transactions of less than 5,000 yuan are rare. In view of the factual needs, the Direct Taxation Bureau plans to submit a request to the authorities to raise the threshold. Before the revision, it will focus on publicity and guidance to cultivate the habit of paying stamp tax, and small-amount tax evasion will not be punished for the time being.

### Port Area Defined

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Port Reorganization Committee will hold its 36th meeting this morning. According to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the scope of the Shanghai port area has been discussed and decided. The Huangpu River, from Minhang to the Wusongkou, and the waterway outside the Wusongkou to the Yangtze River, which is the throat of the city, will be permanently managed by the Port Authority. It is stipulated that the Suzhou River starts from the Waibaidu Bridge, and the wharves on both banks are temporarily not included in the scope.

At today's meeting, the first draft of the organizational outline of the Shanghai Port Authority will be discussed. The draft has been passed by a second reading at the 34th meeting on July 23. It will be passed by a third reading today, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process.

### Heard About Rationed Goods, Many New Businesses Open, Social Affairs Bureau Considers Suspending Registration, Registered Businesses to be Reviewed

[Our Newspaper's Report] The main daily necessities currently rationed by the municipal authorities include sugar, coal briquettes, rice, and oil, mostly entrusted to various businesses for sale. Speculators, seeing the potential for profit, are rushing to register businesses, some even setting up fictitious entities. Coal Industry Association, Machine-Made Coal Briquette Business Association, Sugar Business Association, etc., argue that the rationed goods entrusted by the authorities for sale are already limited. The rapid establishment of new businesses leads to a situation where the porridge is scarce and the monks are many, resulting in insufficient allocation. Established businesses of many years may not even obtain sales rights, and legitimate profits are being搶奪 (snatched away), creating a situation where the guests are usurping the role of the host. They have jointly petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to restrict the establishment of new businesses. The Social Affairs Bureau is now drafting measures to be submitted to the municipal meeting for discussion, considering suspending the registration of businesses, and those already registered will be subject to review.

### Malley Detained Pending Investigation, Extradition for Questioning Possible Once Evidence is Complete

[Our Newspaper's Report] Staff Sergeant Malley, a U.S. soldier arrested by the Fan Constabulary based on the testimony of the Englishman Quillian regarding the shooting death of Yu Shengxiao, is currently being detained by the U.S. military police. Yesterday, the Nanjing U.S. Military Liaison Group stated that once the Chinese police have completed their search for evidence, he can be extradited for legal proceedings. Malley is an active-duty soldier serving at the U.S. Army Hospital in Shanghai. The police remain skeptical of Quillian's claim that he was not the shooter, as his statements seem to be an attempt to shift the blame to others. The next step in the police investigation is to locate a "black military [vehicle] stained with blood" and the murder weapon. According to the police, tracing the handgun is difficult because all three bullets fired passed through the body and left no marks, making it impossible to identify the type of gun.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The An Tai Iron Factory at the end of Xiaoshadu Road previously submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the factory's 36 apprentices had repeatedly participated in strikes and work stoppages, disrupting the factory's operations, and requested permission to expel them. After the Social Affairs Bureau approved the expulsion, it issued an order on July 29th to stop work and complete the departure procedures immediately. Yesterday afternoon, the 36 apprentices, holding red and green paper flags, marched in a line to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition and distribute declarations, claiming that their participation in the strikes and work stoppages was entirely due to threats from the workers. Now that they have been expelled by the factory, they have only learned about 30-40% of the required skills, and it will be difficult to find employment after leaving the factory, inevitably leading to unemployment. Moreover, their families are poor, and they will be reprimanded by their parents when they return home. The factory has stopped providing meals, and they can only endure hunger while awaiting orders. According to the Social Affairs Bureau, the apprentices are demanding that the factory pay each of them a severance fee of 1.6 million, which has no legal basis. Later, the factory agreed to pay each of them 350,000, which they refused to accept. If they disagree with the Social Affairs Bureau's order, they can apply to the Municipal Government for arbitration.

They are willing to provide the workers with half of their annual bonus for severance, in accordance with Article 2, Section 3 and Article 4 of the previously agreed-upon conciliation record. The workers firmly refused to accept this. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau ruled that the severance payment should be issued in accordance with Item C of the First Resolution of the Second Meeting of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee. However, this resolution stipulates that "industries with existing agreements may still follow their agreements." Therefore, the employers convened a meeting at 6:00 PM on the 29th of last month to decide on the severance method. Unexpectedly, at this time, Pan Fagen, a standing director of the workers' union, suddenly led more than 30 workers to the meeting place and beat Shi Guansong, who was present, into an injury. The case was reported to the Xincheng Police Precinct. It is said that Pan was still not satisfied and ordered the workers to strike.

It is reported that 64 of the industry's 81 members have closed their shops.

Yesterday, the Ministry of Economic Affairs replied by telegram, stating: Article (1) of the original motion, which calls for treating the symptoms in an emergency to prevent factories and shops from closing and workers from losing their jobs, should be handled in accordance with Article 5 of the Outline for the Implementation of Constitutional Government upon the Completion of Mobilization for the Suppression of Communist Rebellion.

(4) Regarding production enterprises that encounter a shortage of funds, the state banks should provide sufficient loans as needed, the Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed the Joint Treasury to handle the matter. If various industries need it, they can apply directly to the local Joint Treasury branch. (5) Regarding cases where manufacturers are unable to continue operating due to various reasons, the government should temporarily maintain them, and all products should be exported as much as possible regardless of cost if they are suitable for export, and sold at par if they are suitable for daily necessities, the Ministry has telegraphed the National Economic Commission for discussion. (6) Regarding the government's principle of ensuring the survival of factories and shops and the livelihoods of workers, and setting minimum wages by industry, the Executive Yuan has issued the "Provisional Measures for Wage Adjustment in Shanghai," and the Executive Yuan has ordered that wages may be discounted by a certain percentage based on the cost of living index, from 90% to 60%.

### Acting as Agent to Collect Land Certificates; Younger Sister Fooled by Older Brother; Pledging Funds for Failed Speculation; Qian Zelin and Others Prosecuted

[Our Newspaper] Qian Zelin and Zhu Qiyi have been accused of fraud, and the District Prosecutor's Office has recently filed a public prosecution. A certain Qu Qianpeizhen owns real estate in the Renzhou Li neighborhood of Haining Road in this city and possesses an old deed. Last year, she applied to the Land Administration Bureau for registration and to exchange for a land ownership certificate, submitting the old deed to the bureau and obtaining a receipt. The defendant, Qian Zelin, is Qu Qianpeizhen's cousin, who falsely claimed that he could find a way to help through connections and obtain the land certificate from the bureau in a short period of time. Qu Qianpeizhen believed him and handed over the receipt issued by the bureau, along with her personal seal and land tax bills, to Qian Zelin. On January 16th of this year, Qian, colluding with Zhu Qiyi, pledged the above-mentioned deed receipt and borrowed 20 million legal tender from Sheng Yanfang. Due to failed speculation, they were unable to repay the loan. Zhu then approached Sheng and requested to retrieve the deed receipt first. After the pledge, they returned it to Sheng. Through Zhu's introduction, they borrowed 50 million legal tender from Chen Weida at a monthly interest of 10 million, with a three-month term. Qian drew up a temporary sales contract, allowing for redemption within the deadline. After repaying Sheng's principal and interest, the remaining funds were used for speculation, which again failed. On March 24th of this year, Qian borrowed another 15 million legal tender from Chen Dada. Unable to repay the principal and interest, he signed a check from the China Bank with a date of June 24th of this year in the name of Qu Qianpeizhen, with a face value of 24 million yuan (including interest). Chen went to cash the check at maturity, but it was dishonored. Upon pursuing Qu for payment, Qu then learned that she had been defrauded by Qian, Zhu, and others. The victim reported the incident to the police station, which forwarded it to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The prosecutor charged Qian Zelin with violations of Article 339, Paragraph 1, and Article 56 of the Criminal Code, and Zhu Qiyi with violations of Article 339, Paragraph 1, and Article 30 of the Criminal Code, and filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law.

### Bizarre Murder Case in Tianjin; Inside Story of the "Ghost Market Head"; Shan Mingju's Heart Was Dug Out; Suspect Ren Likui Detained and Sent to Court for Trial

[Our Newspaper Tianjin] The "Head Case" in Tianjin has caused a great stir in the city for the past half month. After half a month of investigation by the police, the details of the case have come to light. It turns out to be a tragic event caused by the sexual perversion of an unscrupulous Taoist priest. The main suspect has already been sent to the Tianjin District Court for trial. The details are as follows:

A Bloody Sack

Near the Xiguangkai shooting range in Tianjin, there is a "Rabbit Market," which is a place where the lower classes conduct various transactions before dawn. During the "ghostly" hours of this ghost market, on July 14th, a sack was discovered at the entrance of the Xihutong Alley near the shooting range. When opened, a large, bloody human head rolled out, and the body was missing. The head was quite handsome, with a section of long hair cut off. Examination revealed that there were injuries from a wooden stick on the right temple and top of the head. It could be determined that the person was killed before being decapitated and discarded. Thus, the ghost market head case spread throughout the city.

Police Detectives Mobilized

Upon learning of this bizarre murder case, the police first examined the head. Based on the fact that the head hair was cut and the sideburns were very long, it was determined that the deceased was a Taoist priest. Accordingly, a large number of detectives were dispatched to investigate the three major groups of the Tianjin Longhua Buddhist Association, the Taoist Association, and the Jade Emperor Temple. After three days of investigation, the name of the deceased was finally discovered: Shan Mingju, 28 years old, from Tai'an, Shandong, residing at No. 3 Kaiyuan Li, Zhaojiashen Street, Tianjin. He lived there with another Taoist priest, Ren Likui (46 years old, from Qinghe). Further investigation revealed that Shan Mingju was a Taoist priest from the Baiyun Temple in Beiping, tall and handsome. He came to Tianjin from Beiping two months ago and originally lived in the Rongji Store on Zhaojiayao Street. He became close to Ren Likui and was persuaded by Ren to live together in Kaiyuan Li on May 12th. On the evening of July 13th, Shan Mingju was still playing mahjong with acquaintances Sun Xiujing, Li Qingrong, and Yuan Jixing at No. 5 Kaiyuan Li, and they dispersed at 4:00 AM, only two or three hours before his head was discovered in the ghost market.

Feigning Madness

Based on the investigation, the police went to No. 3 Kaiyuan Li, where Ren and Shan lived, on the 17th. They found that the bricks in the house seemed to be floating. When the bricks were lifted, the soil was loose, and there were faint blood stains. Bloodstains were also found on the walls. There were two flower pots put together under the bed, one containing a lock of long hair and the other containing a wooden stick, both covered in blood. The long hair was identical to the hair of the head in the ghost market. When asked about Shan Mingju's whereabouts, Ren Likui replied that he did not know. When asked about the bloodstains, he claimed that it was chicken blood. He also claimed that Shan Mingju bled when he fought with someone, but he flatly denied the murder, and the body was still missing. After the police detained Ren Likui, Ren feigned madness at the police station, stopping eating, holding his breath, and refusing to confess, which made the police feel quite troubled.

Digging Up the Body Underground

After three days of interrogation and inducement, Ren Likui finally confessed that Shan Mingju was indeed killed by him and that the body was buried under the water tank behind the northwest door of his residence. On the 29th, the police sent personnel to dig up the body and indeed found Shan Mingju's headless body two feet deep underground. The whole body was wrapped in old cotton, tied with old wires and hemp ropes. The upper body was naked, wearing sweatpants. Examination revealed that there were injuries from a wooden stick on the back, chest, and left arm of the body, a knife wound on the chest, six and a half inches long and three inches wide, with the belly exposed and the heart having been dug out. Examination of the lower body revealed that the genitals had also been cut off. During interrogation about the motive for the murder, Ren refused to confess and continued to pretend to be a fool, spouting nonsense. The inside story of the case remains a mystery.

Feminine Temperament

It was not until the 26th that the truth of the case became clear. According to the police's investigation, Ren Likui was originally a "Lord Longyang" with a sexual perversion, that is, someone who pretends to be a woman and engages in homosexual relationships. According to Wang Wenqing, who once lived with Ren Likui, "Last spring, I was introduced by a friend to live in a house with Ren Likui. After moving in, I found that Ren Likui had a rather feminine temperament. He repeatedly used words to seduce me. At that time, he cooked and served me at home, but he did not allow me to go home. He often quarreled because of this. Once, he even threw a kitchen knife at me and told me to chop him to death. It was not until January 29th of this year, when he was 'worshipping the stars' and no one was allowed in the house for twelve days, that I took the opportunity to move away."

Moved by Jealousy

Based on this confession, it was determined that there must have been a sexual relationship between Ren and Shan. Unexpectedly, Shan was a dissolute Taoist priest who did everything, including eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, and often did not return late at night, which aroused Ren Likui's jealousy and led him to kill him. This can be seen from Ren Likui's digging out of Shan Mingju's heart and genitals, but Ren Likui has not yet admitted this point.

Why did Ren Likui throw the head into the ghost market? The answer can be found in what Ren Likui said to people before the murder. He said, "After a person dies, the ghost follows the head." He obviously hoped that the ghost would not haunt his house, so he discarded it in the ghost market. (Reporter Li Shaolin, 8/3)

### A Rural Engineer Discovers Small Mine in Zhengzhou; University Students Ashamed of Insufficient Experience

[Our Newspaper Zhengzhou] There are many small-scale coal mines being developed in the western Henan valley. Gongyi has more than ten mines, each with three to five mine shafts, producing 6 million tons annually. Yuxian has 53 mine shafts, producing 1 million tons annually. Other counties such as Mixian, Dengfeng, Yanshi County, and Fanshui also have a large amount of coal production. These small-scale mine shafts are mostly mined after being surveyed by rural engineers. Those rural engineers don't know what ore veins are, nor do they know what instruments to use to measure them, they just rely on their experience, looking to see if the land is surrounded by mountains, what kind of trees grow on the mountains, and how the streams run between the mountains, and then use their steps instead of measuring instruments to determine whether there is coal in a certain place. If there is, they can also say how deep you can dig to see coal, and what kind of coal it is. It is said that there is also so-called watermelon field coal, that is, under this coal field, one coal pile after another is scattered like watermelons in the field. That rural engineer can also point out from which point to dig down to get into the heart of a watermelon. In that case, in two or three years, this factory can rise to prominence relying solely on this one watermelon.

There was a graduate who graduated from university with a degree in mining last year and went to Mixian to look for mines, saying that he had discovered a coal mine. Provincial Governor Liu was very happy and spent 200 million yuan and borrowed drilling machines from Chongqing. As a result, they drilled to a depth of 20 zhang and still didn't see any coal. A rural engineer next to him saw and said, "You read in books that there is coal in this place, but I looked at the ground and didn't know there was coal." In the end, that university student had to retreat in despair and abandon the idea of continuing mining.

At 12:00 PM on July 12th, a tragedy occurred at a carbon mine in Yiyang. More than 100 miners were buried alive in the well, and four miners died on the well, and 37 were injured. The reason was that the mine suddenly collapsed. Mines that don't pay attention to safety equipment are prone to this kind of trouble. The provincial government has stationed personnel in the mines to collect income tax, hoping to send more people or conduct roving inspections to pay more attention to safety equipment and miners' welfare.

Construction is scheduled to begin in October.

### Hang Liwu Arrived in Shanghai from Peiping Yesterday – Talks About Impressions of Education in Peiping and Tianjin – Scheduled to Return to Beijing Today and Come to Shanghai Soon to Reorganize Jiaotong University

[Our Dispatch] Hang Liwu, the Vice Minister of Education, flew from Beijing to Peiping at the end of last month to make his first inspection of colleges and universities in Peiping and Tianjin after the recovery. The official business has now been completed, and he flew back to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. He is scheduled to return to Beijing today and will have discussions with the members of the Jiaotong University Reorganization Committee before his departure. This reporter visited his residence last night, and Mr. Hang's face was covered in dust, indicating the hardship of this trip. According to the results of the inspection, he said: "Tsinghua" and "Yenching" Universities have gradually restored to their pre-war state. Under the leadership of President Hu Shi, "Peking University" has made rapid development. It is hoped that the government will find a way to provide financial support to match the existing human and material resources of the school to adapt to its development. In the Peiping-Tianjin area, "Beiyang" is struggling through hardships and is gradually recovering. "Nankai," thanks to the leadership of President Zhang Boling and its spirit of hard work, has largely restored its former appearance. Generally speaking, all colleges and universities feel that equipment is insufficient, and the lack of faculty housing is the most serious problem. Professors in Peiping and Tianjin hope to enjoy the same allocation benefits (rice, wheat, coal, etc.) as professors in Beijing and Shanghai. Mr. Hang has promised to find a way to solve this problem as soon as possible after returning to Beijing. Currently, foreign students are studying in various schools, and many international scholars who come to China are willing to visit Peiping. Comparing the current situation in various parts of the country, Peiping is still the center of education and culture in China and will bear the responsibility of promoting international culture in the future. He believes that after the libraries and instruments of the schools are enriched, the salaries of professors are increased, and life is stabilized, the golden age of universities four or five years before the war can be restored in the short term. As for the students, because Peiping and Tianjin are close to the war zone, their emotions are excited, their lives are serious, and there has been a large increase in the number of students taking the entrance examination this year. At this point, the reporter asked about the incident of Jida dismissing professors and inviting reporters to report. Mr. Hang said: There have been no similar incidents in the universities of Peiping and Tianjin because all schools have committees. Whether or not a professor's contract is renewed depends entirely on their teaching performance and academic level, and is decided by a meeting of all committee members. The president cannot arbitrarily decide to retain or dismiss them. This has become an extremely good tradition in Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University. Regarding the Jida incident, Mr. Hang said that from the Ministry of Education's standpoint, it should take a trusting attitude toward the president and should not interfere.

[Another Dispatch] According to the person in charge of the Jiaotong University Reorganization Committee, Mr. Hang will come to Shanghai soon after returning to Beijing because the reorganization of Jiaotong University's affairs is in urgent need of handling.

### Guo Zhen Cup Volleyball Tournament – Huayan Wins and Loses Equally – Youlian Wins Against Nanxing in the Women's Group

[Our Dispatch] The second Guo Zhen Cup Volleyball Tournament held three matches last night. The heavy rain caused few spectators to attend the games. As a result, the two teams of Huayan (Group A) won and lost equally. Group A beat Jinyuan in three straight sets. However, Group B lost to Yongsha after a hard-fought match. In the women's group, Youlian also continued their victory by overwhelmingly beating Nanxing.

Yesterday's results:

(1) Huayan A defeated Jinyuan (Men's A) 21-13, 21-14, 21-6.

(2) Yongsha defeated Huayan B (Men's B) 21-8, 21-11, 21-12.

(3) Youlian defeated Nanxing (Women) 21-11, 21-10.

Huayan A defeated Jinyuan (Men's A)

Huayan A's front row, Wang Junbing, relied on Qian Jiaxiang's powerful attacks, as did Weng Chengguang. However, Jinyuan defended effectively, once taking the lead at 7-5, two points ahead of Huayan. After much back and forth, Huayan A took the lead with 11-9 to win the right to change sides. After that, the situation changed, and Huayan suddenly jumped ahead, ending the first set at 21-13. Liang Weiyi's serve also contributed a lot.

In the second set, Jinyuan served first and showed some energy, repeatedly tying the score. However, Huayan A gradually took the lead by one or two points. This set ended at 21-14.

Huayan continued to take the lead in the third set. At the change of sides, it was 11-4. Huayan was in "strict formation" awaiting the attack. Jinyuan's front row, Xu Mouliang, displayed a few closing techniques, but the final result was 21-6.

Yongsha defeated Huayan B (Men's B)

Yongsha was full of talent, and Huayan B was naturally no match for their sharpness. However, looking at the stalemate between the two armies, Huayan B can also be called a very promising team, and the future should be watched with admiration. Moreover, many of the team's players have been promoted to Huayan's A team, and their strength has decreased accordingly last night.

Watching Yongsha's quick and heavy set and spike was amazing. In terms of the height of the players, none were below five and a half feet, and many were also Minyue athletes and Shanghai basketball stars.

### Checks Cannot Be Cashed on the Same Day; Significant Impact on Industry and Commerce; Banking Association Suggests Compromise: Providing Guarantees to Allow Same-Day Cashing

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the Ministry of Finance's investigation into the practice of allowing financial institutions to cash checks on the same day, our reporter specifically consulted with a leading authority in the city's financial sector. The authority stated: "There is no basis in the negotiable instruments law for allowing same-day cashing of checks that have not yet been received. From the perspective of banking and financial practices, it is also not within the scope of business. Therefore, there is no such thing as a 'ban' on same-day cashing in the financial sector." However, it will inevitably impact the turnover of general industrial and commercial sales. Currently, due to inflation, the receipt, settlement, and payment of funds are moving into the hundreds of millions. Checks are virtually the only means of payment. Furthermore, due to the practice of allowing same-day cashing of checks, the financial sector is implicitly providing industry and commerce with the convenience of one day's advance in capital turnover. If this is abruptly banned, industry and commerce will definitely feel greatly inconvenienced. If same-day checks are to be cashed, the funds must be raised and deposited overnight. Those who previously used same-day checks will now have to use large amounts of cash, which will inevitably create a shortage of cash."

[Another Report] It is reported that the city's Banking and Commercial Association, in order to reduce the inconvenience caused by checks not being cashed on the same day, has specifically suggested a compromise to the authorities. For customers who cash checks on the same day, they will be required to issue a guarantee, providing a definite assurance of payment within the amount of the funds cashed. This suggestion is still awaiting final approval from the financial authorities.

Furthermore, according to opinions from the four banks and two bureaus, from the perspective of national banks and bureaus, same-day cashing cannot be allowed to avoid bounced checks. The four banks and two bureaus not only do not allow it now, but also did not allow it in the past. If same-day checks could be cashed, it would be equivalent to increasing inflation. Commercial banks, on the other hand, are mostly accommodating with same-day cashing in order to increase deposits. In reality, in order to stabilize the business of the banking and financial sector itself and to curb inflation, same-day cashing of checks should definitely be prohibited.

According to a person in charge of the National Federation of Banking Associations: This move is to consolidate the original intent of commercial credit, and the number of returned checks in the future may be reduced as a result.

### Selling Pressure Envelops the Market; Chinese Stocks Retreat Downstream

Yesterday, most Chinese stocks, except for No. 235, were released into the market in almost their entirety. The money supply tightened, and the buying protection was lost. No. 32 and others even engaged in short selling. Therefore, from morning to noon, under the consistent pressure of selling, they succumbed to the bottom. Resistance was weak in the middle, and at the close, all popular stocks ended at low prices.

The market opened weakly. Delivery of Yongsha opened considerably lower. After opening, No. 60, No. 91, No. 153, No. 160, No. 4, No. 97, No. 157, No. 152, No. 76, and No. 32 were sold, and the market fell to 237 yuan. Nos. 218, 106, and 178 took advantage of the low prices to buy and slightly stabilize the market. Nos. 32, 152, 224, 103, 60, 212, and 154 were sold in large quantities, and No. 89 even sold spot Yongsha aggressively, pushing the price down to 229 yuan and 223 yuan. After 10:00 AM, Nos. 158, 85, 95, 219, and 218 took the opportunity to buy, but only pulled the price up by two yuan. Nos. 45, 197, 231, 32, and 162 were sold in large quantities, and No. 67 sold spot Yongsha in large quantities. After 10:45 AM, delivery of Yongsha also broke below 230 yuan. Nos. 16, 224, 97, 162, 169, 186, and 142 all sold. Nos. 202, 177, and 190 sold spot Yongsha in large quantities. In the afternoon, delivery of Yongsha fell to 225 yuan and then rebounded slightly, while spot Yongsha closed at a low price of 222 yuan. No. 141 supplied Xingguang, and the chips loosened, so it also closed at a low price.

After the close, delivery of Yongsha bids were initially low and then high, initially dropping to 224 yuan, and then closing at 227 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, delivery and spot shares of Yongsha, Huafeng, and Xingguang fell by about 10%. Meiya, Jingfu, Xinhe, Yonggong, Qinxing, and Zhongfa fell by a strong 5%. Xinhua fell by a weak 5%. Cement, Tongyi, Zhongfang, and Datong fell slightly. Jinglun had few transactions and fell by 15%. Lian and Zhongshen fell by about 10%, and Match fell by a strong 5%.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Decline

Government bonds were generally flat yesterday, while unified bonds continued to weaken due to continued liquidation by multiple parties. Although Room 555 bought, Rooms 230 and 360 sold. After opening at 10,900 yuan, the high price was 11,400 yuan and the low was 10,350 yuan, after which it stabilized slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, Types A, B, D, and E each fell by 100 yuan, and unified Type C fell by 600 yuan. Transactions were approximately 5 million.

Foreign stocks also could not be sustained yesterday and were exhausted. Material and exchange rates further assisted selling, and the weakness of each stock became more apparent. Yisha opened at 90,000 yuan and formed an oversupply, gradually falling to a low price of 85,000 yuan at the close. Jewish merchants still had a buying appetite for steel and paper. Securities firms advanced first and then exited, banks also supplied, foreign firms also scraped, and Guangdong firms sold aggressively at the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson fell slightly, and British American Tobacco, Union Industries, Guangyi, and Beer all fell by about 10%. Yisha Steel fell by a strong 10%, and the remaining stocks all fell by about 5%.

### Spot Cotton Quiet

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was sluggish due to the continued decline in cotton yarn prices. Both supply and demand were weak.

### Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Alliance Negotiates with the Textile Development Corporation for Raw Materials

The Shanghai cotton textile industry, in view of the fact that Japanese goods have historically sold well in Nanyang and have a long history, and that once Japan's foreign trade is opened, Japanese goods will undoubtedly restore their original position in the Nanyang market, leaders Xu Wenzhao and Chuan Liangjun launched a joint cotton textile production and sales alliance company, uniting the shirt, undershirt, sock, handkerchief, towel, blanket, and clothing industries to consolidate our country's market in that region. The preliminary plan is to ship 200,000 machines, 150,000 undershirts, 250,000 towels, 10,000 blankets, 20,000 shirts, and 140,000 handkerchiefs to the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines to earn foreign exchange and expand our country's domestic goods market. It is estimated that the above finished products require approximately 3,610 pieces of 16-count, 20-count, 32-count, 40-count, and 42-count yarn, and the processing fees are approximately 34.8 billion yuan. The finished products are valued at 69.2 billion yuan at the initial market price, which is equivalent to 3.5 million US dollars. Because the company lacks raw materials and processing fees, it has submitted a report to the National Economic Commission requesting relevant agencies to allocate them. In principle, the National Economic Commission has already approved the case at its regular meeting on the 12th of last month and has transferred it to the Textile Adjustment Committee and the Four Allied Headquarters for review. In order to actively expand production, the person in charge of the company negotiated with the Textile Development Corporation yesterday regarding the supply of raw materials. It is reported that the Textile Development Corporation strongly agrees with the principle and will continue to discuss the details of supply after the company's organization matures.

### Large Quantities of Japanese Yarn and Cloth Ship Through Shanghai to Nanyang, Totaling Over 5,000 Tons, Estimated at Over 20,000 Pieces

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Dutch ship Chizdaney, which sailed from Shanghai to Kobe at the end of last month, returned from Japan to Shanghai the day before yesterday (3rd), transiting through Xiamen, Hong Kong, Singapore and other places to return to Surabaya. There were more than 180 passengers in the city and only four suitcases of cargo. However, it carried a considerable amount of cotton yarn and cloth, totaling more than 5,000 tons and estimated at more than 20,000 pieces, from Kobe. This is one of the dynamics of Japan in the Nanyang market. According to import and export merchants, our country cannot operate because it prohibits the transportation and sale of yarn and cloth overseas.

Yarn Market Commentary

Another report: Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened weakly, because sales from Tianjin and Guangdong were sluggish, and there was very little purchasing. Near the close, some scattered sellers were selling off their inventory, and the market was flooded with chips, making the market even weaker. As a result, 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn fell 350,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 16.9 million yuan. 20-count special double Ma 12.3 million, light double Ma 10.4 million, all fell 450,000 yuan. The remaining 30-count Da Nu Jincheng Ren Zhong, 16-count Sanming Hongfeng, 10-count Jinbao Xing, and 42-count Shuiyue, 40-count Jixiang Baoguang and other coarse and fine yarns all continued to fall by 200,000 to 400,000 or 500,000 yuan.

Cloth Market Dull

Another report: Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw traders attempt to push up prices at the opening, but scattered households and dyeing factories frequently sold off their inventory. It was also heard that the Textile Development Corporation has 100,000 bolts of "Four Gentlemen" brand, "Golden Seal" Yuan Bijin in stock and is selling them off in succession. Furthermore, the Cantonese and Hubei merchants are having difficulty selling in their local markets, and there is no progress in sales in the local stores, so the market was depressed. By the end of the day, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 426,000 yuan, a drop of 6,000 yuan from the previous day. Five Fortunes Colorful Ball Blue Chicken and other fine cloths also continued to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 or 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

However, it is estimated that only about 60 billion yuan in foreign exchange can be recovered after export, which is a huge loss. It is proposed to submit a report to the Ministry of Finance to ask whether it will bear this loss. Resolution: To be decided after submitting a report to the Ministry of Finance. (5) The price issue for purchasing spring silk. The designated purchase price is 29 million per dan. However, details are pending submission to the Guidance Committee for discussion and decision.

### Silk Weaving Industry Appeals to Authorities to Increase Artificial Silk Quota and Lower Allocation Price to Facilitate Production

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau resumed the allocation of rayon on August 4th, allocating half of the amount requested by each manufacturer, and adjusted the allocation price. Silk weavers in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Shengze and other places, after hearing the news, sent representatives to Shanghai to meet with merchants in the city yesterday afternoon to petition the Central Trust Bureau to request an increase in the quota and a reduction in the allocation price. He Molin, manager of the Purchasing and Barter Department, received them, but the negotiations did not yield results.

In the afternoon, more than 30 representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau to visit Director Wu, explaining the current difficulties of the silk weaving industry. If they are not resolved, the factories will be forced to close one after another, and more than 100,000 employees will inevitably lose their jobs. Director Wu was very concerned about this, inquiring in detail about the current situation of the silk weaving industry, and immediately called President Zhang of the National Bank, arranging to visit him at 7:00 PM that evening to discuss a proper solution. A decision on this issue may be reached in the coming days.

Liu Qingyi, executive director of the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association, told reporters that the silk weaving industry uses rayon and spun silk as raw materials. After the victory, rayon was shipped from Japan to Shanghai by the Central Trust Bureau exclusively and allocated to various factories. The allocation price was lower than the market price. In June of this year, each box was 9.6 million yuan, while the cost of the Central Trust Bureau was less than 4 million yuan. However, the allocation was stopped after June and has been stopped for more than a month. More than 300 silk weaving factories in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Shengze and other places are mostly only partially operating due to the lack of raw materials and difficulties in exporting, and the situation is very uncertain. Silk weaving factories in Shanghai are therefore discussing the issuance of wage discounts, which is still being mediated by the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee. The Central Trust Bureau resumed allocation from the 4th, but the allocation price has increased to 22.6 million yuan per box. The black market price is 24.6 million yuan, but the allocation requires payment one week in advance. If the interest rate is calculated, the allocation price is already equal to the black market price. Merchants in Suzhou and Hangzhou were shocked when they heard the news and came to Shanghai to discuss requesting a reduction in the allocation price, otherwise they would be unable to maintain operations and would have to close their factories. As for the quota, Shanghai had a total of 2,900 boxes in December last year, but it was reduced to more than 400 boxes in June of this year, which was not enough for allocation, so an increase in the quota was requested.

Another report: Yesterday's rayon market did not change much, and transactions were very quiet. The market opened yesterday with No. 120 Takayama Arikawa at 25 million yuan. The closing price at noon was 5.2 million yuan. The unsold goods from yesterday's allocation were not allocated yesterday, so the holders were still struggling. The closing price was up 200,000 yuan at 5.4 million yuan, up 400,000 yuan from the previous day. The factory Jing yesterday's market was very quiet, and all levels of Gao Sidu lacked transactions, but because the chips were exhausted, the asking prices were all raised by 500,000 yuan. Silk goods and silk quilts opened down. Huaqiang goods were first called at 10.545 million yuan, and finally sold at 530,000 yuan. Dacheng goods were made at a maximum of 580,000 yuan for the spot price, and the closing price was 550,000 yuan. There were very few transactions of checkered crepe, and the asking price was similar to the previous day. The production areas of Sheng Huo Chong electric spinning and foreign spinning reported price increases, the former by 10,000 yuan and the latter by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

### Silk Weaving Industry Loans Four Allied Banks Approve Standard: 5 Million per Machine

At 5 million yuan per loom, the total loan amount will reach more than 30 billion yuan. It is heard that many member factories of the Association obtained production loans last year. Before applying for new loans this year, they must first complete the procedures for settling the old loans.

Legal Interpretation: Dumping of Foreign Goods Leads to Factory Closures and Debt Disputes

Editor: A invested in opening a factory in January last year. At first, the business was good, but recently, due to the impact of foreign goods, it closed down with debts and auctioned off some of its assets to repay debts. Friend B has lent money to A several times, agreeing to use machinery, assets, and houses as collateral. C rented the entire factory building from A in November last year for a term of two years, with the monthly rent specified as a percentage of the products. D holds the factory's bounced checks and warehouse receipts and filed a lawsuit in court after the factory closed. May I ask: (1) B's mortgage has not been cleared and he can freely dispose of the factory property, but he knows that the factory has been rented to C. Now he knows that D has come to enforce the valuation and auction first. How should he deal with it? (2) C rented from A in November last year, but the lease was not certified by the court. Is this lease valid? (3) If D has enforced the auction, can C apply for an objection? Will it affect the leasehold right?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers] (1) The mortgage has not been cleared, and it is not "free to dispose of." If the mortgage right has been legally established, then "the mortgage right will not be affected by the transfer of the mortgaged property to others, and the exercise of its right of pursuit will not be affected by the auction of the mortgaged property by the court. Therefore, after the mortgaged property is auctioned by the court at the request of ordinary creditors, the mortgagee's failure to request liquidation of the proceeds only results in the loss of this opportunity to claim compensation, and since his mortgage right has not been extinguished, he can exercise the right of pursuit against the auctioneer." (2) The lease contract is also valid even if it is not certified by the court. (3) All stable transfers to third parties, the lease contract still exists for the transferee, and D's execution of the auction does not affect C's leasehold right.

### New Gas Price Not Overcharged

Reply to Reader Cai Liangzhi

I have received a letter from your Social Service Department, stating that it has received a letter from reader Cai Liangzhi, stating that the Shanghai Gas Company's overcharged price increases the extra burden on users, and requested a reply with the original letter attached. The reason for the adjustment of gas prices this time is initially due to the lifting of the cost of living index, followed by the abolition of central subsidies and the sharp increase in the price of allocated coal. Therefore, the prices of various public utilities have to be increased month by month to balance revenue and expenditure, and the business will not stop. It is not just gas. As for the new prices adjusted by gas several times, it is stipulated that it will start from the date of meter reading. After checking Mr. Cai's bill, the company is handling it in accordance with the regulations and has not overcharged. Corresponding reply, please check and inform. This is to the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau of Shen Bao.

### Tennyson, Poet Laureate of the Victorian Era in England

— Rolandzi

The literature and art of the Victorian era in England were obviously in an era of peace and prosperity, just like the Elizabethan era. The rise of democracy and the achievements of the industrial revolution gradually introduced a new trend of realism into romantic literature and art.

In the Victorian era, the most accomplished poet was Alfred Tennyson. His poems have been recited everywhere by the British people for nearly 50 years, just like Shakespeare's plays, because he can write the voice of the people into poetry. His poems have become a powerful expression of the people's joy and suffering, just like a member of parliament speaking for the people in parliament, and its power is a hundred times greater. His poems combine the strengths of Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Scott, Byron, etc.! He is a representative of Victorian writers.

Tennyson was born on August 6, 1809, in the residence of the parish priest of "Somersby" in Lincolnshire, England. The natural environment there nurtured the poet's inspiration early on. Tennyson began writing poetry at the age of twelve, and later entered Trinity College of Cambridge University with his brother. In his second year, he wrote a poem that was extremely brilliant and won an honorary medal.

In the summer of 1830, he and Hallam, influenced by Cologne, also ran to the Italian revolutionary party to participate in activities! He marched in the Pyrenees Mountains to resist the Italian Emperor.

In 1831, Tennyson's father died, and the family was poor and could no longer pursue a degree at the university. He stayed at home for six years to concentrate on studying and writing poetry in his spare time.

In the autumn of 1832, his close friend Hallam died suddenly. Tennyson was discouraged and rarely wrote for ten years, but his "In Memoriam," written to mourn Hallam, is as famous as his "Idylls of the King."

In 1842, his collection of poems (Poems) was published, and modern narrative poems were also printed in it. After publication, it caused a sensation among the public, and his fame as a poet rose sharply.

In 1847, he published a long poem of three thousand lines, "The Princess," which was very popular.

In 1850, he was elected "Poet Laureate," continuing the title of Wordsworth. In the same year, he married Emily Sellwood, Hallam's sister, whom he had admired for thirteen years. Later, he was summoned and rewarded by Queen Victoria. In 1864, he wrote "Enoch Arden," and his reputation became even greater.

After 1872, he tried drama to explain the difficulties of England's founding and encourage the people's patriotism. He wrote "Queen Mary," "Harold," "Becket," "The Cup," "The May Queen," "Becket," "The Foresters," and other plays. Naturally, he was not as proficient as he was in writing poetry, and his achievements were not as great as Shakespeare's.

On October 6, 1892, he died of illness at his retreat. On the 12th, he was buried in public.

Tennyson's writing style is to speak for the people. His poems are concise and powerful, and have a philosophical meaning. His style is the opposite of that of his contemporary poet Browning, and he will always live in the hearts of most people.

### The Humor of the Violin Virtuoso

— Qiu Ping

The unprecedented violin virtuoso Paganini (N. Paganini) hired a carriage to perform. The coachman asked him for double the money. Mr. Paganini asked why he wanted double? The coachman said: "Why does your performance cost twice as much as others?" Mr. Paganini said: "I can cut two of the four strings and play. Can you take off half of the wheels?"

### Rainy Night

— Li Weichu

One

Now, I have learned to be silent. My heart cries in silence, my lips are tightly closed because of silence, and my eyes are watching because of silence. Unspoken words make me deeply understand the meaning of profoundness. I think I will never speak again. If words are vulgar, selfish, cruel, and lose the preciousness of language; if words bring resentment, disaster, and harm, then I would rather shut my mouth forever. The deaf-mute are wise listeners.

Two

How many times, I hate my sincerity!

When lies are more beautiful than truth,

When falsehoods are sweeter than truth,

I am saddened and even ashamed to tears for my own stupidity and foolishness. At this time, I hate myself! I hate why I can't lie? I hate why I can't be false? At that time, I cursed myself even more!

Three

How many times, I even more blamed myself: Why can't you bear it? Why can't you deceive yourself and others? That is obviously not your business, why do you have to argue with others until your face turns red? That coal ball is obviously black, but people say it is white; why can't you admit it?

Four

That person is obviously a scumbag, but you think of him as a hero; that person is obviously a well-known hypocrite, but you think of him as a generous and righteous knight; that person is obviously a little almsgiving, but you return it with deep affection; that person is obviously leisure, but you use it with a lifetime of love; what glasses are you wearing? Are your eyes blinded by nobility? Is your soul deceived by holiness? Five years, ten years, the tide goes out, the stones are exposed, and then; you know you are wrong, you regret, resent, but what's the use? Everything has been washed away by mistakes, you should still curse your own stupidity!

Five

The wind and rain are beating, roaring, and crying outside the window. The night is quieter than death, and the sound of frogs is like an endless cry. Isn't the wind also bringing the cry of the universe to the world? At this time, in this situation; the soul encounters the deep tranquility of the night, as if it has been baptized by sadness, so it is as clear as water, as clear as a mirror. At this time, you can't forgive yourself for even a little flaw! The only thing that can be respected is wisdom and reason. Emotion is just a dizzy teenager of seventeen or eighteen years old. Although it is innocent, it is so cute, but it is ridiculously naive and stupid. If you understand the deep tranquility and distant meaning of autumn, and at the same time you recall the disasters you caused in the spring, you will understand that in the underworld, people do not welcome the real spring, so everything that belongs to spring; innocence, enthusiasm, straightforwardness, and the real revelation of human nature are not welcomed by people at this time, and are regarded as stupid, naive, and ridiculous...

Six

——Then, when is the time when spring is welcomed? When is the time when mankind expresses its whole truth?

I don't know, but our hearts know. Haven't our hearts demanded the same? When this voice in your heart rises again, you will know that this time must not be far away, and it will not be too far away from you. Then you will believe that mankind is not heading towards destruction, but towards light, towards happiness, towards good and evil, just like from night to dawn.

### Love

— Xu Minghuai

Remember the past years like flowing water, remember the past love like a dream, the tide of memory flows circuitously through the river of the heart, and the beautiful piano sound plays on the strings of the heart...

Remember once standing by the bridge, gazing at the clear sand and water, reflecting the blue sky, milky white clouds, the lush green grass, and the trembling reeds; the fine waves murmuring slightly, and rushing forward affectionately.

Is life always so busy! Is life always so leisurely and quiet!

The answer is a string of smiles like the morning glow

"Ding Dong"! A piece of gravel slid down, breaking the clear water and sky, the ripples are charming whirlpools, rippling, rippling.

It's just a small wave in the process of life, and there are countless waves, big, big, small... in the days to come.

Remember once walking on the outskirts of the city, bathing in the golden waves of light, the gentle dance clothes of the evening wind brushed over; listening to a chorus of frogs, accompanied by the songs of the wind that came quietly and went quietly, watching the clouds floating slowly in the blue sky, and the distant mountains lying leisurely, in the moving mood, drawing a trace of reverie, floating to a distant place - this should be a surreal enjoyment, an unparalleled enjoyment.

Let's go to make a green dream under the green willow tree! Seek the "love in the dream", the warmth of love, and the evergreen of warmth.

Remember once sitting deep in the building, listening to the pattering rain, gently hitting the roof tiles, and the eaves leakage began its ups and downs of playing, from light to heavy, from slow to fast.

Turn on the red bean-like oil lamp, and look at the quiet surroundings of the room, with endless flavors of lovesickness and lingering tenderness. Leaning together, reading the poems of the philosophers, making subtle murmurs, listening to the even ups and downs of breathing, the gentle beating of the pulse, and the silent exchange of heart electricity. Let the boundless night go on! There is no longer a lonely self in the world.

Remember once rowing in the heart of the lake, the lights on the lake, wandering in the vast night fog, blinking drowsily, a trace of crescent light, gently sifted down the lake, the stars smiling in the ripples, the yachts playfully kissed on the sparkling scales, and a clear song sounded in my ears:

Eyes flow

Half shy

Flowery demon

Willow-like tenderness

Infinite pain

In the heart

A light smile

Forget my worries...

The sound of oars is accompanied by the singing, the singing harmonizes with the sound of oars, the singing, the sound of oars, shaking the cool lake water at night, shaking the cool moonlit night, is a symphony with a beautiful melody and sonorous tone, is a string of beautiful spring dreams that are ethereal and distant.

Remember countless good times, countless dreams, endless songs, poems, endless poetic feelings, love!

Love is a glass of orange drunk wine, exuding a rich fragrance; love is a petite and exquisite bud, pregnant with infinite vitality; is a beautiful rainbow after the rain, hanging over the long sky; is the first spring thunder before "awakening of insects", passing over the layers of clouds; is the music lingering in the heart, is a colorful picture, is the laughter of the heart, the exchange of youth!

Cherish laughter, cherish youth, do not let cunning steps steal the precious years, let the colorful piano sound slip away, the fiery love, the buds in the heart, bloom a scarlet flower in the golden days.

### Swallow

— Minzi

As early as spring, the swallows put on a dazzling coat of purplish-brown and came from the other side of the ocean.

They spoke cheerful words, and in the beams, they used their own saliva and mud to build a warm nest. It seemed that I had never heard them say love words. I don't know when this pair of distant lovers laid eggs, and I don't know when they hatched the swallows. The swallows put their tender yellow mouths on the edge of the nest, and cried like that.

The old swallows no longer seemed to have the leisure to sing so happily in the beams. They put all their divine power on the younger generation. They flew to the fields, catching dragonflies, butterflies and other small insects to feed their children. Seeing the father or mother coming back with something in their mouths, the swallows opened their yellow mouths and clamored.

The old swallows staying by the nest carefully watched over their children, fearing that snakes and mice sneaking from the beams would take them away. Sometimes, the old swallows used their mouths to peck off the mud and dead cars stuck to the swallows, or combed their feathers that were not yet full... What a delicate care and noble love!

For the continuation of life, they are breeding their offspring. In order to cultivate their offspring, they have exhausted their efforts!

Now, the swallows' feathers have become full under hard feeding. They can fly with the old swallows in the clear blue sky, and they have also learned to catch flying insects. So the old swallows murmured in the beams again. This is a song of joy, their efforts have been rewarded.

When autumn came, they returned to the south. The old swallows were swallowed by the giant waves when they crossed the ocean because of the depletion of their divine power. Only those young and strong children flew back.

The fate of the old swallows is certainly sad, but the greatest comfort can be found from those later generations who are stronger than themselves.

### "Guiyang Bridge"

— Lu Lian

The color of this bridge is really fresh, it is bright red. Red like fire, and like blood. How many people standing at the head of the bridge are not constantly laughing at the bottom of their hearts? This is really ingenious. The person who painted this bridge must have a lot of experience and have seen a lot of green grass and flowers. How can the name be so special? In the bustling metropolis of the southeast, it is named after a city in Guizhou Province. This is a bit strange, maybe the other side is the underworld, who knows, there are many mysterious things in the world. So no matter what, don't cross it, people should be careful. Let's stand on this bridge, rest, and if no one accompanies you, there are clouds and water, which is not considered lonely. There are trees on the bridge. What, there are trees on the bridge? I don't believe it. Ah, it is the unruly trees growing on the shore. What does this mean? One of its branches passed through the bridge railing, understand? Speaking of the railing, the railing is also a bit strange. This is not wood, wood will not be so thin, so is this lead wire? It doesn't look like it very much. Look around, your eyes can't just stay in front of you. The surroundings are full of trees. Trees, trees, all trees. There is grass, the grass is too chaotic, who is in charge of this place, so unruly. Huh, how come there is a rainbow on the right side, no, I said it wrong, it is red, a red line. Not too big or too small, like a bridge but not a bridge, what is this place? Go and see, you must not miss the opportunity to broaden your eyes. Don't go forward, how dare you guarantee that the other side of Guiyang Bridge is not the underworld? Right side, right side, go back the same way. ...Ah, it's still a bridge. The bridge name is still Guiyang Bridge. There are several kinds of small birds on the head, the small birds are comfortable, they sing so happily. My companion called me on the bridge where I just stood. Annoying, I walk slowly, and I have to exploit other people's time to walk the bridge. Ask him: Why is Guiyang Bridge called Guiyang? "I don't know," so simply, I don't like this kind of straightforwardness, it spoils other people's interest and makes a fool of myself, it is better not to say anything. What's wrong, urging me to hurry? Okay, raising your legs will leave ten miles behind. If it weren't for the sake of Guiyang Bridge, I would be angry with you.

### Beethoven's Poverty and Death

— Oriental Mist

At the end of November 1826, Beethoven suffered from a meningitis cold and fell ill in Vienna. After being ill for several months and undergoing several operations, the money was used up. He had no choice but to write to the London Music Society and Micesels in England in early March (1827), asking them to try their best to organize a concert to help him. The Music Society immediately sent him 100 pounds as an advance payment. He was very grateful for this matter. "It was a heartbreaking sight," said a friend who was present at the time, "to see him receive the letter, clasp his hands together, and moan with joy and gratitude." In gratitude, his wound reopened. And he also wanted to dictate a letter of thanks to those "noble Englishmen who sympathize with my miserable fate"; he promised to write a work for them: the tenth symphony, or an overture, whatever they pleased. "I have never," he said, "undertaken a work with so much, as I am writing this work." The letter was written on March 18, but on the 26th of the same month, in a snowstorm, our generation of "Music Saint" died.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

However, there was one small thing that left him with some resentment. You see, Yaoqun had bought him a pair of new leather shoes. These shoes had been personally inspected by Yaoqun, so of course they were flawless. The leather was a loose, yellowish color, with a subtle sheen, exactly like the ones worn by foreign devils and Chinese university students, lacking nothing at all. Furthermore, although Little Tiger was joining the formal army, there were no restrictions on officers' attire, so Yaoqun had also gotten him a set of military uniforms, a military cap, and an ordinary golden collar badge. Yaoqun thought that he might occasionally need to attend banquets or group appearances, so Little Tiger had to have a set of presentable clothing. In addition, there was, of course, a bit of encouraging intention behind it. This whole set of luggage, in this "returning in glory" performance, if actually worn in its entirety, how glorious it would be to see his mother, his sixth uncle, his maternal great-uncle, and the many elders, peers, and subordinates in the village? But on the day of the troop withdrawal from Beiping, Yaoqun had hidden this beautiful outfit, leaving only the pair of leather shoes.

This time, going back to the old village, even though they had that "Pass" as a talisman, they could encounter countless checkpoints along the way, with inspections that could turn everything inside out. So, the two only wore their original clothes, with a few changes of clothes packed into two small bundles. Even the new leather shoes, only worn once or twice, were left behind in Beiping because they didn't match their clothes. This one point, just this one point, made Little Tiger feel greatly disappointed. Every time he thought about it, he had to grit his teeth and glare. But when he thought about how he had already become a "squad leader" and the secret mission of this trip, he threw this worry aside.

When the car arrived in Pan Yang, Yaoqun thought that there would be a lot of trouble, so he had warned Little Tiger many times to be especially careful, cautious, and patient, and not to say a word if possible, so as not to cause trouble and delay the main purpose. However, as soon as the car entered the station, the two felt something different, unlike the previous situation. The first thing was the calmness, an unusual calmness. Usually, there would be various strange shouts as soon as they got off the car. People getting off the car would have to line up on the platform, inspect their luggage, interrogate their origin and destination, and check "Border Crossing Permits," "Identity Cards," "Passes," "Vaccination Certificates," "Protection Certificates,"... If there was any doubt, they would not only get slapped in the face, but also have to provide a guarantor.

This time, the two got off the car, each with a small bundle in their hand, and had already placed all kinds of documents within reach. But the platform was quiet and orderly, and there was no such thing as lining up. No one came to interrogate them; they could leave the station as soon as they got off. At the station entrance, there was only a ticket collector and two traffic police officers performing their ticket collection duties. There were no other troubles. This was truly beyond the expectations of the two.

Yaoqun felt this was strange, but he couldn't ask about it, and didn't want to stir up trouble. As soon as they left the station, he glanced around and got into a taxi, giving the driver a place name.

It was only a little after seven in the afternoon. Usually, along the streets this car passed, although not very lively at this time, there would still be people coming and going in a constant stream. But Yaoqun and Little Tiger, sitting in the car, didn't see many people walking. Some of the shops along the street had already closed their doors, and some were busy closing. This scene, as Yaoqun saw it, was like a mystery. Little Tiger had, of course, also seen this, and wanted to say something several times, but Yaoqun stopped him.

When they arrived at the designated location, in front of a hostel, as soon as the car stopped, they saw a person who looked like a receptionist rushing down the steps to greet them. Little Tiger, who had been feeling stifled for more than thirty hours, wanted to move around a bit. He smiled, raised his hand, and gave the person who came to greet him a warm gesture. Upon seeing this, the person seemed a bit surprised and only nodded slightly.

### Please Contribute Generously

— Taisheng

Another appeal for the families of martyred journalists

After this magazine published an article by Mr. Wang Dian on behalf of the Zhu Xinggong family, the Jialin Scholarship Board generously donated one million yuan and requested this newspaper to launch a fundraising campaign for journalists who died during the war of resistance, providing generous pensions.

Since this newspaper published the donation announcement, donations from all sides have been very enthusiastic, showing that society is willing to contribute generously to the families of loyal and martyred journalists.

The situation of Shanghai journalists fighting against the enemy puppet regime during the enemy puppet period is difficult for those who have not experienced it firsthand to imagine. At that time, enemy puppet scouts were everywhere, explosions occurred around various newspaper offices, hand grenades, sulfur bombs, and shrapnel flames were flying, and thugs from "76th" were lurking around the newspaper offices, waiting for an opportunity to attack journalists. At that time, the lives of journalists were in as much danger as fighting on the front lines.

However, the "paper bullets" full of fighting spirit, resilience, and unyieldingness still selflessly and loyally shone and shot at the shameless and despicable enemy puppets, letting them know that although Shanghai had become an isolated island, the banner of justice was still fluttering in the sky of Shanghai; although the national army had withdrawn westward, Shanghai journalists, using "pen barrels" instead of "gun barrels", were still leading all Shanghai citizens in defending the motherland!

Zhu Jinggong, Zhang Sixu, Cheng Zhenzhang, Li Junying, Jin Huating, Shao Xubai..., and other martyred journalists, in order to defend the motherland and promote justice, they fell under the banners of the motherland, in a pool of splendid and glorious blood... Their loyalty is touching, and their bravery can be a model for journalists.

Victory has been two years, but the lives of the families of martyred journalists are not guaranteed. Shanghai citizens who love the motherland and journalists hope to contribute generously, so as to accumulate contributions and distribute them to the families of martyred journalists, in order to comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven.

Starting tomorrow, this magazine will publish the sacrifices of martyred journalists one after another. I hope you will understand and participate in this great event!

### Letter from America

— Translated by Zhengming

Although any discussions in America about the Wedemeyer mission to China are still somewhat speculative, it is becoming increasingly clear that those in power in Washington have decided to provide assistance to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and Wedemeyer's trip to China is reportedly to uncover evidence that can serve as a basis for "revising" American policy. The State Department's view, if it can be called a view, is this: After Marshall returned home and personally submitted a report on China that blamed "both sides," Truman could not legitimately modify policy without the activities of another "fact-finding" mission, although no one believes that Wedemeyer can add anything to the reports and analysis already received by the State Department from various personnel in China.

The plan for Wedemeyer to include Korea in his itinerary, a State Department bigwig told me, is just "a reference" and has no major significance.

Aid to Korea Plan Shelved

Before this matter is announced, the State Department will first declare - if various current plans can mature - that they will not, in any case, ask Congress to approve any aid to Korea this year. It is said that their statement will explain to Korea that they have decided to incorporate Korea into the entire global economic aid program at the next congressional meeting. And the date of the congressional meeting, unless Truman convenes a special session this autumn, will probably be held in January next year, giving the Koreans a bitter pill with a sugar coating.

The reason why the plan to aid Korea was abandoned is this:

Republican congressional leaders told State Department officials at the last minute that they had no hope of obtaining $78 million to aid Korea this year. Senator Vandenberg has flatly refused to agree to announce this policy through his Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Eaton, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the State Department that he was willing to bring this case up for discussion, but no action could be taken on it during the 1947 session of Congress, because congressmen are generally terrified of the topic of foreign aid. Joe Martin told the State Department the same thing. The $137 million allocated by the Department of the Army to Korea for "internal administration functions" will include some reconstruction funds, but not much, because most of it will be used for occupation costs and food relief.

America shields Japan

Because Japan is where the United States wants to spend the most money to support this old enemy, the United States is obviously making the most effort and is treating it as the top priority in promoting Japan's economic recovery. Whether right or wrong, most American officials now hold the old view of the British that the Japanese are the only people in the East who can do business well. In addition, there is currently a desire to establish some kind of anti-Soviet fortress in the Far East, and the Japanese are in a key location and can be the United States' temporary favorite.

Now that the Soviet Union has indicated that it intends to boycott the preliminary meeting of the Japanese peace treaty in August, the world clearly sees that a hopeless deadlock is finally unavoidable. Washington's current belief is that the United States will insist on leading the holding of the Japanese peace conference, whether the Soviet Union participates or not, because if it yields, it will be said to be some kind of retreat, and Marshall has said that he will not take this kind of retreat.

Lamenting the Indonesian War

The State Department is devoutly praying for the poor Indonesians and the Viet Minh government of Vietnam every night, but it doesn't seem to be able to do anything effective. Today they are expressing their pain over the Dutch re-launching the war against the Indonesians, but tomorrow they may issue a wonderful and ridiculous little notice expressing "regret" over the outbreak of the conflict, but there will be no other action.

The Netherlands obtained materials under wartime agreement conditions, and the lend-lease materials obtained at that time are now being used to fight the Indonesians, and the United States has reason to take them back. However, Washington officials say that if the United States wants to exercise the right of retrieval, it will cause too much trouble. For the sake of our American money, it doesn't seem harmful to try it, and we should notify the Netherlands that we will no longer give them Export-Import Bank loans or other financial assistance until they really know that they are living in the twentieth century. The same should be done for the French in Vietnam.

### Guanyin Attainment

— Lu Shi

The nineteenth day of the sixth lunar month is the Buddhist holy day of Guanyin's attainment. Due to legends turned into dramas, the performances on Great Fragrant Mountain have made some people deeply believe that Guanyin Bodhisattva is the third daughter of King Miaozhuang. At the same time, because the images sculpted in the temples are generally female, it further confirms that the Great Master achieved Buddhahood as a woman.

In fact, the Buddhist doctrine holds that the four elements are empty and there is no form, so where does the distinction between male and female come from? As for the sculpting of female images and the myth of King Miaozhuang, it is a symbol and not a fact.

Originally, Buddha Sakyamuni was born in the dark ages of ancient India and witnessed the heavy karmic obstacles of that time. He was extremely sad about his view of life, and he was willing to give up the nobility of the crown prince and enter the mountains to seek enlightenment, hoping to transcend the world and save himself. Later, he was greatly enlightened and realized that saving himself by escaping the world was still a small self, so he resolved to enter the world to save others and complete the great self. The so-called saving oneself by escaping the world is Tathagata, and saving others by entering the world is Bodhisattva. In other words, Tathagata takes negative emptiness as the highest ideal, and Guanyin takes compassion and salvation as a sacred mission.

The Buddha Dharma is vast and boundless, planting causes according to circumstances and proving fruits according to sounds, so it is said that the Buddha has billions of incarnations. Wonderful Form Tathagata is one of the Buddha's incarnations. The Chinese character for 'wonderful' is composed of 'young' and 'woman'. The heart of a young woman is the most compassionate, so the Bodhisattva uses a young woman as a symbol. White clothes indicate purity, and purple bamboo represents spiritual communication. Guanshiyin from Purple Bamboo Spirit Mountain is the Buddha, and the Buddha is King Miaozhuang. The three are one, and there is no so-called father-daughter relationship.

Good men and believing women, if only you have compassionate hearts, promote your spirit of universal love, and grasp your pure beliefs, the Western Paradise is close at hand. The Pure Land exists in your heart, so why must you pilgrimage to famous mountains to cultivate yourself!

### Miscellaneous Notes from America

— Xu Shuyuan

Every country has its own unique customs and human feelings. Although the British and Americans belong to the same ancestry, their lifestyles are sometimes so different that it is hard to believe. Even in terms of clothing alone, there are huge differences. The British like to wear shorts, but Americans absolutely do not wear short suit pants. You can't find anyone wearing shorts and walking boldly on the streets in the United States. They have a very obscene interpretation of people wearing shorts, so people who go to America from England or India have to treasure their short suit pants to avoid being laughed at. Even in the summer, despite short-sleeved shirts, the pants are always long. The clothes worn by women in the summer are simply unbelievably thin. Those that are more cumbersome wear long pants and mesh shirts, and those that go a step further wear short white drill pants, just like the Chinese old-fashioned apron. Some simply wear bras and triangular pants connected into one piece. This kind of seductive clothing is most common in the southern provinces, and less common in large cities like New York. American women almost never wear socks in the summer. First, nylon socks are not easy to buy, and second, wearing socks does not contribute to beauty at all. So sock shops are deserted in the summer. Smart exporters learned that Chinese women have a sock-wearing habit and are willing to pay the highest price, so they smuggled all the nylon socks at a price of one yuan per pair to Shanghai to sell at a high price. Most of those silk socks are large sizes, suitable for American women, and it always feels inappropriate to put them on the small legs of Chinese women. American women have a habit of wearing flowers, but because fresh flowers are not easy to buy, they use paper flowers to decorate. The women in New York, in particular, wear them brightly, just like the court attire of the Manchus. Each of their hair is piled up like Princess Iron Fan in "Si Lang Visits His Mother." (36)

### What Should the New Currency Be Called?

— Yu Jing

The rumor of issuing "Sun Coins" has been around for a long time, but it has never become a reality. The relevant authorities have repeatedly stated that this is not the case, but it will certainly not be groundless. After this war, inflation has soared like a kite, making it difficult to control. Reorganizing the currency is inevitable, but the timing is not yet ripe, and the authorities are cautious and unwilling to prematurely cause adverse effects. Recently, General Wedemeyer came to China and it has been rumored that he will assist our country in reorganizing its finances and reforming its monetary system. Semi-official sources have even revealed that it may be implemented within the year, which shows that the time is not far away!

What will the new currency be called? This is a very interesting question and must be of concern to many people, serving as a topic of conversation over tea and wine. If the name of the new currency is really the rumored "Sun Coin," then the government, in order to praise virtue and reward merit, and to remind the people to remember the great achievements of the national father in leading the revolutionary martyrs to establish the country with difficulty, adopting the national father's surname as the name of the new currency is originally well-intentioned and beyond reproach; however, if we can make the name of the new currency contain more meaning and be more practical, it is still desirable!

If we could know in detail the origin of the names of the currencies of various countries in the world, it would be extremely interesting. Some are just evolved from simple village dialects, some are rich in mythological meaning, and naturally there are also those that use the surnames of emperors or great men, without any fixed rules. However, within the irregularity, there is a new naming rule that is worthy of our reference; that is, the name of the standard currency is evolved from the name of the country, which may be more meaningful and solemn when circulated internationally.

Anyone who pays a little attention to international common sense probably knows that the currency of Bolivia is called Boliva, and before Lithuania and Latvia joined the Soviet Union, their currencies were also called Lit and Lat, respectively. Some people may think that these are small countries and are not enough to be examples. But everyone should not forget that the currency of the French Republic (Frabce) is called the France (France). They are all derived by removing or slightly changing the tail of the country name, which seems to give people a very clear and solemn impression.

In English, China is called China, in French it is called Chine, and the Japanese call us 支那 (Shina), all of which are evolved from the Qin sound. It can be seen that more than 2,000 years ago, the Qin Dynasty's institutions, martial arts, and imperial achievements were enough to be respected by all countries in the world. If I suggest that we name our new currency standard 鎭 (China), it would probably be enough to explain the demeanor of a great ancient country in China without being humble to the honor of being one of the four powers!

It clearly tells those who hold it that this is a Chinese (China) currency, and the side of the character "金" (gold) also tells people that it is omnipotent money and also indicates that it is adopting the gold standard. I think it is undoubtedly the case that our country will adopt the gold standard after reorganizing its monetary system.

"鎮" is a new character, just created by me, but I think everything is changing with each passing day, and it is no longer an era where the Kangxi Dictionary can explain everything.

### The Soviet Atomic City (Part 2)

— Translated by Binzhi

—— Tannu Tuva ——

Tannu Tuva has become a secret den of the Soviet Union. But from newspapers, magazines and government bulletins, between the lines, a little secret can be found. In this vast desert wilderness, there were originally only more than 70,000 people leading a nomadic life. But as Maxwellov said in Soviet Review: the number of Soviets has increased sharply there, and the natives are gradually being Sovietized. From Plaisidim's words, it has gradually become electrified. The entire territory is divided into seventeen electrified districts and four cities. Judging by common sense, there would not be so many villages on the nomadic grasslands. This shows the rapid increase in population, and perhaps the number of Soviets has exceeded the number of natives.

Another passage says that the rivers and lakes of Tannu Tuva have been dredged for many years, and steamships can now travel back and forth there. This inevitably raises the question of how the steamships and riverside machinery were transported? Of course, there are only two ways: land and water. If they are transported by land, it shows that the Soviet railway construction has been secretly expanded to its hinterland. If they are transported by water, it proves that the navigation of the Yenisei River has been successful. From the diaries of scientists, we can see the frequent traffic of cars, which indicates that the highways in Tannu Tuva are also well-connected.

The agricultural development of Tannu Tuva is unknown. However, there are not many workers planting grains on 15 million acres of land. It can be inferred that it must use large-scale mechanized farming like the Soviet Union next to it. At the same time, coal and hydropower are used to match the power stations.

The Soviet government attaches great importance to Tannu Tuva, spending countless money and manpower to develop and build it. In 1946, at least 32 large-scale research institutes were established there, and five scientific expeditions were engaged in mineral resource surveys. If the Soviet Union has an atomic city, it must be in Tannu Tuva.

From these brief fragments, I have obtained a little bit of information, barely drawing a rough outline of the Soviet atomic city - Tannu Tuva. But there is no way to know more unless the Soviet Union opens his mysterious curtains.

Water Margin Anecdotes

### Baozheng

— Aizhu

Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Chao Gai was known as Baozheng. Baozheng, needless to say, is equivalent to the current Baozhang (village head). The Song Dynasty followed the previous dynasties, and Lizheng (ward chief) was set up in the countryside. It was said that a Lizheng would definitely lose money, and the most difficult task was to take turns serving in the local government office, called Yaqian (government servant). Later, the task was exempted, and rural households were used instead. The Lizheng was only in charge of collecting taxes, so it was hard on some wealthy farmers in the countryside, and the Lizheng was no longer a hard job. During the reign of Emperor Shenzong, Wang Anshi implemented the exemption from service law, changing service to recruitment. The people paid a sum of exemption from service money, and should no longer serve. However, after the implementation of the Baojia (household registration) system, Baozheng replaced the original duties of Lizheng. Wang Anshi's plan was to save money. The heavier the duties of the Baojia, the fewer the various services hired by the government could be reduced. Therefore, at that time, Baozheng was responsible for clearing household registrations, capturing thieves, collecting taxes, and training strong men. This situation became more and more serious in the Southern Song Dynasty, and various duties piled up on the Baozheng. For example, sending and receiving palaces, repairing bridges, mending roads, and sending official documents. In addition, superiors had to pay a meeting fee, and after serving, they had to pay a dismissal fee, which was no less difficult than the Lizheng in the early Song Dynasty.

According to the situation of Chao Gai described in Water Margin, it seems that he was quite influential in the countryside before becoming Baozheng. That must have been the situation in the Northern Song Dynasty. If it were in the Southern Song Dynasty, people with more money would not serve this hard job, especially a local tyrant like Chao Gai who had a wide range of acquaintances. Therefore, this also shows that it is a story handed down from the Northern Song Dynasty.
