### The National Economic Commission Discusses Price Controls and Will Implement Effective Multi-faceted Regulations After Deciding on Measures Next Week

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Stabilizing prices was one of the most important issues discussed at the National Economic Commission meeting on the 16th. After the meeting, Chen Qitian and others, who recently went to Shanghai for on-the-spot investigations, reported on their findings. Chen Qitian reported on the work of the Textile Adjustment Committee and the Fuel Management Committee, as well as the reasons for the rise in cloth and coal prices. He pointed out that the price of cloth rose due to the increase in yarn prices, while the price of coal rose due to safety problems in the production areas. Huang Yuanbin reported on the financial investigations in Shanghai and provided reports and analyses on foreign exchange banks. Shi Kuiling reported on the investigation of the prices of daily necessities such as rice, coal, and oil. He Chouxiang also provided a report. During their reports, Chen and others analyzed that the recent price increases were due to psychological and military factors, and that prices in Hong Kong also had an impact on Nanjing and Shanghai. Recently, due to the publication of the "Self-Prepared Foreign Exchange Measures," the National Bank's tightening of funds, the publication of the Pulitzer thesis, and the Shanghai municipal authorities' investigation of yarn supply and sales, prices have tended to stabilize and are currently continuing to fall. The investigations by Chen and others have been completed. Shi Kuiling will return to Shanghai on the evening of the 16th, and Liu Zhendong, who is currently in Shanghai, will also be able to return to Nanjing next Monday or Tuesday. The entire investigation work is expected to be completed by the beginning of next month, at which time the investigators will discuss detailed measures with the relevant ministries and departments, submit them to the National Economic Commission next Thursday, and immediately implement them to effectively control prices in multiple ways. It is heard that future measures may involve both regulatory and comprehensive approaches, that is, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes at the same time. There will also be appropriate measures for how to coordinate technology and policy. Once the measures are decided, they will be implemented immediately. Huang Yuanbin, who also went to Shanghai for investigation, visited President Zhang after returning to Nanjing on the 16th and reported on his findings. It is heard that Huang proposed 15 construction points, including suggestions for improving the black market for foreign exchange, banks, and overseas remittances.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Chambers of commerce and grain industries from various provinces, cities, and counties formed a petition delegation to petition for exemption from grain tax.

Upon arriving at the Ministry of Finance, Minister Yu personally received them and expressed his willingness to consider the matter of exemption and stated that he would not disappoint the representatives.

### The Ministry of Finance Makes Appropriate Adjustments to the Issuance of Circulation Coupons and Taiwan Dollars; Rational Control of Exchange Rates Between the Two Places

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Ministry of Finance News: The separate use of Northeast Circulation Coupons and Taiwan Banknotes in Northeast China and Taiwan was originally a temporary measure taken because the economic conditions in these areas, which had been occupied for a longer period of time, were different from those in the mainland, in order to prevent excessive fluctuations in finance and prices in Northeast China and Taiwan. When the time is right, legal tender will still be used to recover them. At present, the order in Taiwan has just been stabilized, and it is not appropriate to change the currency system abruptly. Furthermore, if the exchange rate is stipulated and legal tender is used at the same time, it is due to the fact that Northeast China has relied on materials from within the customs in the past, and military and public personnel need to remit money to support their families, and there is a tendency for speculative funds to flow into the customs, which will cause funds from Northeast China to flow into Pingjin and other places, which will affect finance and prices in Pingjin. The current approach is to make appropriate adjustments to the issuance of Northeast Circulation Coupons and Taiwan Banknotes, and at the same time, to implement reasonable controls on the exchange rates between Northeast China, Taiwan, and the mainland, in order to stabilize finance and prices in Northeast China and Taiwan, and then to plan a unified approach when the time is right.

### Wedemeyer Asks for Assistance in Improving China's Cultural Standards

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 16th, broadcast: Boston News, it is reported that General Wedemeyer expressed his opinion that the United States should assist China in improving its cultural standards so that the Chinese people can gradually embark on the road to political participation.

### U.S. Policy Declaration on China; Secretary Marshall Has Already Drafted and Will Be Released Soon; Congressman Judd, Representative of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Comes to China for Inspection

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Authoritative sources revealed today that Marshall himself is presiding over the review of the future U.S. policy towards China. The reason why he has not yet released the new policy declaration based on Wedemeyer's report to Truman is partly because Marshall's mission at the United Nations General Assembly is too busy. Truman has delegated this task to Marshall. Regarding the policy declaration on China, it will eventually be released.

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Republican Congressman Auchincloss said: President Truman should immediately recall MacArthur to consult on U.S. Far East policy matters.

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Republican Congressman Judd departed today on behalf of the House Foreign Affairs Committee to inspect China, Japan, and Korea. Before his departure, he said: "It is regrettable that the government is keeping the Wedemeyer investigation report a secret, even from Congress. If I could know a thing or two about the contents of the Wedemeyer report, this work would be simpler. No matter what the report says, it is better to release it than to keep silent. I firmly believe that the United States should resist communism in Asia, just as it does in Europe. We are now discussing appropriating $20 billion, most of which will be used to resist communism in Europe, but many people with insight believe that if we want to effectively stop the expansion of the communist party's influence, our concern for Asia should not be less than our concern for Europe."

According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington, Judd told reporters that he plans to meet with key American officials and expatriates in China and discuss political and economic issues with senior officials of the Chinese government. He met with President Chiang on his last trip to China and hopes to meet with him again this time.

Editorial

### Resurgence of Japanese Conservative Forces

The Japanese conservative new party movement, centered on former Prime Minister and Liberal Party President Shigeru Yoshida and Kizokuin President Tsuneo Matsudaira, has been actively underway since early September. It has recently been joined by former Democratic Party leader Shidehara Kijūrō, Chairman of the House of Councillors Foreign Affairs Committee Ken Shōbu Asa, and several members of the House of Councillors, aiming to seize power before the peace conference is convened. This is a noteworthy issue. If the conservative new party is formed, it may not only overthrow the Katayama Cabinet and cause Japanese politics to regress, but it will also have a significant impact on the future peace conference, rendering the aim of the Potsdam Declaration to "establish a government that is inclined towards peace, democracy, and responsibility" unattainable.

After the war, Japan's conservative forces, including Zaibatsu, capitalists, landlords, and bureaucrats, although temporarily impacted by democratic reforms and threatened by the punishment of war crimes, lay dormant. However, after the thorough reforms diminished, the dormant conservative forces became active again. This was largely due to the moderate and lenient policies of the American administration. Last October, some members of the Liberal and Progressive parties proposed the slogan "Strengthening the national foundation, conserving power," but the time was not ripe, and it failed. Recently, due to the sharp antagonism between the US and the Soviet Union and their differing views on the Japanese peace treaty, and on the other hand, the Socialist Party's anti-capitalist stance, implementing the Economic Power Deconcentration Law and coal nationalization to promote moderate social reforms, aroused attacks from capitalists and landlords. Therefore, the conservative forces saw an opportunity and launched this major coalition movement. Yoshida is a typical bureaucrat of the old era. Liberal Party Secretary-General Ohno and Council Chairman Hoshijima have long been mainstays of the conservative faction. When the Socialist Party came to power, they secretly allied with Tanaka, the vice-president representing the Shidehara faction of the Democratic Party, and contacted stubborn figures like Matsudaira to prepare for the next step in political activity. Tsuneo Matsudaira is the father-in-law of Emperor Hirohito's brother Prince Chichibu, a prominent figure of the old era, and the current president of the House of Councillors. His leadership of the "Ryokufūkai" group, besides Matsudaira as the leader, includes Naotake Satō, Takudō Uematsu, and Kōsaku Noda as mainstays. They represent the interests of capitalists and landlords in the guise of bureaucrats and use the Ryokufū label to encourage the people's blind faith in the Emperor system. Now they stand on the same front as Shidehara Kijūrō, possessing strong power, background, and support, using a pro-American diplomatic policy for the peace conference as a smokescreen and protecting the old forces and opposing social reforms as their policy. Its growth and activity are undoubtedly a manifestation of the darkness and reaction of Japanese politics and the result of the indulgence and appeasement of the American administrative policy.

Katayama is caught in a dilemma in the face of the growing power of the conservative new party. On the one hand, he stated that the government has the ability to handle the peace conference. On the other hand, he firmly implemented social reforms in an attempt to save the current economic crisis and stabilize his regime. The cabinet meeting on September 29 passed the "Economic Power Deconcentration Law," which includes three key points: restricting personal wealth; restricting economic concentration resulting from agreements and contracts; and restricting the concentration of enterprise productivity and management. This is a necessary step to implement the Allied Headquarters' order to dissolve the Zaibatsu, but the Zaibatsu firmly opposed it. The conservative new party movement is even more determined to fundamentally overturn the Katayama regime by undermining its foundation and setting a new national policy. Then, on October 3, the cabinet meeting passed the "Coal Production Increase Implementation Plan," which includes six points: Coal mine workers should implement a five-day week system of working four days and resting one day instead of a 24-hour, three-shift system; The tax amount for increased income from increased production by workers should be reduced or exempted instead of being subject to progressive taxation; Employment rules should be automatically determined by labor unions; In order to peacefully and quickly resolve labor-management disputes, a "Coal Production Council" should be established; Improve coal mining technology and prioritize the allocation of materials; Stop black market transactions by developing new coal mines to achieve passive production increase. This coal mine state management method, aimed at increasing production and suppressing strikes, is still based on the Allied Headquarters order. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's plan, Japan's coal production can increase to 40 million tons by 1952, with an annual increase of 2-3 million tons. At the beginning of the British Labour Party government, the first bill passed in Parliament was the nationalization of coal mines. In the current Japanese Diet, there is great resistance and many hidden obstacles. It is difficult to judge whether steady social reforms can receive Diet cooperation and support. If it is unfortunately hindered, it will greatly reduce the prestige of the Socialist Party. At that time, will Katayama retreat in the face of difficulties? Or will he throw himself into the arms of the conservative forces? This will be a test of the future of "political democracy" and "economic democracy" in Japan.

Due to the development of the conservative new party movement and the deepening of the Japanese economic crisis, Katayama's environment is much more difficult. In addition, the "Supreme Emperor" above Katayama is not firm about Japan's democratic path and has no determination to dissolve the Zaibatsu, while Ashida Hitoshi of the Democratic Party, a member of the three-party coalition government, is a fence-sitter. Katayama is already in a situation where he cannot clap with one hand. The September issue of the authoritative magazine "Diamond" editorial "Crisis of the Katayama Cabinet," pointed out that the economic crisis cannot be overcome, and the "October crisis" is inevitable. However, Chief Cabinet Secretary Nishio Suehiro replied: "The Katayama Cabinet will definitely not consider reorganization in November" and firmly believed: "Even if the two major bills are not supported, Katayama will still not step down, and will support until after the opening of the peace treaty with Japan." It is difficult for us to know what the Socialist Party relies on for such confidence. In fact, even if the Katayama Cabinet collapses, it will be even more difficult to overcome the Japanese economic crisis. The incompetence of Shidehara and Yoshida has already been tested after the war. Therefore, the "Diamond" magazine also said: "If the Katayama Cabinet collapses, the crisis cannot be solved because of Katayama's dismissal, and even other cabinets cannot avoid it." Why? This is because the American administrative policy has errors, the distance between Japanese political democracy and economic democracy is very far, the Zaibatsu have not been dissolved, capital is still concentrated, war criminals have not been punished, the economy is still weak, and the peaceful people of Japan are still in suffering!

### China's Proposal to Harmonize US and Soviet Opinions

The second session of the United Nations General Assembly has been open for a full month; however, in these thirty days, we have only seen successive waves of turmoil on Lake Success. Although several issues already on the agenda have been submitted to various committees for discussion, no agreements have been reached. Among them, the most important and eye-catching is the suggestion put forward by the United States representatives to organize a standing committee of fifty-seven countries to meet regularly throughout the year in order to maintain world peace and security. In recent days, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has been discussing this issue. The Soviet representatives have firmly expressed their disagreement, believing that the US's motive in putting forward this suggestion is to circumvent the Security Council, so that the permanent members cannot exercise their veto power. Therefore, this issue has not only become the focus of the dispute between the representatives of the US and the Soviet Union within the United Nations General Assembly, but it has also become the greatest obstacle facing this United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, all countries in the world are paying close attention to the Political Committee's discussion of this issue.

In order to reconcile the views of the US and the Soviet Union, our country's representative Dr. Wellington Koo has put forward a particularly moderate and appropriate solution. According to a report by the Associated Press, the representative stated at the Political Committee meeting on the 15th that China conditionally approves the US suggestion, and believes that if the powers of the standing committee of fifty-seven countries can be clearly defined, on the one hand, not undertaking the main tasks undertaken by the United Nations General Assembly, on the other hand, not infringing on the Security Council's task of maintaining world peace, then the committee will be a useful auxiliary agency to the United Nations General Assembly. As for the conditions he proposed, there are two points: Any international issues and situations within the scope of Articles 11 and 14 of the United Nations Charter must be submitted to the next United Nations General Assembly for discussion before the standing committee of fifty-seven countries can replace the United Nations General Assembly to conduct preliminary research and investigation. The implementation of the resolutions passed by the United Nations General Assembly shall not prohibit any member state from appealing to the Security Council on any issue that is being discussed and studied by the standing committee of fifty-seven countries. Once the Security Council handles the issue, the standing committee must stop the discussion.

If the compromise plan of our country's representative can be accepted by the United Nations General Assembly, then the difficulties faced by the United Nations can be easily solved. The reason why the United States wanted to put forward this suggestion is because the United Nations mechanism is hindered by the veto power. For the international problems that have occurred after the war, no effective solution has been made. In order to strive for the success of the United Nations, Secretary of State Marshall - in his address at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, advocated strictly limiting the exercise of the veto power, and formally suggested to the General Assembly to establish a standing committee of fifty-seven countries to meet regularly throughout the year, specializing in research on issues of world peace and security. However, immediately after Secretary of State Marshall issued this suggestion, it immediately aroused the firm opposition of the Soviet representatives. Soviet Deputy Minister Vyshinsky made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, fiercely criticizing the US's suggestion, and pointed out that the purpose of the United States was to circumvent the Security Council so that the permanent members could not exercise their veto power. Therefore, this proposal is only beneficial to "war-mongers" and so on. If the dispute between the US and the Soviet Union over this issue cannot be resolved and the two sides reach a compromise, then whatever the outcome, whichever side's proposal wins, it will be enough to endanger the existence of the United Nations mechanism.

When the representatives of the US and the Soviet Union were arguing fiercely, there were widespread rumors that the Soviet Union might withdraw from the United Nations mechanism. Even former British Prime Minister Churchill still believes that it is not impossible for the Soviet Union to take this action! Churchill made a radio speech on the 14th, using this as his point, and said: "If the world hopes for peace, even if the Soviet Union withdraws from the United Nations, war will not occur." What's more, the new Communist International has already appeared, and the Soviet Union can use this international organization to engage in anti-American activities and propaganda. Therefore, in order to avoid the Soviet Union withdrawing from the United Nations and causing the world to split into two, the United States should make considerable concessions on this issue. However, from another perspective, the United Nations mechanism has not yet become an effective international organization, and efforts should be made to remedy it. In all fairness, the US suggestion is also one of the plans. If it is abandoned due to Soviet opposition, then the foundation of the United Nations organization is still built on the principle of unanimity among the five great powers. For the international problems that have occurred after the war, it is still impossible to make effective solutions. The result will be that the United Nations mechanism will be nominally existent, and it will still inevitably follow the footsteps of the old League of Nations. Therefore, all countries that love world peace and all countries that advocate upholding the United Nations mechanism as their national policy should try to reconcile the views of the US and the Soviet Union and reach a compromise plan so that the United Nations mechanism will not be nominally existent.

In short, the United Nations mechanism, in the seam of the US-Soviet conflict, has reached the final juncture of life and death. The representatives of various countries currently attending the General Assembly on the shores of Lake Success should use their political wisdom to break the current deadlock and find a way out. The compromise plan of our country's representative Dr. Wellington Koo is worthy of attention from all countries. We also hope that the representatives of the US and the Soviet Union will not act on impulse, but can calmly and carefully study the compromise plan of our country's representative, and, for the sake of the overall situation of the world, should make a wise choice as soon as possible!

### General Assembly of the Money Trade Association

(Continued from page one) The first meeting was held in the afternoon, chaired by Wang Yiqi, with 108 representatives present. Today's meeting consists of reports from representatives from various regions on the business situation of money merchants in their respective regions and their suggestions for improvement. More than ten speakers from Ping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Chongqing, including Liu Zhaoti, Xu Yujing, Hu Shangfu, and Wang Ruobo, mainly said: The business of money merchants has always been based on credit, deeply rooted in the people. Its influence on the people's economic life is deep and significant. However, colleagues in various regions lack communication, making it difficult to promote the development of money merchants. Therefore, the organization of the association is indeed necessary. It is hoped that it can integrate the whole country and assist the government in promoting national policies to prosper trade. In the current period of suppression of rebellion, in order to stabilize finance, the authorities should be requested to issue emergency measures as soon as possible to avoid financial panic. The future business of money merchants should be based on undertakings, not for profit. The publication of money shops across the country and their business plans should be in line with the state's policy of stabilizing finance. Since the imposition of business tax on the money industry after the financial boom turned to decline, colleagues in the banking and money industries in various regions feel that the burden is too heavy, and the government should be requested to reduce the tax rate. After the representatives finished their speeches, the secretariat read the congratulatory telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the telegram of condolence to the soldiers at the front line. All unanimously approved, and then the meeting adjourned. In addition, both morning and afternoon tomorrow will be review meetings.

Chairman's Admonition

Now record Chairman Chiang's admonition as follows: Public and supervisory members of the Money Trade Association of the Republic of China: The money industry has a long history in our country's financial undertakings, and its distribution is also widespread. Since its inception, it has served society, adjusted finances, and achieved many successes. Its adaptability to the environment and convenience to the people have the power to be deeply rooted and universal, and are related to the prosperity of the national economy. The government has promulgated financial laws and regulations, and its expectations for the management and support of the money industry are comprehensive. At a time when we are assisting in suppressing the rebellion, pacifying the people's livelihood, and stabilizing the economy, it is indeed an urgent task. The establishment of the National Money Industry Association at this time should be aware of the importance of its responsibility. All financial measures related to the government, which are published in laws and regulations, should have been deeply recognized and known to follow. It is hoped that it will point out current malpractices and express good plans in order to reverse the crisis of economic decline and benefit the development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce. This is what is deeply hoped for, Kai-shek.

### Orphans Donate Flag to the Young Women's Christian Association

(Continued from page one) At the beginning of the conference on the 16th, four young girls, representing the Zhejiang Provincial Orphanage, presented a silk banner with the inscription "Benefiting the World" and delivered a speech, roughly stating that the Young Women's Christian Association has spared no effort in its work for children's welfare in the past, and they have benefited greatly from it. They hereby express their gratitude on behalf of all the children, etc. All the representatives present were deeply moved.

Talks by Korean Representative

On the afternoon of the 16th, the reporter went to the Hotel des Colonies to visit Mrs. Kim, the Korean representative attending the conference, and asked about her struggles during Japanese rule. She said: The various cruel and painful experiences in the past are indeed indescribable. In short, the people had absolutely no freedom. The Young Women's Christian Association was a social and religious organization, so it was subjected to strict surveillance. In 1939, it was forced to disband, and all activities were completely suspended. Countless underground comrades were killed. Mrs. Kim was originally a professor of religion at a Korean senior college, but was forced to lose her job after the religious subjects were cancelled. After the victory, she specialized in organizing the Young Women's Christian Association and developed activities. However, international religious activities are still prohibited in the north under Soviet control. Currently, the northern and southern parts of Korea are completely separated, and even correspondence is subject to inspection. There are still many cases of family members being unable to reunite, so all Koreans long for the peaceful reunification of the country to arrive soon.

Improved Status of Women

According to Mrs. Kim, the status of Korean women has generally improved after the war. Nowadays, many married women go out to work, and their husbands are not allowed to interfere. There are special departments in government agencies to discuss the conduct of women's welfare affairs. At the end of this year, Korea will hold the first general election, and women also have the right to vote, equal to men.

### Embezzlement of Gold in Taiwan Case

(Continued from page one) According to reports, in October 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Evans served as the leader of the US military liaison group and arrived in Taipei with our dispatched forward command post. He took advantage of his position to receive a box of "Fu" character gold ingots from Japanese Major Harada, a total of 4,000 ingots, each weighing one tael, but only 2,000 ingots (ie 2,000 taels) were delivered to the Taiwan Provincial Government, while the other 2,000 ingots (ie 2,000 taels) were misappropriated. Harada was an officer of the Japanese military accounting office. At that time, the Taiwanese youth Huang Zairong, who was working as a translator, was aware of this. Through Huang Zairong's introduction, Evans met his younger brother Huang Zaiyi, who was doing business in Shanghai, and privately shipped the gold ingots to Shanghai in batches in November of the same year, selling a total of 1,921 taels, exchanging for US$107,967. Huang Zaiyi received a commission of US$706 and 466,000 French francs. There were also 79 gold ingots, whose whereabouts are unknown. It is rumored that Evans took them back to the United States. When the case was discovered last year, Evans, who had returned to the United States, had retired. He was subsequently arrested. The US side opened a court investigation in the spring of this year. The Taiwan Provincial Government sent officials Wu Songgong, Xia Zhizhi, and Ma Xian to Los Angeles to testify. Huang Zaiyi and Japanese Harada, as well as another US Army Captain Aronson, involved in another case, also appeared in court and were subsequently indicted.

### Chiang Monlin's Remarks in Shanghai

(Continued from page one) In addition to Indonesia, Annam, and Japan, all other countries in the Eastern Conference were represented. During the conference, opinions were widely exchanged on various issues such as the industry, economy, culture, education, and democracy of various countries. Regarding the Japanese issue, the representatives of various countries generally felt the importance of re-education work. As for China's domestic politics, it was not discussed. Since the conference was limited to exchanging opinions, there were no resolutions. Therefore, after recording all the opinions, they were only for reference by various countries. Chiang said: During his stay in the UK, he inspected all aspects of British society and deeply felt that the current economic situation in the UK is indeed very serious. At present, at least 10 million people in the UK rely on imports from abroad for their food. Pork is extremely rare in the market, and even eggs have disappeared. Therefore, the British government's control over materials is even stricter than during the war. On the one hand, the people's needs are all rationed, and even the King and the Prime Minister are no exception. On the other hand, the government forces all materials to be sold to prevent national accumulation. A friend of mine raises pigs at home, but he is not allowed to eat them himself, and the eggs laid must also be sold publicly in the market. Although materials are scarce in the UK, there is no black market. This is because the British are accustomed to abiding by the law, and are willing to endure personal hardship rather than increase the country's difficulties. This spirit is worthy of our admiration and learning. Finally, Chiang denied the rumor that he would be appointed Secretary-General of Guangdong Province.

### Kawashima Yoshiko Persistently Makes Excuses

(Continued from page one) A temporary court was set up on the 16th in the prison. Because the location was not announced in the newspapers beforehand, there were few spectators. Mayor He also came to watch. Presiding Judge Wu Shengjiu, Prosecutor Jia Cequan, etc. began the court session at 1:30 pm. Kawashima, wearing a gray prison uniform, walked in under the mercury lamp. She first bowed to her three defenders, and then answered questions from the court, claiming to be 33 years old, of Japanese nationality, and from Beiping.

Enumerating the Charges

The prosecutor enumerated the charges, saying that the defendant was born in China and there was no question about her nationality. Because she was a descendant of the late Qing Dynasty, she had the idea of restoring the Manchu Qing Dynasty. The defendant had various conditions for working as a spy, such as driving airplanes and cars, riding horses, swimming, dancing, photography, and mastering English, French, Chinese, and Japanese languages. Moreover, she was over 30 years old and still unmarried, and traveled between Japan and various important places, which shows that she had espionage activities. However, because her skills were superb, it was difficult to obtain evidence. This is also the reason why she denied everything. The focus of this case should be that the defendant had attempted to send the puppet Manchu imperial relics to Rehe and tried to form the "Dingguo Army." Although she used the Japanese, she handed over South China to Wang Jingwei and North China to Zhu Shen. Referring to the defendant's confession in the Beiping Execution Supervisory Office, it can be proved that she is a traitor.

Specious Defense

After that, the court conducted the interrogation one by one, or ordered her to state her case. Kawashima denied almost all the points in the confession, saying that it was a "novel" written to Li Zongren after being deceived and ordered to do so, and repeatedly said: "I can accept such a shooting, but except for the crime of being a traitor, I dare to say in front of the portrait of the Father of the Nation that I have not done anything to harm China." She also said: "I returned to China at the age of sixteen because I knew I was Chinese and came to see my motherland." She said: "The Father of the Nation also hoped for Sino-Japanese friendship. If you say I am a traitor, please bring evidence." Kawashima had high eloquence. She looked innocent, but in fact her words were very sharp and did not leak any flaws. Kawashima claimed: "The Japanese wanted to use me, but I was not used. This is not a crime!"

Denying Everything

Kawashima denied that she had been a dancer in Shanghai and worked as a spy, denied that she had attempted to restore the Manchu Qing Dynasty and form the "Dingguo Army," and denied that she had rebelled against Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen, saying that it was done by her brother Shengdong. She also said that she had never participated in the puppet Manchu affairs. She said earlier that Terauchi had forced Honjo Shigeru to send troops with a pistol, which she learned from Japanese books. Regarding her visit to Wang Jingwei in Japan and asking him if he had any contact with Chiang Kai-shek, she said that she was not in Japan at that time. She said that she was shot because she was afraid that the Japanese would bomb the Forbidden City, so she asked Konoe for help and shot herself in anger. She said that wearing the general's uniform was just a momentary curiosity, and she would not wear it again in the future.

Disrespecting the Judge

Finally, she said: "The lawsuit cannot be fought. I have no money and cannot give bribes to the judge. If anything happens again, I will definitely run away with the judges." Her three defenders pleaded, asking the court to pay attention to the evidence, and that the indictment against Kawashima was mostly imaginative, and should not be recognized as evidence of a crime because of Kawashima's mysterious and dramatic face. Before leaving the court, Kawashima asked the prosecutor "What's your surname?" She said: I hope you can change the way you handle other cases in the future.

### Political Party Nomination Candidate Quota Issue Shelved, Supervisory Yuan Discusses Supervisory Committee Election Issues

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 16th] The issue of allocating quotas for the three parties nominating candidates for the general election has not yet been agreed upon. The Democratic Socialist Party insists on not submitting a list until the quota issue is resolved. Although the Youth Party has already submitted a list of candidates for the National Assembly, it has not yet submitted a list of candidates for legislators. The Central Election Guidance Committee of the Kuomintang held a meeting on the 16th to thoroughly discuss issues such as political party nominations and the principles for reviewing party members participating in elections. According to Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party, who returned to Nanjing from Shanghai today, the quota determined by the party's Central Standing Committee is actually the "minimum" number. The standard for this number is based on the current domestic environment and the party's internal assessment of how many people can be found who are qualified to serve as representatives or legislators. When asked by reporters whether this quota was absolutely unchangeable, he replied that it would depend on the degree of mutual concession between the two parties (referring to the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Party). Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party told reporters that the so-called candidate quota is not the number of elected people. The constitution stipulates that a two-thirds majority is required to amend it. We hope that the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and non-party individuals will account for at least one-third of the total number.

[This newspaper Nanjing, 16th] The Central Election Guidance Committee of the Kuomintang held a meeting on the morning of the 16th to review the list of candidates for the National Assembly from various provinces, cities, and districts of the party. Wu Tiecheng chaired the meeting to discuss review methods and the issue of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties participating in the election. Zhang Shusheng, the Chief Commissioner of the election, told reporters today that he especially emphasized the determination to assist friendly parties in participating in the election. It is also learned that, based on the principle of cooperation with the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, the Kuomintang will cede some areas to the two parties separately. It is also learned that the Election Guidance Committee will hold closed-door meetings daily starting from the 17th and will complete its task after the internal list review is completed.

[This newspaper Nanjing, 16th] The Supervisory Yuan held a symposium on the morning of the 16th to discuss the election of supervisory committee members. During the meeting, the proposal by the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties to allow the provincial, municipal, and county councils to participate in the selection of candidates was reviewed. Several supervisory committee members were also appointed to study the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the constitution and the organizational law of the provincial, county, and municipal councils, and to present their findings at the next symposium. Also on the 16th, the meeting exchanged views on the issue of free transportation for executive and supervisory personnel of various parties.

### The Academia Sinica Council Holds Group Review Meetings, Candidate List May Be Decided Today

[This newspaper Nanjing, 16th] The Academia Sinica Council held review meetings in three groups on the morning of the 16th. The mathematics and physics group was convened by Li Shuhua, the biology group was convened by Chen Zhida, and the humanities group was convened by Hu Shi. A general meeting was held at 3:00 PM to discuss and synthesize the review results of the groups. The list of candidates for the mathematics and physics group has been largely reviewed. The review of the biology and humanities groups will continue on the 17th, and the entire list can be completely decided at the general meeting on the 17th. It is reported that the review is based on two qualifications: "works" and "service achievements," and is extremely detailed, with much debate, especially on establishing principles and standards. The principle for this year's election of academicians is to select 80 people. Therefore, the total number of candidates passed by the three groups tomorrow will be one times the number of academicians, that is, 160 people, and will not exceed 200 people at most. The council believes that there is a regret, that is, according to the election rules, the nomination of academicians in this session is somewhat mechanical. Others are nominated, but self-nomination is inconvenient. For example, the council itself should have five people, who have given up this time. By analogy, judging from the current situation of Chinese academia, there are omissions. This should be taken into account and added to the second session next year. At noon on the 16th, Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet to entertain all members of the council. Minister Zhu will host a banquet on the afternoon of the 17th.

### Four US Congressmen Arrive in Nanjing, Visit Foreign Minister Yu to Inquire About Civil Aviation

[This newspaper Nanjing, 16th] Four members of the U.S. House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, including Congressman Hall, and Major Taylor, arrived in Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 16th. They immediately went to the Ministry of Communications to visit Minister Yu Dawei and Mr. Siffin Suo, inquiring about the current situation of civil aviation in China, and hoping that the commerce between China and the United States can rely on air transport for substantial development in the future. At 11:00 AM, they visited Vice Minister Liu Shishun of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and were accompanied by Mr. Liu to meet with Premier Zhang at the Executive Yuan. At noon, Ambassador Stuart hosted a banquet to entertain them. At 2:00 PM, they flew to Tianjin on the same plane. Mr. Hale B. was borrowing to leave. It is reported that the mission of their trip is to visit American overseas businessmen in various places to understand the current situation of Sino-American commerce, and then return to their country via South Korea and Japan in order to make greater progress in Far East trade.

### Fuzhou Rice Prices Fall Back

(This newspaper Fuzhou, 16th) Rice prices here have been rising sharply. Yesterday, they were sold for 760,000 yuan. Today, due to a drop in yarn prices, they have fallen back by 50,000 yuan. At a time when rice and grain are abundant, the price of grain is so high, which is causing public outrage. The municipal government has specifically ordered the police bureau to investigate and crack down. The Provincial Agricultural and Food Administration will allocate 3,000 dan of affordable rice from today, to be sold to the common people at 450,000 yuan per dan.

### Hankou and Changsha Rice Prices Continue to Rise

[This newspaper Hankou, 16th] Grain prices here continue to rise, and top-quality machine-milled rice has already hit the 500,000 yuan mark. In addition, credit is tight, and the Shanghai exchange rate discount has reached 180 yuan per 1,000 yuan.

[This newspaper Changsha, 16th] Rice prices have skyrocketed, once reaching a peak of 450,000 yuan. Everyone is asking why the prices continue to rise in a straight line after the comprehensive ban on transportation. According to people familiar with the situation, grain from the lakeside area is directly transported downstream at high prices, causing a shortage of rice in Changsha. The Ministry of Food has entrusted the purchase of 3.6 million dan in Changsha. The Wuhan Xingyuan is purchasing military grain in Hunan. The Hubei Agricultural and Food Administration is unable to repay its debts to the central government and is purchasing grain in large quantities in Hunan. Grain smuggling is rampant, and the government cannot prohibit it. It is said that after the autumn harvest in previous years, the Changsha granaries could store a minimum of 7 million shi of grain, but this year, apart from military grain, there is currently no grain left, resulting in a food shortage. (More price news can be found on page 5)

### Zhenjiang Commodity Prices Tend to Stabilize

[This newspaper Zhenjiang, 16th] Commodity prices in Zhenjiang have stabilized yesterday and today, but top-quality rice is still sold for 540,000 yuan per shi, soybean oil is 22,000 yuan per catty, cotton cloth is falling with the Shanghai market, and cigarettes continue to rise.

### First Visit to Yantai (Part Two)

--Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi

National Army Enters Yantai Without Firing a Single Shot

There are many rumors, and I don't know where they come from. If you are not careful, you will be misled by them. In fact, the National Army did not fire a single shot when entering Yantai. The battle ended early at Mount Zhifu and Shuiman Tou (the outer barriers of Yantai), so the urban area was not baptized by artillery fire, otherwise it would definitely not be the way it is now. Coming to Yantai will remind people of the warlords of several generations, including Chu Yupu, Liu Zhennian, Zhang Zongchang, and Han Fuqu. A middle-aged Yantai man has never stopped hearing gunshots since his elementary school days. The buildings in Yantai are well-preserved, and the streets and alleys are all concrete pavements, which are relics of the Liu Zhennian era. However, the port is not very good. Ships have no docks to rely on and must be transferred by small sampans. Shandong entrepreneurs once attempted to build the Yantai-Weihai Railway in order to make Yantai's position replace Qingdao, but the result was blocked by Japanese imperialism. In fact, the commercial port value of Yantai is far above Qingdao. In terms of water transportation, it is close to all ports in the Bohai Sea, and the direct connection to the south is only ten hours more than Qingdao. The most important difference is that Yantai has products, while Qingdao does not. Yantai's products include five major categories: aquatic vegetables, lace, hairnets, pork, and fruit wine. The absorption of foreign exchange accounts for an important proportion of the country. Among the aquatic vegetables, the apples, pears, and grapes are just coming onto the market in the autumn. In recent years, because there has been no rotation, many fruit trees have been cut down. The scale of the orchards reminds people of the western United States. Yantai has only been opened for several decades. Every Yantai person around the age of fifty has witnessed the construction of buildings and the flourishing of orchards. Although Yantai is currently scarce and difficult, the fragrance of apples still permeates everywhere. Vendors carrying poles on their shoulders shout on the streets "Fifteen coppers a catty," which is what the locals no longer care about, but the people in the south consider a treasure.

"Three-Dynasty Veteran" Still Serves as President

In Yantai, there is no shortage of "three-dynasty veterans." For example, the famous Zhang Yu Winery produces 100 to 200 cases of grape wine and brandy per day. Zhang Yuchang, the father of this old man, was originally a worker, but when it passed to his nephew, he became a complete capitalist. Zhang Yu Winery has been shut down for ten years, and the old man has run away. The machines are still there and have not been damaged at all, so the municipal government sealed it as public property. Another is the president of the Chamber of Commerce, who is still serving as president, assisting the municipal government in restoring order. The port is still under the management of the Navy and should return to normal within the expiry date. In the past, Yantai Port was a place where foreign fleets came to escape the summer heat. The merchants could not help but yearn for the "prosperity" of more than ten years ago. As soon as they saw American sailors landing, they quickly wrote out English signs and planned bars and dance halls. According to the Navy, the American cruiser, Erdaosi, was not allowed to enter the port, only allowed them to land for sightseeing, and the ship gave them three days off, accompanied by Chinese personnel to tour Yantai. I don't know if they will be able to enter and exit freely in the future.

Mayor Ding Fu Ting Looks Like Feng Yuxiang

Finally, I will introduce the current mayor, Ding Futing, a native of Muping, Shandong, 51 years old, who looks like Feng Yuxiang, but is less tall. He graduated from the Northeast Military Academy and the Northeast Police Academy. He served as a staff officer in the Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Office and participated in the Great Wall War of Resistance. At that time, he was a brigade commander and commanded the battle at Xifengkou, where he was besieged by the enemy. During the Anti-Japanese War, he fought guerrillas in eastern Shandong. Just like Qingdao Mayor Li Xianliang, people forgot his original education and experience and liked to call him "born from guerrilla warfare" (Sent from Yantai on the 11th) (End)

Qingdao US Consulate Officials Praise the Discipline of the National Army

[United Press Qingdao, 16th] U.S. consular officials recently returned from an inspection in Yantai. According to what they told a United Press reporter, the situation in Yantai has quickly returned to normal two weeks after the National Army recovered it. The 25th Division of the National Army first entered the city on October 1. They were in high spirits and had excellent discipline, paying the value for shopping. Therefore, the people welcomed them and wholeheartedly assisted in building fortifications. American property in Yantai, such as Mobil Oil's oil depot and the residences of missionaries, suffered heavy damage, but not due to the war, but because of looting by bandits, who removed all the wood. The consulate's archives are intact and have been taken back to Qingdao. There are no plans to reopen the Yantai consulate. According to a Chinese merchant, he told an American missionary: We people were living in darkness under the Communist Party's rule, and now we have seen the light of day again. The Chinese people's feelings towards the Communist rulers can be seen from this.

### European Crisis Affects US Security, Marshall Urges Aid to Europe, Demands Immediate Emergency Measures

[Reported by This Newspaper] New York, 16th Radio: Washington News, President Truman announced at a press conference today that the government has achieved considerable success in providing temporary aid to France, but convening a special session of Congress to help Europe solve the economic crisis this winter may still be necessary. At present, he is trying his best to obtain the aid to Europe to avoid all the troubles of convening a special session of Congress. Truman's tone has been the most optimistic today compared to the past few weeks. He also said that the report by Interior Secretary Krug on investigating domestic resources to seek large-scale aid will be released in the coming days. Regarding the proposal for the United States to take over the British military district in Germany, Truman said that no decision has been made yet. When asked about the President's opinion on Wallace's critical remarks, he refused to answer.

[Reuters Boston, 15th] Secretary of State Marshall said in a speech to the American Federation of Labor here today that there is a need for the United States to engage in emergency relief to prevent the collapse of Europe before the United States Congress can take action on a long-term aid plan to Europe. Secretary Marshall said: We are already facing the danger that the characteristics of Western civilization, which our government and way of life are based on, will disappear. We must adopt active transitional measures to prevent the fatal deterioration of Europe's political, economic, and psychological state before Congress has sufficient time to consider and act on a long-term aid plan. The current grain conservation plan is one of these transitional measures. The Congressional Committee, which is scheduled to meet in November, will undoubtedly consider other measures. At the same time, the U.S. government should also do its best to provide assistance. However, this is only an important step to prevent collapse this winter. Secretary Marshall then outlined the basic principles of U.S. foreign policy in the current world situation, saying that "The basic question today is whether people are allowed to freely organize their society, politics, and economic survival according to their wishes, or whether their lives will be left to the control of a very small number of people. In today's world, the seriousness of this question has exceeded the extent of the past. Although the theory of suppressing or even eliminating human freedom differs from era to era, these theories all have a most serious fallacy, that is, in human affairs, no means can be spared to achieve their goals. "Secretary Marshall then described the history of the "Marshall Plan" after he first reported the aid proposal at Harvard University in June. He said: We have now reached the stage where sixteen European countries have submitted preliminary reports. Several committees of Congress plan to convene meetings in a few weeks to review the priority measures of immediate need, and then the government will put forward a plan for long-term reconstruction and reconciliation in Europe. Regardless of the form of this plan, we can be sure that the participating countries will make every possible effort to achieve their self-determined production goals and financial reforms. These countries all need extreme perseverance. Basically speaking, the current problem of world recovery is actually a production problem. The American people should know that increasing production requires more diligent work, and the latter requires food. The production of American farms and factories has an extremely significant impact on the whole world. The United States is now in a world of extreme crisis, and this situation contains great danger. Every American people should realize that those who think that the United States can maintain a detached position in the crisis are fools. The economic stability of Europe is a necessary condition for its political stability. Therefore, it has an extremely significant impact on the peace and security of the United States, and even the peace and security of the entire world. We are facing the danger that the characteristics of Western civilization will be eliminated, and our government and way of life are based on this characteristic of Western civilization."

### Foreigners' Assets in the U.S. Total 1 Billion Yuan, U.S. Government Considers Requisition, Plans to Use it for Emergency Aid to Europe

[Central News Agency Washington, 15th] According to U.S. Acting Secretary of State Lovett today, the Marshall Plan will be formally submitted to the Congressional Committee on November 10 for decision. Lovett emphasized that the United States, under the current circumstances, has made its best efforts to help European countries get through this winter.

France and Italy's assets in the United States that can be used are not enough to cope with their dollar panic. It is estimated that the funds needed to help these countries get through the winter until the end of March next year will be 100 million or 200 million yuan more than the 585 million yuan in temporary assistance proposed by President Truman. Lovett continued: The U.S. government is studying the legal issues of requisitioning foreigners' assets in the U.S. to assist the European aid plan. On this point, the State Department has not asked private banks to announce the number of foreign accounts. As for whether it is planning to take this kind of step, he declined to answer. France has asked the government agencies concerned to study its citizens' property in the United States. It is said that the Department of Justice is studying the legal issues of using European people's loans in the U.S. to support public bonds issued by the Export-Import Bank. It is generally believed that it is a legal measure to support public bonds issued by the Export-Import Bank with nearly 1 billion US dollars of foreign property under the control of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

### 31 German Ships, the U.S. Will Give to France

Bidault Optimistic About the Aid to Europe Plan

[Reported by This Newspaper] New York, 16th Radio: In order to support the French government, which is being coerced by the Communist Party, the United States is currently trying to provide it with economic and material assistance. It is rumored that the United States plans to give France 31 ships obtained from the German Navy to improve France's maritime transport work.

[Reuters Paris, 15th] It is reported that Bidault has assured his cabinet members in today's cabinet meeting that the temporary aid that the United States has promised to give to France is sufficient for France to maintain itself until the Marshall Plan is implemented.

### Emergency Aid to Europe Plan Does Not Include the United Kingdom

[United Press London, 15th] Government officials said that ensuring the remaining portion of the unfrozen U.S. dollar loan or ensuring that the Marshall Plan is implemented before June next year cannot prevent the United Kingdom from continuing to substantially reduce its purchases with U.S. dollars and intensifying its reduction in purchases from the U.S. dollar trading area. The United Kingdom cannot request temporary assistance before the Marshall Plan is discussed.

### Western European Countries Need Huge Amounts of Aid, the U.S. Demands Further Cuts, Which Will Cause Subtle Diplomatic Problems

[United Press Washington, 15th] Senior State Department officials planning the Marshall Plan said that they believe that the European countries participating in the plan may not be able to reduce their demands to the point that the United States considers "reasonable," otherwise the U.S. government will have to weaken them on their behalf. They said: The only question is who will be responsible for the reduction work. This move involves subtle diplomatic and political issues, because the Executive Committee of the Sixteen European Countries Meeting is currently visiting the United States. They have said that if they are responsible for actually reducing the numbers, they will not be able to achieve the desired recovery process, and the responsibility for the failure will be borne by them.

Well-informed sources in the government privately said that the Marshall Plan will be drastically reduced when it is submitted to Congress. Senior U.S. officials said that they dare not directly tell European Chief Representative Sir Franks and his colleagues this attitude, lest they be disappointed and return home. However, the United States and Europe unanimously believe that there is no need to hold the Paris Lun Conference, and that the necessary corrections will be made in the current meeting. Both parties believe that sending the plan back to Europe for reconsideration is tantamount to its death knell.

### Wallace Denounces U.S. Government Officials, Refers to Them as Wall Street Go-Betweens

[United Press Baltimore, 15th] Wallace said to an audience of 8,000 at the American Progressive Citizens Congress tonight that Secretary of Defense Forrestal, Secretary of Commerce Harriman, and Acting Secretary of State Lovett are "Wall Street bankers behind the go-betweens." Before they drive us to war, I must first drive them out of Wall Street.

Their thoughts and deeds are all to think that money is everything in culture. Their attack on the American people is well-planned and actively implemented.

### More Than 600 German Factories Will Be Dismantled as Compensation

[Central News Agency Berlin, 15th] The British and American military governments jointly announced today that all 682 factories have been listed for compensation, to be dismantled and distributed by the Allies. Among them, 380 are ordinary industrial factories, and the rest are arms factories. According to the old industrial standards plan, more than 1,600 factories in the merged area were originally planned for compensation. The bulk of the common equipment in the list of 320 arms factories is distributed to the 18 governments concerned of the Allied Compensation Committee on the one hand, and to the Soviet Union and Poland in a ratio of 25%. Compensation is limited to the main industrial equipment that can be moved from ordinary factories and the ordinary industrial equipment that can be moved from arms factories. As for the special machinery for producing weapons, if it is not destroyed, it will be handled in accordance with the plan to eliminate combat potential.

### Seven Countries of the Arab Group Sign a Military Mutual Assistance Treaty, Requesting Trusteeship of Italian-controlled Libya

[Reuters Beirut, 15th] The Arab League Steering Committee has ended its eight-day secret meeting at the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the meeting, the Arab countries reiterated their determination to engage in military cooperation based on the principles of mutual assistance and self-defense. League Secretary-General Azzam claimed that the military treaty that the Arab countries can establish is the greatest achievement of the League since its establishment in 1944. The recognition of military cooperation as a basic element of the Arab world is a first in the Middle East.

Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, the newly resigned financial expert of the U.S. Special Administrative Region, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen have formed a military cooperation agreement for the first time, and the Palestinian issue is the motive. Azzam also revealed that in today's League meeting, a memorandum to the four major powers of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France has been drafted, requesting that the Arab countries be allowed to participate in the international committee scheduled to discuss the issue of Libya in North Africa next month. If the Arab countries are elected to govern Libya under trusteeship, Egypt is the most likely to be elected.

### Reasons for Clayton's Resignation: Disagreement with Secretary Marshall

[Reuters, London, 15th] Observers here believe that Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Clayton's resignation is due to differences of opinion with Secretary of State Marshall regarding the imperial trade preference system. Clayton insisted that Britain must abandon its imperial trade preference system as a condition for participating in the Marshall Plan for European Recovery, while Marshall believed that the recovery of Europe should not be hindered solely by attacks on the principle of the trade preference system. Threatening not to allow Britain to participate in the European aid plan and demanding that Britain abandon its imperial trade preference system would inevitably be a poor political stance and difficult to reconcile with European recovery and American principles. According to reports from Washington, when the Anglo-American tariff negotiations entered a serious stage last week, British Ambassador to the United States Lord Inverchapel bypassed Clayton and directly contacted Marshall. This meeting was a key turning point in the Anglo-American tariff negotiations and one of the reasons for Clayton's resignation.

### Japanese Prime Minister Declares No Compromise with Communists

Hoping for Opposition Party Cooperation in Preparing for Peace Conference [New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Prime Minister Katayama, attending the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on the 16th, stated the Japanese government's views on the Japanese peace conference, saying: Japan must prepare two things for the peace conference: first, based on the Potsdam Declaration and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, to complete the democratization of all sectors of Japanese domestic politics, economy, culture, and society. The current government's various measures are all based on this line; second, to prepare for the full delegation to attend the peace conference, to complete the national burden, hoping that the opposition parties will cooperate and send representatives to participate. Prime Minister Katayama then discussed Japan's position after the establishment of the Communist International organization, saying: "So-called permanent neutrality does not have this power internationally. Japan, which has renounced war, hopes to quickly join international organizations and ensure security. However, because all countries experienced hardships during World War II, a third world war is thought to be avoidable. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party have broken off relations, so there will be no compromise with the Communist Party, nor will it be influenced by the Communist International organization."

### Serious Labor Unrest in France: Potential for Nationwide Strike

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] The highest standing authority of the General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Paris District Federation of Trade Unions, is scheduled to meet next Monday. Observers believe that this move may be a sign of a general strike in the Paris area.

### Before Holy Land Gains Full Independence, It Should Be Placed Under UN Trusteeship; Syria and Iraq Propose

[Reuters, Lake Success, 15th] Syria and Iraq each submitted resolutions to the General Assembly today, requesting that Britain place the Holy Land under UN trusteeship before Palestine gains full independence, and that several legal points of the Palestinian issue be submitted to the International Court of Justice.

The Syrian resolution asks the General Assembly to recognize that Palestine is a mandated territory and that its independence has been temporarily recognized by the League of Nations covenant. The General Assembly's proposals on Palestine should only be limited to the provisions of Chapter XII of the Charter regarding trusteeship. Britain has not yet established the necessary institutions for a self-governing government in Palestine, enabling the Palestinian government to fulfill its responsibilities in accordance with the mandate law. In order to establish such governmental institutions, efforts should be made during the transition period between the end of the mandate and the establishment of an independent Palestinian government. Therefore, Syria requests that the General Assembly advise Britain to prepare an agreement under Article 79 of the Charter as soon as possible and submit it to the General Assembly for approval, so that Britain can complete its mission in Palestine during the transition period, engaging in establishing a sovereign Palestinian state with a democratic foundation, and electing a constituent assembly as soon as possible. The constituent assembly should formulate a constitution to protect the basic freedoms and rights of all minorities and protect the Holy Land. A government should be established within a certain period to take over administrative power. The Iraqi resolution asks the General Assembly to recognize that partition conflicts with the right of the majority people to choose a government and Britain's guarantees to the Arabs in 1915 and 1916.

### Arab Group Plans to Organize Middle East Committee: Refuses to Participate in Far East Commission

[United Press, Lake Success, 15th] The Soviet Union previously criticized the Far Eastern Commission for being controlled by colonial countries and demanded that Arab countries participate in order to balance the power, which seems to be doomed to failure. The Lebanese representative submitted a supplementary plan to his proposal to the Soviet Union, arguing that due to the possibility of the establishment of the Middle East Committee, the Arab League is willing not to participate in the Far Eastern Commission.

### Commander Xuan Submits Opinion Letter to Mayor Wu: Food and Cloth to be Operated Publicly, Avoiding Exploitation by Intermediaries and Eliminating Monopoly; Universal Inspection of Hoarded Goods in All Districts

Police Commander Xuan Tiewu, on the afternoon of the 16th, formally submitted to Mayor Wu an opinion letter on the public operation of food and cloth and the universal inspection of hoarding. The opinion letter is divided into two points: For the people's needs for food and clothing, namely food (including oil) and cloth, the municipal government is requested to immediately organize public operation to avoid exploitation by intermediaries and eliminate the hoarding and monopoly. Shanghai does not lack materials and has enough for the people's needs. The reason why people feel there is a shortage is all due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding. The Shanghai area is vast, and the hoarded goods are either piled up in scattered warehouses or dispersed into retail, making inspection difficult. The Garrison Headquarters is now determined to universally inspect hoarded goods (including all daily necessities) in all districts, not limited to warehouses. Houses suspected of hoarding will be inspected, and all goods found will be supplied to the market at reasonable prices. A spokesman for the Garrison Headquarters stated that if the above opinion is approved, the Garrison Headquarters will fully assist the municipal government in thoroughly implementing it.

### Four Principles for Random Inspection of Textile Mills: Production Certificates Required During Inspection, Main Target is Hoarding

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau considers the responsibility of random inspection of textile mills to be significant. After consulting with Tan Yili, the inspector stationed at the bureau from the Textile Adjustment Committee, four key points for the inspection were agreed upon: When each inspection team departs, they should hold a production certificate to conduct the inspection on the designated manufacturer. Inspections without a certificate are not allowed. When the manufacturer's account books are brought to the bureau, they should be immediately sent to the commissioner of the Textile Adjustment Committee stationed at the bureau for review and countersignature. Each team should sign and report the investigation situation every day before 5:00 pm for further review and instructions. The main target of the random inspection is hoarding for profit. These measures have been approved and will be implemented immediately.

Treacherous Merchants Move Rice to Suburbs

[Another Report] It is expected that yesterday, the inspection of the Gu Da Textile Mill will continue together with the Textile Adjustment Committee, and strict monitoring of transactions in various markets will continue.

In the future, if citizens see treacherous merchants dividing up hoarded rice and attempting to hide it, they should immediately report it.

The detailed calculation method of this method will be discussed and decided at the second meeting next week after the members of each department return and study it, and then the opinions will be submitted to the National Economic Commission for approval.

### Automobile Fuel Rationing Issue: Decision Awaits Compilation of Data

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of automobile fuel rationing in the city, the Municipal Council previously decided on a method stipulating that each vehicle can refuel at most once every three days, with a maximum of 10 gallons for small cars and 30 gallons for large trucks each time. After the implementation of this method, some vehicles were insufficient due to the different nature of each vehicle, and others had surpluses. The Automobile Fuel Rationing Review Committee convened a meeting at the Public Utilities Bureau the day before yesterday and decided to divide small cars and trucks into three levels, large, medium, and small, according to tonnage, and allocate fuel according to actual needs. More fuel will be allocated to commercial rental cars, and less fuel will be allocated to private small cars that do not need 100 gallons per month. This principle was reported to the Municipal Council's Public Utilities Subcommittee, which convened at 3:00 pm yesterday, by Deputy Director Zhang of the Public Utilities Bureau. After discussion, no concrete decision was made. Director Zhao told reporters that the reports on the number of refueling gallons submitted by the various companies to the Public Utilities Bureau are not yet complete.

Regarding smuggling suppression, the police bureau only plays an assisting role. Wherever customs personnel cannot reach, the maritime police will provide assistance anytime and anywhere. In terms of maintaining security, great progress has been made since Director Wu took office. Water rats have disappeared, and scalpers have also been unable to do anything due to the implementation of the new system.

The Maritime Division currently has a total of 400 police officers, all of whom are well-trained and excellent personnel. On the equipment side, it has also been strengthened. In addition to about 50 armed patrol boats (including sampans), it also has new wireless communication equipment, and the area under its jurisdiction is 150 li long and 100 li wide.

### Designated River Ports for Ships to Take Shelter from Wind: Five Methods Resolved

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Suzhou River is narrow. Whenever a hurricane passes, all the ships docked in the Huangpu River rush in to take shelter, making it unbearable. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau specially investigated the city's rivers and canals so that when there are strong winds and waves, it can designate ships in a certain area to enter a certain river or canal to take shelter in order to disperse them. It also invited the Zhabei Bureau, the Maritime Police Bureau, the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, and various shipping associations to discuss together and decided on five methods: Ships docked south of the Bund (Sixteen Pups) should enter various ports south of Sixteen Pups to take shelter from the wind and must not sail into the Suzhou River to take shelter. Ships docked south of Minhang Road and north of Sixteen Pups in the Huangpu River may enter the Suzhou River to take shelter from the wind. Ships docked north of Minhang Road in the Huangpu River should take shelter in the various rivers and canals north of Minhang Road and must not sail to the Suzhou River to take shelter. Ships docked north of Minhang Road and south of Sixteen Pups, due to draught restrictions, cannot enter other small ports to take shelter and may take shelter in the Suzhou River. The meaning of various warning signs prescribed by the Central Meteorological Observatory and the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory and the time of day the signs are hoisted, as well as information on meteorological conditions, shall be sent by the Public Utilities Bureau to the various shipping associations for the shipping companies to be informed.

[Our Report] No. 397, Shimin Village, Hongqiao Road, Shanghai West, is the warehouse of the Shanghai Clothing Factory under the Joint Logistics Headquarters.

### Evicting Tenants, Coffins Brought to the Door: May 30th Hosiery Factory Accuses Landlord of Obstructing Business and Infringing Freedom

[Our Report] Tang Yurang, a native of Funing, rented two rooms downstairs at No. 190-192 Wuzhou Road from Sun Huayin, who resided at No. 338 Kulun Road, on September 24th of last year. He opened the May 30th Hosiery Factory, stipulating a one-year lease, which expired on September 24th of this year. Tang, citing excessive decoration costs, requested a renewal of the lease, but Sun firmly refused. The two sides were deadlocked. On the 4th of this month, Sun, along with his concubine Sun Fangshi, his son Sun Shuihe, and dozens of other men and women, brought eight coffins and piled them inside the May 30th Hosiery Factory, obstructing its business. Tang Yurang reported this to the police, requesting that Sun and others remove the coffins, but the police stated that this was a civil dispute and were unwilling to intervene. Upon hearing this, Sun and others intensified their actions, adding three more coffins the next morning, completely filling the May 30th store. They also moved in an old wooden commode that Sun Huayin's ninety-year-old mother had used for decades, drawing onlookers and blocking the road. Tang Yurang, claiming that Sun was obstructing his business, filed a lawsuit with the local court against Sun Huayin, Sun Fangshi, and Sun Shuihe for the crime of infringing freedom and demanded that they be ordered to remove the coffins. The case was heard yesterday morning in the First Criminal Court by Judge Shen Dabao. The defendant, Sun Huayin, admitted without hesitation to carrying the coffins into the May 30th store. When asked in court where he got so many coffins, Sun replied, "I am the owner of a coffin shop. I want to take back the house downstairs on Wuzhou Road for my own use, but the plaintiff refuses to move out, so I brought the coffins there." Subsequently, the plaintiff, Tang Yurang, stated that although the lease had expired, he had requested to renew it. The defendant did not give notice but instead moved in coffins and commodes, obstructing his business, which was unreasonable. The court concluded the debate on the case and scheduled the verdict for the 21st.

### Xiao Dangui's Coffin Surrounded: 50,000 Fans Crowd Paradise to See the Famous Actress's Last Moments

[Our Report] The body of Yue Opera star Xiao Dangui was placed in a coffin at the Paradise Funeral Home yesterday. Daxi Road underwent a transformation from its usual quiet and desolate state, with people flocking to Paradise from 8:00 am onwards. By the afternoon, the crowd grew larger and larger, causing severe congestion from the Jiangsu Road intersection to inside the funeral hall, creating a "grand occasion" unseen in over a decade since Ruan Lingyu's passing. When Yuan Xuefen, Zhu Shuizhao, Xu Yulan, Chuan Quanxiang and others entered the hall together to preside over the ceremony in the afternoon, the crowd surged forward even more, shoulder to shoulder, rushing into the funeral hall, all wanting to catch a glimpse of the famous actress's face and pay their respects to her remains. As a result, order was completely lost, and wooden furniture and lawn flowers were all knocked over. Wreaths, flower baskets, and the large photo frame of Xiao Dangui were also trampled into pieces. The military and police authorities temporarily dispatched a large number of personnel to assist in maintaining order, and the coffin placement ceremony proceeded hastily amidst the clamor.

Before the ceremony, Xiao Dangui's face was slightly ulcerated due to arsenic poisoning, so she was re-made-up. A "Zhang Family Qian Clan" ancestral tablet was originally placed before the coffin, but it was removed after discussions with Yuan Xuefen and others. Xiao Dangui's siblings, the children of her husband Zhang Chunfan's first wife, and several godmothers of Xiao Dangui were all present to take care of matters. Xiao Dangui was dressed in seven layers of various colored clothing and four pairs of various colored pants, white stockings, and embroidered shoes. Before the coffin was closed, twenty-five cheongsams, ten-odd close-fitting shirts, pants, and vests, a complete set of pure silver bowls, chopsticks, cups, and spoons, and two silk-cotton quilts that Xiao Dangui had used during her lifetime were placed beside her as burial goods. At 3:40 pm, when the coffin was closed, the crowd waiting anxiously outside the window rushed straight in when the master of ceremonies shouted to pay respects. All six long glass windows were knocked down by the surge of people, and the funeral altar also collapsed. Candlesticks fell to the ground, cries erupted, drums and music sounded together, women screamed that someone was groping them, and the military and police caught several pickpockets.

During the ceremony, Xiao Dangui's husband, Zhang Chunfan, also appeared in mourning clothes, crying sadly. Many other Yue Opera fans also sobbed and wept, and everyone asked each other, "Who will be able to play the Empress (referring to the play *Love of Mountains and Rivers*) in the future?" In the midst of the chaos, another fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl pleaded with those blocking her path in front of the surging crowd, "Please let me in to see her! This is the last time!" Crying and begging, she insisted on entering. The power of Yue Opera to attract the masses was such.

The losses at Paradise during this ceremony totaled over 100 million yuan. The cost of the actress's quilts and bedding amounted to over 30 million yuan, and the nanmu coffin cost 150 million yuan, making it a grand affair. As for when the funeral will be held and whether it will be buried at West Lake, it is currently awaiting consultation between Xiao Dangui's godmother and the Yue Opera community. The truth about Xiao Dangui's murder will reportedly be released after negotiations with various parties.

According to statistics, there were over 50,000 attendees at Paradise yesterday, almost all of whom were women and children. They only began to leave successively at around 5:00 pm after Yuan Xuefen and others broke through the encirclement under the protection of the military and police.

However, due to the war front changing and communication being cut off, the gold shop intended to embezzle the gold, refusing to pay interest or allow withdrawals, leading to a complaint from the officer's family members.

### A Talk with Hu Shih: Nanjing, 14th, Our Reporter Pu Dejie

Dr. Hu Shih (Our Report Photo) "...The students have decided to resume classes this morning!"

When Principal Hu Shih said these words, he was filled with a joyful mood. He pushed up his glasses and folded a newspaper carefully, holding it in his hand as he told the reporter:

"This news is good enough, right? Haha"—this "good enough" news made Principal Hu especially happy, and he spoke a lot despite his busy schedule.

"There are still two students who were arrested at Peking University who have not been released. According to the official announcement of the case, it is quite serious. Both are students in the Economics Department, and their grades are usually good, but I don't know them. They left school a long time ago and only came back to study after the victory."

Talking about the lives of teachers and students in northern schools, he said:

"Coming here and seeing that I can eat white rice, I really feel envious. The situation in the north is too difficult. Everyone eats coarse grains, and the rice is all broken rice, very bad. The students' staple food is corn grits and sorghum flour, and they gnaw on cornbread every day. I came to Nanjing this time only a little over a month since the last time, but prices have risen too much. The north has been affected, and life in general will be even more difficult." As he spoke, he shook his head, and the smile on his face disappeared. The living problems of faculty and students are a new topic for university presidents, weighing heavily on the minds of scholars. He hopes that the salaries of public school teachers and staff will be sufficient to maintain their lives, and the new suggestions from the Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, and Political Council are reasonable and should be implemented. —But at the same time that the reporter was talking to him, the political affairs meeting had passed the transitional adjustment plan.

Next Year's American Election

Regarding Burritt's "Impressions of a Visit to China," which has aroused widespread attention in both Chinese and American public opinion, he is currently looking for a full text to read. He said that Burritt is a straightforward person, and they know each other well, but he has to wait until he has read his article before expressing his opinion. From here, the reporter and Principal Hu talked about the American election.

"The situation of next year's election is still not clear what the trend is. We have to wait until the Republican presidential candidate is nominated in June and the Democratic Party also decides on the role to be opposed in July before we can observe. The Republican Party has already lost four consecutive elections, and in 1944, Dewey and Roosevelt's votes were not that different, so there will be a competition next year."

Stassen is Most Hopeful

"Mr. Hu, who do you think is most likely to be nominated as a candidate in the Republican Party?"

"It's hard to say. Dewey has strength in the party organization, but a person who has failed before is rarely selected as a candidate again, unless there is a real lack of talent, like Bryan, who was nominated by the Democratic Party as a candidate three times in 1896, 1900, and 1908, but he also failed three times. Eisenhower is a promising one, but we have to wait until he leaves the military. Next year, he will be our principal (Eisenhower will take office as the president of Columbia University), and maybe he will participate in the election. Also, there is the young and capable Stassen, who is only forty years old this year. He started campaigning the earliest, and his talent and ideas are very popular with the American people. I think his hope is the greatest."

He Thinks MacArthur is Old

"What about General MacArthur?"

"Old!"

"Vandenberg?"

"That's right, Michigan supports him, and he is also a relatively promising one."

"Taft?"

"Taft's influence in the Republican Party is not small, but his isolationism is very unfavorable to his campaign. The American people have lost interest in this."

Thoughts on Wallace

"Mr. Hu, what do you think of Wallace's third party?"

"Wallace's faction is supported by very progressive and liberal people in America, but this is ultimately a minority. My judgment is that if the Democratic Party splits, it will inevitably lead to a Republican victory. Since Theodore Roosevelt left the Republican Party in 1912 and formed the Progressive Party, resulting in failure, no one has done this again in more than 30 years. Although the Progressive Party had more votes than the Republican Party that time, victory still belonged to the Democratic Party's Wilson. Theodore Roosevelt and Taft were both losers."

Diplomacy Will Not Change

"Mr. Hu, where do you think the focus of next year's American election competition will be? Now, the Democratic and Republican parties are united on foreign policy. Will there be any changes by then?"

"American diplomacy currently does not show any signs of changing. The focus of the people's choice is probably still on systems and doctrines that are closely related to their interests."

"Mr. Hu, do you mean that next year's election will not affect American foreign policy?"

He nodded. Finally, he said: "Let's see next summer!"

Principal Hu's talk was stopped at this point due to time constraints. In these ten thousand miles of days where speaking is not for the people, the difficult lives of the northern people and the housework on the other side of the Pacific seem to be the only topics he is willing to discuss. At noon, a feast where he can eat white rice is waiting for him, so the reporter should not bother him any further.

### Wuxi Farmers' Association Celebrates First Anniversary

Female Members Reach Over Two Thousand

[Our Report from Wuxi, 15th] Since the founding of the Republic of China, there has been no farmers' association organization in our county. Farmers were like loose sand. It was not until October of the fifteenth year that the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department sent people to be responsible for organizing. The following year, the Farmers' Association was established, but it soon ceased its activities. In the twentieth year, the Central Government promulgated the Farmers' Association Organization Law, and the official Farmers' Association was established in March. Later, due to lack of funds, the work was suspended. In the summer of the twenty-fourth year, the County Executive Committee reorganized it, and it was completed in the autumn. Until the autumn of the twenty-sixth year, the war of resistance against Japan began, and the association's affairs were suspended. For eight years of occupation, the farmers suffered all kinds of hardships. In October of the thirty-fifth year, the County Charcoal Association was officially established, and Lu Zaiyang, Hu Zhengling, Hu Huiwu, Zang Wenda, Jiang Yi and others were selected as directors and supervisors. Lu Zaiyang was elected as the chairman of the board of directors (currently a county councilor), presiding over the association's affairs. As of September of the Taiyear, 134 township farmers' associations have been established, and the association's affairs are flourishing. Today (the 15th), at 9:00 am, a first anniversary celebration meeting was held at the County Council, with an unprecedented grand occasion. Currently, there are 2,071 female members in the entire county, including Xu Yueying, the executive director of the Zhangcun Township Farmers' Association in the Sixth District (29 years old, currently the executive director of the Women's Association of the County Council), and Zhou Peihua, the executive director of the Zhangmiaoshe Township Farmers' Association (66 years old, currently the deputy township head and teacher of the Central People's School). Both are women, growing up in the countryside and are very interested in agriculture. They lead the charcoal farmers, develop agricultural movements, and all parties place great hope in them.

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 8th] According to a survey of the current state of roads in Fujian Province: On the national highways, there are five routes, including the Beijing-Guangdong Trunk Line, the Fujian-Guangdong Trunk Line, the Zhejiang-Guangdong Trunk Line, and the Fujian-Hunan Trunk Line, totaling over 2,262 kilometers, but only 1,341 kilometers are open to traffic. There are 19 provincial highways, totaling 4,000 kilometers, but only about 350 kilometers are open to traffic. Thus, although there are 24 national and provincial highways in Fujian Province, with a total length of 6,262 kilometers, only 1,709 kilometers are actually open to traffic, accounting for less than one-third of the total. The Southwest Highway was thoroughly damaged during the war, and the provincial government is unable to repair it after the war. Even road maintenance is quite difficult. Also, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airlines has recently established a branch in Fuzhou to facilitate overseas Chinese in the Fuzhou area traveling to various ports in Southeast Asia. Overseas Chinese purchasing tickets from the company will first fly to Hong Kong on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane, then transfer to another plane to fly to major ports in Southeast Asia.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] The Zhenjiang-Changzhou-Danyang-Yangzhou Suppression Command received a telegram from the Capital Garrison Headquarters stating that the communist bandits Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, and Su Yu were roaming in Anhui Province along the Jinpu Railway and in various places in northern Jiangsu, attempting to revive their forces. To ensure the safety of the capital region, the command has decided on four measures for ships navigating the Yangtze River within its jurisdiction: Ships are prohibited from docking on the north bank of the Yangtze River, except for ports open to the public in Huaiyin. All ships, except those restricted to certain routes, must navigate along the south bank. Each Jiangfang district must concentrate ships from the north bank of the Yangtze River, berthing them at ports on the south bank, dividing them into baojia units, and assigning personnel to manage them together with local officials. Each Jiangfang district may implement wartime emergency measures, utilizing some motorboats and wooden boats to form patrol teams to patrol the river surface.

### Ministry of Education Inspector Chen Dongyuan Discusses University Expenses: Central University Needs Over 2.9 Billion Per Month; Chongqing University Needs Over 700 Million

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of Education, responding to an article by Cai Shangsi published in the Dagongbao of Shanghai on the 11th of this month, which stated that "the monthly expenditure of a division of soldiers is 120 million yuan, while the monthly budget for running a university is only over 30 million yuan. The cost of maintaining one division of soldiers can support 39 universities," stated today through Inspector Chen Dongyuan that although the current educational funding is insufficient to meet actual needs, after careful consideration, it is unbelievable that a university can be run with only over 30 million yuan per month. University expenses vary depending on the size of the school and the cost of living in the area. Nanjing Central University, according to current standards, spends over 2.9 billion yuan per month, including "academic and administrative expenses," "living subsidies for faculty and staff," "academic research subsidies," and "student support expenses," among other things. Construction and temporary expenses are not included. Chongqing University is smaller in scale, and the cost of living in the area is lower, but its monthly expenses still reach over 700 million yuan. Cai's comparison of the budgeted expenditure with the actual expenditure has some logical flaws.

### Nanjing Middle School Principals Advocate Increasing Teachers' Training Fees; Hosted Press Conference Yesterday to Explain Views

[Hualian News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Nanjing's public middle schools, faced with high prices, meager teacher salaries, and insecure livelihoods, previously submitted a written petition through representatives to the Municipal Assembly, requesting the passage of an increase in teachers' training fees for municipal secondary schools. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the principals of various public middle schools hosted a press conference at Municipal No. 1 Middle School, attended by Chen Chongyin and over a dozen others. Chen first reported on the excellent treatment of teachers in private schools and the precedent of collecting teachers' training fees in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai. Xu Yuanpu then stated two points: Increasing teachers' training fees can improve teaching efficiency. The treatment of teachers in municipal schools is inferior to that in private schools, and the mental strain is even greater because of the large number of students eager to enroll in municipal schools to receive education. Each class is already at full capacity, with 70 to 80 students per class. The workload of "teaching" and "grading papers" is inevitably increased. Increasing teachers' training fees is a small amount, but it provides significant mental comfort to teachers. From 1929 to 1937, education in the capital advanced rapidly. During the war, due to insufficient conditions, standards declined. After the victory, rising prices and insecure livelihoods made it impossible to improve standards. To correct this problem, strengthening the teachers' qualifications is essential.

### The "World Scholarly Dictionary" Completed by the Xuetian Museum; Yang Jialuo Discusses Work Plans

[Shenzhou News] Since its establishment in 1930, the Chinese Xuetian Museum of the World Academy has gathered scholars from the Chinese academic community, dedicating themselves to compiling the "World Scholarly Dictionary" and the "Comprehensive History of the Nation." During the Anti-Japanese War, it endured many hardships, but the editors-in-chief Li Shizeng, Yang Jialuo, and Chu Renxin worked even harder.

[Our Newspaper] Two hundred and ninety-eight dormitory spaces vacated by the graduating class of National Jiaotong University were used by the school to set up dorm administrators' offices and student meeting rooms, taking up 170 dormitory spaces.

### Hong Kong Double Tenth Charity Football Match: Hualian and Western Union Draw; Liu Fuquan's Last Kick Makes it a Tie

[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Airline News] On Double Tenth National Day, as usual, there was a charity football match between Hualian and the Western Union, held at the Naval Stadium, with kickoff at 4:30 PM. Due to the National Day holiday, there were many football fans. The stadium was full just after 4:00 PM. Governor Grantham of Hong Kong was also a distinguished guest. The Navy band played music, heightening the excitement of the whole stadium. After the Chinese and British national anthems were played and the flag-raising ceremony was completed, the match began. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

No Score in First Half

As soon as the match started, the Western team took control. After a while, Hualian began to launch its first counterattack. Afterwards, the Western Union controlled the midfield again. Once, left-winger Ying Shijie shot fiercely near the goal, but Jun Gan deflected the ball, narrowly averting danger. Then there was a melee, and Hualian also had a chance, shooting fiercely at the goal, but unfortunately it hit the post. Thus, the first half ended with no score.

Tie Game

In the second half, the Western Union continued to hold the offensive. If Jun Gan hadn't performed well, Hualian would have lost early. At the fourteenth minute, the ball went back and forth in the Hualian penalty area. Qing Yu accidentally missed a kick, Mitchell broke in and shot forcefully, Jun Gan could not save it, and the Western Union scored the first goal. Hualian desperately counterattacked. Just one minute later, Jing Cong shot fiercely, seemingly destined to enter, but it was returned by Thelas into a corner kick. As time ran out, Hualian still hadn't made much progress. Suddenly, Liu Fuquan intercepted the ball from the opponent's kick and shot from 35 yards away, tying the game at the end of the match.

Hualian Performs Below Par

Judging from the performance, Hualian should have lost. The Western Union's offense was naturally urgent, and its defense was tight, almost making it impossible for the Hualian forwards to score. Looking at Hualian, none of the five forwards were any good, only Shi Jingcong was relatively active. In the defense, Tan Jun Gan tried his best to defend the city. Hualian's failure to lose should be credited to him. Kong Qingyu and Xie Jinhong also played decently, but the others were too disappointing.

### A Report with the Spirit of the Times: UNESCO and China (Conclusion)

Chinese Staff: The Chinese staff within the organization: During the preparatory period from the end of the previous year to the end of last year, the internal staff numbered over a hundred. Since the official establishment at the end of last year, the work of various departments has gradually developed, and the number of staff in each department has gradually increased. As of the beginning of October this year, there are approximately five hundred and fifty staff members. There are also five Chinese individuals working within the organization. Two were hired during the preparatory period: one is Guo Youshou, serving as the Director of the Education Department, and the other is Neng Ailing (a Chinese overseas citizen raised in the UK, commonly known as Miss Sam), formerly an assistant staff member in the Natural Sciences Department, now transferred to be an assistant staff member in the News Department (another person hired during the preparatory period was Wu Wending, serving as an advisor in the Natural Sciences Department, who resigned in the spring of this year). Since the organization was officially established at the end of last year, three more individuals have been hired: one is Qian Zhaozhen (the eldest daughter of Qian Tai), serving as an assistant staff member in the Education Department, who took office in January; the second is …, serving as the Director of the Asian News Department, who took office in July; and the third is Wang Jingxian, serving as an advisor in the Natural Sciences Department, who took office in September. In addition to the above five individuals, there are also two Chinese temporary staff members: one is the advisor to the General Assembly, Luo Zhongshu, whose term is five months and expires on October 15th of this year, and the other is Ms. Gui Guizhen, an assistant staff member in the Natural Sciences Department, who arrived in mid-September and whose term was originally only one month but has now been extended.

In addition, there are other Chinese personnel associated with the organization, such as Chen Yuan, who is one of the executive directors, and Zhao Xin, Zhou Lin, who are responsible for liaison work between the Chinese Ministry of Education and the organization (the Chinese Ministry of Education has a permanent office in the organization). These individuals are not staff members hired by the organization, but they have direct relationships with the organization.

Budget

The Organization's Budget and China: Last year, the UNESCO Paris Conference passed a budget for the organization of US$6.95 million, of which US$950,000 was to repay the expenses of last year's preparatory committee, and US$6 million was the budget for this year.

Last year, the Paris Conference also approved a revolving fund of US$3 million for the organization. Each member state was to contribute proportionally based on their economic development, but each member state only paid one-third this year, totaling US$1 million.

Therefore, this year's organization's expenses and revolving fund combined total US$7 million (the proposed budget for next year is US$9 million, which will be discussed and decided at the Mexico Conference).

The expenses shared by each member are roughly proportional to the dues paid to the United Nations. However, due to the United States' special voluntary contribution, this year it alone pays 44.03% of the total expenses, which is approximately US$2.4 million.

China's dues for this year are US$510,825, plus a revolving fund of US$73,500, totaling US$584,325.

Although the proposed budget for next year is US$9 million (the recent Executive Board resolved that next year's budget should not exceed US$9 million), the share borne by each member state should not differ greatly from this year's amount, because Guatemala, Colombia, Uruguay, Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and seven other countries are preparing to join the organization in January next year. There is also talk of Argentina joining. Liberia and Cuba, for example, are two countries that have recently joined since the budget案 passed at the end of last year. In other words, the budget for next year will increase by US$3 million, but the number of new member states may increase by eight or nine compared to when it was established last winter.

This organization will spend US$6 million this year! This is an unprecedented figure in the history of international educational and cultural cooperation, a considerable sum. But this US$6 million is used for education and culture, for peace and construction. It is only the cost of manufacturing six light cruisers! It is only the cost of manufacturing ten bombing planes! It is only one-eightieth of what was spent in one day of World War II!

Prospects

The Organization's Prospects and China: At the Paris founding conference last winter, the charter was approved, and official member states that sent representatives to attend the meeting numbered thirty (namely: China, Arabia, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Ecuador, the United States, France, Greece, Haiti, India, Lebanon, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, the Dominican Republic, the United Kingdom, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, the Union of South Africa, Venezuela). This year, Liberia joined, and recently Cuba joined. Therefore, the organization currently has thirty-two official member states.

At the Paris conference last winter, twelve countries that had signed the London Charter of November 16, 1945, but had not yet been formally ratified by their governments, also sent representatives to attend the meeting (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, Iraq, Iran, Luxembourg, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay, Yugoslavia).

At the Paris conference last winter, countries that were members of the United Nations but had not signed the London Charter of 1945 were also invited to send representatives to attend as observers, totaling seven countries (Russia, Ukraine, Abyssinia, Paraguay, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Byelorussia). As a result, only Paraguay and Costa Rica sent representatives to attend as observers.

However, three countries that were not members of the United Nations sent representatives to attend the founding conference last winter: Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland. At the conference, Austria, Italy, and Switzerland were nominated as candidate members.

These are all China's brotherly members and friendly nations in this organization. China was one of the first countries to participate in the preparation of this organization, not only because of its long history, large population, and love of peace, but also because it is an independent and important ally in world culture. In the future, China's contribution will have a great impact on the development of this organization. China has invited the organization to hold its fifth annual conference in China in 1950, saying that this year will be the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius' birth. "Confucius was a sage of his time." If Confucius were alive today, he would also strive for cooperation in world education, science, and culture. (The End)

### Sixteen Trade Associations Express Conditional Support for Government Acquisition Measures: Decide on Several Principles for Government Adoption, Hoping for Consideration of Merchants' Difficulties When Drafting Detailed Rules; Petition to Relevant Parties Today

[Our Report] Representatives from sixteen trade associations in this city related to the import of goods with self-provided foreign exchange held a meeting yesterday at 5:30 PM at 150 Hong Kong Road to discuss how to respond to the government's acquisition plan. Chaired by Zhang Yaozhang, Chairman of the Import-Export Association, representatives from each industry reported separately. Industries such as pigments, hardware, chemical raw materials, and steel bars are still discussing within their respective industries and have not yet reached a conclusion. The iron and chemical raw materials industries believe that re-shipping goods for export poses many practical difficulties. Representatives from the import-export and paper industries proposed several countermeasures. The final conclusion was to conditionally support the government's acquisition measures in principle, but with the hope that the circumstances of merchants could be considered when drafting detailed implementation rules. Discussions then began, and several principles were decided to provide to the government for reference and adoption:

The special foreign currency deposit slips issued by the government can be used in the fourth and fifth periods of quota and non-quota allocations. After the special foreign currency deposit slips expire, they can be used to request the Export-Import Management Committee to issue permits, without being included in the quota, and can be used in place of foreign exchange settlement. The two-month deadline for shipment is too short and should be changed to allow prior registration among industries. Those who wish to re-export should only register first. All registered parties have priority transportation rights until the quota is used up. The implementation rules of the Export-Import Management Committee should explicitly stipulate that when the government publicly sells these goods in the future, the original importers and exporters should have priority to purchase them from the original manufacturers. Special foreign currency deposit slips should be issued in unregistered form, be divisible, and be tradable in the market. This would prevent merchants' funds from being frozen. The government's future selling price should be the acquisition price plus 10%, and the original importers and exporters should still have priority to purchase. Request that representatives from relevant trade associations attend the drafting of the implementation rules by the Export-Import Management Committee for consultation. It was also resolved that each trade association should nominate two representatives to petition the National Bank and the Export-Import Management Committee at 2:30 PM today, and it is also planned to petition the Executive Yuan in Nanjing once. Each trade association will convene emergency meetings and conduct registration of those willing to re-export to support the petitioning representatives.

### Zhang Jia'ao Hopes Importers Will Sacrifice Personal Interests and Consider the Overall Situation, and That Cooperation Will Solve Any Problem

[Our Report] After the government announced measures to deal with materials arriving at ports with self-provided foreign exchange, importers expressed difficulties. Yesterday, our reporter specially visited Zhang Jia'ao, Director of the Export-Import Management Committee, to inquire about his opinions. He granted an interview and stated: "The import of materials must be permitted by the Export-Import Management Committee before they can be imported. This is the key to managing trade. Although merchants in Shanghai have various reasons for their materials arriving at ports, importing them without permission inevitably violates government laws. The Export-Import Management Committee, considering that the materials have been delayed for a long time, which is not a long-term solution, petitioned the government to quickly determine a solution to end the matter as soon as possible. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan meeting proposed a discussion by the Yuan organs, which was handed over to a sub-group for review, then to the Economic Committee for deliberation, and finally, this week, a review meeting was convened, which broadly adopted opinions from all parties, and this decision was finally made. In the review meeting, the representatives of the Export-Import Management Committee repeatedly raised concerns about safeguarding the interests of merchants, and the review meeting accommodated them as much as possible. In handling this matter, the government sought a solution that took into account both maintaining regulatory laws, preventing black market speculation, and the interests of importers, and it has been racking its brains. Especially regarding the stimulation of the black market, based on previous experience, and this time, as soon as the news that the Executive Yuan was opening up the import of goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange was released, the foreign exchange black market suddenly rose, the relationship within which is self-evident. Because the black market hinders exports and remittances from overseas Chinese, and because the black market for foreign exchange, gold, and US dollars affects prices, it is too closely related to the interests of all people. I sincerely hope that importers will understand the government's painstaking efforts in handling this matter, sacrifice their personal interests to seek the welfare of all people. As for the detailed rules for handling, the Export-Import Management Committee is drafting them to quickly reduce inconvenience. As long as we have a spirit of cooperation from top to bottom, there is nothing that cannot be solved."

### Export-Import Management Committee to Conduct Goods Registration Soon

Regarding the handling of goods arriving at ports with self-provided foreign exchange, the Export-Import Management Committee received an order from the Executive Yuan yesterday to proceed in accordance with the handling measures. The committee is currently drafting implementation rules, which will be submitted to the Yuan for approval before implementation. According to the committee's spokesperson, the first step in purchasing goods with self-provided foreign exchange will be to conduct registration. Because according to the handling measures, importers who do not want to sell their goods to the government can re-export the goods within 60 days. Therefore, those who wish to sell their goods with self-provided foreign exchange in accordance with the order must first register with the committee, and the committee will review and then purchase them. This registration will begin within two or three days. The committee also stipulates that goods re-exported must not be shipped to Hong Kong or other places, but must be returned to the original place of shipment.

### Banking System Continues to Inject Money, Tight Credit Conditions Persist

[Our Report] National banks continued to inject 57 billion yuan into the bill exchange yesterday. The tight credit conditions did not relax. Dark interest rates were still quoted at 2.2%, and multiple parties in the off-market Chinese stock market were offering interest subsidies, which have risen to 3%. The funds injected yesterday were mainly for cotton yarn settlement. Central Bank injected 2.6 billion yuan, Greater Exchange exported 2.9 billion yuan, Foreign Bank injected 33.6 billion yuan, Small Exchange exported 8.83 billion yuan, Bank of China injected 4.6 billion yuan, Bank of Communications injected 700 million yuan, Farmers Bank exported 1.2 billion yuan, China Investment Bank injected 1.36 billion yuan, Postal Remittance exported 2.4 billion yuan, and Cooperative Bank exported 2.3 billion yuan.

### Credit Cooperative Deposits and Loans Must Not Be Considered Interbank Transactions

[Our Report] Regarding whether transactions between credit cooperatives and banks and money houses can be considered interbank transactions, it is learned that the Ministry of Finance has a concrete explanation: "According to regulations, credit cooperatives, in addition to receiving deposits from non-members after obtaining approval, should limit their credit granting to members. Therefore, their nature is different from that of general banks. Now, the Ministry has stipulated that if banks and money houses legally engage in transactions with credit cooperatives, they must not be considered interbank transactions. All deposits received from credit cooperatives must be treated as ordinary deposits and be subject to deposit reserve requirements. Loans to credit cooperatives should also be treated as ordinary customers and be handled according to general procedures."

### Silk Exports Gradually Improving

Since autumn, China's silk exports have shown signs of improvement. To date, the China Trust Bureau has processed the inspection of more than two thousand out of the five thousand five hundred bales of spring silk delivered by manufacturers, and has shipped them in batches to France (45 bales) and the United Kingdom (90 bales). 800 bales for India were also shipped yesterday. It is also learned that the bureau plans to ship another one thousand bales each to India and the United States, and 75 bales to the United Kingdom this month. The goods shipped to the United States are scheduled to be loaded onto the Courser on the 25th. The current overseas market price is approximately US$4.40 to US$4.20 per pound. The UK market requires finer silk threads and offers better prices. If the situation in India improves, China's silk sales will become more active. The United States has 50,000 to 60,000 bales of stored silk and 80,000 to 90,000 bales of Japanese silk, which are flooding the market, and the market price is sluggish. Japanese silk prices have fallen, and Italian silk has even fallen to around US$3.50.

### Government Bonds Improve, Chinese Stocks Weak

Government bonds tended to improve yesterday. Unified C opened at 16,200 yuan, reached a high of 17,400 yuan, and then hovered around 16,800 yuan. Approximately 5 million changed hands. Rooms 538 and 552 and Runde bought, while Rooms 360, 550, and 503 sold.

Chinese stocks were slightly lower yesterday, and the process was relatively stable. Ewo Cotton opened at 182,000 yuan and retreated from 186,000 yuan to within 180,000 yuan to close. Although the Guangdong dealers bought, the foreign firm dealers and securities dealers sold. As a result, Ewo fell by 0.5% compared to the previous closing price, Paper Industry and Guangdong Ping were flat, and the rest were slightly lower.

### Textile Association Board of Directors Decides to Establish Three Committees

[Our Report] The first board meeting of the second session of the Textile Association was held yesterday afternoon at the association's headquarters, chaired by Chairman Du ..., to discuss important matters as follows: The Textile Association decided to establish three committees: (A) Committee on Japan: to study issues such as compensation claims against Japan, restrictions on Japanese spindles, and trade with Southeast Asia.

The organization and personnel issues of each committee were discussed. The Textile Factory Society plans to rent land from the association to build a large auditorium, which will be used jointly by the two associations in the future.

### Police Department Pays Attention to Speculative Chinese Stocks, Retreating Mid-Course

Chinese stocks initially rose yesterday, but due to extremely tight credit conditions, off-market delivery was not easy, interest rates rose again, and speculative forces were forced to sell within the market, causing a sharp decline. In the end, the situation was weak, but some small stocks emerged as a surprise force. Huaxin was absorbed by No. 107, and Qinxing's new shares were maintained by No. 204. The former rose by 50%, and the latter rose to the limit.

Morning trading saw mixed results. After opening, Qinxing took the lead in rising, and Meiya also advanced under short squeeze conditions. However, Yongxin was sold off, retreating to a low price of 315 yuan for immediate delivery and 331 yuan for deferred delivery. Meiya and Qinxing improved better and better, and Yongxin also pulled up to a high price of 334 yuan for immediate delivery and 350 yuan for deferred delivery. Xinya rose to the limit, and Qinxing also forced a rise to the limit. Unexpectedly, after 10 o'clock, speculative forces sold off one after another, and the situation changed suddenly. There were many settlements, and the off-market interest rate rose to 2.55% and 3%, making delivery difficult, and the market gradually declined. Near noon, Yongxin retreated to 315 yuan for immediate delivery and 331 yuan for deferred delivery, and then closed at prices of 317 yuan and 333 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, the immediate delivery stocks Dongxin and Xinguang rose to the limit, Meiya, Zhongsi, Xinlei, Cement, and Commercial Press rose slightly, Huachang, Sino-French, and Zhabei fell by 0.5%, Yongxin, Xinyi, Underwear, Tongyi, Zhongfang, Rongfeng, Lian'an, and Xinyi fell slightly, and Xinguang, Jinglun, Match, and Hengfeng Zhongxing were flat. The deferred delivery stocks Qinxing rose to the limit, Meiya rose by 10%, and Yongxin and Xinguang rose by 0.5%, and the rest rose slightly.

It was heard that the yarn price was good again, and people were excited. Yongxin rose to 327 yuan for immediate delivery and 342 yuan for deferred delivery. Finally, to deal with the speculative market, the police department had countermeasures, and people's hearts turned weak, and Yongxin still closed at a low level of 318 yuan and 331 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning closing price, the immediate delivery stocks Yongxin, Xinyi, Huachang, Underwear, Xinhua, Zhabei, Zhongfang, Tongyi, and Match rose slightly, Meiya and Zhongsi, and Rongfeng fell slightly, Huaxin rose by 10%, Qinxing still rose to the limit, and the rest were flat. The deferred delivery stocks Dongxin rose to the limit, Huayan fell slightly, and Yongxin and Xinyi were also the same, and Xinguang Jingfu were flat.

The current deferred arbitrage transaction yesterday combined interest rates of about 1.6% to 2%. Yongxin's discounted price opened at 15 yuan, retreated from 16 yuan to 14 yuan, and closed at 15 yuan. Meiya retreated from 25 yuan to 20 yuan, and closed at 23 yuan. Xinyi was between 6.5 yuan and 7.5 yuan, and Xinguang was around 1.5 yuan.

### Government Plans to Improve Tea Production and Sales

This year, China's export tea production is estimated to reach more than 300,000 dan. As of the end of June, 73,479 bales had been inspected and released by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and 65,334 dan had been inspected and released by the Taiwan Specialty Product Inspection Office. Recently, with the adjustment of foreign exchange, tea merchants can now make profits, and exports have shown a slightly active phenomenon. However, the production and sales methods of domestic tea are still backward and not suitable for foreign competition. The Executive Yuan, in view of this, ordered the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to consult with relevant agencies to draft an outline of a plan for the production and sales of export tea in order to improve it. It is currently being submitted for approval.

### Export Tea Stagnates

Yesterday's foreign firm tea market: sellers' desire to raise prices remained unchanged, and export firms, considering that foreign tea prices were still low, did not want to rush to buy at high prices, resulting in a standstill in transactions, but the situation was generally stable and pretty. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, local shops and nearby villages still intended to get involved, but due to the limited supply, it was difficult to get what they wanted, and the number of transactions also decreased, and the market situation was improving.

### Cigarettes Turned from Weak to Firm

### Successful Conclusion of Allocation Meeting - Rayon Allocation Decided - Shanghai Receives 65% of Total

[Report from our newspaper] The meeting convened by the China Trust Bureau, gathering representatives from silk weaving, ribbon weaving, and knitting industries from various regions to discuss the allocation of rayon, successfully concluded yesterday afternoon. Although representatives from different regions had some disputes regarding the allocation ratio of rayon, they ultimately cooperated harmoniously and resolved the matter smoothly. The allocation ratio of rayon for the silk weaving industry in various regions will be based on the actual number of silk weaving machines in each region. According to this calculation, Shanghai will receive 65% of the total, while Hangzhou and five other locations will collectively receive 35%.

The number of weaving machines in each region is as follows: Hangzhou 5535 machines, Suzhou 1557 machines, Shengze 1114 machines, Wuxing 463 machines, Wuxi 164 machines, Tianjin 1086 machines, and Shanghai 6800 machines.

Assuming the monthly allocation is 7,000 cases, the allocation ratio would be: Shanghai 4,550 cases, and other cities a total of 2,450 cases. Within that, Hangzhou 1,370 cases, Suzhou 384 cases, Shengze 275 cases, Wuxing 114 cases, Wuxi 40 cases, and Tianjin 267 cases.

Furthermore, assuming the monthly allocation for the ribbon weaving industry is 580 cases, Shanghai will receive 500 cases and Suzhou 80 cases. Other regions have not yet reported their needs, so no allocation has been approved for the time being.

As rayon is not the primary raw material for the knitting industry, it was not discussed during the meeting. In the future, when needed, the China Trust Bureau's rayon allocation committee will refer to the actual situation and re-allocate accordingly. Also, if the monthly amount of rayon arriving at the China Trust Bureau increases or decreases, the allocation will be adjusted proportionally according to the above-determined figures.

Tightening Credit, Rayon Prices Weaken

Yesterday, the price of 120 Dan Rayon such as Xu Zi You Guang etc., was first offered at 80 million yuan in the morning, with transactions at a minimum of 75 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was demand at 78 million yuan. Eventually due to tightening credit and growing unease, the offering price was at 78 million yuan but there were no takers. Transactions for 3A grade goods occurred at 68-69 million yuan in the afternoon.

Factory Transactions

Yesterday morning there were slight transaction, D grade goods were traded opening at 68 million yuan for 7-day notes, other mid-grade goods were offered at 6-7 million yuan, high-grade at 8 million yuan, with credit terms of a few days on the payments. In the afternoon, due to tightened credit, supply was greater than demand, there were no transactions. Dry goods were scarce and offered at steady prices.

Silk Fabrics

Zhen Silk blanket fabrics from Da Cheng and Hua Qiang opened between 22.9 million and 30 million yuan, with maximum next-day contracts at 450,000 yuan, the price fell slightly at the close. With spot trading done at 2.9 million yuan and next day contracts at 3.1 million yuan. Prices for American goods remained flat with little trading, Hua Jin high-end goods offered at 60,000 yuan, with very little trading for all goods, offering prices were firm.

### The Latest Discovery on the Principles of High Blood Pressure

— Wang Wanbai

I have high blood pressure, so I am particularly concerned about it. Recently, I saw an article in the well-known American magazine "Time" revealing a new understanding of high blood pressure, which aroused great interest. I had just given a radio broadcast on it, and now I am honored to be asked by this publication to contribute an article. I am providing this translated record for your review and correction.

An Amazing Discovery

High blood pressure accounts for one-third of all mortality in the United States, so the medical community recognizes this disease as the most dangerous disease of the 20th century civilization, and also the most difficult to understand. However, today, it is possible to provide a clear explanation for this previously incomprehensible mystery, because a British scientist has found a clue to this disease. The conclusion of his discovery is that the increase in blood pressure is actually due to a "short circuit" in the blood circulation within the kidneys. The reason for this phenomenon is that the nerves are overly stressed.

An Accidental Discovery

The discovery of the new understanding of high blood pressure was actually a matter of chance, just as the discovery of Penicillin was also accidental. In 1941, when Britain was subjected to intense bombing by enemy planes, paramedics discovered that people injured by collapsing houses, whose legs had been compressed by heavy objects for several hours, would suddenly die of kidney failure, which was quite mysterious, and the danger was no different from heart failure.

But how could leg compression affect the kidneys? Soon, a Spanish physician, Josep Trueta, and his four colleagues at the Oxford Medical Research Institute, conducted blood circulation experiments on rabbits in their spare time. They tightly tied tourniquets around the hind legs of the rabbits, then injected colored liquid into the arteries of the rabbits, and observed the results with X-rays. Soon they found the mysterious answer: after prolonged compression of the arteries in the legs, the surrounding blood vessels would spasm, resulting in obstructed blood circulation to the kidneys, thus leading to the dangerous consequence of kidney failure.

Anemia in the Renal Cortex

Now that the principle of kidney failure caused by prolonged limb compression had been successfully studied, Trueta's research team conducted further exploration. They found that the blood circulation in the kidneys has an automatic emergency response mechanism from the inner layer to the outer layer. When the blood supply to the renal cortex is blocked, the blood in its arteries will take a shortcut, passing through the larger blood vessels in the renal medulla and returning to the veins. As a result, the renal cortex becomes extremely anemic, lacking blood and oxygen, leading to starvation. The consequences are as follows: ① The secretion of urine decreases or even stops completely. ② The anemic renal cortex immediately secretes a substance (probably a hormone) to stimulate the whole body to increase blood pressure.

Based on the above discovery, Trueta's research team found a clue: this phenomenon of shortening the blood circulation path in the kidneys can also be produced by many other stimulating methods. For example, stimulating a certain nerve with electricity can also achieve the same effect. Also, severe bleeding, or the application of heavy doses of endocrine hormones (such as epinephrine and pituitary hormones), or the injection of toxins secreted by pyogenic bacteria, can all have a stimulating effect. Therefore, the research team concluded that tense nerves constrict the blood vessels of the kidneys, causing blood to flow into the larger blood vessels in the renal medulla instead of the fine blood vessels in the renal cortex, resulting in a lack of blood in the renal cortex. Therefore, the body automatically adjusts to increase blood pressure, forcing more blood to reach the renal cortex.

Emotional Attacks

Doctors have long felt that a certain type of high blood pressure is closely related to the kidneys, and they also know that anger or other emotional attacks can raise blood pressure. We have what is called "essential hypertension," which accounts for 95% of all hypertension cases. It is only known to be related to the kidneys, but no detailed explanation has been given. Now, the physiological circulation of high blood pressure demonstrated by Trueta's research team can explain the principle of this essential hypertension.

According to Trueta's research team, changes in kidney blood circulation are merely passive tools, and the one manipulating these tools is actually the nerves. Any sudden injury to the nervous system, or emotional stress, can cause such an attack. Therefore, the research team announced in their recently published book "Studies on Kidney Blood Circulation," stating that we firmly believe that the main cause of high blood pressure has been found to belong to the central nervous system, that is, in one's own mind. If they can fully understand this point, it will bring great new hope to patients with essential hypertension. (Translator's note: The implication is that patients should not be in a state of worry, fear, or being busy and tense all day long. Therefore, a pleasant and peaceful state of mind is the secret to preventing and treating high blood pressure.)

### DDT and Prisoner Hygiene (Continued)

— Hu Qipeng

This is from the perspective of humanity and law. We must pay attention to prison hygiene and the improvement of prisoners' lives. From the perspective of public health, it should also be valued. Especially prisons built in urban areas, because infectious diseases in prisons have a high chance of spreading to citizens and becoming a pandemic. For example, in the years 1577, 1730, and 1750, Britain's prisons experienced three outbreaks of infectious plague. The deaths of prisoners piled up, and the disease spread to citizens, causing many deaths. Now, looking at several prisons and detention centers in Shanghai, there have been deaths from infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, epidemic typhus, and relapsing fever over the years. In the years 1933, 1938, 1940, and 1944, the Shanghai Detention Center of the Shanghai Local Court on Sinan Road (formerly the Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Rue Massenet) experienced an outbreak of epidemic typhus (this disease is very easy to occur in prisons, so it was formerly known as "jail fever"). The spread was very severe. The mortality rate of prisoners in the prison broke records. Guards, staff, prison directors, and prison medical officers were all infected and died. In 1944, during the enemy-puppet era, Zhang Yipeng, the puppet Minister of Justice, died of infection after visiting the prison for inspection. In the same year, many citizens were also infected. In the two years since the war, various prisons and detention centers have received many DDT liquid and powder agents distributed by the Relief Administration. Prison medical officers must use them cautiously at all times. Therefore, the formerly dreaded epidemic typhus and relapsing fever have gradually decreased. By 1946, they had not been found. This is because the viruses of these two diseases are entirely spread by body lice as vectors. Prisoners in prisons and detention centers are most prone to fleas and lice because their clothing and bedding are unclean and rarely washed. Now that fleas and lice have been killed by DDT, these two terrible infectious diseases have also been eliminated. As shown in this statistical chart, the number of prisoners housed in various prisons and detention centers is inversely proportional to the number of deaths. Comparing the past death toll, it can be said that DDT has saved many prisoners who were about to die from diseases.

Table of Prisoners Housed and Deaths in Shanghai Prisons and Detention Centers in 1945 and 1946

Of course, emphasizing the hygiene of prisoners in prisons and detention centers does not mean that we can be fearless just because we have DDT. It is still important to pay attention to prisoners' living quarters, diet, clothing, bedding, exercise, environmental cleanliness, and mental health. These are all fundamental points for improving prison hygiene. For example, when it comes to the hygiene of prisoners' clothing and bedding, after prisoners enter prison, they all wear clothing and bedding prepared by the prison, and they often bathe and change clothes, so that fleas and lice have no way to parasitize. If fleas and lice are completely eliminated, DDT will not be necessary. The two infectious diseases of epidemic typhus and relapsing fever will never be found in prisons again. Clean and tidy prisoners' clothing and bedding is not only related to cleanliness and hygiene, but also has important implications for prison security and appearance. Therefore, I firmly believe that the wise judicial authorities, in view of the fact that the hygiene of prisoners in prisons and detention centers can affect the public health of citizens, and at the same time need to realize the meaning of modern imprisonment, will definitely actively improve the hygiene of prisoners in prisons and detention centers.

### A Brief Discussion on Infantile Convulsions

— Xie Yunshou

Convulsions are the most common disease in children. If you walk along the street, you can see signs everywhere that say "Family Tradition of Massage, Specializing in Treating Acute and Chronic Convulsions." When convulsions occur, it is truly a shocking event. A lively and clever child suddenly foams at the mouth, loses consciousness, and the whole body convulses, causing the whole family to panic and seek medical advice and divination, caught off guard. "Acute convulsions meet a slow doctor" - a kind of anxious attitude can be seen from these eight words.

Medically speaking, convulsions are not the name of a disease, but a symptom of a disease. Any febrile disease in children, digestive disorders, acute indigestion, dysentery, meningitis, encephalitis, or pertussis, uremia, can often cause convulsions. Because the brain center of infants and young children, his reflex inhibition function, has not yet been fully developed, some minor stimuli can cause convulsions or a state of spasm, especially when children encounter high fever, his reflex function is somewhat increased, and it is easier to cause systemic spasms. There are also some neurotic children who suddenly have convulsions when they are slightly frightened or angry. More are caused by the existence of intestinal parasites, such as roundworms. True epilepsy, commonly called "sheep madness," and symptomatic epilepsy, such as congenital dementia, cerebral palsy, sequelae of encephalitis, can also cause convulsions.

Emergency treatment for convulsions: Since there are so many causes of convulsions, the patient's family cannot treat it themselves. However, before the doctor arrives, emergency measures are also very important. First, put the child to bed quietly, loosen the child's clothes, and place a cold towel or ice pack on the head to promote awakening. Try to avoid all kinds of stimuli, and use a screen to block strong light. Open the windows to allow air to circulate. The sick room should be quiet. When children are having convulsions, people often unconsciously shout loudly, even breaking porcelain. Sometimes when the doctor enters, there is no place to put his feet. This is not only a meaningless act, but also does not benefit the patient. On the one hand, an enema should be given first, which can expel the contents of the intestine, reduce bloating, and also reduce convulsions. The stool after the enema should be saved and can be examined for its properties when the doctor arrives, especially when dysentery is prevalent and the child has not yet had diarrhea, and high fever and convulsions occur first, which is often encountered.

As for the treatment method, of course, it is necessary for the doctor to come, after examination, before treatment. Speaking of the prognosis, it varies depending on the condition. However, most of the diseases that cause convulsions in children are colds, fever, indigestion, constipation, roundworms, etc., which are naturally not very dangerous. The massage of Old Lady Wang and Mama Li is effective, mostly for these types of diseases. If it is encephalitis, meningitis, dysentery, etc., and it is not treated early, then there is a danger to life.

### Nutritional Disorders in Breastfed Infants

— Cheng Hanzhang

Nutritional Disorders in Infants Fed with Human Milk

When overnutrition leads to milk regurgitation, vomiting, or diarrhea, it is advisable to shorten the breastfeeding time and reduce the frequency of feeding. Do not breastfeed within four or five hours.

In severe diarrhea, a small amount of cathartic may be given first, followed by an astringent. For cathartics, use calomel (0.01 taken at once, or 0.05 per dose, three times a day) or castor oil (3.0 taken at once, once a day); for astringents, bismuth subnitrate is commonly used (0.1 per dose, three times a day), etc.

Even after recovery, it is advisable to prohibit breastfeeding more than five or six times a day.

Nutritional Insufficiency

If breast milk secretion is insufficient, it can be accurately determined by measuring the weight before and after breastfeeding. In addition, even if secretion is sufficient, but the nature of the breast milk is like colostrum, mixed feeding should be performed; if breast milk secretion is still insufficient or contains colostrum globules, and the child's developmental delay and gastrointestinal symptoms do not decrease, weaning can be started and breast milk discarded, but it is still not advisable to completely discard breast milk.

As for acute gastrointestinal disease, nephritis, or beriberi in the mother, or when the infant develops symptoms, the approach should be to first try mixed feeding and not discontinue breastfeeding.

Situations Where Human Milk is Unsuitable

When the mother or wet nurse suffers from an acute infectious disease, or when the infant shows clear symptoms of beriberi, and in cases of tuberculosis in the breastfeeding woman, breastfeeding must be discontinued and a healthy wet nurse chosen; except for these situations, if the breastfeeding woman has no abnormalities and her milk is suitable for other infants, but is uniquely unsuitable for her own infant, causing vomiting, diarrhea, and other nutritional disorders, although it is extremely rare in practice, there are still examples. In this case, breastfeeding should also be discontinued and the infant fed the milk of another wet nurse, or artificial nutrition must be completely transitioned to. However, mixed feeding is best. In short, the best standard for wet nurse selection (Ammenwahl) is to examine the nutritional status of the wet nurse's own child.

Constipation in Infants Fed with Human Milk

Constipation in infants fed with human milk may be due to a small amount of milk intake, or it may be due to an excessive amount, so attention should be paid to this point first, and the best approach to treating constipation is to avoid using medications.

1.  Enema (glycerin or equal parts water and glycerin)

2.  Abdominal massage: First, rub and pinch the skin of the abdomen with the thumb and forefinger for two to three minutes, then massage the rectus abdominis muscle from the upper part to the lower part and then from the lower part to the upper part, then massage the lateral abdominal muscles (with the thumb on the front abdomen and the other four fingers on the corresponding back), and then place the palm between the ileum and the ribs to make circular movements, lightly rubbing and finally imagining the jejunum to move in the same way as its peristalsis, massaging in sequence. This massage is sometimes effective.

3.  Use Liebig's juice or malt extract paste, one or two teaspoons daily, dissolved in soup and given to the infant. (Refer to appendix) (To be continued)

### Jaundice

— Chu Linzun

This name is very common. When we see this term, or hear this word, we will think of a patient's skin, the whites of the eyes, showing a particularly yellow color, the color of the urine is also very dark, on the contrary, the stool is sometimes grayish-white, the skin is itchy, and the pulse is relatively slower. It seems that diagnosing jaundice is very easy. You don’t need to consult a doctor. Can’t you determine what disease you have and take some medicine for jaundice? Of course, there are many medicines, or some secret recipes. After taking them for a few days, the disease slowly gets better, and you think it’s the effect of the medicine. However, the fact is not like this; because there are many diseases that you don’t take any medicine for, and after a considerable period of time, they naturally get better. Some people, too, get jaundice, take the same prescription, and not only do they not get better; they almost lose their lives. Perhaps they took an effective and miraculous elixir that worked on others, but really lost their own lives. What is the reason for this? Because without proper diagnosis and treatment, getting better is luck, and not getting better is what you expect!

Jaundice is a symptom, and many diseases, and many causes, can show the same symptoms. This is a good example of the same symptoms but different causes. There are also many diseases where the cause is the same but the symptoms are different.

Now, I will introduce to readers the names of several major diseases that can cause jaundice symptoms: infectious jaundice, the same as serum hepatitis, drug-induced jaundice, chemical jaundice, jaundice caused by systemic infectious diseases, acute yellow atrophy of the liver, Weil's disease, actinomycosis, leukemia, Horlgkin's disease, amyloidosis, echinococcosis, Leishmaniasis, Histoplasmosis, liver abscess (A. bacterial pyogenic, B. amoebic), congestive heart failure, thyrotoxicosis, pancreatitis, duodenal ulcer, chronic hepatitis (cirrhotic), pancreatic cancer, Vater's ampulla cancer, extrahepatic bile duct cancer, gallbladder cancer, metastatic liver cancer, primary liver cancer, acute cholecystitis, bile duct stones, bile duct stricture, hypersplenic hemolytic jaundice, constitutional lung dysfunction, neonatal jaundice.

Although I have written so many disease names, it is not complete, but it is already too much for the general reader! These few disease names may give you an impression that jaundice is a symptom, and its causes are many. The causes are different, and the treatment methods are of course different. Some require a surgeon; some require an internist, and some require a pediatrician, because the causes of neonatal jaundice are also very complex, and detailed differential diagnosis is needed. In short, regardless of male, female, old, or young, when you are sick, you should ask a doctor for a detailed examination to determine an accurate diagnosis and the most effective and economical treatment method. Do not be self-righteous and take medicine indiscriminately with a smattering of knowledge. There are often many diseases that can be diagnosed and treated with today's medicine, but are repeatedly misdiagnosed by patients or their families; resulting in an unknown sacrifice!

### The Arab People

— Lun

Mentioning the Arab people cannot help but evoke many historical memories. Thirteen hundred years ago, the prophet Muhammad preached a monotheistic religion to the citizens and tribes of western Arabia, and this religion was the beginning of Islam. In the year 622 AD, they established colonies, forcing the conquered people to submit to their language and race, and spreading their religious beliefs. Through a kind of merger (in which some refused to merge), a new and greater Arab nation was born. So until now, Muhammad established a small country in Medina. But this small country should not be underestimated, because it has a very glorious and splendid history. Within eighty years, it had roamed the west of Asia, reaching the mountains of Afghanistan, and crossed North Africa, reaching the Atlantic coast. Wherever they went, they asked people how to define the Arab nation. We only have one answer that is close to the truth: all those who recognize Muhammad's mission and the belief in the Arab Empire as the historical center, and all those who recognize the Arabic language and its cultural traditions as a common heritage, are Arabs.

For more than a hundred years, the Arabs have lived under the cultural traditions of medieval Islam, still maintaining a balance of social and economic interests and religious control, while maintaining a calm and detached attitude towards political and governmental issues. They are xenophobic and regard Europeans as uncivilized barbarians.

The starting point of Islamic nationalism is undoubtedly religious rather than nationalistic, and this should be remembered. They are now reviving the dream of the past Islamic empire and appearing on the current world political stage with a new image of the Arab League. This hope has gradually intensified for the surging national movement.

Forgetfulness
— Rong Guan

Not long ago, China was considered a forgetful nation. This forgetfulness probably originated with King Wu of the Spring and Autumn period. History records that King Wu, Helü, was defeated and killed by Goujian of Yue. The son of King Wu (Fucha) had someone stand in front of the court every day, calling his name whenever he entered or exited, and asking: "Fucha! Have you forgotten the hatred of the Yue people who killed your father?" He would answer: "I dare not forget."

He said he "dared not forget," but three years later, Fucha defeated Goujian; Goujian submitted and sued for peace, offering beautiful women. Fucha indulged in sensual pleasures and forgot everything about his previous teacher. "Twenty years later, we'll see who's stronger." Fucha was forced to sign a treaty of surrender. Presuming Fucha to be the ancestor of forgetfulness, there are probably few objections.

Therefore, "when the Way is not practiced, one may as well drift on a raft." How long ago was it that this amnesia has crossed the Pacific Ocean and reached the east of the sea? Uncle Sam, who claims to be scientifically advanced and to have entered the atomic age before the world, probably overuses his brain, but rarely replenishes it. It would be fine if his own memory was weak! Raising a tiger brings trouble. What about its impact on human peace? But the old man of the United States simply doesn't consider this. Here is an example:

The work of revitalizing Germany and Japan has become a concrete measure. Even Marshall, who is openly known as the "American Helmsman," has unreservedly expressed his intention to revive West Germany in his European Recovery Program. In Japan, General MacArthur has taken it upon himself to be biased towards Japanese "democracy": huge loans, opening of trade... This is still not enough; the chairman of the Japan Committee, Sebald, even added fuel to the fire by resolutely advocating that Japan's industrial level should be raised above the old standard of 1930-34...

In this way, the repetition of past mistakes is self-evident—although Fucha's forgetting of national hatred still came after a long period of preparation of "ten years of accumulation and ten years of training." But now, less than six years after the "Pearl Harbor War," how can our old American completely forget the past? Is this a "good" thing?

Moreover, Fucha's forgetfulness was just a matter of his own affairs, but in the old United States, this forgetting often brings the disaster of suffering to millions of lives when new war opportunities arise! Alas! Alas!

### Straight Lines and Curved Lines

— Wang Pingling

After Chinese people leave school and mess around in society for a few years, after being hit by hard and soft nails many times, experience tells them that it is impossible to survive in a society like China's by being too honest. They learn to adopt strategies such as "selecting the real and rejecting the false," "not fighting hard battles," and "seizing opportunities," to engage in the struggle for life. The purpose of such strategies is to strive for the greatest results with the least sacrifice, and to return with a full load of spoils, once and for all.

However, young people who are new to the world are often young and vigorous and do not understand this philosophy of life. Facing the ripe leaves on the tree, they drool and are eager to swallow them, wishing they could rush forward and grab them; but they are often tripped by stumbling blocks. As for those with experience, they can avoid straight lines that are prone to bumping into walls, and satisfy their desires in a situation where they are considerate in all aspects and foolproof.

I remember a year ago, Wang Jingwei's traitors, such as Chen Gongbo and Miao Bin, in order to whitewash their ugly deeds, falsely claimed in court that their treasonous behavior was a so-called curved line of patriotism. The difference between treason and patriotism is as clear as day and night. Traitors still call themselves curved patriots. The curve of their line cannot be more curved.

Chinese people love to talk about face and like vanity. They can never be pragmatic. Even if there is a perfect plan, it is difficult to follow it, because when doing things, one must be considerate in all aspects in order to avoid unforeseen obstacles. It really feels like it takes a long time and is futile. However, if you don't do this, there will be more resistance, and you simply can't take a step. Generally, those who travel around the world and sell dog skin plasters have to bow and salute to the audience when they set up a ring and start performing, and recite words to ask the brothers to help. The same is true for those who sing Beijing opera to open a stage. Yu Shuyan, who was proud, did not pay attention to this set and wanted to break this bad habit of "paying respects to the mountain stronghold." However, the first time he took the stage in Shanghai, he was greatly embarrassed and was forced to leave immediately, buying a ticket back to Beiping overnight and never coming to Shanghai again. This example shows the difficulty of establishing oneself in the world. Although science has progressed to the atomic age, the atmosphere of opening a stage and paying respects to the mountain stronghold in all levels of society not only remains unchanged to this day, but may have become even worse.

At this moment, large and small government offices all have units such as "personnel offices" or "public relations departments." The original motivation was to save the time of most people and not waste it endlessly on personnel disputes, so they set up separate institutions to be solely responsible, allowing them to not care about anything and to specialize in bowing and saluting in all directions along a vague curved line in order to avoid friction and reduce disputes. Who knew that friction would become more intense and disputes would increase to an extreme extent.

The average life expectancy of Chinese people is only thirty-five years. In order to save time, people take curved lines, we must take straight lines, and people take straight lines, we must take the shortest "vertical lines" in order to catch up. However, we have to make a big detour.

Now the fact is that construction is taking the winding curved line, while destruction is choosing the straightforward straight line. Therefore, our compatriots in this country are more likely to fail than succeed.

### Razor

— Cai Rulin

Just as the war broke out, three Scottish youths went to the recruitment office to volunteer. They volunteered to contribute to the country, and each had hair about three and a half feet long.

"Why do you young people have such long hair?" The sergeant at the recruitment office asked them in surprise.

"Oh—that's because our brother took the razor with him when he went to America six years ago!" the eldest one explained.

### Song of Autumn Mosquitoes

— Sun Yuehan

In a small, cramped, dark room, a lamp casts a dim green light like a bean. I dip my brush in ink and spread out paper to write poetry, but Mr. Mosquito pricks my arm. I search for a fan and wave it, but it returns again and again, buzzing and humming like thunder. Helpless to dispel my sorrow, I sigh three times; to break the boredom, I gulp down a cup of wine. The small one is like a needle, hissing and sighing (or buzzing, groaning, wailing, and hissing). Your biting me is a strange thing indeed. My body is now dry with oil and water, I hope you don't mind that there's no flavor! You must pity my thin bones, lonely and frail, embracing illness. Is it because I have too many emotions that I attract trouble? Or is it because my flesh is delicious that you love me so much? You rush forward to suck and draw. And don't you see the bewitching modern woman next door, with her white teeth, red lips, and skin like floss? Her perfumed sweat is as sweet as candy, and she feigns anger and coquetry with a peculiar charm. Are you afraid of Western DDT? You imitate those Westerners by settling down here. I don't know what karma from a previous life has made us so different. Your stings are like arrows, your hair roots piercing in and changing my face. It itches and stings, but you don't want to scratch. When it hurts, even Bian Que can't cure it. The next night, red towers cast floral shadows, hurrying the remnants of sweet dreams at the third watch of the moon. Who is injecting all night long? The blood transfusion project is always you. Alas, alas! Business is dwindling, and the gate is closed. Every morning, I force myself to eat vegetable roots; I tremble at the thought of your arrival and am even more heartbroken when dusk arrives. Don't you see? The big, sturdy fellow next door, with his pig's waist and turtle's back, is oily all over. He idly lies on his back, legs spread wide, waiting for you to sever the connection!

Note: Mr. Mosquito: another name for the mosquito.

Zhuo Pu: a colloquial term, used to describe a person with a large frame.

Legs spread wide: describes the posture of lying on one's back.

DDT: i.e., DDT!

### Supplement to the Revolutionary Grass

— Duyun

Yun Yaojun wrote an article on "Revolutionary Grass" in a woodblock journal. I would like to add a few words based on what I know.

In the countryside, Revolutionary Grass is indeed seen as a "life-threatening grass." Not only has it been discovered in the Jiaxing-Huzhou area, but it also grows everywhere in the river ports of my hometown, Ningbo, hindering navigation. If you pull it ashore, it has no nutrients for the fields, and there is very little ash when it is dried and burned, so it can be said to be useless.

"Revolutionary Grass" is also sold in flower gardens in Shanghai, mostly planted in mud pots. The leaves are light green, floating on the water like wheat leaves, and a bit like ginkgo leaves. The stems are short, forming a round ball in the middle and hollow. The villagers call it a cannon, because revolution and fighting require cannons. The flowers bloom on top, in light blue, like irises. They can bloom continuously for three or five flowers, beautiful and pleasing to the eye, and can be used as potted plants. Because the stems have air bubbles, they float on the water without sinking, and their reproductive power is very strong. If the villagers do not remove them in time, the river ports will be blocked in one or two months, hindering traffic.

"Revolutionary Grass" was discovered in large quantities around the years 4 and 5 of the Republic of China. At that time, bandits and bullies in eastern Zhejiang often called themselves the "Second Revolutionary Army" and extorted money. The people hated them. Just when this grass was discovered, they called it Revolutionary Grass. After the bandits were wiped out, the villagers removed the grass, believing that it was reliable and that the name lived up to reality.

In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the May Fourth Movement of students rose up, with class boycotts, parades, speeches, costume dramas, and the launching of a boycott of Japanese goods. At that time, this grass propagated again for the second time, and the river surface was silted up. The villagers called it "Student Grass," saying that its flowers were brilliant, but its stems were empty. It could not fertilize the fields, nor could it be used as firewood. It was a "useless" scholar. Unexpectedly, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, this grass thrived for the third time. It seemed that in addition to Revolutionary Grass and Student Grass, the villagers also called it "Peace Grass," referring to the fact that the puppet organization's Peace Army had empty strength but would disturb the people everywhere.

The villagers changed the name of this grass three times, placing their meaning in the grass and trees, which shows the general feelings of the people!

Good Abacus

A and B were sitting in the same train carriage. B was an old man and looked very depressed. When the train arrived at the first station, B hurriedly got off the train and ran out onto the platform; but after a while, he got back on the train, panting. After the train passed one station, B did the same thing at every station. A, driven by curiosity, couldn't help but ask B the reason.

"Well," B said, "I recently asked an expert to examine my heart, and he said that my heart was in such bad condition that it could die at any time. Therefore, I thought it would be better to buy tickets station by station."

Tonsils

The doctor told A that his wife's tonsils should have been removed when she was a child. So, after the tonsillectomy was completed, A sent the bill to his father-in-law. (Da You)

### Needlework for Dollars

— Qiu

Thousands of British women, led by the 81-year-old Queen Mary, have organized a sewing group to earn dollars for the British Empire.

The knitted or sewn goods are transported to the United States and other dollar areas by a non-profit export company, and the workers are paid in pounds by the government.

The chairman of the Women's Voluntary Service has been promoting the "Needlework for Dollars" campaign with the help of the government.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said: "We welcome any plan to earn dollars, but sewing will be even more beneficial to us, who are lacking in labor."

British women will use their spare time, with materials supplied by the Women's Voluntary Service, to earn dollars for their country stitch by stitch.

### Talking About Chrysanthemums in the Hunting West Wind

— Shu Xiang

"Alas, the chrysanthemum east of the fence, the stems are sparse and the leaves are thin, although it is said to be different from orchids and irises, it also has its own fragrance. The wine in the cup is not yet cold, and it is only stained with clear dew. When it is in bloom, you do not pick it, what will it rely on when it falls in Luoyang?"

— Li Bai

Wandering along the riverbank, in the hunting west wind, I saw the changing yellow chrysanthemums. Chrysanthemums are the representative of hermits in ancient times. Since being praised by Tao Yuanming, they have been loved by a group of people.

There are two kinds of chrysanthemums. One kind has purple stems, a fragrant smell, and a sweet taste. Only the kind whose leaves can be used as vegetables is the true kind. The other kind is dark green, has a wormwood smell, and is inedible. It is bitter and difficult to distinguish from the true chrysanthemum. Ordinary people regard the bitter kind as the true chrysanthemum.

There are the most types of chrysanthemums. Fan Chengda's Chrysanthemum Manual lists chrysanthemums as thirty-five varieties, and Wang Xiangjin's Group of Fragrances lists chrysanthemums as one hundred and seventy-two varieties. The colors are divided into yellow, white, purple, and red. In fact, to this day, there are probably more than three hundred types of chrysanthemums.

The famous varieties include Imperial Robe Yellow, Grand Tutor Red, and Green Heaven Rong, etc., more than one hundred and seventy varieties. In terms of orthodoxy, yellow chrysanthemums are considered the most precious, but the common people prefer novelty. Many people like to see variegated colors such as red and purple, while the true-colored chrysanthemums are not valued.

Poems about chrysanthemums most easily reveal a person's temperament. Notes on the Noble Ear says: "Huang Chao served his grandfather at the age of five. For the joint verse about chrysanthemums, the grandfather thought but could not reach it, and Chao replied casually: 'Worthy to be the head of all flowers, naturally endowed with ocher yellow clothes.' Chao's father was surprised and wanted to whip him; the grandfather said: 'The grandson can write poetry, but he does not know the weight of things. He can be asked to write another poem.' Chao also said: 'The rustling west wind fills the courtyard, the cold petals and cold fragrance are hard for butterflies to come. If I become emperor in the coming years, I will move them to bloom with peach blossoms.' The domineering meaning can already be seen in childhood. Like Zhu Yuanzhang's poem about chrysanthemums, he also said: 'I do not bloom when all the flowers bloom, and when I bloom, I will scare everyone. I want to fight a battle with the west wind and cover my whole body with golden armor.' It is also a self-appointed meaning of the ninth five. However, Zhu Shuzhen, who wrote about 'Last year on the Lantern Festival, the flower market was as picturesque as a painting,' said of chrysanthemums: 'The earthen flower can be white and can also be red, and it can still love this skill in its later years. I would rather embrace the fragrant branches and grow old than dance with the yellow leaves in the autumn wind.' This tone of chastity and self-preservation is very different from 'I do not see the person from last year, my tears wet my silk sleeves.'"

Tang Bohu, who collected the fragrance, went to Ningde's residence to see the chrysanthemums and sadly wrote a quatrain: "For whom do the yellow flowers bloom without being picked? They are lonely in the sparse fence and winding path. They are just traded for rouge and powder with gold coins, and a lifetime of color is entrusted to the west wind." Seeing these solitary and noble yellow flowers in the bleak autumn, many people will be saddened by autumn.

### Reasons for Power Outage in Nanshi

Explanation from China Merchants Electric Company

We have received your letter forwarding a reader's inquiry regarding the recent frequent temporary power outages in Nanshi, and we are writing to reply. The original power generation equipment of our company has been dismantled and removed by the enemy and puppets and cannot be used. Since the resumption of business, we have been temporarily purchasing electricity from the Shanghai Power Company for supply. Due to the limited amount of electricity purchased and the uneven distribution, we have implemented rotational power outages in different areas to make adjustments. Recently, after the labor unrest occurred at the company, the power generation dropped sharply, and there have been unscheduled power outages since October 1st. During this period, the company repaired the high-pressure boiler, reducing power generation. It was not until October 8th that the power supply in our company's area returned to normal. Our company sincerely apologizes to the users for the impact of the power outages. The newly ordered generators have not yet been fully transported, and the generators that were seized by the enemy and puppets and sent to Beiping and Boshan are still waiting for the Resources Committee to continue to negotiate and implement their speedy recovery. During this transition period, our company, in addition to doing its best to minimize the impact of power outages on users within the possible range, still hopes that all users will understand the difficult situation of our company, and cooperate with us to overcome the difficulties due to the limited electricity supply. It would be most fortunate. Accordingly, we are replying, hoping for your consideration and disclosure! Respectfully, the Editorial Department of the Central Daily News, Social Service Department, Shanghai China Merchants Electric Company.

### Prevention of Tuberculosis Must Not Be Delayed

Statistics for September at the Hongqiao Sanatorium.

The social service department of the Hongqiao Sanatorium in this city holds half-price X-ray fluoroscopies every afternoon to promote tuberculosis prevention checks among citizens. According to the statistical report for September, it was found that pulmonary tuberculosis patients still account for more than 20% of the total number, especially among young people aged 15 to 26. Among them, there are many newly admitted university students who, after undergoing X-ray fluoroscopy during physical examinations, were found to have pulmonary tuberculosis lesions. The students did not know it themselves and had no symptoms of illness. Fortunately, they were discovered early, and if appropriate treatment is given in time, they can recover their health, which is a necessary measure for school health and public safety. The statistics of the hospital are as follows: 189 people had varying degrees of pulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 20.04%. 261 people had bronchitis, accounting for 27.67%. Others, such as those with blurred shadows, pleural thickening, and deep hilar lymph node shadows, totaled 144 people, accounting for 15.28%. 349 people had normal heart and lungs, accounting for 37.01%.

"The extravagant are never rich enough, the frugal always have more than they need."... etc., all written by Yu Gongyu and painted by Tao Lengyue, are exquisite and extraordinary. They can be used to decorate the walls of homes, schools, and social organizations, and are beneficial to people's hearts and of profound significance. All sectors can send a letter to the printing house to request them free of charge.
