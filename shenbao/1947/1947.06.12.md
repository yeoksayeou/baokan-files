### Mongol Troops Invade Xinjiang Incident: I Lodge a Serious Protest with the Soviets and Mongols, and Plan to Immediately Send Senior Officials to Xinjiang to Investigate

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the incident of Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang, our government has lodged a serious protest with both Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union. Zhang Yuan-chang, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced the following when answering reporters' questions at a press conference held by the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan on the 11th: "Regarding the Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang and attacking our defense forces stationed at Beitashan, our government has naturally received reports. This matter is not an ordinary border conflict, and our government attaches great importance to it. The local military authorities have been ordered to firmly defend our territory and handle the matter cautiously. Our ambassador stationed in Moscow has also been ordered to lodge a serious protest with the Soviet government, and through the Outer Mongolian envoy stationed in Moscow, to the Outer Mongolian government." According to the inquiries made by reporters today regarding the aforementioned incident, there were as many as nine questions, the contents of which are as follows: (1) Outer Mongolian troops have invaded six hundred li into Xinjiang, and four aircraft with Soviet markings participated. Does this contradict the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, and what explanation does the government spokesperson have for this? (2) In terms of diplomacy, what measures does the government intend to take regarding this matter, and will a protest be lodged today? (3) If the government lodges a protest, is the target the Soviet Union or Outer Mongolia? Since our country and Outer Mongolia have not yet exchanged diplomatic envoys, what method will be used to protest to Outer Mongolia? (4) According to a dispatch from Dihua (Ürümqi) by the Central News Agency, Asman, the commissioner of the Altai district, has been under pressure from a certain party since February of this year, retreating step by step. From February to the present, four months have passed. During this period, has the government received reports regarding this border incident? Will attention be paid to it? Also, during this period, will diplomatic negotiations be conducted on this matter, and what are the details? (5) Before the Outer Mongolian troops invaded Xinjiang, did any incidents occur on the border that Outer Mongolia could use as an excuse, or does the Outer Mongolian side have other excuses, and what are they? (6) Is there collusion between the Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang and local ethnic minorities? What is the attitude of the people towards the Outer Mongolian troops in the areas occupied by the Outer Mongolian troops? (7) Is our garrison in the Altai district only resisting? Is it also preparing to recover lost territory? If the Outer Mongolian troops continue to invade, what measures will the government take to stop them? (8) What is the strength of the garrison in Xinjiang, especially in the Altai district, and does it have sufficient strength to stop the Outer Mongolian troops from continuing to invade? Is the government preparing to send reinforcements? (9) If the Outer Mongolian troops continue to invade, will this lead to the consideration of our government declaring war on Outer Mongolia?

The Chairman Summons Zhang Qun and Liu Fei, Asking About the Mongol Troops' Invasion of Xinjiang

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Chairman Chiang invited Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun for dinner at 8 p.m. on the 11th, and summoned Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Fei at 10 p.m., asking about the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] We will send senior officials to Xinjiang to investigate and handle the matter successively. However, the candidates have not yet been determined. They may be senior responsible personnel from the diplomatic or national defense fields. The candidates will be decided in one or two days. It is reported that Chairman Chiang is scheduled to summon Bai Chongxi on the 12th to inquire about the matter. When the Kuomintang held a Central Standing Committee meeting on the morning of the 11th, it was decided on the spur of the moment to invite Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to attend and report. Wang said after briefly recounting the incident that the report on this matter was obtained from the Ministry of National Defense, and the handling of this matter should be resolved through diplomatic means, with the government lodging a protest and sending personnel to conduct an actual investigation. However, the external spokesperson maintained an extremely cautious attitude when answering reporters' questions about this matter. Zhang Yuan-chang, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, attended the Information Bureau's press conference on the afternoon of the 11th. It is said that Vice Minister Ye was unable to attend due to official business, so he represented him. Reporters had previously raised nine questions concerning national defense and diplomacy regarding the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion, and Zhang avoided answering them directly. According to reporters' inquiries, our protests to the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia have been lodged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The protest to the Soviet Union is about the Soviet aircraft bombing. Diplomatic authorities have also been in contact with the Soviet Embassy. Fedlin Ko, the counselor of the Soviet Embassy, visited Vice Minister Ye of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 11th.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Government officials announced today that the Outer Mongolian troops' attack on Beita town in Xinjiang was caused by the issue of the release of eight Mongolian soldiers captured by Chinese troops in the last border dispute. Outer Mongolian troops, supported by the air force, attacked Beita after the expiration of a 48-hour ultimatum. The commander of the Mongolian army stated that unless the eight captured Mongolian soldiers were released immediately, he would resort to force, and then launched an attack from both land and air. It is reported that the commander of the Beita garrison proposed negotiations with the Outer Mongolian side, but a peaceful solution was not reached.

### Legislative Yuan to Hold Regular Meeting Today: Xinjiang Deputies to Propose a Provisional Motion, Suggesting that the Government Adopt a Tough Diplomatic Stance

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] When the Legislative Yuan holds its 327th meeting on the 12th, Xinjiang deputies Guang Lu, Hua Shengmu, etc., will propose a provisional motion regarding the Soviet aircraft covering the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang, suggesting that the authorities adopt a tough stance on this matter. Guang Lu and others met with reporters on the morning of the 11th and expressed their feelings about this matter, believing that the occurrence of this incident was within expectations. At the same time, they pointed out that the ethnic issue is not serious in Xinjiang today, and what is worth noting is the international relationship. At the same time, the Xinjiang incident can be viewed in the same light as the current Inner and Outer Mongolia, Northeast China and other issues, because the problems that have occurred in the above-mentioned areas have commonalities. After the Yining Incident, Xinjiang people advocated that the government should take a tough stance towards the Soviet Union and appeal to the United Nations Security Council to attract international attention. Today, they still advocate adopting a tough diplomatic approach.

### People in the Capital are Shocked

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] After the news of Soviet aircraft covering the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang was released, people in the capital expressed extreme shock. All newspapers published it in the most prominent position, and some even accompanied it with maps to draw the attention of the people of the country. The Soviet Embassy, which was usually very deserted, has now become a target for reporters to interview. On the 11th, reporters interviewed people familiar with border affairs to inquire about their views on this matter. They all believed that the Outer Mongolian troops invaded our country's territory by 600 li under the cover of Soviet aircraft, and are now only more than 300 li away from Qitai. If they invade further and advance to Qijiaojing and other places, the northern route of Tianshan will be cut off, and there will be no way to contact Dihua and Hami (that is, Xinjiang and the interior). Therefore, the development of the situation cannot be ignored. As for the cause of this incident, they all believed that this matter had international factors in it, so they all believed that following diplomatic channels to resolve it may also be an effective method. Speaking of the immediate cause of this matter, a Xinjiang person who had just come to Nanjing from Dihua a week ago told reporters that this incident was caused by the conspiracy of Dalilehan, who was supported by external forces. Dalilehan is a Kazakh, who was active in the area bordering Outer Mongolia and the Altai district before the signing of the peace treaty. After the peaceful settlement of the new situation and the withdrawal of the Outer Mongolian troops, the government announced that Asman would be the commissioner of the Altai district, and Dalilehan, under the instigation of a certain party, did everything possible to obstruct Asman, making it almost impossible for him to take over. Last winter, 3,000 cavalry disguised as "Yining" troops suddenly came to the Altai district to help Dalilehan attack Asman, and the war continued intermittently. Recently, the Outer Mongolian troops launched a fierce attack under the cover of Soviet aircraft, and the situation has expanded. These Mongolian troops once occupied the Altai district before the signing of the peace treaty, so they are very familiar with the terrain of the area.

### The Soviet Embassy Makes No Comment

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Soviet Embassy refused to comment on the Xinjiang matter on the 11th. It is said that this matter was only learned from the newspapers, and no comment will be made before knowing the details. The embassy also made no comment on our protest.

### No Official Report Received: US Officials Remain Silent

[French News Agency, Washington, 10th] Regarding the Nanjing news that Outer Mongolian troops invaded Chinese territory under the cover of Soviet aircraft, responsible officials here stated that the US State Department does not attach much importance to this. Up to now, the US State Department has not received an official report. The US government has repeatedly received similar news of this kind within the past month, some of which came from the Chinese government, but none of them have been confirmed.

### News of the Mongol Troops' Attack on Xinjiang: Prominently Published in American Newspapers

[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] Evening newspapers here published the report from Nanjing about the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang on the front page. The headline of the New York Sun was "Outer Mongolian Troops Invade China, Troops of the Outer Mongolian Republic Break into Xinjiang Under the Cover of Soviet Aircraft." The newspaper used a report from the Associated Press based on news from the Central News Agency, which stated: "It is confirmed that Outer Mongolian troops invaded Xinjiang on the afternoon of the 5th of this month under the cover of four aircraft with Soviet markings." The Associated Press said that according to a certain military observer, due to the remote distance and the lack of readily available troops, the central government does not seem likely to send sufficient defense forces to Xinjiang.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Shanghai branch of the National Diplomacy Association is scheduled to invite leaders from all walks of life today to exchange views on the countermeasures our country should take after the Xinjiang incident. The association will make an important statement on this matter.

### Zhang Boling Returns to Tianjin

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 11th] Zhang Boling flew from Shanghai to Peiping on the 11th and returned to Tianjin in the afternoon. Regarding the Outer Mongolian invasion, Zhang expressed his emotion, saying that if the Chinese people all had patriotism, China would be the strongest country in the world. Now everything is due to everyone's lack of patriotism, but I am not pessimistic, and I will still do my best to devote myself to education.

### Hong Lanyou to Fill the Vacancy on the Central Political Committee

### Portuguese Colonial Minister Actually Says: Macau Will Not Be Returned Without Bloodshed

[United Press, Lisbon, 11th] Portuguese Colonial Minister Durão stated when receiving the Macau delegation on the 11th: Portugal will never return Macau to China unless blood is shed in Macau. Portugal will take measures to correct any Portuguese laws that the people of Macau do not agree with. Durão also said: Similarly, he is sure that Portugal will still reside in India. Unless thousands of white and colored Portuguese fight in India for defense, the Portuguese flag will never be lowered in India. He firmly believes that in the changes in India, Portugal's sovereignty in India can still be safe and sound.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] At the Information Bureau's press conference on the 11th, when asked "Has China formally negotiated with the Portuguese government regarding the recovery of Macau?", Zhang Yuan-chang, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, replied: Regarding this matter, "No comment."

### Economic Reform Plan: The Primary Focus is on Reducing Deficits; Methods for Levying Property Tax are Being Drafted

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan held a press conference at 4:30 p.m. on the 11th. Director Dong Xian'guang answered reporters' questions as follows:

Question: It is rumored that during the recent arrest incident, President Zhang and other government officials were unaware of the details. What is Director Dong's opinion on this?

Answer: The recent arrests were based on Article 5 of the Measures for Maintaining Social Order promulgated by the National Government on May 19, which authorizes local authorities to take effective measures to prevent and control social order and public security in emergencies. The implementation of this order in various places is reported to the central government in detail afterwards. The rumor that President Zhang and other government officials were unaware is unfounded.

Question: Can you elaborate on the nature and main points of the proposed property tax? On what principles will property be estimated, and will this property tax apply uniformly to all types of property?

Answer: The government is drafting methods for levying property tax, and the principles for estimating property and classifying property are still under study.

### All Sincere Peace Plans are Welcome by the Government

Question: What attitude does the government take towards the peace plan drafted by the Political Consultative Council? Is the government willing to accept the Political Consultative Council's recommendations, abandon any preconditions, and reopen negotiations with the Communist Party?

Answer: I would like to remind everyone again that the government has never closed the door to peace negotiations, and welcomes any practical and feasible peace plan. The Chinese Communist Party has already expressed its rejection of the Political Consultative Council's peace proposal through its propaganda organs. The June 5 broadcast of the Communist Xinhua News Agency accused the entire Political Consultative Council of being a reactionary group supporting "civil war," and said that the Political Consultative Council's call for peace was entirely false. The Communist Party's attitude is sufficient to show who should bear the responsibility for the domestic conflict.

Question: There is much speculation about President Zhang's new economic reform plan. Can you explain the actual situation and current state of the plan in detail? What are the details of President Zhang's new economic reform plan?

Answer: The purpose of the economic reform plan proposed by President Zhang is to balance the national budget, primarily to reduce deficits, promote production, and increase tax revenue. Before the plan is approved by the State Council, it is not appropriate to report the details. The meeting of the National Economic Commission yesterday made some decisions on how to quickly sell state-owned enterprises and enemy-puppet industries. People can use US Treasury bills to purchase all or part of the state-owned enterprises and enemy-puppet industries designated for sale by the government. If the contractor purchases more than half of the shares of a certain state-owned enterprise run by the private sector, the government can first hand over the enterprise to the contractor for operation, and the government will temporarily retain the remaining shares and continue to sell them.

Communist Troops in the Northeast Adopt Positional Warfare Tactics

Question: What is the outlook for the military situation in the Northeast?

Answer: In Changchun, Sipingjie, and Shenyang, the Communist troops attacking the National Army have changed their previous mobile guerrilla tactics and adopted positional warfare. This is an unprecedented change in the Communist troops' combat methods. You may recall that the Communist troops attempted to cross the south bank of the Songhua River three times, and suffered heavy losses in late April and retreated in embarrassment. It is remarkable that they have been able to quickly complete their reorganization and replenishment in a short period of time, and bring in better and newer weapons than before, and launch a large-scale attack again.

### Our Government is Studying the Issue of a Peace Treaty with Japan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] At the Information Bureau's press conference, Zhang Yuan-chang, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, answered diplomatic inquiries as follows:

Question: What is the Chinese government's attitude towards the recent request made by the new Japanese Prime Minister regarding the Ryukyu Islands?

Answer: The entire issue of treaties with Japan is under study by our government, but at present I will not comment on this matter.

Question: Does the editorial in the Dagangbao on the 7th of this month on the Vietnam issue reflect the Chinese government's opinion? It is said that the Vietnamese Kuomintang "is naturally supported by China." Is this true? If so, in what aspects is it supported by China? Please also inform us.

Answer: The Chinese government does not currently support any party in Vietnam.

Question: According to press reports, some fishing boats of "a certain country" have been detained in Yingkou Port. Can you please confirm or deny this? Are there any provisions in international law or Chinese law that stipulate that foreign ships should be detained when entering Chinese territorial waters?

Answer: I have no information about this report.

Question: Has the inspection team sent by the Chinese government to Lushun-Dalian sent any reports? If reports have been received, please inform us of the treatment the team received from the local people and authorities (Soviet and local authorities).

Answer: The Lushun-Dalian inspection team arrived in Lushun about a week ago, but has not yet gone to Dalian. The inspection work is currently underway, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a detailed report.

Question: What is the Chinese government's attitude towards the current situation in Hungary?

Answer: There is no Chinese diplomatic representative in Hungary, but the situation in Hungary is being closely monitored by our government.

### Zhang Junmai Invited to Visit the Capital: Xu Chuanlin to Take Office as a State Councilor Early Next Week

[This Newspaper Report] The authorities are handling the Xinjiang incident with great caution and will invite leaders of various parties to discuss it in the coming days. Mr. Zhang Junmai has already taken a car to the capital last night at the invitation of the highest authority. When reporters met Mr. Zhang yesterday, they asked him about his views on this incident. He replied: The nature of the problem is serious, and I dare not answer lightly before studying it. A detailed investigation should be conducted first. When asked about the content of the so-called unified interpretation of the constitution, Mr. Zhang said: For example, the political system of our country, whether it is a presidential system or a responsible cabinet system, should have a unified interpretation. Also, other articles of the constitution cannot be interpreted from the perspective of one party. Regarding the rumor that Article 3 of the common governance policy of the three parties will be deleted, Mr. Zhang said that he had not heard of it.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Mr. Xu Chuanlin of the Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to visit the capital early next week to take office as a member of the National Government Committee.

### The National Government Committee Will Establish Three Committees: Political, Economic, and Legal; Candidates for Chairmen are Being Selected

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The National Government Committee will establish a Political Committee, an Economic Committee, and a Legal Committee. Candidates for chairmen are being selected. This is because the reorganized National Government Committee holds a State Council meeting every two weeks to discuss policy guidelines, military and political plans, legislative principles, and handle financial plans and the national budget for each department and other important political affairs that are too numerous to handle. It is also difficult to conduct detailed research on some cases that must be reviewed in advance. According to the regulations of the National Government Committee meeting, various proposals can be submitted to the subcommittee for review and deliberation. Now, in order to meet the actual needs, it is decided to establish three standing committees. The Political Committee is responsible for handling cases involving domestic affairs, foreign affairs, transportation, education, etc. The Economic Committee is responsible for handling cases involving finance, economy, finance, food, agriculture, and forestry, etc. The Legal Committee is responsible for handling various laws and regulations and legislative principles, etc. It is reported that the candidates for chairmen of each committee may be Chen Bufu for the Political Committee, Shao Lizi for the Economic Committee, and Wang Chonghui for the Legal Committee.

### Outer Mongolia, Less Than Two Years After Independence

— This Newspaper Archives

Outer Mongolia, which has not been independent from China for two full years, has sent troops to invade Chinese territory. The political and diplomatic situation in Xinjiang is extremely complex. Since the Yining Incident, the government has spent great effort to arrange it properly. Now that Outer Mongolian troops have invaded Xinjiang, they certainly have some intentions. Outer Mongolia, a vast land of more than 600,000 square miles, has been included in the Chinese territory for more than 2,000 years, but the relationship between the two has never been clearly stated. It was not until the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty that lengthy articles were drafted and the relationship between China and Mongolia was officially determined. Although it was only a unilateral edict of Emperor Jiaqing, it was highly valued by the Mongols and became an internationally effective document. After the Guangxu period, the Qing court's policy of governing Mongolia was unsatisfactory. At the same time, Tsarist Russia colluded with the Living Buddha and encouraged resistance to governance, so there was a gradual phenomenon of disintegration.

Although Outer Mongolia is a remote and desolate wilderness, it is a natural collection center with unparalleled abundance of meat and fur, and with a vast land and sparse population, it has a high potential for development. Therefore, it aroused the covetousness of Tsarist Russia. Later, Tsarist Russia managed Siberia, built the Middle East Railway, and incited Outer Mongolia to become independent.

After the first stage of the Soviet revolution was completed, it gradually adopted the attitude of the Tsar towards Mongolia and replaced it. First, it established its administrative system, changing the Khanate banners and alliances into new administrative systems such as Aimags, Horool, Sum, Baks, and Arban. It implemented a new economic policy suitable for nomadic society, and Sovietized everything in Mongolia. It also supplied modern weapons and trained Mongolian troops. During the border conflict between the Mongolian army and the Japanese "Manchukuo" army in 1936, the Soviet army also entered Mongolia.

On the eve of Japan's surrender, China and the Soviet Union signed a friendship agreement in Moscow, deciding that Outer Mongolia would hold a referendum after the end of the war to decide whether to become independent or not. This is based on the principle of the founding father of supporting weak and small nations. In November of that year, Lei Fazhang and others flew to Kulun (Ulaanbaatar) to observe the referendum election. On January 5 of last year, the government officially recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia.

Xinjiang is our country's external solid treasury in the northwest, with a mild climate and abundant products, far above the northeast. In the past, Xinjiang had a very delicate position due to geographical and diplomatic influences. Now it is refreshing its politics and appeasing all ethnic groups. Recently, the appointment of Masud Sabri as the new provincial chairman is a step towards benefiting the neighbors and pacifying the people. The surprising incident of Outer Mongolian cavalry invading Baitashan is far from our country's desire to recognize the independence of Outer Mongolia, which is regrettable!

In terms of geographical situation, Mongolia and Xinjiang are characterized by the Altai Mountains extending from the northwest to the southeast, with the northwest being high and steep and the southeast slopes being gentle. From Zaksak to the Jungar region, there is a flat sand that cannot be defended. Nomadic peoples live in it, traveling hundreds of miles a day, which is considered commonplace. Therefore, once something happens in Xinjiang, it is easily controlled by Outer Mongolia, which is worth paying attention to.

How the fate of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia was decided, history has told us. Now that Mongol troops have invaded Xinjiang, its future evolution is even more worthy of attention from the people of the country.

### National Assembly's Decision to Convene as Scheduled; National Assembly Representative and Legislative Yuan Member Election Headquarters to be Established Soon; Two Committee Members Nominated by the Kuomintang

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Rumors of a postponement of the National Assembly convening have attracted attention from various parties. The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held a routine meeting on the 11th and discussed this issue heatedly. It was generally agreed that the government is urgently seeking to implement constitutional governance and form a popularly elected government. Efforts should be made to hold general elections this year as scheduled, so that the National Assembly can complete its mission. Therefore, there is no need to postpone the National Assembly. At a press conference held by the Executive Yuan Information Bureau on the afternoon of the 11th, someone asked Mr. Xian Guang about this. Mr. Dong replied: Some senators and other parties have suggested postponing the National Assembly scheduled to convene on December 25 this year to implement constitutional rule, fearing that preparations would not be completed in time. However, the government has not considered this suggestion and is still making all necessary preparations in accordance with the established policy, deciding to convene as scheduled. The Executive Yuan's routine meeting yesterday decided to expand the existing National Assembly Hall building, which is an example of active preparation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The National Assembly Representative and Legislative Yuan Member Election Headquarters will be established soon. According to Article 13 of the headquarters' organizational regulations, the headquarters will have a committee of three to five members, with one person designated as chairman. It is learned that the committee members will be selected from the Kuomintang, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Youth Party. The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee on the 11th nominated Zhang Lisheng and Hong Lanyou as committee members. It is reported that the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have also internally decided to appoint Jiang Yuntian and Liu Dongyan, but have not formally submitted the list. Another person is still being sought.

### Central Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party

Decision to Establish a Political Discussion Group

[Our Newspaper Report] The Democratic Socialist Party convened a Central Standing Committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. All standing committee members participated.

### Northeast National Army Deployment Completed; Liang Huasheng Discusses Annihilation War to be Launched; Heavy Bombardment of Siping Outskirts Airport by Communist Army

[Our Newspaper, Jilin, 11th] This reporter met with Chairman Liang Huasheng on the 11th. According to him, the Communist army has disregarded the lives of civilians and launched five offensives, causing widespread suffering and hardship. Liang smiled and told the reporter that there will be no sixth offensive after the Communist army's five offensives. He continued that the National Army has recently completed its deployment and is about to launch an annihilation war. When asked about the impact of the Communist army's southward invasion of Jilin, he expressed disgust and said it was like being bitten by a flea. The area around Jilin is relatively peaceful. The National Army launching an attack along the Jilin-Shenyang line has reached Chaoyangbao. It is reported that Communist army commander Zhou Baozhong has arrived in Wulajie, and some have seen him riding in the same car he used when he fled Changchun last year. Furthermore, according to the commander of the 60th Army, Zeng Zesheng, the main force of the Communist army in eastern Jilin has moved near Panshi, and there are only small groups of remnants around Jilin, which are not worth worrying about. He expressed regret for the heavy sacrifices made by the 184th Division, which held Meihekou and achieved one of the highest strategic tasks, and stated that the whereabouts of the division commander, General Chen Kaiwen, are still unknown.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] The focus of the Northeast war situation is on the outskirts of Siping. The Communist army shelled the airport on the night of the 10th, appearing to be preparing for a large-scale attack on Siping on the night of the 11th. The Communist army coming from the north of Songhua River includes the First and Second Columns and six divisions. The First Column is roughly equivalent to one army of the National Army. Furthermore, the main force of the 16th and 17th Divisions of the Sixth Column has recently moved from the Huadian area to Qingyuan, with the intention of attacking Siping from the west. After the National Army in southern Liaoning abandoned Pulandian, Wafangdian, and Xiongyue, Pulandian County Magistrate Zhou Jian and Wafangdian County Magistrate Zhang Jian both led local self-defense teams to resist, but eventually disappeared in the chaos. The Communist army attacked Lanping on the 10th, resulting in a day-long battle. Gaiping was captured, and the National Army launched a counterattack on the 11th to secure the railway line from Dashiqiao to Yingkou. The Communist army that captured Ximu City on the 10th and threatened Haicheng and Anshan was repelled by the National Army's combined land and air attack. The outskirts of Haicheng and Ximu City, 70 to 80 li to the southeast, have become more stable, and Anshan is even safer. Ximu City was formerly known as Xiaomuguan.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 11th] The main force of the Communist army that attacked Tieling began to gather towards Siping yesterday. However, there is no fierce fighting near Siping yet, but it is generally believed that a major battle may occur around Siping soon. The Communist army near Shuangyang has recently gathered at Yantongshan on the Jilin-Shenyang line, with unclear intentions. Wounded Communist soldiers are continuously transported from Siping, Gongzhuling, Huaide, and Fulongquan, across the Songhua River from Fuyu to the north. It is reported that there are tens of thousands of them on the way.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 11th] According to sources, Zhou Enlai went to Tonghua from Yanji at the end of last month to supervise the battle, commanding the Korean Communist Li Hongguang and Yang Peiyu detachments and the Liaodong Military Region troops, with a total strength of about 100,000, attempting to attack Fushun, Anshan, and Yingkou, cut off the transportation between Andong and southern Liaoning and Shenyang, and then attempt to seize Shenyang. The local military authorities have been paying close attention to this. Communist army commanders Zhou Baozhong and Lü Zhengcao, along with a foreign military delegation of 15 people, have moved from Gangyao to Liuhe to supervise the battle. Furthermore, over 10,000 Japanese prisoners are currently being transported by a certain direction’s Jiatas.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] According to captured senior Northeast Central personnel, former Japanese Kwantung Army Lieutenant General Liu Mie, after surrendering, was trained in a certain country and has now returned to the Northeast, serving as a senior staff officer in the Communist army headquarters. The Communist army's southward invasion this time was mostly planned by Qi Mie.

### Fierce Battles Occurring in Central Shandong; Communist Army Concentrating in the Yimeng Mountain Area; Communist Army Cleared from the Outskirts of Anyang, Northern Henan

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 11th] The Communist army is concentrating in the Yimeng Mountain area, and fierce battles are about to begin. On the 11th, three columns of the Communist army, about 50,000 people, moved to the area east of Laiwu. Two columns, about 30,000 to 40,000 people, are also gathered north of Yishui. Currently, the 10th Column, with more than 20,000 people, has moved to the Xueye area north of Tusikou, and the National Army has taken strict precautions.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 11th] The main force of the National Army in central Shandong continued to advance towards Tusikou.

### Vice Chairman Sun Proposes Long-Term Control of Japan to Prevent Militarists from Making a Comeback

[United Press Nanjing, 11th] Vice Chairman of the National Government, Sun Ke, stated in a conversation with United Press reporters today that he advocates strict, long-term control of Japanese territory and people to prevent ancient theories such as racial superiority and militarism from resurfacing in the world, especially in the Far East. It is said that before Japan has genuinely trained a generation with thoughts and beliefs in peace and democracy, the Chinese government is extremely concerned about the possible revival of Japanese national power. He believes that General MacArthur will not mistakenly believe that Japan can be transformed into a democratic nation in a matter of months. This is a work of many years, certainly not achievable in a few months. If we want to completely eliminate the future threat of Japan to peace, we must produce and train the next generation. China demands that at least until the peace treaty is drafted and approved, complete military control and occupation of Japan should continue. Part of the supervision should continue indefinitely to ensure that the militarists still present in Japan cannot make a comeback. China has more reasons than other countries to understand and care about Japan, so we urge the countries concerned to avoid granting freedom too early, so as not to provide a new base for its anti-democratic leaders.

"Jinghua Bell":

Former Dean of Education of the Army Artillery School, Zou Zuohua, commissioned a giant bell to be cast by the Xia Shengxing Foundry outside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) to celebrate the 50th birthday of Chairman Chiang. It was named "Jinghua Bell", seven feet high, five feet in diameter, and weighing over a thousand catties. Zou Zuohua himself wrote the inscription on the bell: "On the great birthday of Principal Chiang Kai-shek, the memorial hall is completed, adorned with a pavilion, the pavilion is tied to a bell, the bell is tied to an inscription, the inscription reads: His功盖天下兮天比崇 (His merits cover the world, and the heavens are comparable), 寿高天下兮徂徕松 (His longevity surpasses the world, like the pine of Mount Tai), 福被天下兮民景从 (His blessings are bestowed upon the world, and the people admire and follow), 声满天下兮启瞶矇 (His fame fills the world, enlightening the ignorant), 永不朽兮垂無終 (Eternally immortal, enduring without end)." When the casting was completed, the enemy had already approached Nanjing. The owner of the foundry buried the bell underground, so it remained unharmed. After the victory, it was unearthed from the soil. However, the owner of the foundry had passed away, and his wife was willing to donate it to the government through the Nanjing Municipal Council without asking for any compensation (because 300 yuan out of the 800 yuan casting fee agreed upon before the war had already been received). Now the Nanjing Municipal Government will build a bell pavilion in Wuzhou Park and erect a monument to record the event. The picture on the right is the full image of the "Jinghua Bell".

Editorial

### The Incident of Outer Mongolian Troops Invading Xinjiang

Reports from Chinese and foreign news agencies have stated for days: A battalion of Outer Mongolian cavalry, equipped with military vehicles, light and heavy weapons, under the cover of aircraft allegedly marked with Soviet symbols, began invading Baita Mountain, 350 li northeast of Qitai in Xinjiang, on the 5th of this month. Our defense forces, with the responsibility of defending the territory, have resisted, and the fighting is ongoing. It is also reported that the Outer Mongolian cavalry has wedged 600 li deep into our territory, and nearby towns have been bombed, causing casualties among soldiers and civilians. Our diplomatic authorities have lodged a protest with the Outer Mongolian government through Soviet Ambassador Petrov. In today's turbulent Eurasian situation, the sudden report of a serious alarm on the border of Xinjiang, China, naturally deserves our deep attention.

Xinjiang, formerly known as the Western Regions, is surrounded by high mountains on all sides, with the Tianshan Mountains running through it. Judging from the overall situation, it can defend the Great Wall in the east, shield Mongolia in the north, protect Tibet in the south, and rely on the Pamirs in the west for defense, residing on the spine of the Chinese mainland, like building a commanding structure on a high house. If it is secure, it will protect China and consolidate our borders. If it is not secure, the Guanzhong region will be restricted, the Hehuang region will lose its defenses, and even a small movement will shake the Central Plains. Therefore, the Han Dynasty seized thirty-six countries to sever the right arm of the Xiongnu, and the Tang Dynasty opened the Anxi and Beiting Protectorates to control the various barbarians. The Mongol Yuan Dynasty rose in the Altai Mountains, seized the Western Regions, and eventually destroyed the Song and Jin dynasties and gained control of the world. During the prosperous Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, expeditions were conducted against the Jungar and Hui tribes, and the land extended for tens of thousands of miles. Later, Britain and Russia strengthened their management, and the tribes around Xinjiang, such as the Kyrgyz, Kokand, Andijan, Kazakhs, Bukhara, etc., not only changed their names and surnames, but also had hidden forces, causing many concerns in the western border. Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang's Gobi Desert are intertwined. Since the fall of Kulun in the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), Outer Mongolia established a government and Tannu Uriankhai declared independence, and from then on, the northern frontier defenses were completely lost, as precarious as a pile of eggs. Fortunately, China and Mongolia have been at peace for the past twenty years. This sudden invasion of the Xinjiang border by Outer Mongolia seems to be a planned action. We are unwilling to make premature judgments about future developments. However, the occurrence of this unfortunate event has hidden dangers that are worrisome. Reflecting on the past and present, we find it difficult to remain silent.

First, the invasion of Outer Mongolia is in the Altai region of northern Xinjiang. None of the Xinjiang incidents in the past ten years or so did not originate in the Altai region. What is different about this time compared to the past "civil unrest" is that the Outer Mongolian army's invasion is planned and is not simply an internal ethnic issue in Xinjiang. Altai is the fifth administrative region in northeastern Xinjiang, with the district government located in Chenghua, formerly known as Chenghua Temple. It is located south of the Altai Mountains, bordering the Soviet Union in the west, Outer Mongolia in the east, and reaching Dihua in the south, serving as an important border town in northern Xinjiang. The Altai region is vast, rich in mineral resources, and has a population of 63,040, with the Kazakh ethnicity accounting for 53,352 people. When the Kazakhs rebelled, they repeatedly harassed Mulei River, Qitai, Fuyuan, Fukang, Gand, and other places, leading to unrest in Dihua. In the May 1945 incident, rioters occupied Chenghua, and in August, the rioters who occupied Tacheng came in droves. The counties in the Altai region were looted, and the people fled to Qitai and other places in the First District. The Altai Administrative Commissioner's Office was originally located in Chenghua, but due to external pressure, it retreated to Baita Mountain in mid-April of this year. Based on this, it seems that the situation in the Altai region has long been precarious. If the Outer Mongolian army's offensive is not stopped, the disaster of war will inevitably extend to the entire northern Xinjiang, which would constitute a serious problem.

Second, Outer Mongolia was originally part of our country's Outer Mongolia region. After the fall of Kulun in the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), it was instigated by others to claim independence and was protected by Imperial Russia. After the Russian Revolution, Outer Mongolia once canceled its independence and submitted to our country, but soon酝酿 (wùn niàng; brewed) independence again, establishing the "Mongolian People's Republic," protected and guided by the Soviet Union. On August 14, 1945, China and the Soviet Union signed the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance." In order to preserve Soviet friendship, our country exchanged notes with the Soviet Union, confirming that Outer Mongolia, after Japan's defeat, would be recognized as independent when its desire for independence was confirmed by a referendum. On January 15, 1946, our government officially recognized the independence of the Outer Mongolian state, but diplomatic relations have not yet been established. Outer Mongolia is politically independent in form, but its military and diplomatic affairs are originally bound by the "Soviet-Mongolian Protocol." Therefore, the actions and development of the Outer Mongolian army are worth paying attention to because of the Soviet Union's involvement.

Third, Sino-Soviet relations are based on the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance." For several years, we have been hoping that Sino-Soviet relations can improve because of this new foundation. According to the spirit of this treaty, the Soviet Union would have stated that it has no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs. In recent years, the internal turmoil in Xinjiang has been handled reasonably by the former Provincial Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, and the Soviet Union's attitude has been unquestionable. This invasion of northern Xinjiang by the Outer Mongolian army is an unfortunate event, whether from the perspective of Sino-Soviet relations or Soviet-Mongolian relations. From the Soviet Union's perspective, the Soviet Union should prevent the Outer Mongolian army from invading Xinjiang through legitimate channels to avoid escalating the situation. From China's perspective, the Chinese government should use reason and make decisive decisions to prevent the Outer Mongolian army from advancing further, both diplomatically and in action. The situation has not yet developed further. The Outer Mongolian army, which has invaded 600 li into northern Xinjiang, should withdraw as soon as possible to maintain the friendly relations between China and Mongolia.

At the same time, we believe that before the Xinjiang local authorities accurately report the truth, all parties should not have emotional overreactions to this unfortunate event. We must remain calm and trust that the government can take necessary measures to stop the Outer Mongolian army's actions through legitimate channels.

[This newspaper's report] On the night of the 7th of this month, a Ning dealer was shot and captured in the Hua Xiang Apartment on the thirteenth floor of Guilin Road (formerly Rue Mère de Sion). In order to capture all the criminals in the case, the police department only completely solved and published the case yesterday. The detective section of the police department learned that there were two major gangs in the city's drug trafficking organization, one was the Wuxi gang, led by Chen Yaobin from Wuxi. One is the Changzhou gang, hosted by Shi Yiping. Zhang Ningqiu. The two gangs cooperate closely on weekdays, and often transport large quantities of morphine and opium from the north to Shanghai for profit. After more than a month of investigation by the police department, it was learned that Chen lived at No. 71, Lane 125, South Shaanxi Road. He usually behaved generously and often went in and out of the apartments and No. 28, Lane 117, Shandong Road. Because there was no concrete evidence yet, he was not immediately arrested. On the 6th of this month, the police department believed that the time was ripe, so it dispatched all the detective section personnel to search and arrest them in all directions at the same time. The police department has confirmed that the Changzhou gang wanted criminal Zhang Xiaoqiu lives on Yueyang Road. They immediately arrested Zhang and his accomplices Zhang Jinkang at the address. The two criminals confessed that the principal offender, Shi Yiping, lived at No. 325 Hua Xiang Apartment. They immediately rushed to arrest Shi and left police officers guarding inside No. 325. At 2:00 a.m. on the 7th, Chen Yaobin came as expected and was caught without a struggle. Section Chief Feng Xiushan of the police department then took Chen to walk downstairs. Unexpectedly, when they reached the second floor, Chen suddenly took advantage of his strength and punched Section Chief Feng to the ground, ran downstairs, and fled out the door. Police officers had been lying in ambush and surrounding the Hua Xiang Apartment in advance. At this time, seeing someone running out of the building in a panic, they fired a shot at his lower abdomen, and Chen fell to the ground in response. At the same time, police officers had also gone to Chen's residence on South Shaanxi Road, and accomplices Yu Youting and Chen's driver Jiang Miaoyuan were captured. A large bag of morphine was also found in the house.

At the same time, Xue Zongming, Gao Huixing, Zhao Zhiming, and Gao Ziqing were subsequently arrested in the secret organization for external liaison at No. 117, Shandong Road. Five catties of opium and seven morphine tablets were confiscated. In addition, Chen's younger brothers Chen Qizong and Chen Yaoming were also important criminals in the gang. Chen Yaozong was arrested by police officers at No. 126, Nanyang Road, according to the confession of the previous criminals, while Chen Yaoming had already fled after hearing the news. He Jiying and Zhu Xionglei, who were responsible for selling drugs to other places for the two gangs, were also arrested later. A total of thirteen principal and accessory criminals have been arrested. The police department believes that the two major drug trafficking organizations in Changshu and Wuxi in this city have now been completely cracked. The investigation has come to an end, and confessions are being strictly interrogated. They will be transferred to the local court for investigation and handling in accordance with special criminal cases.

### Knitwear Industry Dispute Mediation Unsuccessful; 300 Male and Female Workers Surround Police Station; Zhou Xuexiang Rushes to Bail Out Seven Detained Representatives

[This newspaper's report] Due to a dispute over the cost of living index, the labor and management of the knitwear industry in Districts 1, 2, and 3 have recently been unsuccessfully mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. Yesterday afternoon, the two parties were convened again for negotiations. The reason is that the industry's business was sluggish last year, and it was agreed that the monthly calculation would be 85% of the cost of living index of the previous month. After the index was frozen starting in February, it was issued in full, but the differential was still discounted, with 20,000 issued when it was 73,000, and 32,000 issued when it was 110,000. It was also stipulated that if the index exceeded 12,000 times after the index was unfrozen, the 85% discount would be restored. The agreement will end at the end of August this year. Today, the cost of living index is unfrozen. The workers believe that they are losing too much according to the agreement and cannot maintain their livelihood, so they requested to calculate it at 14,800 times, which the employers did not allow. During the negotiations yesterday, the workers made a concession to 14,000 times and then a discount of 85%, but the employers still did not allow it, and the negotiations became deadlocked. When mediating, more than 300 male and female knitwear workers went to the Social Affairs Bureau to await news. The bureau believed that there was a suspicion of gathering people to threaten, and ordered the workers to withdraw, otherwise they would not be mediated. At the same time, it notified the Songshan Police Station to send police to maintain order. After the workers withdrew outside the bureau, the negotiations were still fruitless. The workers were therefore anxious, and the union representatives could not dissuade them. The police station then took seven labor representatives to the police station: Tang Hanbai, Xu Guannan, Chen Fusheng, and Qian Jinkang from District 1; Fang Xiong and Yu Tongju from District 2; and Li Ding from District 3. At the same time, the employers' representatives were summoned. Seeing that the representatives were taken away, the workers rushed to the police station together. The police station then dispatched police cars and a large number of military police to maintain order. The workers surrounded the police station and did not disperse for a long time.

### Index Dispute - Almost Impossible to Index - Tofu Disappears - Sick from Hunger - Director Lu Visits the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau to Discuss Countermeasures

[This newspaper's report] The labor-management dispute caused by the cost of living index continues to spread. Director Lu of the Ministry of Social Affairs visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon to discuss countermeasures for this problem. According to Fan Zhenbang, chief of the Mediation Section of the Labor Department: Some employers did not consult with the labor party, or ignored the labor party's request for consultation, and directly notified all members by the same industry association to pay at 14,800 times, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers and led to strikes, work slowdowns, and other behaviors, which is also one of the main reasons for the dispute. The government will take appropriate measures to deal with workers who strike or slow down work.

Tofu industry workers were refused by the employers for demanding salary according to the cost of living index. The workers launched a strike on the 7th. On the same day, several tofu shops were destroyed because the workers did not strike, and three workers were arrested by the police station on suspicion of inciting a labor unrest. Some employers still maintain their work independently, and after holding out for two days, they were forced to close down yesterday, and there was no tofu to buy in the vegetable markets. After persuasion from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, the workers may resume work today, and the wage issue will be mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau within a few days.

Due to a cost of living index dispute, three male and female workers at the Jiuchang Weaving Factory in Nanshi have become ill from starvation. The Social Affairs Bureau sent staff to persuade them to send the patients to the hospital for treatment, and cooked porridge and bought bread to persuade the workers to eat. Mediation will be carried out within a few days.

Parasol, Ink, and Writing Brush Strikes and Work Slowdowns

Some of the workers in the ink and writing brush group of the pen and stationery industry also slowed down work yesterday.

Seven Handkerchief Factories Slow Down Work Starting Yesterday

### Two Routes Adopted: Ticket Purchase Order Certificate to Prevent Scalpers, Changing Color Daily

Since the implementation of the two routes, scalpers have become active again, not only harming traveling passengers but also affecting the order of various stations and local public security. It has been specially decided to adopt ticket purchase order certificates starting today, with which to exchange for train tickets. The certificates are divided into seven colors, changing one color for each day of the week. The price for second-class tickets is 10,000 yuan per certificate, and for third and fourth-class tickets, it is 5,000 yuan per certificate. When exchanging for train tickets, refunds will be made for overpayments and supplements will be required for underpayments based on the number of tickets purchased. All major stations on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou routes will handle this accordingly, except for first-class tickets and reserved-seat tickets, which will still be sold at the original ticket windows. The Shanghai Station has also added a waiting room that can accommodate more than 2,400 people.

### Sino-U.S. Wireless Telephone Fee: Twelve U.S. Dollars for Three Minutes, Formal Calls Expected to Begin on July 1

[Our Newspaper] The city's telecommunications traffic with international and domestic locations is becoming increasingly developed and convenient due to the application of new machinery and equipment. The International Wireless Radio Station, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, purchased the latest "single-line telephone machine" from the United States, which has recently arrived in the city. The radio station is now actively preparing for Sino-U.S. and Sino-Philippine wireless telephone services. The former has been tested several times with excellent results, and the latter is also being tested. It is scheduled to begin formal calls on July 1. At that time, it will contact the Shanghai Telephone Company so that citizens who want to make calls do not have to go to the radio station in person. They can leisurely pick up the phone and talk to relatives and friends across the ocean, as if speaking in the same room. As for the cost of Sino-U.S. calls, it is said to be approximately twelve U.S. dollars per three minutes, which, converted at the legal exchange rate, is actually more than 140,000 yuan in national currency.

Keyboard Automatically Rises and Falls

Furthermore, since the International Wireless Radio Station used "five-unit" wireless teletypewriters from U.S. military surplus materials to launch wireless teletype service, the speed of telegraphic communication between this city and international locations, in terms of receiving in Shanghai, and in terms of avoiding errors, has both had remarkable results. A reporter visited the radio station yesterday. There are currently three of these teletypewriters. Two of them are connected to the RCA Wireless Communication Company and the [unclear] Wireless Communication Company, respectively, to send and receive commercial and private telegrams. The other one is used for sending and receiving news telegrams. Each teletypewriter includes both receiving and sending parts, and its structure is very complex. When the San Francisco side sends a telegram, the keyboard of the teletypewriter here automatically rises and falls, typing out the original text, which can be taken off and delivered to the line person immediately without going through the procedure of copying.

Studying Expansion of Equipment

When sending a telegram, the original text is first typed on a paper tape about half an inch wide. This type of typewriter is different from ordinary ones, with different arrangements of tiny needles on its keys. Therefore, different letters on the paper tape have different holes. This paper tape is loaded onto the transmitter, and when the machine is turned on, different radio waves are emitted due to the different holes, causing the keys on the receiver in San Francisco to rise and fall, typing out the original text. This wireless teletype service has not been in operation for long, and the International Radio Station is still studying how to increase efficiency and expand equipment. It is reported that the Global Wireless Radio Company also recently intends to contact the International Radio Station to handle wireless teletype services. However, the company's teletypewriters use a "six-unit" system, which is slightly different from the "five-unit" system used by RCA and others. One of these machines was tested in Nanjing the night before last, communicating with Ventura City in California, USA. Seven more are currently stored in customs. Some will be sold to the International Radio Station, and some will be sold to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau to open wireless teletype service between Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Guangzhou.

Currently, the students are on strike, and the professors have not yet resumed teaching. The school is in a state of stagnation. We believe that the situation is serious. President Wu has been managing the school for many years and is loved by teachers and students. At this time of school turmoil and shock, we rely on him to lead the masses and take measures to stabilize the situation. Therefore, we specially request you to earnestly persuade him to stay and urge him to return to the school immediately to maintain school affairs. We are anxiously awaiting your order. (2) To President Wu Baofeng: We heard about the unfortunate incident at our alma mater, and our president resigned in anger. However, at this time of social unrest, the situation of our alma mater is particularly difficult. We earnestly ask you to consider the education of our country and the future of our alma mater, and to return to work immediately, overcoming the difficulties to meet the expectations of the public. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Education to urge you to stay, we respectfully send this telegram to express our earnest request.

### Opening a Path for Silk Exports - Exchanging Silk for Rayon from the United States - One Pound of Raw Silk Can Be Exchanged for Six to Eight Pounds of Rayon

[Report from this Newspaper] The government's loan of 250 billion yuan for cocoons is intended to produce 30,000 dan of silk for export. Based on the current production costs, the price of this export silk would need to reach 25 million to 30 million yuan per dan. However, the US market, the only destination for our country's raw silk, currently has a market price of only 4.45 yuan per pound. Converted at the official exchange rate, this only reaches over 7 million yuan per dan, a significant difference, and export costs are too high. Moreover, given the current surplus of raw silk in the United States and the availability of cheap raw silk from Japan, there is considerable concern about the prospects for this export silk. However, according to a relevant source, this batch of export raw silk is actually the only resource for obtaining foreign exchange. While current export costs are unfavorable, the method can be changed to exchange one-third of our produced raw silk for rayon from the United States, thereby supplying the country's annual consumption with low-priced rayon. Because the US market price for raw silk is 4.4 yuan per pound, while rayon is only 0.6 to 0.9 yuan per pound. Therefore, one pound of raw silk in the US can be converted into six to eight pounds of rayon. Based on the current domestic market prices, raw silk is equivalent to 200,000 yuan per pound, while rayon is equivalent to 90,000 yuan per pound, with the difference between raw silk and rayon being just over one-fold. Therefore, if raw silk can be exported to the US in exchange for US rayon, it would be even more beneficial to our country than simply exporting raw silk to earn foreign exchange.

### Selling Wind Sweeps the Market - Food Rice Prices Reported Lower and Lower - High-Quality White Rice in North City at 360,000 Yuan

[Report from this Newspaper] Rice prices have been falling daily this week, and dropped another 10,000 to 20,000 yuan yesterday. Due to the heavy rain in recent days, shipping merchants are eager to sell off their stocks, fearing moisture evaporation, and the market is enveloped in a selling wind, creating a situation of oversupply. In addition, production prices are reported low, making it difficult to boost prices, and consumer confidence is weak, resulting in a sluggish market. Yesterday, a total of over 5,600 shi of rice arrived from the north and south. High-quality white rice fell to 360,000 yuan in the north city and 380,000 yuan in the south city. Thin rice was 385,000 yuan in the south city and 380,000 yuan in the north city.

At the beginning of this month, food rice prices soared, once approaching the 500,000 yuan mark. The authorities actively took measures to clear supply channels and strictly prohibit hoarding. At the same time, rice distribution was organized for factories, schools, and organizations, as well as subsidized rice sales for the poor, stabilizing public sentiment. With the approach of summer, food rice is prone to insect infestations and mold, and each household's storage is limited to meeting immediate needs, ceasing hoarding. Those holding goods are also seeking to sell, causing public sentiment to turn downward. According to general observations, rice prices can remain stable for a considerable period if there are no major stimuli.

Flour from Hankou has arrived, and the market is quiet. Local flour continues to decline by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, imported flour is weak, and bran falls by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cakes still lack real demand and are slowly declining by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans are oversupplied, appetite is very scarce, and prices have fallen sharply by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Green beans are difficult to find, plummeting by another 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Red beans linger in a weak state, gradually falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum continues to arrive from Hankou and continues to weaken by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Corn transactions are light and lack activity. Sesame seed arrivals and sales are both small, and there are no gains or losses for the time being. Raw peanuts from South China are reported to be quiet, and the local market outlook is stagnant, falling by 10,000 yuan.

New broad beans are not moving among the Hakka community, and local demand is limited, gradually declining. Goods from various ports along the Yangtze River and nearby Zhejiang Province are gradually pouring in, continuing to plummet by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan, and the situation remains lackluster. The oil market is making gradual progress, and sesame oil, soybean oil, and vegetable oil have all slightly increased by 10,000 yuan. Small-batch sesame oil has soared by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

New wheat arrivals are slightly up, but flour mills are rejecting them and not opening, still declining. The flour market is declining rapidly. The factories must reduce prices to 120,000 yuan before a transaction can be made. It will probably take a few more days before they can start operating.

### Fourth District Flour Industry Association Held Its General Meeting Yesterday

Reporting on the Negotiation and Organization of Wheat Loans

[Report from this Newspaper] The Fourth District Flour Industry Association held its general meeting for all members yesterday morning starting at 11:00 AM. More than 50 member representatives attended, chaired by Chairman Du Yong. The meeting adjourned at 1:30 PM.

The main agenda item yesterday was a report by the association's executive director on the negotiation and organization of wheat loans with the authorities, for the information of all. The loan term is three months, with interest of about 4%. The loan amount is based on each factory's production volume, with a loan amount of 1 billion yuan per 1,000 packages. The government will provide 70% of this loan, and the manufacturer will fill in 30%. Collateral can be in the form of real estate and production goods, including machinery and flour. The loan principle is currently awaiting final approval from the Four Banks Joint Office to determine the accepting bank and handle loan matters. If the loan principle is approved, each manufacturer will separately apply for loan procedures with the bank in their factory's location.

Other agenda items: (1) Approval of raising 1 billion yuan for the association's arts fund, shared equally according to each factory's production volume, approximately 5,000 yuan per package. (2) Discussion of the quota allocation of burlap bags. The flour industry has been allocated 240,000 pairs of burlap bags, of which the Fourth District Association can allocate 70%. (3) The United Federation of Flour Industry Associations, including the five district associations nationwide, is in the mature stage of preparation. The director of the preparation is Yang Guanbei, and the Fourth District Association has also nominated ten preparation members. The draft regulations of the Federation have been drafted and are expected to be established in Shanghai in the near future.

### Total Amount of Cocoons Collected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Has Reached 180,000 Dan

[Report from this Newspaper] According to information from the Silk Production and Sales Coordination Association: as of the 8th of this month, the total amount of fresh cocoons collected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has reached 180,000 dan. Jiangsu has 86,000 dan, and Zhejiang has 91,000 dan. Jiangsu still has 25,000 to 30,000 dan to be collected, but this will require the arrival of the requested increase of 30 billion yuan in loan funds before they can be fully collected. It is heard that Dong Zanyao, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, has personally approached the Executive Yuan and the Four Banks Joint Office to request approval for the remittance.

Another report: a related source indicated that if the cocoon loan can reach 300 billion yuan, it is estimated that Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces can collect 250,000 dan of fresh cocoons.

[Report from this Newspaper, Hangzhou, 11th] Zhejiang Province has concluded its spring cocoon collection. It is estimated that 20,000 dan of local species cocoons and 75,000 dan of improved species cocoons have been collected, totaling 95,000 dan, using loans of 120 billion yuan. The results are still good.

### Summer Goods, Yarn Weaving Products, Are Selling Very Well

Autumn goods, wool, serge, and overcoating fabrics, showed clear and hidden upward trends yesterday. Summer goods, such as voile and poplin, are mostly strong on the outside but weak on the inside. White serge, white straight tribute, white "er er ding" types have extremely dull sales. Yarn woven products, such as white canvas, white yarn twill, khaki, Baifu ne, Ai Hua ne, rainproof cloth, thread hemp cloth, etc., are selling well. Local and Nanjing merchants have considerable interest, and Chongqing and Rong merchants are also actively preparing.

[Report from this Newspaper] According to information from the Farmers Bank of China: as of now, the increase in loans of 50 billion yuan has led to 65 cocoon purchasing companies signing contracts. Only five or six have not yet signed. The increased loan amount has already remitted over 44 billion yuan.

### Poor Sales of Fine Yarn

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were driven by the simplification of the ban on yarn and cloth transportation in Hankou and other places. Merchants from Guangdong and Hubei successively made purchases, and the market continued to rise. 20-count Double Horse yarn reached a high of 7.8 million yuan, and 42-count Blue Phoenix also reached a high of 12.6 million yuan. Subsequently, Shenxin Factory released over 100 bales of Double Horse yarn for sale at a price of 7.7 million yuan. At the same time, many brands of yarn, such as Tian Nu, Jin Shuang Ji, etc., were sold, and the market suddenly plummeted. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was priced at 12.25 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count Special Variant Horse yarn was 8.55 million yuan, up 100,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn was 7.72 million yuan, also up 170,000 yuan. The overall trend for the day was poor sales of fine yarn, and the market declined. 20-count yarn remained firm due to the brisk cloth market, and 16-count yarn benefited from purchases by cotton textile factories producing towels and bed sheets, and the market conditions were positive.

### Raw Materials for Soap, Candles, and Matches - Caustic Soda, Rawhide Powder, and Glue All Rise

The trading of raw materials for soap and candles was good, with various parties making purchases, and the market became brisk. Monthly brand caustic soda reached a high of 7.2 million yuan per barrel, an increase of 200,000 yuan. Sales of American caustic soda were slow, with little change in the market. Sodium silicate rose by 1,000 yuan per pound to 2,300 yuan. Siding is currently unavailable, and market demand is strong, resulting in a shortage of supply, with a sharp increase of 400,000 yuan per dan to 3.4 million yuan. Other items such as coconut oil, vanilla oil, and rosin remained stable.

Due to reports that the authorities have approved and relaxed the import quota for raw materials for matches, various factories are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and have no intention of making purchases. The market trend is weak. Potassium chlorate fell to 29 million yuan per ton, a sharp drop of 2 million yuan. Sulfur also fell by 200,000 yuan, and zinc chloride was priced at 28 million yuan, also down 2 million yuan. Amber fell by 500,000 yuan, and the prices of red phosphorus, 100-pound kraft paper, 26-pound blue paper, and 35-pound green wrapping paper all fell. The only exception in the market is rawhide powder glue, which is in short supply and has strong demand, with the price per ton (5%) reaching 30 million yuan, a sharp increase of 5 million yuan. Manganese dioxide and fine glass powder are stable.

### Yarn Merchants Obtain Registration Cards

[Report from this Newspaper] The Textile Control Commission has been handling the registration of approved manufacturers for the northbound transportation of yarn and cloth. As of yesterday, 126 manufacturers and 255 distributors have obtained registration cards. 156 manufacturers approved for southbound transportation have obtained northbound registration cards. Eight remaining companies have not obtained cards, and the commission has extended the deadline to today.

### Quotas for the Rotation of Rayon Have Been Distributed by Various Associations

[Report from this Newspaper] The Quota Allocation Department of the Import Control Commission has allocated the import quotas for rayon for the first and second quarters, each totaling US$565,000, for a total of US$1.13 million. It is learned that the various silk weaving industry associations have dispatched representatives to jointly discuss and finalize the allocation of this quota. The allocation ratios are as follows: Hangzhou 27%, Suzhou 8.5%, Shengze 4.8%, Wuxi 0.5%, Shanghai 59.2% (including a Huzhou silk weaving factory with 23 weaving machines). This allocation ratio will be submitted to the Quota Allocation Department for review and approval within days.

### Actual Sales Are Slow, Prices Do Not Rise or Fall

Yesterday, 120-count Asahi rayon opened at 17.5 million yuan, hovering for a long time, with transactions at 600,000 yuan. The closing price at noon was 800,000 yuan for sale, but because actual sales were very slow, the final price offered was 500,000 yuan, selling at 600,000 yuan, resulting in the same price as the previous day. 150-count bright rayon had very few stocks on the market. Yesterday, the price for Asnia brand was 19 million yuan.

Yesterday's market for factory silk was very weak. Because there were more sellers than buyers, asking prices consistently softened. B-grade goods were transacted at 24.4 million yuan for five dan, bought by Tong Zhang. There were no other transactions heard for other grades. Single goods were also transacted yesterday for five dan, at 17.6 million yuan. Another dan was bid at 17 million yuan, 400,000 to 500,000 yuan lower than the previous day.

Yesterday, the silk market was still falling. Dachen silk covers sold for 9 million yuan, and Huaqiang silk covers were transacted at 8.8 million yuan, 100,000 yuan less than the previous day. Dachen checkered crepe opened at 34,100 yuan, and after many sales, the price dropped all the way down. A transaction was made in the middle at 3,700 yuan, and the final transaction was at 3,400 yuan, 600 yuan less than the previous day. Alternate-day transactions opened at 3,700 yuan. The factory price of Hang silk luo spun yarn was about 400 to 500 yuan lower, and the Shanghai market had very few transactions, with asking prices standing firm. Huajin crepe and rayon feather yarn were in demand from the Hankou community, so transactions have been very active in recent days.

### The Shanghai Stock Market Situation is Still Uncertain - The Phenomenon of Inverted Prices Occurs Between Spot and Deferred Yong Yarn - There is Hope for a Reprieve on the 20% US Bond Security Deposit - Stock Exchange and Broker Joint Petition to Beijing

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was still very uncertain, with deferred settlements imminent. Moreover, starting next week, the payment of a 20% security deposit, which must be paid in US dollar bonds, leaves doubt as to whether there is room for accommodation. Retail investors are closing out their positions during the delivery. Some large investors are forcefully buying spot yarn, marking a major shift in operations, and the process has repeatedly risen from low to high. The phenomenon of inverted prices occasionally occurs between spot and deferred Yong yarn. Although people have different observations on the Xinjiang incident, due to the unfavorable environment, those who are pessimistic are more numerous. The morning opened lower, and after opening, deferred Yong yarn advanced from a low price of 5,200 yuan, with numbers 104, 157, and 179 advancing to 5,400 yuan. Numbers 223, 97, 65, 72, and 85 were still sold, retreating to 5,260 yuan. Numbers 103, 19, 177, 60, 106, and 76 advanced to 5,400 yuan. Numbers 84, 102, 97, 185, 235, and 224 were supplied from time to time, dropping to within 5,300 yuan. Numbers 180, 89, 61, 152, 50, 223, and 117 were all acquired. Numbers 157 and 231 forcefully acquired spot Yong yarn, raising the price of deferred Yong yarn to over 5,550 yuan. Numbers 102, 107, 91, 65, and 83 divested, dropping to 5,380 yuan. Numbers 28, 153, 23, 204, and 152 bought in at low prices. There are rumors that there is hope for a reprieve on the 20% US bond security deposit, and representatives of the stock exchange and the brokerage association have a joint petition planned. Buying interest is still strong, and prices rebounded to outside 5,500 yuan. Numbers 16, 29, and 224 divested without end. Numbers 235, 8, 36, 185, and 94, although advancing, were marked high by the Commercial Press from 183 all the way to the limit. However, outside 5,500 yuan could not be sustained for long, and retreated back to within 5,400 yuan before closing. Number 231 forcefully supported spot Yong yarn, and number 104 also absorbed more deferred Yong yarn. The closing price was again stable. Spot Yong yarn closed at 5,420 yuan, and deferred Yong yarn closed at 5,430 yuan. After the close, numbers 148 and 226 sold out, once forcing deferred Yong yarn down to below 5,380 yuan, but retail buyers were still eager, and the final price was shouted up to over 5,430 yuan. The result was that the price for immediate delivery stock Yong yarn was the same. Huafeng, Xinguang, Xinhe, Yonggong, Jingfu, Xinxing, and Wei Cuo were slightly lower. Zhongfa fell by half a percent. The Commercial Press was the only one to rise to the limit. Datong, Jinglun, Wuhe, Lian, and Xinya were slightly lower. Guohuo and Zhongs fell by half a percent. Huochai, Neiyi, Zhongfang, and Rongfeng were slightly higher. Numbered stock immediate delivery Yong yarn Jingfu and Xinguang slightly dropped. Yonggong, Huafeng, and Xinhe fell by half a percent. Off-exchange stocks were still slightly lower.

### Unified Bonds Depressed - Foreign Stocks Low

Yesterday, public sentiment for public bonds was depressed, and the environment was unfavorable. Unified C opened at 6,500 yuan in the morning, already seeing a decline. Rooms 360 and 230 sold out, and prices declined from 6,800 yuan to 5,800 yuan. Yarn flower merchants and room 503 acquired, and the price lingered around 6,400 yuan. The result was that A, B, and D were all 800 yuan lower than the previous close, and C and E fell by 1,300. Transactions were approximately 5 to 6 million.

Yesterday, foreign stocks were still not sustained. Security merchants continued to sell, and Hesheng also divested. Retail buyers could not resist, and public sentiment was still timid due to the current situation. Jardine Textiles opened at 59,000 yuan in the morning, and prices declined to within 55,000 yuan before closing. The result was that Jardine Textiles, Wheelock Marden, and paper all fell by more than half a percent to less than 1 percent. British Industries, Guangyi Brewery, and Aviation were slightly lower, less than half a percent. Steel was the only one that was flat.

### China Textile Construction Collects Cotton in Various Regions - Has Reached 1.4 Million Dan

[Report from this Newspaper] To promote the use of domestic cotton, the China Textile Construction Company has actively established cotton collection points in various cotton-producing areas across the country to carry out purchasing work. It is reported that since the new cotton harvest began around September and October of last year, the company has purchased a total of 1.4 million dan of domestic cotton in Northeast China, Tianjin, Qingdao, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Hankou, Shashi, Nantong, Jiading, and other regions. Cotton is now approaching the end of the season, so the purchasing period for this year will only last for another month. It is heard that the quality of the cotton collected in Xi'an is the best, followed by Zhengzhou, Hankou, and other places.

### Tight Credit - Market Prices Decline

Another report: Cotton market prices have recently declined due to slow sales of cotton yarn, with yarn factories becoming less interested in purchasing. Moreover, with the end of June approaching, credit is unusually tight in the market, and prices in the interior have also declined. There were not many transactions in the market today, and the trend was flat and weak. Fellow traders slightly traded midday samples, with 82 pieces of Shashi cotton at 1,475,000 yuan, 100 pieces of Hankou fine velvet at 1.29 million, and Chongtong 50 dan at 1.12 million yuan per dan. The above prices were all warehouse delivery prices. Because the price of Baohua cotton was high, the local yarn factories had no intention of purchasing. Only a small factory in Wuxi transacted 40 pieces at 1.52 million yuan.

### Continuous Distribution of Goods by the Company - The Rising Trend of Cigarettes is Halted

Yesterday's cigarette market initially saw continued demand from local merchants, and the owners held on to their goods, causing the market to rise in a straight line. However, good times did not last, and fellow traders from other ports resold on the market, causing the market to soften. In the afternoon, the rising trend was halted due to the China Company's distribution of Double Axe and Quanlu, the Huaming Company's distribution of "Crusader, Great Million Gold," and the rumors of Huacheng also distributing goods. British Great decreased by 80,000 yuan from the previous day. Old Dao, Wu Hua, and Jiaodi remained strong. The Chinese cigarette market was still strong.

[Another report] Canned cigarettes are in high demand due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival and the need for gifts. Prices are exceptionally firm, with 50 Qialike priced at 50,000 yuan, Three-Five brand at 42,200 yuan, and Small Cannon at 29,000 yuan.

### Bank of China Scheduled to Hold Shareholders' Meeting

The 23rd annual general meeting of shareholders of the Bank of China is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 14th of this month in the conference hall on the fourth floor of the bank. The board of directors has notified all shareholder representatives to register before the 13th. It is understood that this shareholders' meeting will not only report on business operations and the final accounts, but also discuss the distribution of profits. The bank's current business meeting, which opened on May 5th of this month, has lasted for a week. Group reviews of proposals began on the 6th and have now come to an end. A second general meeting will be held today, and a closing ceremony will be held.

### Evaluation of 35th Year Aged Tea Completed

[Report from this Newspaper] Since the China Tea Joint Operating Company decided to purchase the aged tea of the 35th year and began the price evaluation, it is known that the evaluation work has now come to an end. The prices of the various grades of tea that have been evaluated are currently being sent to the tea merchants for their opinions. If there are no objections, the purchase will be carried out according to this evaluation, and then negotiations will be held for export.

Domestic Tea Prices Firm

Yesterday's tea market saw continued purchases of domestic sales tea by local shops and Hakka merchants, causing public sentiment not to be discouraged. It was difficult to see good transactions, but prices were firmer than before. The green tea cores, which were frequently favored by Tianjin, remained quiet due to the inability to resolve the negotiations between the two parties. As for the export of fancy teas, since several local Chinese merchants, in view of the current situation of Chinese tea exports gradually nearing extinction, resumed operations in order to actively promote them, transactions have slightly recovered in recent times, and the market atmosphere has been able to stabilize. It is learned that Wang Yutai Tea House has recently shown interest in purchasing last year's Qimen black tea, and if the price offered is generous, there may be a flurry of activity.

### Cloth Prices Rise Across the Board

The cotton cloth market was showing a firm trend from the beginning. At 10:30, Hankou merchants made advances, and traders also came to acquire, because after the ban on the transportation of yarn and cloth to Hankou was lifted, the price of yarn rose, so public sentiment was unusually excited, and the owners of cotton cloth were even more eager to hoard. Therefore, the price of each grade of fine cloth rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan across the board. The prices of other bleached cloth, twill, serge, gray cloth, Berlin, etc. also rose, ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 yuan.

### Sales of Bituminous Coal are Sluggish

Coal Market, shipments of bituminous coal have been distributed in succession, and it is difficult to boost the market, especially as the arrivals of Fengcheng, Tongpo, Letong, and Renxi Tong are abundant, and sales are extremely sluggish. The arrivals of old blocks and coke from Hankou for white coal are also high, and purchase is greatly affected. However, because the water rate for this month has been adjusted, the mine price for Yuanhua fines delivered in Shanghai has increased instead, so most of the white coal blocks are still holding their prices, except for a small number of Hakka merchants who urgently need cash and are willing to sell at a low price.

### Jinshan Branches Rebound

Jinshan branches have recently seen prices rising because the production price is not harmonious, and the merchants mostly hold back, so the market has gradually rebounded, rising by more than 10% before and after. The current lowest exchange rate in the market for Yuan school is 860,000 yuan, only then will they be willing to exchange.

### China Textile Construction Sells Yarn

[Report from this Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 498 pieces, all sold to manufacturers. There were a total of 246 purchase applications.

### Impact of Taiwan Dollar Exchange Rate Change on Taiwan Sugar Ration Price Adjustment

[Report from this newspaper] Due to the recent change in the exchange rate of the Taiwan currency, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has requested that the price of Taiwan sugar be adjusted accordingly. The Sugar Subcommittee of the Price Evaluation Committee held a special meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to increase the price of the 19th term sugar ration from Taiwan Sugar Corporation by 16% compared to the previous term. Specifically, special grade cotton white sugar is 460,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Grade 1 cotton white sugar is 420,000 yuan per dan. Special grade granulated white sugar is 450,000 yuan per dan. Grade 2 granulated white sugar is 400,000 yuan per dan. Taiwan brown sugar is 370,000 yuan per dan. In addition, Peruvian sugar is also priced at 524,000 yuan per dan.

### Sluggish Sugar Prices

Yesterday, the sugar market was sluggish due to weak actual sales and abundant supply. The Guild's initial price for Peruvian granulated sugar was only 558,000 yuan, then rose to 568,000 yuan, and later settled at 565,000 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 yuan. Taichung Grade 20 granulated white sugar was 485,000 yuan, also down slightly by 5,000 yuan. Grade 3 and a half white sugar initially fell slightly by 10,000 yuan to 515,000 yuan, later rebounding to 520,000 yuan. Grade 24 coarse white sugar decreased by slightly over 10,000 yuan to 575,000 yuan. Local sugar felt even more sluggish, with very few transactions. Shantou green sugar was 325,000 yuan. Shunde high-quality green sugar was 310,000 yuan to 300,500 yuan, with less than 100 packages traded. Xinghua white open sugar ranged from 460,000 to 540,000 yuan, Xinghua red sugar was 320,000 to 330,000 yuan, and the second grade was 300,000 yuan, all down slightly by 10,000 yuan, with 400 baskets traded. Although Diaogreen sugar was quoted at the original price, there were few buyers. With the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's ration price adjustment today, there is hope for a rebound in market prices.

### The Red Zone Within China

— Translated by Diao Songxi

The author is Mary Lumar Knight, an American woman who worked as a correspondent in China for a long time. During the war, she was transferred back to the United States to hold an important position in the Bureau of Censorship. Later, she returned to China to work for a magazine for six months. She has considerable knowledge of China. This article is published in the May issue of the American Reader's Digest.

Now that most of the American troops have withdrawn from China, what will happen to the Chinese Communist Party? What impact will their policies have on the United States and world peace?

First and foremost, it must be clear that the Chinese Communist Party are communists. They are not like many Americans mistakenly believe, similar to members of the American Farm Bureau Federation and harmless to the country. They are staunch fanatics, typical figures of Marxist-Leninist ideals. Their leaders are either controlled by the Russians, trained in the Soviet Union, or both. They believe that the whole world is moving towards communism. Their two million troops (including guerrillas) wear red stars. They have already received some Russian aid, and if given more assistance, they may launch an offensive from the northern sea and, with the cooperation of all "underground work" organizations in the major cities, occupy the weaker areas of China. If China turns red, the entire Asian continent will inevitably become red!

Russian Rule is More Difficult to Endure Than Japanese Rule

When I arrived in the industrial centers of Xunyang and Anshan, the Red Army (Soviet and Chinese) had already withdrawn. It was still hot then. I was knocked down by a National soldier and threatened by a Chinese mob. Although I declared that I was an American and protested, they mistook me for a Russian and ignored me.

Just ask the common people. It is said that the six months under Russian rule were more difficult to endure than several years under Japanese rule. The Japanese, because they wanted to develop the industry in Manchuria, at least gave many people jobs. The Russians were not like that; they set back industrial development by decades. The machinery they transported was equivalent to twice the average annual export of machinery from the United States. Of the nine iron factories in Anshan, six were completely destroyed by them, and the remaining three were destroyed by the Chinese Communist Party!

All the facilities in the major cities of Manchuria were destroyed by the Red Army, so that the million people of Shenyang had no water to bathe in, and there was almost no electricity. After the Chinese Communist Party destroyed the railways, they cut off the starving south from the grain-producing areas of Manchuria, which the Japanese had never done before! They (the CCP) recruited farmers and dug up hundreds of miles of railroad ties, and even cut off the hands of those who drove trains so that they could not drive. This is what the mayor of Anshan told me.

Fearing the CCP More Than Fearing the Russians

He said: "The Chinese people fear the CCP even more than they fear the Russians, because the CCP is more cruel, and even encourages young guerrilla members (boys aged ten to twelve) to murder their own families!"

In Shenyang, a former CCP colonel who had just defected to the National Army told me: "I used to be often ordered to force bandits to go to the countryside to rob, burn, rape, and do everything. After the peasants had suffered enough, the CCP army would pretend to come in and provide relief, and then try to gradually induce the peasants to believe in communism."

The CCP has already trampled on a quarter of China's 500 million people and a quarter of its 11 million square kilometers of land, mostly in northern China and Manchuria. The entire Red Zone has Yan'an as its capital, with a population of 50,000. (At that time, Yan'an had not yet been recovered.) Yan'an was hung with countless red flags printed with axes and sickles, huge photos of Lenin and Stalin, and communist slogans. Most of the curriculum in senior high schools is political and military; most of the students are young men, who are being trained to serve as teachers and guerrilla leaders. Speech is strictly controlled. Children in kindergartens are taught songs of class struggle, so the ideological control of children begins in kindergartens. Leaders only allow newspapers to publish what they want the people to believe. They use leaflets, flags, and speeches to promote propaganda, and the people's spirits are endlessly burdened; there are also "secret agents" watching to prevent any opposing opinions.

Of the 130 million people in the Red Zone, only about 1.5 million are party members, and the number of party members holding public office is less than half of the total number of civil servants. In fact, they occupy all important positions. As for the 13-member Politburo and its 5-member Secretariat, they are all Red Party members. The tunes they are now singing are the same tunes that those who are now Soviet satellite states sang in the past, and now they have become elegies.

The "Far East Bureau" Was Still Active This Spring

The Chinese Communist Party has long been a member of the Third International and occupies an important position in the Far East Bureau of the Third International. Those who have been engaged in sabotage work in Asia for more than 20 years have all received special training. Their achievements in India, Indochina, and Malaya have apparently been progressing daily.

The leaders in Yan'an claim that they had already broken away from the Third International before 1943, which was when the Third International was ostensibly dissolved. However, documents obtained by the Chinese intelligence agency are sufficient to prove that the Far East Bureau of the Third International was indeed active in early 1947 and affected communist parties all over the world, including the American Communist Party. As for resolving the Chinese civil war, it secretly designed to oppose any conditions other than those proposed by the Communist Party, and also opposed any conditions that the United States tried to resolve.

The CCP still denies any relationship with the Third International or the Russian government. As for the outside world, it is determined to bring the benefits of "new democracy" to China, not to benefit the working class. However, Mao Zedong, the number one CCP member, said in his speech to the party congress in Yan'an in 1935, "We communists never hide our political goals. Our final program is to promote China's entry into communist rule."

The Most Powerful Figure in the Communist Party

Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, is a short and fat, 53-year-old hunchback, with long black hair parted in the middle. He likes to eat melon seeds and red peppers, and talks while eating. His large, round face is radiant because of his bright eyes. He is a great debater and a speaker. He claims that he avoids conflicts with the Russians because he believes that China is China's, but he has two sons being educated in Moscow. In his childhood, he did very hard work under the authoritarian rule of his farming father, which led him to revolt and join the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. He quickly rose to become the leader of a peasant guerrilla. In order to organize the rickshaw pullers' union in Changsha, he even went to work as a rickshaw puller himself. He then became a member of the Red Army Committee and Chairman of the Jiangxi Soviet, and later led the so-called "Long March" fifteen years ago with other personnel. At that time, the Communist Party left central China and moved north to its current residence, which is next door to Russian Siberia. Mao lives with his fourth beautiful movie star wife, Lan Ping, in a simple cave dwelling, which is a propaganda tactic that has created the Mao myth, equal to the Stalin myth. His photos can be seen everywhere. The songs taught in kindergartens are to praise Comrade Mao. Today, he is the most powerful figure in the Chinese Communist Party and one of the most powerful figures in the Far East. There is no doubt that the key people around him are controlled by Russian forces.

Head of Propaganda, One of the Five Giants

Zhou Enlai is the most gentle Asian I have ever met. He is the head of foreign propaganda. He comes from an official family, is handsome and always smiling, is neatly dressed in a Western suit, and is polite—such is his background, but he became an organizer of workers in Shanghai and Nanjing and has planned two riots. Today, he has become a member of the Politburo and one of its five giants. As for claiming that the Chinese Communist Party is not communist, that is also Zhou's doing.

Deng Yingchao, Mrs. Zhou, who made Zhou believe in communism, told me very frankly: "If the US government continues to support the Kuomintang, the Communist Party will have no choice but to seek help from a certain country and comrades around the world." Zhou said that he had no contact with Russia, but Mrs. Zhou inadvertently mentioned that she and Zhou lived in Moscow for six months in 1939-40.

Mao Zedong—the first giant of the Communist Party.

Zhou Enlai—the head of Communist Party propaganda.

Zhu De—the number one figure in the Communist Army.

Zhu De's Troops Plunder as Much as Possible

General Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Red Army, owes his position to the strict training he received in Moscow. In 1928, he merged his forces with Mao Zedong and jointly established China's first Soviet government.

Zhu De has recruited one or two million male and female guerrillas. A tall and thin farmer's rifle detachment leader, Ms. Kang Keqing, once asked him how to use a captured machine gun, and as a result, he married her. The Red Army lacked firearms, so they had to plunder them from others. The surrender of Japan brought them a good opportunity to obtain the Japanese army's stores. Zhu De ordered his troops to plunder as much as possible. The CCP competed with the National Army in all the occupied areas, starting a war that has not stopped to this day.

A former CCP colonel told me: "Russia did not openly support the Chinese Communist Party in Manchuria, but the Russians repeatedly told me the secret locations of the artillery they had obtained from Japan, asking us to use them to attack the National Army."

Once Anti-Mao, Li Lisan Reconciled

Li Lisan is a thin and lanky agitator who was already a prominent leader fifteen years ago. Regarding his escape at that time, it is said that he led a secret organization against Mao with Russia's tacit approval and was discovered, so he had to escape.

Li Lisan—Political Head of the Northeast Communist Army.

Li was completely a figure from Moscow. He fled to Insk, married a Russian wife, and went to the Far East University to teach a group of brokers who were returning to their old homes in Asia. Just like Tito brought "new democracy" back to Yugoslavia as a prerequisite for entering communism, he is the liaison between Yan'an and the Kremlin.

Just before the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, orders arrived in Yan'an to prepare for Li's official reinstatement and reconciliation with Mao. Li changed his name and took an American plane to the red capital—Yan'an. After the official reconciliation was completed, he accompanied Marshal Malinovsky, who commanded the "Russian" army composed of Mongols, Buryats, and other 175 ethnic groups belonging to the Soviet Union, from Siberia into Manchuria.

Americans as Pigs, Northeast Communist Propaganda

The power of the Chinese Communist Party is developing westward to the area with a large number of simple farmers, who are easily controlled by the CCP. Those farmers listen to what the Communist Party says—all landlords are enemies of the public, and the land should be divided among the farmers. The Communist Party often sets up a people's court to handle cases accusing landlords, asking the audience to raise their hands to make a judgment, then reads out the landlord's crimes, and then divides his land, sometimes using land bonds as his compensation, and sometimes not at all.

Newspapers and radios tell the farmers—if they continue to listen—the benefits of the new democratic land policy. Under the conditions of this propaganda, the peasant soldiers only do what the leaders tell them to do and have proven themselves to be adept at guerrilla warfare.

The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have both accused each other of violating their agreements, but an American general—not Marshall—told me: Ninety percent of all the difficulties in the ceasefire conditions were caused by Communist actions. In my two conversations with the current Secretary of State, he made it clear that he hoped to understand both sides. However, after Zhou Enlai abandoned the negotiations, he attacked Marshall and accused President Truman of instigating the civil war and trying to turn China into a colony of the United States. Zhou Enlai's propaganda became increasingly fierce. He broadcast Yan'an's conclusion that "The only difference between Japanese imperialism and US imperialism is that US imperialism is stronger, and its methods of aggression appear to be more civilized and legal." Therefore, the Communist Party in the Northeast teaches schoolchildren to draw Americans as two pigs on leaflets, kicking them out of China with their feet.

How will the crisis in Asia end? Is the question mark hanging over China peace or war? Only time will tell! Or the Communist Party leaders—can tell you!

### Optimistic Prospects for the Tin Industry in Southern Yunnan

— Special Correspondent Xu Jilian, Kunming, 3rd by airmail

Engineer Ni Tongcai told reporters: The tin mines on the islands of Southeast Asia have been affected by the war and have not yet fully recovered. Once they recover their original production and sales situation, the old tin industry will not be able to compete with it in its current state. At this moment, it is necessary to reduce costs, expand capital, increase production, and use machinery as much as possible. In fact, these are all interrelated. In the final analysis, it still lies in capital. Therefore, tin loans have a huge decisive effect on the future of Gejiu tin.

In the past, the government stipulated control measures for the production and sales of Gejiu tin. After large tin was smelted, it was handed over to the government to receive the stipulated price. This was of course a shackle for the tin merchants. When the control policy was abolished, it was replaced by the method of exchanging gold for tin. Each ton of tin was exchanged for 32 taels of gold, but the cost of insurance and transportation had to be deducted, so that the manufacturers actually got 18 taels per ton of large tin. After much struggle, it was increased to 23 taels of gold, but the difference was too great, so the "gold difference" problem occurred again.

The entanglements that occurred in the past have been delayed. Fortunately, the method of free transportation and sales has been announced, which is a shot in the arm for tin merchants, because manufacturers' large tin can be directly transported to Shanghai and Hong Kong for sale, or they can apply for export financing from the Fu-Hu Bank. There are not as many restrictions as in the past. At the same time, tin prices are rising steadily, which is a new encouragement for tin merchants. The tin merchants, who have gone through hardships, are rubbing their hands again, ready to make a big splash.

Lack of Water Sources in Mining Areas, Need to Establish Power Plants

The next problem is the water source. The Gejiu mining area is the most water-scarce place. The mined sand (waste) often has to wait for the rainy season to come before the work of washing can begin. If the Xiaolongtan Hydropower Plant can really be established and use electricity to pump water from the Datun Honghe River, then the production of Gejiu tin can solve a major problem.

Indeed, when the reporter passed through the mining area, he personally saw that dry scene. Even a bit of yellow mud water on the side of the mountain was treasured and used. Drinking water was taken from here, washing faces, washing feet, and even washing clothes also depended on this. The people in the mining area have never wasted a drop of water!

Speaking of which, the Gejiu tin industry is on the road to revival. It has already shown a bright prospect. According to the estimates of private manufacturers: it is expected to produce 3,000 tons of tin this year, plus the output of the government owned tin industry company, which can reach more than 4,200 tons. If each ton is valued at 25 million yuan, the total value will reach more than 100 billion. The export of large tin to earn foreign exchange, calculated at the current exchange rate, 4,200 tons of large tin can be exchanged for 8.75 million US dollars. More optimistically: if the government can quickly and continuously provide large amounts of loans, so that mine owners can fully use their funds, solve the problems of water, coal, and wood, and improve mining technology, it is certified that it can produce 40,000 tons per year, then it can earn 100 million US dollars in foreign exchange. This is such an imperceptible and considerable number!

The Perseverance of Miners is Solid, and the Future is Promising

The torch of victory warmed the hearts of every miner and rekindled hope, but they are still facing many difficulties. However, their perseverance is admirable. To revive such a huge undertaking, of course, requires a spirit of hard work. This time, the reporter went deep into the mining area and contacted many mine owners. They are all willing to dedicate themselves to this promising undertaking, but they also need help from all parties to solve some of the difficulties, because with perseverance alone, many material limitations cannot be solved easily.

I saw those many solid faces, which filled me with optimistic beliefs about the future of the Gejiu tin industry.

### Methods of Social Research

— Lu Gu

Author: Webb couple (English) Translator: Qian Yishi, Zhan Zhezun Publisher: Commercial Press

The Webbs were among the founders of the Fabian Society in England, and are experienced socialists. This book is the culmination of their research into the experience of British weaving trade unionism, consumer cooperation, and local autonomy. The translators also highly recommend it as a work of substantial content. After reading it, I am convinced that the translators' recommendation is not wrong.

Sociology as a field has only developed in the past fifty years. Not only are there few universities in China with sociology departments, but their history is also very short. Even fewer people have succeeded in specializing in sociology, and most of them translate works from America and Europe, focusing mainly on sociological theory. Sociology is a flat science, its primary purpose being to study the relationships between people. Whether it is pure or applied sociology, it must involve in-depth social observation and infiltration into various strata to conduct various empirical studies, which is the true meaning of studying sociology. The immaturity of sociology in our country means that this type of instrumental specialized treatise is rarely seen. This is not to say that people deliberately ignore its importance, but because unless a country's social work is more developed, it is impossible for a few scholars to concoct some research methods out of thin air. Therefore, the value of this book is self-evident. Although the subject of this book is the general system of British society, the technical or mental preparation and cultivation for how to start researching society itself are the same in all countries. Moreover, we can learn from the research situation of other countries and achieve twice the result with half the effort. This book can fully provide these examples, which is beneficial for beginners, and even specialized researchers need to refer to it.

Instrumentality is like the antennae of an insect, with its own special function. This is the minimum requirement for social workers. This book tells us how to equip and use these tools skillfully and confidently, and avoid the most common mistakes in common sense, such as the general impressions when observing the evolution of facts, which are usually the easiest to ignore, thinking that they are not important. In fact, this is a huge mistake, like only seeing a person's skeleton without realizing the person's appearance. How absurd and ridiculous is this! Because of this, we can only obtain a string of dead concepts, and finally can only be used as ornaments in museums, completely losing the connotation of society. Therefore, observing the activities of social institutions is like exploring the chemical composition of blood, and we must understand the movement of blood in the veins. Most valuable is that he has devoted two chapters to explain the scope of sociology and its inevitable limitations. He first pointed out that sociology must be related to humanity, and that sociology only involves the relationships between people, that is, the observation of countless combinations and the formation of groups and the various related research. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize that the subject matter of sociology is only those relationships that have a certain or universally compulsory nature, so all existing social institutions. What a simple and powerful explanation. The general public's vague understanding of sociology and disregard for its value are mostly due to the lack of this sound psychological foundation. However, modern people still inevitably underestimate the special position of sociology in the scientific community with a doubtful attitude. Undoubtedly, this is the biggest reason for the slow progress of sociology. To eliminate the general public's misunderstanding of the meaning and application of science, I think that not only should sociology itself make such a defense, but also other non-material sciences. Weber knew this, so he did not hesitate to repeatedly elaborate on it, which can be seen in his chapter on "The Relationship Between Science and the Purpose of Life." Interestingly, the current social phenomenon in our country is full of martyrdom, corruption, embezzlement, and using public office for personal gain. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, whether it was the central government or local officials in England, it was also in this state. However, after all, it adopted some cautious and scientific social inventions and greatly cleared it up. This is tantamount to giving our country a good encouragement and imitation. That is to say, sociology will make a huge contribution to reversing China's strange status quo. At least this is by no means a nonsense. Advanced countries have already achieved good results. The task of sociology now seems to begin with how to deeply cultivate people's belief in sociology.

This book is divided into twelve chapters. The arrangement of the chapters has a continuous ladder, and it will be difficult to cross over if a section is missing. The author has put a lot of thought into this, including (1) the limitation of the scope of sociology, (2) the mental preparation of social researchers, (3) how to study social facts, (4) the technique of note-taking, (5) written language, (6) oral language, (7) the British Royal Commission and subcommittees, (8) observing the activities of social institutions, (9) the application of statistics, (10) verification, (11) publication, (12) the relationship between science and the purpose of life. Looking at the whole book, the focus is on chapters (2), (8), (10), and (11).

Regarding the mental preparation of social researchers, the so-called mental preparation is the ideal mental state of social researchers when they begin to explore social organizations. Generally, anything that can be called scientific has its own special mental preparation, and sociology is no exception, and it is especially important. Weber said it well: "We observe things through our vision, rather than using our vision." This is somewhat different from the research attitude of material science. Of course, the research of material science is very objective, and the inevitability of prejudice in non-material science is also true. It is generally believed that when some people are "selfless people," it is just the meaning of the consistency of prejudices between the two parties. Therefore, in order to ensure the accuracy of social research, the objective research of facts and other necessary conditions such as the necessity of sympathetic understanding, the cultivation of general technical ability, and the breadth of general knowledge, we can talk about how to study social facts. In studying social facts, the author also revealed a very valuable secret: "The subject of research should be the whole or part of a certain special social institution, not a problem that one thinks must be solved." This chapter describes the paper-based question-and-answer method that is commonly used. Zhang Bo once failed because of this, which is a very valuable reference material.

Regarding the observation of the activities of social institutions, he gave a large number of examples, which should include the application of various techniques such as note-taking, oral language, written language, and statistics. Written language is divided into documents and literature. He gave a rather broad definition of literature, that is, all works other than the time-sensitive documents of government or local agencies are literature, which is very suitable in sociology, and he repeatedly mentioned that documents and statistics must rely on the corroboration of oral language and contemporary literature.

Regarding verification and publication, these are the last two steps of all sciences, but it is rare to include publication as a topic in works on scientific methods. Sociology is just like other sciences, especially because the facts of the social institutions they obtain, whether due to simple or complex observations, are not very reliable. Therefore, only the probability of facts can be discovered by comparing the two qualities and conducting detailed tests separately. In other words, sociologists use various independent and systematic assumptions at the current stage, and the results obtained are only limited to the meaning of inclination. Since sociology is in the field of knowledge today, when the determination of each hypothesis requires such difficult and complicated unbiased and systematic verification, and because the subject matter is not easy for others to affirmatively accept their conclusions, any progressive discoveries must be published immediately. Weber said that this is "the special task of social researchers, and only in this way can sociology obtain the kind of definite status enjoyed by the sciences of its predecessors." In the "Verification" chapter, Weber also mentioned incidentally that the verification work under capitalism is wasteful and monopolized, which can be said to give people a good warning.

This book is entirely a gain or loss of results obtained from work experience, and I think its value lies in this. As for the fluency of the translation of this book, I believe that there is no need to experience the hardship of "repeated deliberation," so I believe that introducing this book is not a waste of effort.

### Introducing "Middle School Students" (Monthly published by Kaiming Bookstore)

— Gao Ning

The vast number of middle school students are often troubled by not being able to find extracurricular reading materials. This phenomenon is vividly existing.

After reading the "Middle School Students" magazine for a long time, I deeply feel that there are solutions to the above-mentioned troubles of middle school students in the publishing industry, but they have not looked for them. This "Middle School Students" is a publication that is worth reading.

This "Middle School Students" is a comprehensive publication, which includes education current affairs, social sciences, composition guidance, natural sciences, literature and art, reader's corner, and news summaries.

Taking the recently published issue 187 (May issue) as an example, it has such excellent content:

In terms of current affairs, it has an article "The Moscow Conference in the Past Month," which details the significance of this conference and its nature, which can be understood by young students.

In terms of natural science, there are "The Variation of Sunspots" and "The Thermal Emission of Electrons," both of which are works that enrich young students' scientific knowledge.

In each issue, Mr. Chen Yuan also introduces a country. This issue is about the changing East - Vietnam. After reading these articles, we can have a very clear understanding of the situation of small countries.

It also introduces the figures of the times in the world in each issue. This issue introduces: Motor King Ford and Ho Chi Minh, President of the Republic of Vietnam. If you don't know the life experiences of these figures, you can learn about them after reading them, which is very important.

In terms of literature and art, it has a play "Patriot" and the essays of middle school students.

The news summary of one month is very helpful for middle school students to read newspapers. For example, in this issue, it tells readers in this way:

The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang of China - the National Army stationed in Yan'an - on the protection of human rights - the Moscow Conference is exchanging different opinions - two documents on China - the Pan-Asian Conference in New Delhi.

These are all important news in a month. After middle school students prove it, they can know the important news in the previous month. Therefore, they can get a lot of help when reading the news in this month.

Personally, I think this is indeed an ideal extracurricular reading material for young middle school students.

In the past few issues, I can especially recommend the works of special series, such as "Middle School Students and Politics" (with the opinions of Cao Fu, Sun Qimeng, Zhou Yutong, Zhang Zhirang, Wu Yaozong, Shen Yizhen, Chen Qingshi, etc.), such as "Middle School Students and Literature and Art" (with the opinions of Xiao Qian, Lu Shuxiang, Jian Kejia, Jin Lin, Li Guangtian, Pingbo, Shiyi, Ke Ling, Cao Bohan, Liao Yi, Zhu Ziqing, etc.). These major issues are of interest to every middle school student.

### New Treatise on Chinese Personnel Issues

— Huang Weilian

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in our country, everything is waiting to be done, and there are thousands of things in the country that need to be sorted out urgently. As long as there are suitable people who come forward to shoulder the heavy responsibility and plan everything, the construction industry can gradually recover, and the major national affairs can be on the right track. Regarding the administration of personnel in our country, there have always been two factions: rule by man and rule by law. The rule-by-man faction advocates rule by man, with people as the center of administration; the rule-by-law faction advocates rule by law, with administration paying attention to systems and laws; but no matter what, it cannot get rid of "people." If good laws are supplemented by appropriate people, then good laws can be implemented. It is even more important to enable everyone to be in the right position and do their best.

In recent years, the domestic publishing industry has been quite concerned about personnel administration. A large number of personnel administration books have been published, such as How to Manage Personnel by Qing Ru (Commercial Press, 1933 edition), Xue Bokang's Outline of Personnel Administration (Zhengzhong, 1947 Shanghai edition), Zhang Jinjian's Personnel Administration (Commercial Press edition), and Outline of Personnel Administration Systems of Various Countries (Zhengzhong, 1946 Shanghai edition), Tu Zheyin's Implementation of Personnel Management (World, 1946 edition), Zhao Zongyu's Management of People (World, 1946 edition), in addition, there are He Lucheng's Personnel Assessment (Commercial Press, 1946 Shanghai edition), Zhang Zhenduo's Personnel Engineering (Commercial Press, 1946 Shanghai edition), Huang Yanpei's Experience in Agency Management (Commercial Press, 1946 second edition), Xiao Xiaorong's Personnel Psychological Problems (Commercial Press, 1945 Shanghai edition), etc., but most of them introduce the British and American civil service systems or industrial and commercial management systems, and rarely express specific opinions on the actual problems of our country.

Huang Jingbai's "New Treatise on Chinese Personnel Issues" can be said to be a book that studies the actual problems of personnel and administrative science. In addition to economic problems, the most urgent task for China today is indeed personnel problems. Mr. Gan Naikang said in the preface to this book: "In this rapidly changing trend, what changes will our country's personnel administration cause, and what other problems will be involved? This is also what those who study personnel administration should pay attention to. In this era of democratic centralism and national defense first, the comparison of national strength between countries originally includes the comparison of human resources. From the perspective of the government, the scope of personnel administration should not only be limited to government officials or industrial and commercial employees. The personnel of state-owned and public-owned enterprises have a broad and comprehensive scope, which is the entire plan for mobilizing national human resources, and there must be a reasonable distribution and use of all people.

The Chinese personnel issues discussed in this book include the characteristics of Chinese personnel issues, the talent issues for nation-building, the examination issues at the current stage, the performance evaluation issues during extraordinary periods, the implementation issues of civil service careerization, the issues of organizing job categories, the issues of establishing personnel administration systems, and the issues of improving personnel institutions. How will all these methods be implemented and how will they be started? This is what those who study personnel administration should pay attention to. The whole book analyzes the principles of things, provides methods, and has deep research, and the argument is precise and accurate. It is truly an important book for those who are engaged in studying the current personnel administration problems in China.

Recently, the administrative authorities in our country have attached great importance to improving organizations, controlling finances, and improving office methods, etc., but they often neglect the administration of personnel. In fact, the administration of personnel is more important than all other issues. The promotion of administration depends on people. If we only seek to improve office methods and ignore personnel issues, then we will abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial, and it will be difficult to achieve results. In the past, in the imperial examination era, those with excellent learning became officials. Today, personnel assessment is gradually being valued, and it has been tried out in various places, but the various problems of selecting talents and making the best use of their talents are not discussed, which seems contradictory.

Indeed, the biggest problem in China at present is still the problem of using people, and economic problems are still secondary. With suitable talents, we will use economic facilities. In other words, economic problems are ultimately passive, and the active mechanism is ultimately people. The problem of people is very big. There are people above and people below. If we want the entire organization to cooperate from top to bottom, those who are leaders above must not only be able to plan comprehensively and lead the masses, but also have the ability to move people with virtue and be tolerant of others. Those who serve others below must have a true spirit of service, adapt to the environment, and show loyalty and cooperation. The main spirit of the so-called personnel system is still to select people for the job, distinguish between ability and inability, so that the virtuous and capable can make the best use of their strengths and perform their duties, so that there will be no perfunctory behavior or passing off inferior goods as the real thing.

What is most regrettable is that there are people who cannot strictly abide by their duties or cooperate with others in terms of duties, but they are meticulous in terms of rights and cannot tolerate the slightest difference, making things difficult for those above. They do not know that rights and obligations go hand in hand. If they say rights, they must have duties. There must be obligations first, and then rights. And if they serve others, they must put others before themselves, so how can they not be loyal to those who seek for them? I have never heard of it.

Therefore, the most important task of the future personnel system should be to seek talents. In addition to using the examination method, there should be a board of precise investigation for various talents, so that the examination and appointment agency can be the general assembly of talents for promotion and can play the role of selecting people for the job. In addition, people above and below can do their best in their respective abilities and duties, and can understand each other everywhere, and there is absolutely no selfishness, then the Chinese personnel problem can be easily solved.

### A Guide to Learning Foreign Languages

— Juan Zhi

Written by Chen Yuan, published by Shixue Bookstore

Foreign languages are weapons in our life struggles. As every person in the new era, it is essential to master these weapons.

Without hesitation, every young person now must learn one or several foreign languages. In school education, there used to be at least one compulsory foreign language course. As for the benefits of learning a foreign language, everyone knows it. It will give you a lot of help in academics and literature and art—for example, those who study philosophy can understand many original works, and those who love literature and art can read the original texts, which is really both progressive and enriching.

However, what we see is that some students and young people often do not pay much attention to learning foreign languages, and some only read the textbooks in school several times and do things perfunctorily. Some even have a distorted understanding of learning foreign languages. They think that learning foreign languages is another means of "doing business," such as learning English in order to become compradors. We have seen many of these phenomena. Precisely because of this, we must bring it up to correct these colorful erroneous phenomena and embark on a truly research-oriented and struggle-oriented learning path!

Chen Yuan's work is a book that provides some learning methods for those who are learning foreign languages.

The content of this book is generally worth reading, except for a few small sections. The content is based on some of the author's own experiences, so it can also be said to be a discussion of learning experiences. The content of this book:

First, the author is writing about the question of "to learn or not to learn?" The conclusion is very simple, that is, "foreign languages should be learned," but it should also be "appropriately flexible." The author's reason is this: If you want to learn, it is: "If you have interest, tools, and time, or you can always squeeze out a little time, then even in a mobile life, you may as well start your learning."

Second, in terms of learning principles, the "Five Dosm" - "eyes, ears, mouth, heart, and hands," are indeed the most important in learning, and the author also emphasizes these five dosm. This is necessary.

In addition, "reciting the dictionary" - the author points out that this is not appropriate. Using more, using the basics, attacking the strong, reading magazines, intensive reading, and translation, can be said to be very beneficial instructions for learners.

Third, it talks about various languages - modern aspects: Esperanto, French, English, German, Russian, Japanese; ancient languages are also briefly mentioned, Latin and Hebrew.

In this regard, the author points out that in the modern language aspect, almost every one is not easy, which of course has a reason. In the ancient language aspect, the author advises those who learn foreign languages to understand the ancient languages best, because most of the European languages originate from this, so understanding the ancient languages makes it easy to learn modern languages. I deeply agree with this and hope that all foreign language lovers can do this.

As far as I know, the steps for learning a foreign language must know its: - essence - origin - development - structure. If you understand this, learning is very easy, so ancient literature is very justified to learn it.

Fourth, the author puts forward the learning method chapter, which points out: 1. Pronunciation, 2. Vocabulary, 3. Grammar, 4. Idioms, 5. Conversation, 6. Translation, 7. Writing, 8. Application, 9. Verse, 10. Ending.

The methods told to scholars here can indeed be a good reference for learners.

Finally, a list of learning books is opened. Some of these books are very referenceable, and some books are incorrect. It is also hoped that the author will revise them well in the next edition.

We know that in learning, "there is no smooth road to walk, only those who climb up without fear of difficulties have the hope of reaching the shining peak." This is a famous saying, and it is correct.

This book is not a learning shortcut, but a good guide to learning. We must remember the above famous saying, and then read this book, which is very beneficial.

### News from the Publishing Industry

John Steinbeck's novel "The Moon Is Down," which describes the situation in Norway during the occupation, has been translated into Chinese by Zhao Jiayi and published by Chenguang Publishing Company.

The sixth issue of the third volume of the monthly magazine "Maternal and Child Health" has been published. It is networked by people from Dade Hospital.

### "Two Generations"

— Jian Ci

Shen Ji, Rixin Literary Righteous Book

Before discussing this brilliant collection of short stories, "Two Generations," let us first recall the literary situation in Shanghai during the occupation. This is absolutely necessary and not entirely without significance.

To speak of "freedom of speech" and "freedom of publication" in the occupied territories was naturally unimaginable. If one were to write a literary work that inspired thoughts of resistance against Japan or anti-Nazism, the inevitable consequences would be arrest, torture, or even death. Therefore, the path of literature during this period was extraordinarily difficult and tortuous. Some focused purely on the love affairs of intellectual young men and women, striving for exquisite technique and story structure, becoming the temporarily popular "Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies" school. Others emphasized the expression of human warmth, with meticulous depictions of minor events and small details. Still others boldly used human sexuality as a rallying cry. And there was also the vogue for detective stories, chivalrous thieves, romantic tales, and obscenity... In short, all the dregs of literature, with the aim of diversion and anesthetization, rose up with this political tide, filling the urban landscape of the occupied territories, before the people whose reason and emotions had been numbed.

However, at the same time, it is undeniable that literature full of vigor and a spirit of struggle also sprouted in this intolerable climate, shouldering the responsibility that this distressed era placed on every conscientious literary worker. Like a giant torch, radiating fire and heat, in this dark and hopeless era, from "The Horse Thief," "Ghost," "The Wildness of the Great Marsh"... In this series of short stories, this unrestrained author, with the greatest burst of emotional fire, shot far into the hearts of the people who yearned for liberation and light, fostering a burning, almost insane emotion, causing the "explosion" of the feelings of the weakened people who had already been numbed, and completing the most rational love and hate of the rebellious mind.

The author of "Two Generations" has a gloomy name, Shen Ji. This book, completed in a dark and obscure time, contains ten short and concise novels. In terms of writing method, he still uses his extremely intense emotions, placing them in moods of absolute wildness, desolation, terror, and melancholy... In excitement, he completes the embodiment of his emotions and reason – the narration of the stories – and elevates them, burning them to the highest saturation point. At the end of the story, the author habitually teaches to break through this saturation point, so that the reader's emotions also break through and explode at the same time, but completes the author's purpose, broadens the emotions of the receiver, and as a result, also fiercely and savagely confronts love and hate. And in terms of technique, it is clear that the author has made more perfect progress, whether in the honing of words, the exploration of characters, or the depiction of emotional environments.

Faced with such a complete work of art, we should be optimistic about the author's future.

And on the very first page of this book, the author wrote this famous saying: "Have you ever seen scorpions? In order to cross a body of water, the ones at the front drown themselves in the water, so that the ones behind can crawl over their corpses."

With the text matching the author's great spirit, I think: history will prove that "Two Generations" is a collection of brilliant light on new literature.

### Random Musings on Alone Docking

Yu's control of the floods had both successes and failures. The reason seems too simple; middle school children can write it clearly on their exam papers. Yu's failure was not without merit, because he told later generations with facts that building dikes to prevent flooding is not a good method.

Don't underestimate water; it is the fate of all living things. When it is placed in a teacup, it seems very calm, but when it trickles into the sea, it forms an incredibly enormous power. And the so-called surging ocean is precisely the accumulation of trickles.

As for wanting to build a waterproof dike in the sea to build a dream kingdom, it is both impossible and unnecessary to even think about it.

No matter how delicious the food is, first you must have an appetite, and second you must be able to swallow it.

Friendly countries have sent us many canned goods, and the kindness is naturally appreciated. Canned foods piled up like mountains can often be seen on the streets, and the price is also quite low, but sales are not good. The reason for this is quite thought-provoking for those who care about people's livelihood and society.

Mr. Xu Weinan said: "It's far better to send some stinky tofu." This is not a laughable statement.

Because the appetites of our vast people are not for biscuits, nor for butter.

To praise us too much will cause us to go from being flattered to having seizures.

Therefore, for all well-intentioned gifts, please consider the appetites of ordinary people; then we can swallow them.

Most of the four hundred million compatriots in the motherland are poor; the fortune of going abroad and living in foreign houses ultimately belongs to a very small number of people.

I hope that the compassion of others will not cause unfortunate consequences.

### Rambling on News Translation

— Yan Anfu

Translation is really not an easy thing, and translating news, especially about international politics, military affairs, economics, culture, education, and other news, is even more difficult. First, people engaged in translation work must have a full understanding of foreign languages, and then translate them into fluent and smooth national languages. This is the most basic condition. In addition to this language skill, they must also have a considerable understanding of international current affairs. At the same time, after translating into the national language, it must be understandable to the people of the country, so that it can be regarded as fulfilling the responsibility of translation. What is discussed here is the translation of news, especially from English into Chinese.

Translating according to the literal meaning of the English original into rigid Chinese, making people confused or easily causing misunderstandings, is unacceptable. I remember that more than a month ago, in a Chinese telegram issued by a news agency in this city, there was a translated passage called "Soviet Minister of Armed Forces." The term "Minister of Armed Forces" is really inappropriate. Presumably, the English original of this term may be Minister of Armed Forces. The term "Minister of Armed Forces" not only makes people feel unfamiliar, but also easily causes misunderstandings, because the words "armed forces" often make people associate with words such as "war," "aggression," and "expansion." A good military and political minister, if translated in this way, wouldn't he become "Hitler the Second"?

When translating the names of foreign government departments or institutions into Chinese, one should first understand the political system of that country. In English, the prime minister is called Premier, the premier of the State Council is also called Premier, and even the president of the Executive Yuan of our government is called Premier. However, when translating into Chinese, one must pay close attention and distinguish them clearly. If the word "prime minister" refers to the premier of the State Council in a country with a republican system, it is tantamount to making the same joke as calling the president an emperor. The US State Department (State Department, which is actually about the same as the foreign ministries of other countries, but with a larger scope. It can be said that it is harmless to translate it as the State Department. But since it is translated as the State Department, why not translate Secretary of State as the Minister of the State Department? Why did you come up with a "Secretary of State"? I don't know which translator "created its meaning." Just imagine that in a democratic republic like the United States, how can there still be the existence of "Secretary"? But later, everyone made mistakes and went along with them, and the Minister of the State Department has always been called the Secretary of State.

Speaking of this, I also thought of the translation of the name of the former Secretary of State (please forgive me for following suit). The former US Secretary of State was Byrnes (should be Byrnes, with the emphasis on the word "Byrnes"). I don't know who translated the surname as Bernas. Later, everyone made mistakes and went along with them as usual. Once I heard a Chinese reporter and an American officer discussing current affairs in Tunxi. The reporter spoke English well, but when he talked about "Bernas," the American officer didn't understand who he was talking about. Later, the reporter wrote the word Byrnes on white paper with a pencil, and then he understood that he was talking about Byrnes.

Recently, various Chinese newspapers in this city published news about the case of the beating to death of Zang Da's second son, including "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately received a letter from the US Consulate, which was based on the US military court's statement: "The Chinese court's request is of great interest to this military court..." The words "of great interest" here seem to be worth considering. The English original of these words must be the word Interested. In my opinion, it should be translated as "attention" or "concern" here, and should not be translated as "interest." For a case involving human life, it seems a bit awkward to use words such as "feeling interested," and the meaning is completely different; for example, you say to a friend: "I am very concerned (or very attentive) about the news that your father has passed away." If you change it to say: "I am very interested in the news that your father has passed away." Isn't that a joke?

The above rambling is scattered, unsystematic, nothing more than nitpicking, talking and laughing.

### Urban Planning Exhibition

— Ning Xuren

Many people came to visit the Civil Engineering and Architectural Urban Planning Exhibition sponsored by the Engineering College of St. John's University, and its content was very rich; there was a plan for the new Hongqiao, and they divided Hongqiao into several units, with schools, entertainment venues, and hospitals in the units; the residences included apartment-style and lane-style, all with detailed drawings or models; the design of the residences was very thoughtful, in addition to economic principles, it was also necessary to consider the adjustment of sunlight and air, and the wind direction, etc., the construction of workers' residences should be simple and economical. The remaining are the various stations designed by Professor Bauer; the work of student courses includes drawings and models, and the models include steel-concrete houses, iron bridges, airports, suspension bridges, and sluices.

After eight years of war in China, more than half of the buildings in various places were destroyed. After the victory, it is extremely necessary to restore them. Due to the lack of talent, economy, and materials, the pre-war state has not yet been restored. The Shanghai Municipal Government has established an Urban Planning Committee and has begun to plan the new Greater Shanghai, providing them with the "St. John's University" plan for reference. To build Shanghai into an international city, all kinds of houses, factories, entertainment venues, etc. must undergo rigorous design in order to be comparable to major European and American cities.

### A Stroll on Central Lin Sen Road

— Hua Lin

Fourteen years ago, when I lived on Xuehuali Road in Shanghai, I often took a walk along Xiafei Road every afternoon, starting from the French Park on Hualong Road and walking all the way to the intersection of the Cercle Sportif Francais on Ya'erpei Road. This section of the street was very clean, and I often met friends. At that time, Sun Fuxi lived in a garden villa on Huanlong Road, and his home seemed to be the headquarters.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War this time, most of my friends were scattered. I returned to Shanghai for more than a year, and people who returned from various places reunited in the area of ​​Central Lin Sen Road in Shanghai. I still often take a walk on this section of the road, but it is a bit longer than in the past. The east end goes to the intersection of Madang Road, because I often go to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and the west end extends to Xiangyang North Road, or even to the intersection of Fukaissen Road. The China Association for Cultural Cooperation is there. There is the Yunlin Painting and Calligraphy Society and the Huangshan Art Garden on Luban Road. Near Lin Sen Park, there is the Xiangling Pavilion and the Wenyi Cafe. Li Shizeng lives on Pushi Road, Sun Fuxi now lives near the South Shaanxi Road on Huanlong Road, Ba Jin lives in Lingfei Fang, Ouyang Yuqian lives on Central Lin Sen Road, the intersection of South Shaanxi Road, Bi Xushao lives on Changle Road, and Wang Yaying still lives in the original Xuehua Fang, so entering the alleys is not only not lonely, but also feels more prosperous than more than ten years ago!

The Shanghai Municipal Gymnasium has a part of the rooms for the Shanghai Literary Writers Association and the Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office; the general assembly of the Writers Association, which moved to Shanghai from Chongqing, has its headquarters on Kangti Road, which is much farther away; but the Writers' Bookstore is next door. Wang Jinshan and Liu Pingli, Liu Shi are both near Fuxing Park, and L莽 often goes to the Journalism College. The above friends mostly gather in the Xiangling Pavilion tea house every Saturday afternoon. Although Xu Zhongnian lives on Haifang Road, when he returns to Shanghai, he must run around on this section of the road.

There are many friends on North Sichuan Road, but the road is too far, and I rarely run there. Even things about cultural activities are mostly concentrated in the area of ​​Central Lin Sen Road. In the past, the French Park was the center of the walk, but now Lin Sen Park is the center. It is a pity that the Liming Academy of Lu Buru has been discontinued, otherwise there will be more hustle and bustle in the park.

### Higashikuni Opens a Restaurant

— Ye Lin

According to the Associated Press, Higashikuni, the first prime minister of Japan after the surrender, is going to open a small restaurant in the black market area near Tokyo Station. It is said that there will be a tea room attached, serving light tea and coffee. If it opens, Hirota, Suma, Nagano and other disciples of Mitsuru Toyama will surely become honored guests. And make the tea room a Club for "rectifying comrades."

The word "Miya" in Higashikuni Palace has been cancelled with the deprivation of the nobility title. The reporter's strokes outline that he is no longer an unattainable figure, because now no matter who goes to see him, there is no need to put on a morning dress, wear a top hat and white gloves. He is now a commoner. Because he is a commoner, Higashikuni wants to open a restaurant, because he has lost his "fief." If opening a restaurant is not just a hypocritical decoration, but a way to make a living, then it is naturally a blessing for the Japanese people. From this, we can see that their civil rights have no existence of aristocratic privilege, and will not make them suffer another oppression and exploitation.

In Japan, 1945 was an important watershed era in history. The main key to this watershed is that the emperor and the royal family must have restored their human identity. Higashikuni is precisely from noble to commoner, only to this day. He and his peers are only rectified, not settled. In their personal words, this is a kind of luck. In historical terms, we can hardly know the consequences. It is said that Higashikuni said: "I will pay attention to the reconstruction work of Japan. I want to share the hardships and joys." And I am happy to obtain the identity of a commoner. If this is not self-deprecation, we are willing to tell Higashikuni "Miya" that what he will get must be hardship, and we are also willing to tell Higashikuni that what he will get must be joy, even if he is unwilling to share it, history will not allow him to escape.

Therefore, at this time, such as the former Higashikuni Palace and the current Higashikuni, etc., opening a restaurant is what we want to hear, and we are willing to congratulate him.

### The Sadness of Children

— Shi Xinghuo

Today, in the weekly diary of a third-grade elementary school student, I read such a passage,

"Yesterday, when I came home from school, I saw an airplane in the sky, fighting a battle there. I thought: "If World War III starts, our lives will definitely not be safe!"

How simple and profound this passage is!

The author of this weekly diary is a very naughty child of twelve or thirteen years old, and can be regarded as an outstanding "noisy person" in the class. Who knew that the shadow was also deeply engraved in his chest - what a terrible shadow!

Carefully savoring that short passage, it doesn't seem like a child's tone at all. It is simply full of adult sadness, and that sadness is so heavy that it makes people immediately infected with an indescribable melancholy.

Perhaps it is because he has heard it too many times from the mouths of his elders; it was only when the teacher asked him to do a weekly diary that he involuntarily wrote that passage, which shows that these words have at least been filtered through the child's mind, and he can't find the slightest shadow of innocence and optimism. This is such a terrible thing!

In fact, children like this of twelve or thirteen years old have completely grown up in the flames of war. They have indelible impressions of disasters and famines. Especially the high prices make it impossible for them to get the minimum nutrition and conservation they should have. The black hand of life has strangled the throats of the young, making them have to think: "If World War III starts, our lives will definitely not be safe."

This kind of precocious and unhealthy thinking is reflecting the sadness of the current children. When can we liberate our next generation from this shadow?

Here we can't help but cry out: "Save our young ones"!

### Art Scene

The Taiwan Provincial Compilation and Translation Center has recently been abolished. The writer Li Helin recently wrote to a friend in Shanghai saying: he will soon leave Taiwan and go to Guangxi to work.

The literary translator Li Liewen first worked in the new open community in Taiwan, and recently served in the education field. It is said that he will soon leave Taiwan and go to Fujian.

"Far Wind" Monthly will be edited by Li Baifeng from the next issue.

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

"Feifei, is it sour?"

She nodded, then closed her eyes again, but her hands were always holding the copper rabbit she was playing with.

"Okay, then don't eat it!" Lao Zhu reluctantly said in a gentle tone like a woman: "When the train stops later, Uncle Zhu will go and ask for water for Feifei to drink."

Feifei didn't say anything, as if she also wanted to try her best to fall asleep.

He didn't dare to deduct the remaining quarter of the pear, and still carefully clamped it with two fingers, letting it hover under his palm, for fear that Feifei would want to eat it again in a while.

More than thirty minutes passed, and Feifei seemed to have fallen asleep for a while. Suddenly, she jumped straight up from Lao Zhu's arms, opened her eyes wide, and shouted while crying: "Mom, Feifei wants you! Feifei wants you!" Zhu Zhaonian was so flustered that he couldn't help but put his arms around her and gently shake her.

"Feifei, listen! Don't be afraid! Uncle is here!" He said a few words in a row, and Feifei, who woke up from her dream, gradually calmed down, but Lao Zhu tried her temperature, and it was much higher than just now.

"Feifei, does your head hurt?" he asked gently.

"It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!" Feifei pointed her right finger at her head and cried crisply.

Zhu Zhaonian immediately felt that the temperature in the carriage seemed to have increased by ten degrees, and beads of sweat broke out on his forehead and body.

"It doesn't matter, Feifei, you calm down, it will be fine in a while!" He could only tentatively comfort her with words. "When the train arrives at the next stop, Uncle Zhu will immediately get you some water to drink, and buy you two yellow and round little buns. Feifei, you say, do you love to eat little buns?"

Only then did a faint smile appear on Feifei's small face, which had suddenly lost half its weight in the past few days.
