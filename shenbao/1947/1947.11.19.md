### Political Yuan Passes Bandit Suppression Plan; Bai Chongxi to Inspect in Jiujiang Within Days; Key Defense Ministry Personnel Arrive in Xun Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The bandit suppression plan decided upon by the Six-Province Joint Defense Conference was submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting on the 18th. After two hours of careful discussion, it was slightly revised and passed. It will be promulgated and implemented after being passed by the State Council meeting next Friday. It is reported that the main points of the plan are as follows: 1. Increase the authority of military law to facilitate the work of suppressing bandits. 2. Strengthen the organization of the central government and local governments. 3. Local organizations establish committees for encouraging the people. 4. Replenish local militia self-defense forces to cooperate with the national army in implementing suppression.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi will inspect Jiujiang within days and preside over the Jiujiang Command Post established by the decision of the Six-Province Joint Defense Conference to strengthen the river defense. According to reliable sources, the communists are attempting to concentrate their forces and separately approach various ports on the north bank of the Yangtze River, creating the impression that each stronghold has a tendency to cross the river, so that the national army is exhausted and its strength is dispersed, and it cannot take care of the military affairs in North China and Northeast China, in order to achieve their desire to threaten Beijing and Shanghai and disturb people's minds during the upcoming National Congress. According to an authoritative source, we can only believe that the communist army's propaganda offensive to threaten Beijing and Shanghai is indeed intended to disperse our forces, because according to this person's view, the ultimate goal of the communists must be Tianjin and Beijing, and while the national army is defending Jiangnan and Beijing and Shanghai, Tianjin and Beijing will be empty, and they want to take them by storm, in order to change the international perception. The military authorities have made preparations for this and will never fall for their cunning plan.

[Our Newspaper, Jiujiang, 18th] In response to Minister Bai's arrival in Xun within days, a residence has been found and everything is being arranged. About ten key members of the Ministry of National Defense arrived in Xun by special plane this afternoon, which is said to be related to the establishment of the command post.

### National Army Inside and Outside Yulin Officially Shake Hands and Join Forces; Fu Zuoyi Talks About the Victory at Liangjiutan

[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 18th] Military News: The powerful corps supporting Yulin, after breaking through the obstacles of the bandit army along the way and inflicting heavy damage on the bandits, arrived at the northern suburbs of Yulin at 3 pm on the 18th and officially shook hands and joined forces with the defending army. They are now actively encircling and annihilating the remaining bandit army. In total, the results of the battle in recent days have resulted in more than 8,000 bandits killed or wounded, and many captured.

[Central News Agency, Yulin, 6 pm on the 18th, Urgent Dispatch] The cavalry we sent to Kekeer Gai met with the Ningliang Corps at noon on the 18th. It is expected that the unit will reach the suburbs of the city tonight. Commander Ma Shijing has also led a part of the infantry into the city at 5 pm.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Fu Zuoyi met with reporters today and talked about the victory at Liangjiutan outside Yulin, praising the bravery and good fighting skills of Ma Hongda's unit, and the support of the Muslim compatriots for the central government, saying that this battle has reversed the overall situation in northern Shaanxi. Mr. Fu said: The communist central government wanted to take root in northern Shaanxi, so it tilted its central force, Peng Dehuai's seven brigades, and launched a fierce attack on Yulin, determined to win. Fortunately, the Ningxia troops came to support in a big way and broke the communist offensive that was related to the overall situation. There are many Muslims in Ningxia. This battle can show the Muslims' support for the central government, and it can also be seen that the closer to the communist area, the more the people hate them. The significance is great. After the victory at Liangjiutan, Mr. Ma telegraphed Mr. Fu, saying, "Continuing the pursuit can capture Peng Dehuai!" Mr. Fu said that because the area was all sandy, it was difficult to pursue, so he did not force it. Since the 16th, the bandits have re-assembled small groups to attack the foreign exchange outside Yulin. It is expected that Mr. Ma's unit can join forces with the Yulin garrison today, which can give the national army a chance to annihilate Peng's unit. The military value of Yulin is even higher than that of Shijiazhuang, but the garrison is small, the weapons are poor, and the defense is difficult, so two regimental commanders and four battalion commanders were injured, including the local militia of the Ik Zhao League, who all exerted their greatest strength, and the assistance of the air force was also very successful. In short, the heavy damage suffered by the communists due to the attack on Yulin was definitely not what they had expected. Mr. Fu also discussed the meaning of the national army guarding "points," saying, "Points" are armor, used to protect oneself when bandits come. One does not guard "points" for the sake of guarding "points," but retreats when it is not appropriate to guard. The national army in Chahar and Suiyuan takes great care of the local militia and never lets them suffer losses, so the cooperation is very appropriate. At present, there are no visible communists in Suiyuan, and only a part in Chahar. Mr. Fu also praised the cooperation of the people in Chahar and Suiyuan.

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th] After hearing about the victory at Yulin, all sectors of Chahar Province telegraphed their respects to the soldiers defending the city of Yulin and the Ningxia National Army who reinforced Yulin, and sent telegrams to the Chahar and Suiyuan armies who went out to suppress the bandits to express their condolences.

Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky reiterated his criticism of the Security Council's rejection of Outer Mongolia's application to join the United Nations during the UN General Assembly's debate on UN membership. In reiterating his criticism, Vyshinsky again made the Soviet Union's previous accusation that "Outer Mongolia did not invade China, but China invaded Outer Mongolia."

### American Newspaper Discusses US Policy Toward China

(Continued from Page One) He stated: Although in reality, Stilwell was removed from his command in order to keep China fighting against Japan, and although there is ample evidence to prove that the Soviet Union intends to use the Chinese Communists to gain control of all of Asia, American policy remains unchanged. Vance said: The crisis in Sino-American relations at the time of the Stilwell incident arose from the first public attack on the Chinese central government. This situation is still ongoing. At the end of July 1945, the US Army Department ordered the re-appointed General Wedemeyer to review a plan for the US Army to land ten divisions north of the Yangtze River to establish contact with the Communist forces and equip the Communist troops. The proponent of this plan was Stilwell, then commander of the US Tenth Army on Okinawa. Fortunately for China, the war was nearing its end. If this plan had been implemented, it might have handed the lower reaches of the Yangtze River over to the Communist forces, and the red flag would be flying over Nanjing today. Simultaneously with Vance, an article by LaMoore was also published in the Howard newspaper chain. According to the article, in 1944, Marshall fully supported Stilwell in the conflict between Stilwell and Chairman Chiang. He stated: An American officer who had met with Marshall reportedly said that two years later, when Marshall arrived in China with a mission from the US President, he found that former Chief of Staff Marshall's views on Chairman Chiang and his regime were still largely the same as Stilwell's.

### Qingxin Highway to Open Next Month

[Central News Agency Lanzhou 18th Dispatch] The Qingxin Highway, an important national defense transportation artery in the Northwest that traverses the Qaidam Basin and is 1,221 kilometers long, can be fully completed and open to traffic in the middle of next month. The eastern section of the road was built by the Qinghai Provincial Government and was completed in September of this year. Trial runs have already been conducted. This section runs from Mangnai on the western edge of the Qaidam Basin to Hongliugou in southern Xinjiang, connecting with the southern Xinjiang road. This section, which is over 360 kilometers long, was built by the Sixth District Highway Bureau starting in June of this year. More than 1,000 laborers were mobilized along the entire line, and a battalion of engineers equipped with modern road rollers participated. After entering winter, the weather at the construction site is extremely cold. The work progresses more actively. The cold air makes it impossible to sleep peacefully at night.

### Government Employees to Receive Subsidized Cotton Cloth from Zhongfang for Winter Clothing

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 18th Dispatch] As the allocation of cotton cloth from Zhongfang Company for winter clothing for government employees is about to begin, the company has telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to inquire whether the prices should remain at 1,700 yuan per foot for blue cloth and 1,300 yuan per foot for uniforms as stipulated in the supply plan. The Ministry has replied by telegram that the prices should be handled in accordance with the prices stipulated in the supply plan and has ordered that the cloth be shipped to Beijing for distribution as soon as possible. Furthermore, the allocation of cloth to government employees in the Beijing-Shanghai area was originally stipulated to be twice a year, once in summer and once in winter. Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has determined that this method is not effectively coordinated with the seasonal needs, so it plans to add one allocation each in spring and autumn at a fixed quantity and at a fair price. Each government agency and school (limited to the number of people listed in the budget or payroll) must submit a clear list of employees and purchase colored cloth, wool fabric, shirts, undershirts, socks, and towels from Zhongfang Company and its authorized institutions at a fixed quantity and at a fair price to supplement their clothing. This additional allocation will be made at a fair price, and no subsidies need to be allocated from the national treasury.

At the end of his speech, Thorrend reported the following statistics on the Swiss printing industry: 1,200 general printing plants, 80 lithography plants, and 22 intaglio photogravure plants, with a total of 21,000 employees.

The country has a population of over 3 million, and there are as many as six universities, each with more than 2,000 students. The printing industry, especially the printing of maps, is particularly famous. Although Switzerland has 25 cantons, and the races and languages are diverse, their spirit of unity is admirable. Switzerland is the most democratic, freest, and happiest country in the world today, and its various industries not only did not suffer from the ravages of war during wartime, but also made brilliant progress. He believed that this exhibition would surely have an impact in China and promote cultural exchange. After Zhu's speech in Chinese, he translated it into German.

### Methodist Church Announces 100 Years of Concise History

[Central News Agency Fuzhou 18th Dispatch] According to the concise history announced by the Methodist Church of China, as follows: The Methodist Church was founded by the Englishman John Wesley and later spread to the Americas. In 1783, it separated from the British mother church and established an independent American church, named the Methodist Episcopal Church, meaning those who follow the rules. In 1835, the Wesleyan University decided to establish a Chinese branch plan. On May 15, 1847, the first batch of missionaries, Reverend Collins and Mr. and Mrs. White, came to China from Boston Harbor by sailing ship. After more than 150 days of voyage, they arrived in Fuzhou on September 6 of the same year and established a preaching and medical center in Zhongzhou.

### Representative Zhang Zizhu to Attend International Trade Conference Flies to America Today En Route to Cuba to Deliver Speech Elaborating on Conference Significance and Our Position

[From Our City Desk] The International Trade and Employment Conference is scheduled to commence on the 21st in Havana, the capital of Cuba. Our chief representative, Jin Wensi, has already departed from New York to attend. Representative Zhang Fuyun departed from Shanghai on the 15th. Representative Zhang Zizhu (Political Vice Minister of Economic Affairs), along with advisors Liu Pengjiu, Wang Xuelian, specialists Yu Wenhao, Mao Liyu, and secretary Lu Jiuxuan, a party of seven, are scheduled to fly to America via a China National Aviation Corporation plane this afternoon at 4:45 PM, and then proceed to Cuba. On the 18th, Mr. Zhang issued a written statement regarding the significance of the International Trade and Employment Conference and our country's position, as follows:

International trade and international economic issues are of profound significance to the peaceful coexistence of all mankind. Although the causes of the two previous World Wars were very complex, international economic issues were undeniably one of the main reasons. Therefore, the purpose of the former League of Nations and the current Trade and Employment Conference convened in Havana, the capital of Cuba, is to establish norms for international trade through the establishment of an international trade organization, in the hope that countries will engage in trade harmoniously and exchange what they have for what they lack. Although the formal initiation of this Trade and Employment Conference was proposed by the U.S. government at the end of the year before last, its basic principles had already been decided in the Atlantic Charter and the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. All governments have understood that if countries adopt excessive protectionist measures such as tariff barriers, which lead to commercial and economic competition, there will be no hope for universal prosperity in the world economy. The U.S. government, based on established principles, proposed a draft charter for an international trade organization in the spring of last year. The United Nations Economic and Social Council convened meetings in London from October to December last year and in Geneva from April to October this year, with representatives from the U.S., Britain, France, Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, India (including Pakistan in the second meeting), Lebanon, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, and South Africa (the Soviet Union was absent), a total of eighteen countries, holding two preparatory meetings. Our government has participated in both. In principle, our country has always supported international cooperation and actively promoted all systems of international coordination. However, because our country's war of resistance lasted longer than that of any other Allied nation, and the damage we suffered was also the most severe, the issues of economic recovery and reconstruction after the war are particularly serious. While seeking avenues for international cooperation, we must also carefully consider these realities and reserve appropriate space for our future economic development. This position, I believe, will also be understood by friendly nations. The number of participating countries in this Cuban conference is greater than before, and the issues may be more complex. However, our delegation will continue to seek international cooperation while taking into account the economic development of our own country, and continue to negotiate. I also firmly believe that all governments, based on the spirit of coordination, will achieve a satisfactory outcome.

Two UN General Assembly Protocols Signed by Our Representative Zhang Pengchun

It was also decided that representatives of the member states would sign these protocols at this session of the General Assembly. The signing ceremony will be held on the 11th, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to be forwarded to the National Government, specially appointing Zhang Pengchun as the plenipotentiary representative for signing the respective protocols.

Editorial

### Cherish Your Vote!

The nationwide general election, which is attracting worldwide attention, will begin on the 21st of this month. The three million voters in our city will also begin voting after the whistle blows at dawn on that day to elect representatives to the National Assembly. This general election is a groundbreaking event in our country's politics, and it is also the first step in our country's implementation of constitutional government. According to the provisions of our new Constitution, the National Assembly is in fact the highest organ of constitutional government in our country, with the power to elect and recall the President and Vice President of the head of state, and the power to amend the fundamental law of the country, the Constitution. Therefore, the responsibility of the first National Assembly under constitutional government is particularly significant. The representatives to the National Assembly will be produced by this general election. Whether the representatives chosen by each voter when casting their sacred vote are appropriate is of great importance to the future of our country's democratic politics. As the Western proverb says, "Be cautious in the initial planning of affairs." A good beginning will make it easy to achieve twice the results with half the effort; conversely, it will lead to half the results with twice the effort. Therefore, on the eve of the time when hundreds of millions of voters across the country will exercise their most sacred right to vote for the first time in the initial period of constitutional government, all parties and factions in the country hope that all voters will cherish their sacred vote, neither abandoning it lightly nor allowing themselves to be manipulated by others. In order to ensure that citizens thoroughly understand the significance of this general election, the authorities in our city are holding a publicity meeting on the eve of the start of voting, so as to explain to citizens the role of the first general election and the methods and procedures for voting. We believe that today's publicity meeting will be of great benefit to the conduct of the general election in our city.

Shanghai is the largest commercial port in our country, and it is the center of the country in terms of both economy and culture. In this general election, it naturally occupies a very important position, not only attracting international attention, but also every move of its citizens is sufficient to set a precedent for the whole country. Therefore, the atmosphere of the general election in Shanghai can directly and indirectly affect the political climate of the whole country. Looking at the current situation of people from all walks of life in Shanghai running for election, although it cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory, the open and democratic methods adopted by some candidates for election, if emulated by everyone, can establish a good atmosphere for election. What is especially commendable is that in the tide of elections, we have heard that many military and political dignitaries and social notables, because they have other important tasks or social relief undertakings that need them to be responsible for handling, have resolutely given up running for election. This spirit of humility and deference has added a lot of color to this general election.

This general election is still a groundbreaking event in our country's politics, and it is the first attempt for hundreds of millions of voters across the country to vote. As the saying goes, "Climbing high begins from low." We certainly cannot guarantee that the first general election will perfectly achieve the ideal of "selecting the virtuous and capable," but in any case, we ultimately hope that hundreds of millions of voters across the country will be able to especially cherish their sacred vote and ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed. It must be known that citizens giving up voting is equivalent to giving up their right to be masters of the country, and it is also equivalent to failing to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens. Also, if they cast their votes arbitrarily, allow themselves to be manipulated by others, and treat the election as child's play without giving it the slightest consideration, then it is also political immorality. In today's China, since all parties and factions in the country unanimously advocate the implementation of constitutional government, this general election should be held seriously and strive to ensure that public opinion can be expressed. Only the Communist bandits who betray the country and harm the people want to sabotage the general election and prevent the Constitution of the Republic of China from being implemented as scheduled. We hope that the voters of our city, after hearing the whistle at dawn on the 21st, will be able to enthusiastically go to the polling places and cast their most sacred vote, which is responsible to the country.

Secondly, we have repeatedly expressed our opinions to the candidates running for election, and we have also advised them to pay special attention to the cultivation of democratic political ethics. Our country's implementation of constitutional government can be said to be still in the learning stage, and it is especially important to be cautious when holding general elections during this period. In the past few days, the debate over "party nomination" and "free election" has caused widespread discussion across the country. However, the central government still firmly adopted the method of party nomination, and the list of candidates has been announced one after another in the past few days. Although some candidates who failed to be nominated inevitably have grievances, we have always believed that the method of party nomination is the only way to conduct party elections. According to the examples of various democratic countries in Europe and America, parliamentary politics is party politics, and public opinion cannot be expressed without going through political parties. Therefore, party members only know that there is a political party when running for election, and they do not know that there is an individual, and everyone believes that the victory of the political party is the victory of the individual. For example, in the United States, when each state elects members of Congress, the general voters almost do not ask who the candidates are, but ask which party the candidate belongs to. The candidates are also nominated by the political party, and the speeches they give must also be about the policies of the political party, and candidates belonging to the same political party are never allowed to express conflicting views, let alone run freely for election separately. Our country is now also adopting this method, which does not violate democratic principles. Moreover, the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Youth Party have also nominated candidates through consultation, showing mutual humility and support, without any monopoly or domination, which is even more sufficient to demonstrate the spirit of full democracy.

In short, this general election is the first step for the people of our country to exercise the four powers. It is the first attempt, and mistakes are inevitable; but we ultimately hope to reduce them to the minimum. Our requirement for the general voters is that they especially cherish their vote, not give it up, and not cast it randomly; at the same time, we also require the candidates to adopt legal and democratic means to win the support of the voters with their political views and character, and not to bribe with money, let alone intimidate with power; otherwise, election disputes will inevitably emerge one after another. Today is already the 19th. Two days later, when the whistle blows, the voters of the whole city will begin to vote. We hope that hundreds of millions of voters across the country will cherish their vote!

### Truman's Domestic Economic Policy Receives Poor Response from U.S. Congress, Eaton Says Emergency Aid to Europe Plan Discussions Will Be Affected, Taft Insists Aid Should Be Given to Our Country

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Taft said in a radio address on the 18th, "From the viewpoint of preventing the spread of communism, the aid to Europe plan is necessary. If we do not change our policies in Germany and towards China, then this plan will not be very effective. Apparently, Marshall is unwilling to rescue China from communism at a very reasonable price, but instead allocates tens of billions of dollars to Western Europe." He also said that destroying factories in Germany is contrary to the European recovery plan.

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Republican presidential candidate Senator Taft tonight criticized Truman's proposal as "a further step towards complete dictatorship" and said that the president "wants to turn back the clock, wants to return to the wartime period, wants to restore price controls, the wartime Labor Board, and the wartime Production Board. He wants to manage prices to deal with producers, manage wages to deal with workers, restrict the consumption of goods to deal with housewives and restaurants, and various controls to deal with merchants. It is no different from establishing a Federal Administration, sending out hundreds of thousands of special agents to monitor the daily lives of thousands of people."

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman's thirty-minute speech to Congress today received almost no applause or cheers from the members present. According to House Republican Leader Halleck afterwards, the president said a few days ago that price controls were a method of a police state, but now he himself has put forward such a proposal. This shows the chaos and lack of direction of the government authorities, and the incompetence of the authorities in causing the current domestic situation. The result of implementing price controls in the past was reduced production, induced black markets, and shortages of goods. Congress has other concrete methods that can enable the country to avoid being placed under extreme political machinery. Congress will act in accordance with this policy. European diplomatic circles here have expressed warm welcome to the president's proposal, but they are deeply afraid that opposition to price controls in Congress will hinder consideration of the Marshall Aid to Europe plan. Republican Senator Bowles said: The president seems to want Congress to liquidate America's economic freedom in order to aid Europe. At the same time, the two largest labor unions in the United States, the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor, also expressed surprise at Truman's policy of limiting wages to the highest amount. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said: The president's proposal of a price control plan will shift attention away from the emergency aid to Europe plan, so it is expected that discussions on the foreign aid plan will be delayed.

### Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi Announces Decision to Expand Government Base, Criticizes Communist Party Actions Hindering Revival

[Associated Press Rome, 18th] A spokesman for the Christian Democratic Party today confirmed that Prime Minister De Gasperi is expanding his single-party government to include centrist and left-wing parties, but without the Communist Party. According to a report in a Communist Party organ, Togliatti, after De Gasperi's speech on the evening of the 17th, addressed a secret Communist Party meeting in Milan, stating, "If I win the election in March next year, the future can be peaceful, otherwise revolutionary action will be taken, which is an absolutely abstract plan and does not take into account the general development of our actions."

[Reuters Naples, 17th] In a speech at the national congress of the Christian Democratic Party, which he leads, Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi declared that the recent declaration by the Italian Communist Party demanding the overthrow of the government was a declaration of war. De Gasperi stressed, "The government is not a slave of the United States or the Vatican. I am neither a weakling nor a dictator. I will automatically resign after losing the majority support of Parliament, but I solemnly declare my determination not to abandon my post due to revolutionary movements. Italy must participate in the world's revival as a guarantee of peace and democracy. Now some people openly talk about civil war and the development of neo-fascism in Italy, but oppose every action of the government to maintain peace and freedom. The Italian Communist Party, led by Togliatti, and the far-left Socialist Party, led by Nenni, even hoard weapons privately. The disarmament of political parties is necessary. The country dreamed of by Togliatti and Nenni has Stalin's red star."

The Communist Party resolution mentioned by De Gasperi is said to have been issued by the Communist Party Executive Committee. Observers here believe that De Gasperi's statement that the Christian Democratic Party has no intention of governing alone implies that the cabinet will be changed to accommodate left-wing moderates, such as the Socialist Party led by Saragat.

### Xu Jizhuang Still Has Not Surrendered, His Wife and Others Suspected of Detention, Bank Director and Car Driver Detained for Further Investigation, Lawyer Zhang Yaoguang Released on Bail After Questioning

[This Newspaper Report] The corruption case against Xu Jizhuang, former Director of the Postal Savings Bureau, is currently being heard in the Criminal Court of the District Court after being prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office. However, Xu has not appeared despite being summoned. The police suddenly arrested Xu's wife, Xu Jinshanru, Cheng Tianru, the managing director of Zhenye Bank, lawyer Zhang Yaoguang, and car driver Cao Mingzhi on the 15th of this month. The development of this case has attracted the attention of the public. According to Sun Yuanfang, director of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police Bureau, "In this case, the police bureau was entrusted by the court to go to 22 Taishan Road on the 15th to arrest Xu, carrying a court warrant for the arrest of Xu Gangzhuang and a search warrant. Because it was too early, Xu himself was not there. In addition to Xu's wife, there were also Cheng Tianru and the other two. Because this case is of great importance, these four were arrested first, as they are suspected of hiding Xu Jizhuang. The next day was a Sunday, so it was postponed until the afternoon of the 17th when Xu's wife and others were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling on the charge of 'facilitating escape'." According to the reporter's investigation, the case was slightly questioned by Prosecutor Yu Yixin yesterday, and it was decided that a detailed investigation was still needed. Except for Zhang Yaoguang, who was released on bail, the rest were temporarily detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center.

Huang Guangyu, Chief Clerk of the District Court, and Wu Ronglin, the judge in charge of the case, issued a statement to reporters from various newspapers yesterday, saying: "Xu's wife was not transferred to the District Court by the police bureau. The court was completely unaware of the arrest of Xu's wife beforehand, did not entrust the Beijing Bureau to carry out the arrest, and did not send bailiffs to assist the police bureau, because Xu's wife has nothing to do with the postal savings bureau corruption case. The judge in charge did not issue a warrant for the arrest of Xu's wife, because Xu's wife is not a defendant in this case and is not involved in this case. The police bureau's arrest of Xu's wife may be another case. Xu Jizhuang did not surrender to the District Court, but submitted a statement stating the reasons why he could not appear in court for trial."

However, when the reporter inquired of the District Court President Zha Liangjian late last night, he confirmed that apart from lawyer Zhang Yaoguang who had been released on bail, Xu's wife and the other two were indeed in detention. President Zha stated that the statements made by Chief Clerk Huang and Judge Wu were not entirely factual, and that after the entire case had been reviewed today, the details would be released.

### Yang Wendao, Gu Zhuxuan, and Hu Boxiang Successively Withdraw from the Election

[This Newspaper Report] Since Chen Guofu announced his withdrawal from the city candidate, the public has followed suit, and many have also expressed their intention to concede: Yang Wendao, a patriotic figure who suffered ten years of unjust imprisonment due to the Zhongshan Hideuo incident involving Japanese sailors, specially wrote to the Shanghai Election Office yesterday, stating his withdrawal from the National Assembly election, and specially nominated Municipal Council Speaker Pan as a representative of the National Assembly. His original letter is as follows: "I, Wendao, have applied to be a candidate for the Shanghai City Regional Election for the National Assembly Representative. I have previously submitted the nomination and signature book in accordance with the law, requesting registration and publication as a candidate. I have recently learned that the Kuomintang stipulates that party members participating in the election must be nominated by the Party Central Committee. Wendao is a member of the Kuomintang and should follow the instructions of the Central Committee. I hereby specially write to state my withdrawal from the National Assembly Representative qualification. I hope you will take this into consideration and approve it." He also said: "Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan is an advanced member of our party and is the head of the municipal public opinion organ. He has been nominated by the Central Committee as a candidate for the Shanghai City Regional National Assembly Representative. I will change my request for the support of comrades who are running for my election to unanimously vote for Pan Gongzhan as the Shanghai City National Assembly Representative."

Gu Zhuxuan, who has 200,000 voters in the city, wrote to the election office stating his withdrawal from the National Assembly Representative election. The reporter specially visited Mr. Gu and inquired: "I have been in Shanghai for fifty years, and I have always done my best for local public welfare and the welfare of my fellow villagers. Since the war in northern Jiangsu, the refugees have been wandering. I am deeply saddened by what I have seen. The northeast wind has already started, and the refugees are suffering from hunger and cold. Relief work is even more urgent. I visited the mayor yesterday and there are concrete plans for winter relief and work relief, which need to be carried out urgently. Although I am loved by hundreds of thousands of fellow villagers and brothers and nominated as a candidate for the National Assembly Representative, I weigh the pros and cons and feel that it is more urgent and important to devote my full efforts to the urgent rescue of hundreds of thousands of refugees than to run for my own election. Moreover, the number of places in Shanghai is limited for this election, and there are so many candidates. After careful consideration, I decided to give way to the virtuous and capable. In fact, the obligations to the country and the nation are the same whether in or out of office. Giving up oneself to help others is even more of a contribution to society and fellow villagers. All of this is true, and the motivation is sincere. It is not to be different and attract attention or to fish for fame and praise. I hope that those who know me and love me will understand me."

Hu Boxiang, a well-known industrialist and painter in the city, has been promoting the national products movement all his life, and colleagues in the industrial sector have jointly nominated him as a candidate for the industrial and mining sector of the National Assembly Representative. According to Mr. Hu: "There are many talented people in the industrial sector, and he is very busy with his own affairs. He is also committed to studying art. He did not go through the nomination procedures in advance to formally obtain the qualifications of a candidate, so he withdrew from the election to give way to the virtuous and capable."

### Juvenile Police on Patrol: First Day Impression, Diners Laugh and Talk, Dignity Lost

[This Newspaper Report] The city's restaurant banquet economy inspection officially began yesterday. The inspection team consists of representatives from the police bureau, the social bureau, the Chinese cuisine industry, the Western cuisine industry, and the kitchen industry association, as well as 25 participating juvenile police officers. The city is divided into five districts: Huangpu, Laozha, Yimiao, Taishan, and Hongkou. Yesterday, the juvenile police encountered some difficulties in the inspection: 1. Representatives from the industry association accompanied the inspection, and the restaurants were prepared in advance. 2. Three diners in a restaurant needed 116,000 yuan to add a scrambled egg. Although it did not exceed the 120,000 yuan limit, the price limit or regulations seem to need further research and modification. 3. Foreign wine is prohibited, but the restaurant removes the foreign labels and mixes it with domestic wine, which is difficult to distinguish. The responsible parties are reviewing these difficulties and are trying to improve them.

### Speaker Continues to Make Campaign Speeches, Appeals for All Refugees, The Fundamental Way to Save Refugees Should Be to Sincerely Implement Constitutional Government

[This Newspaper Report] Municipal Council Speaker Pan visited various preserves in the Yulin District yesterday afternoon. He delivered a campaign speech at Jingzhou Road Elementary School at 3:00 PM, and the audience of more than a thousand people was very enthusiastic. Pan first said: "Since the victorious restoration of the city, the promotion of local autonomy has been going on for two years, and the autonomous organization of district preserves and guards has gradually been completed. However, the current municipal autonomy law has not yet been enacted, and the work of household registration, land administration, roads, guards, and education has not yet reached the ideal standards. City government officials have not yet been elected by the people. Therefore, speaking of the city's autonomy, we must still wait for the continuous promulgation of government laws and the continuous labor of local autonomous personnel. The reason why the autonomy work has not been accelerated is because society has not been stable." The number of refugees coming to Shanghai is estimated to be 200,000, which has formed a serious social security problem in the city. Therefore, I am here today to appeal for all refugees.

### So-Called Refugees Are Not Born

So-called refugees are not born, but because the communists are making trouble, they cannot live and work in peace in their hometowns, and they have no choice but to leave their homes. They have withdrawn to Shanghai from northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and other places. Therefore, saving refugees should be our common responsibility. The city is currently launching winter relief work, hoping to help the 200,000 refugees who have come to Shanghai to overcome this difficult winter. This is very important, and I hope everyone will contribute. But what I am appealing for is not only this palliative relief. We must further make fundamental attempts to find out the cause of the refugees and use what method to "eliminate the cause of the refugees." Otherwise, refugees will not only come continuously, and it will be impossible to save them all, but even the citizens of Shanghai may become refugees.

### Direct and Indirect Reasons

There are two reasons for the occurrence of refugees. First, the communists' rebellion. Second, the lack of clarity in politics. If, when the country was victorious, the communists did not rely on their international background to collude with the bandits and rebel, but worked with the government to promote the country's revival, then the country could immediately achieve good governance, and the people's livelihoods could also be stabilized. It is hateful that the communists use brutal or coercive means to deal with the people, but we must also reflect on whether government officials are all clean and self-disciplined, and whether everything they do is "what the people like." Therefore, the direct reason for the occurrence of refugees is the communist rebellion, and the indirect reason is the lack of clarity in politics. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek announced to us that we must both suppress the rebellion and implement the constitution. This is the fundamental way for us to eliminate the cause of refugees. If we want to save refugees and not become refugees ourselves, then we should sincerely implement constitutional government.

### Brief Speech at Chung Cheng Park

Finally, Chairman Pan explained that the exercise of suffrage is the main key to the nation's implementation of democratic constitutionalism, hoping that citizens will not despise or abandon it, and should cherish their vote. He also stated that he has now been ordered by the Kuomintang Central Committee to be a candidate for Shanghai mayor, because the Central Committee believes that he has served in Shanghai for decades and should be able to gain the trust of local people, and still hopes that Shanghai citizens will elect him based on their care and familiarity. After Mr. Pan finished his speech, he immediately rushed to Chung Cheng Park. In the piercing cold wind, the crowd gathered in the square still numbered over ten thousand. The chairman, seeing that the drizzle was getting heavier, gave only a brief and to-the-point few-minute speech. The audience applauded thunderously, and they began to disperse after a quarter of an hour. Furthermore, Liu Suiming, the president of the Military Servicemen's Friends Association, yesterday specially brought the association's performers to perform recreational programs to subsidize the event.

### Central Training Students Send Letters and Telegrams in Support

Today at 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM, Chairman Pan will deliver campaign speeches to citizens in the North Sichuan Road District and Hongkou District at the Cultural Hall. In addition, the Shanghai Alumni Association of the Central Training Corps, in order to promote non-partisanship and assist alumni in their election campaigns, has sent letters to all alumni, urging them to mobilize their relatives and friends to support the regional national representatives who have registered with the association: Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Qian Dajun, Jiang Huaishu, and other alumni, in order to meet public expectations. It is heard that alumni letters and telegrams have been pouring in lately, expressing their support. In addition, more than twenty people from vocational groups such as Shui Xiangyun, Wang Yeyu, Fan Cai Kui, and Zhao Banfu are also investigating and assisting.

### Fang Zhi Delivers Election Speeches at Two Locations

Fang Zhi, the candidate for national representative in this city and the chairman of the Kuomintang municipal party headquarters, delivered a campaign speech to over two thousand citizens in the North Station District at the Tianchan Road Hebei Grand Theater at 10:00 AM yesterday.

### Supplementary Measures for Conserving Electricity: Tailor Shops Also Receive Preferential Treatment, Similar to Important Fences; Foreigners with Passports Are Not Restricted

[Our Newspaper Report] After the announcement of the measures for conserving electricity in this city, the Public Utilities Bureau, believing that there were still shortcomings, specially drafted supplementary provisions and general rules for the electricity conservation measures, which have been approved by the recent Electricity Supply Review Committee and will be implemented immediately. The full text of the provisions is extracted below:

For those houses with multiple electricity meters installed, if they do not have the same account name, they should be calculated separately.

The user's account name shall be based on the original registered account name. Any transfer of account must be processed after investigation by the company. Except for changes in the type of electricity use, the standard for the quantity of electricity used shall not be changed due to the account transfer application.

The electricity conservation fine has been approved by the Municipal Council and shall be collected at 10% of the public utility surtax.

Reward money will not be paid for fines temporarily, and the handling fee will be decided based on the actual expenses after implementation. The expenses can be paid in installments over several months.

For new users who installed electricity after June 1st of this year but before the implementation of the restriction measures, the limit shall be the highest electricity consumption in the first two months of use. For new users installed after the implementation of the restriction measures, the standard shall be 40 degrees uniformly. In special circumstances, an application can be made to the Electricity Supply Review Committee for an increase.

For those who move, the limit should be transferred along with the move.

Public street lights are not restricted. U.S. military diplomatic groups and UNRRA are not restricted, but they must not use electric stoves. Foreigners with passports shall be treated in the same manner.

Public utilities and important military service agencies, such as telegraph, gas, ferry, public bus, tap water, customs, aviation, fire, police, military police, garrison headquarters, and other offices, may use the highest electricity consumption in one year (from November 35 to October 36) as the limit. If the above-mentioned agencies need to increase due to business expansion, the company shall first investigate and then submit it to the Electricity Supply Review Committee for approval.

For small industrial users whose production is related to electricity use, such as tailor shops, the highest electricity consumption in one year may be used as the limit.

### Leng Shan Submits Defense in Xiao Ling's Suicide Case; Watching Plays and Night Outings Cannot Prove Enticement; Zhang Chunfan Has No Right to Sue

[Our Newspaper Report] In the suicide case of Yue opera actress Xiao Dan Gui, Zhang Chunfan, based on Article 1123, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code, accused Leng Shan of obstructing freedom, enticement, and other crimes in his capacity as the head of the family. It is learned that Leng Shan has drafted a defense statement, pointing out that Zhang Chunfan, after being prosecuted for instigating suicide, was heavily criticized by society and tried to shift the target of public opinion, thus making false accusations in the hope of reducing his own guilt. He also stated that Zhang is Xiao Ling's maternal uncle (as evidenced by the Lao Zha District household registration book), who is a collateral blood relative within the fifth degree of kinship to Xiao Ling, and has no right to sue according to law, requesting dismissal. As for the points accused by Zhang, Leng Shan's defense is as follows:

When "Qin Huai Yue" was staged, Leng Shan was filming the movie "Machine Embroidered Jiangshan" in Suzhou. Leng Shan was not the screenwriter or director of "Qin Huai Yue," as evidenced by the prospectus.

The reason for borrowing the mailbox to communicate with Xiao was that Leng Shan often left Shanghai to film movies. During his departure from Shanghai, he communicated with Cathay actors to discuss theatrical issues, and there was no act of enticement. Zhang cannot provide evidence either.

The indictment mentioned watching plays and night outings, and enticement for adultery. Checking out movies together is common, and it is absurd to use this as evidence of enticement.

As for the phone calls with Xiao, they were even more common. The narrative method in the indictment clearly has the intention of fabricating a trap.

The indictment claimed that Shen Yitao had a secret talk at the request of the defendant a few hours before Xiao's suicide, which is completely unfounded. It is found that Shen and the plaintiff are close friends, while the defendant is not familiar with them. As for the claim that the defendant moved his family to avoid punishment after Xiao's suicide, it is even more fabricated. The defendant has lived in Julu Road for five years and has never moved, as evidenced by his household registration, which is not difficult to verify.

### Percentage Increase in Public Utility Prices

[Our Newspaper Report] The price adjustment table for public utilities in this city has been initially reviewed and approved by the Public Utilities Bureau and has been submitted to the National Economic Commission for approval. It will be implemented as soon as it is approved. It is estimated that the price increase date will not exceed the end of this month. The detailed percentage increase is as follows:

Electricity: Shanghai Electric Power Company will increase by 72%, French Electric Power Company will increase by 65%, and Zhabei, Huashang, Pudong, and other companies will increase by 75%.

Tap Water: British and French tap water companies will increase by 108%, and inland, Zhabei, and Pudong companies will increase by 115%.

Gas: All will increase by 90%.

Telephone: Will increase by 55% to 75%.

### Reason for Sudden Cold Weather: Cold Air Mass Invasion

[Our Newspaper Report] According to the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory yesterday: The climate in this city will become colder today. Yesterday's temperature will drop from 55 degrees Fahrenheit to 51.7 degrees Fahrenheit, and today it may reach 40 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. The reason for the sudden change in climate is that a Siberian cold air mass has invaded Central China in recent days, causing the sunny and harmonious weather of the past few weeks to change into cold, humid, and overcast weather.

### Charity Horse Racing Actively Underway; General Association Investigates Horses and Jockeys; The Final Problem Lies with the U.S. Military

[Our Newspaper Report] Since the Municipal Council passed the Winter Relief Association's proposal to hold a winter charity horse race to raise relief funds, there has been much speculation about whether the horse race can be realized. According to reporters, the matter is actively underway. The Jockey Club, in order to know in detail how many horses are currently available for racing on the member side and how many members are willing to participate as jockeys, yesterday sent a notice to all members with a horse form and a jockey registration form attached, requesting them to fill it out and return it for research. According to people familiar with the horse racing industry, there should be no problem with horses and jockeys if a charity race is held this winter. Although many horses were lost before the war, about one hundred and fifty horses can be collected at present for regular competitions. This number is not difficult, but the level will be slightly worse than before the war. Therefore, whether the horse race can be realized will depend on two other major issues:

Whether the U.S. military can agree to cede a portion of the clubhouse site it has leased. This matter is currently being negotiated with the U.S. military authorities by the municipal government and is the most important prerequisite for realizing the horse race.

The duration of the horse racing season. If a lot of effort is spent on preparing and practicing, and only one or two horse races are held, neither the Jockey Club nor the horse owners will be willing to do so. Conversely, if a horse racing season of three to four months can be given, it is expected that people interested in this field will be enthusiastic about participating.

### Zhang Guizhang Wanted for Embezzling Comfort Money

[Our Newspaper Report] In the case of Zhang Guizhang, the head of the volunteer troop in the Fifth Bao of the Xuhui District of this city, who embezzled and committed fraud during the conscription of volunteer soldiers, the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau has issued an order to arrest the fugitive. The original order stated: "According to the reports from Mo Jing and Chen Zhili, volunteer soldiers of the Fifth Bao of Xuhui District, Zhang Guizhang, the head of the troop of the Fifth Bao of Xuhui District, forged receipts and embezzled 7 million yuan of comfort money from each of the soldiers. It is requested to investigate the matter. According to the investigation report, Mo Jing and Chen Zhili, two volunteer soldiers of the Fifth Bao of Xuhui District, were introduced by Zhang Guizhang, the head of the troop. It was agreed in advance that the volunteer soldiers' comfort money would be 6 million yuan, plus the 10 million yuan subsidy for resettlement fees from the Municipal Military Service Association. However, it was found that the bao spent 10 million yuan on comfort money for each, while the volunteer soldiers' families only received 5.95 million and 5.85 million yuan respectively, and the money was all collected by Zhang Guizhang, as reported. An arrest warrant should be issued. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the district chief to instruct his subordinates to investigate, arrest, and send the suspect to be investigated."

### Lianyungang in Hibernation

[Special Dispatch from Lianyungang, December 12th] After the victory, Lianyungang, Donghai, and Bayun became isolated islands. This mouth of the Longhai Railway has been deserted for a long time. The reporter, feeling the light cold of late autumn, sat on the "automatic express train" that was not powered by coal but by a car engine, from Xinpu to Lianyungang City. I climbed to the top of the mountain, breathed the ocean air, and stepped on this only good port between Shanghai and Qingdao.

### Old Kiln Chisel Mountains and Fill Seas

Lianyungang was originally a mountainous area by the sea, locally known as Lao Yao. To this day, many foreign merchant ships do not know Lianyungang and only know Lao Yao. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Longhai Railway Bureau suggested building a port. Thus, in the spring of the 24th year, this desolate Lao Yao began a great project of chiseling mountains and filling seas. Until the outbreak of the war, it already had good construction. As the flames of the Anti-Japanese War spread to Central China, the port personnel of Lianyungang began to evacuate and were ordered to destroy the port facilities. Speaking of this matter, the current Director of the Port Affairs Office, Mr. Yang Xiangian, happily told the reporter: After the destruction, he regretted not being thorough, but thinking about it today, he was fortunate not to have completely destroyed it. Otherwise, how could there be such great strength to resume restoration?

Accompanied by Engineer Hu Zhishi, I visited the pier, where I saw many rusty iron bridges and many broken machines lying on the beach. These are all the relics of the destruction before the war.

### Remains of Three Docks

During the enemy's occupation, some engineering work was also rebuilt. There are now three docks, all left by the enemy. The first dock is next to the breakwater, with wooden piles underneath. Because there is a small insect in the sea that specializes in eating wood, the wooden piles have rotted over the years. To avoid danger, the port office has removed the first dock. The second and third docks are currently more convenient to use. These two docks are relatively strong, with half of the piles made of cement.

Before the war, Lianyungang's highest annual throughput reached 5 million tons, one-sixth of the throughput of Shanghai Port. Currently, its main task is to export Huai salt. On the day I went, two ships were loading salt, which was being transported to the Anhui area. However, after the opening of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in the future, Huai salt will not be transported by sea. What business will Lianyungang do then? This is a fear in the heart of the current port office. --Even though the opening of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway still needs to wait for some time. They eagerly hope that the Zhongxing Coal Mine will resume operations as soon as possible, and that the entire Longhai Line will be opened as soon as possible. Lianyungang is still preparing to be the mouth of the Great Northwest.

To the north of Lianyungang, the Linhongkou water carries silt into the sea. Thus, due to the rising tide, a little gift is delivered to Lianyungang every day. The silt that increases daily is enough to bother the port office. There are currently two dredgers tasked with dredging. And the coal needed for these two dredgers is a problem. The day before yesterday, it was finally easy to load 1,000 tons of coal from Taiwan, which temporarily relieved the port office. They could not help but feel a little emotional when they thought of the two coal-turning machines that could transport 400 tons of coal per hour before the war.

### Breakwater and Silt Prevention

The port of Lianyungang currently has two breakwaters. The first, located in the south, is approximately 1.5 kilometers long. The second, located in the north, is semi-circular and was built by the Japanese, with a length of approximately 3.3 kilometers. However, they only provide breakwater protection and do not prevent silt accumulation. Therefore, under the design of a Dutch engineer, a grand plan was devised. The plan involves constructing a wide breakwater from Xugou directly to Xilian Island, thereby simultaneously preventing waves and silt. Subsequently, the inner side of Xilian Island would be leveled and reclaimed from the sea, with six docks built on both the north and south shores. Additionally, railway tracks would be laid on the northern breakwater to enable direct loading and unloading of goods. While the plan is commendable, current conditions may not permit its implementation. Furthermore, whether the completed construction can be fully utilized remains a question.

Recently, Director Yang informed me that he only desires a simpler plan. First, to raise the southern breakwater because, during high tide, seawater from outside the port can still invade the port. Second, to rebuild the first dock. Third, to complete the second dock, making it entirely of concrete piles. This plan alone requires a budget of over 160 billion. He plans to build ten docks on the southern shore within five years.

### Hope for the Xugou Plain

Lianyungang is almost entirely mountainous. The few small plains that exist were carved out during the construction of the port, as stones were needed. Therefore, future urban development is unlikely. Only Xugou, to the north, is a large plain and still offers hope. After the victory, due to the presence of bandits, Suyun City became an isolated island. The railway was not open, and the Xuhai Highway was washed out. Restoration of traffic only occurred at the end of last month, and the traffic is still dominated by military vehicles. Few ships come from Shanghai. Rice sells for 1.8 million per 320 jin, and Qingdao merchants are also collecting goods here. Other items, such as cigarettes, are at least twice as expensive as in other parts of northern Jiangsu. Newspapers from Beijing and Shanghai are transferred from Qingdao, arriving approximately once every week or two. Consequently, news becomes history.

### Railway Bureau Takes Over the Port

The reporter went to visit the municipal government, but the mayor had gone to Shanghai, and the secretary had strolled off to Xuzhou. The people of the Lianyungang municipal government also felt frustrated. They said that, according to regulations, the port should be managed by the municipal government. Now it is managed by the Railway Bureau, so the Port Affairs Bureau cannot be established, and there is no discussion of any construction.

In addition, during his inspection in Suyun Port, Zhang Xiang, the head of the Huaihai Pacification Area Inspection Group, received an anonymous letter of accusation.

It is expected that the competition will be even more intense in the future. A women's group will be formed this year, but it seems difficult for Chinese women to form independent teams. Most of them will be the targets of competition for foreign women. The Sports Federation and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce have the strongest lineups.

The Shanghai Tennis Club has built two indoor courts to promote badminton, which will be completed soon. The ground is being repaired these days. The establishment of this court will provide a place for badminton enthusiasts to practice and will greatly help promote the badminton skills of the Chinese people.

Registration will be sent to last year's participating teams and schools in this city starting tomorrow. The committee has borrowed the Municipal Stadium and set up three courts, which have been painted and completed, which is enough for the league and future open tournaments, so there is no problem with the venue.

The league is divided into Group A, Group B, and the Women's Group. The champion of Group A last year was won by the Chinese team led by Pan Youyuan, and Group B was won by Yucai. There will be more teams participating this season than last year, especially many foreign teams.

### Chinese Stocks Plunge Mid-Session, Rebounding Remarkably Near Closing

Chinese stocks took a dramatic turn yesterday. Initially, due to the settlement of cotton and sugar, credit became tight, and various parties once took profits, leading to a mid-session decline. However, positive news in the evening report helped buying sentiment, and securities brokers went all out, leading to a remarkable rebound near the closing.

The rest suffered slight declines. Among deferred delivery stocks, Dong Xing rose slightly, Xin He and American Asia Xin Guang each fell by 5%, and the rest suffered small declines.

There were those who took the opportunity to sell deferred and spot delivery at high prices, and the price once fell back to $325 and $326. The black market outside the market soared, and there were also rumors of Mr. Ma's resignation. The market aggressively bought spot Wing On Yarn, and before the closing, it soared to a high price of $334 for spot delivery and $335 for deferred delivery, and then closed at $332 and $334. As a result, compared to the morning close, American Asia Match Xin Guang Jing Fu rose by 5% for spot delivery, Zhabei rose by over 10%, Jinglun rose by 15%, Yong Gong Underwear fell slightly, and Xin Yi, Hua Feng, Rong Feng, Shang Ping, and the rest rose slightly.

[Another Report] The British pound, Hong Kong dollar, and Indian rupee have been adjusted and increased several times in a row, which proves that the government has launched large-scale trade with the British pound area. Recently, a large amount of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and other products from our country have been shipped to the British pound area, and they are very popular among the local residents. Currently, the domestic production is not enough. If the production is increased, and domestic sales are further reduced, and exports are increased, it will help the government absorb a portion of foreign exchange to balance the income and expenditure of the Foreign Exchange Fund. The US exchange rate has been quite stable recently. General import and export merchants and others who hold foreign exchange are taking a wait-and-see attitude, believing that the government will open up free foreign exchange.

### Dyeing and Weaving Factories and Merchant Guilds Absorb Yarn and Cloth, Creating New High Prices; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn Rises Another 2.8 Million

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw insufficient supply in Shanghai, and private yarn factories exchanged yarn for flowers with India, increasing the demand for cotton yarn.

At the close, yarn prices reached new highs. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn soared to 43.6 million, a sharp increase of 2.8 million compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn continued to rise by 890,000 to 1.78 million.

The cotton cloth market was stimulated by the influx of floating capital into Shanghai and the loose credit of merchant guilds. The market saw bullish sentiment. Industry players, in view of the situation, aggressively covered short positions. 12-pound faucet and other grades of fine cloth once again created unprecedented high prices, seeing sharp increases ranging from 50,000 to 105,000 yuan compared to the previous day. About 30 to 40 pieces were traded. Serge saw a large number of chips, and trading was smooth, rising by 35,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths also mostly trended firm.

### Tong Jiling, Deputy Director of the Textile Adjustment Committee, Takes Office; Promoting Joint Distribution Requires Government-Business Cooperation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tong Jiling, Deputy Director of the Textile Adjustment Committee, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and took office in the afternoon. Regarding the joint distribution of cotton yarn, he told reporters that the government authorities attach great importance to it, believing that if yarn factories can cooperate with the government, the implementation of joint distribution will be promoted smoothly, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve results. Therefore, the government authorities have accepted and considered the eight opinions proposed by the Textile Association. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has hired experts to study them and will submit them to the full economic meeting this Thursday for discussion and decision, and then submit them to the Executive Yuan for review and decision before implementation. As for the pricing of cotton yarn and cloth, cotton has already begun to be implemented, and yarn and cloth can be resolved smoothly after the joint distribution method is determined. The association can also accept and consider the yarn merchants' request for yarn allocation. As for the detailed methods, they can also be resolved smoothly after the entire joint distribution method is determined. In addition, the committee may adopt the request of the replication industry to participate in the Cotton Yarn Allocation Committee in the future.

### The National Bank Authorities Say That the Rumors of 50,000 Yuan Banknotes Are Completely Absurd

["United" Credit News] There have been rumors in the market recently about the issuance of 50,000 yuan banknotes, which has affected some commodity prices. According to a responsible person at the Central Bank, this is another absurd rumor. As of today, there has been no news about the issuance or non-issuance of large banknotes. Under the current economic situation and the situation of the Communist bandits creating chaos, coupled with the fact that the US loan has not yet been specifically decided, rumors have become a tool for speculators. It is still hoped that legitimate businessmen will not be misled.

### The Arrival and Sales of Rice Are Steady

Yesterday, a total of 20,800 shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets. Digestion was average, the source of supply was abundant, and the market was still trending towards a steady pattern. Japonica rice was fluctuating, Indica rice was firm, and Bai Xian Yuan stood firm. The North Ocean wheat flour saw active sales.

### Rayon Continues to Rise; Factory Silk and Silk Goods Both Showed Firmness Yesterday

Yesterday, the rayon market continued its upward trajectory. The 120s, 1A, "Xu" character, with luster, immediately jumped over the 100 million yuan mark, reaching an additional 3 million yuan. However, due to the excessive price, few inquired. It once dropped to 1 million yuan with a transaction. At noon, the asking price remained at 3 million yuan. In the afternoon, it slightly weakened, with the final asking price at 2 million yuan, still 500,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The price of 4A Cambodian silk stood around 95 million yuan.

Factory Silk

The market was thriving yesterday, boosted by the high price of rayon, which invigorated people's spirits. The asking prices for all grades of five-dan head silk were generally 4 million to 5 million yuan higher than the previous day. Medium-grade additional dan silk was traded at 70 million yuan, and high-grade additional dan silk was traded at 72 million yuan. Tiger stove silk was also traded at 66 million yuan. The price increase for dried spun silk was slower yesterday, with special grade additional dan silk priced at around 51 million yuan.

Yesterday, the market followed the rise in raw materials. Silk quilt covers rose by 1.4 million yuan. Goods from Dazheng and Huaqiang opened at 26 million yuan, immediately rising to 6.5 million yuan.

However, the market price is 1.6 million yuan. Adding transportation costs of 1 million yuan, the purchase price in Shanghai indicates significant losses for exported tung oil, making it increasingly difficult. Consequently, the Hong Kong market is performing well, with London barrel oil at £205 per long ton C&F. According to pig bristle merchants speaking to reporters yesterday, the current prices for various grades of pig bristles are: Tianjin improved #55 at 38 million yuan per customs dan, #26 at 31 million yuan, Chongqing bristles (Yu price) at 18.5 million yuan, Shanghai bristles at 16 million yuan, and no market for Hankou bristles.

The Central Bank's Discount Committee held its 122nd regular meeting yesterday and approved 25 industrial loans totaling 7.44 billion yuan.

The Textile Monthly, published by the China Textile Institute, has been revamped in terms of content, starting with volume 8, issue 26. This issue is a special edition on the China Textile Machinery Company and includes multiple articles on domestically produced textile machinery.

Correction

A letter from the United Credit Information Service states: Upon review, the news released by this office on the 17th, "Rumors of Foreign Exchange Balancing Committee's Dissolution are Inaccurate," omitted the phrase "according to a certain economic authority" under the section "no changes whatsoever." Furthermore, "Mr. So-and-so" was mistakenly written as "Mr. Shen." Please correct accordingly.

Spring and Autumn

### On the Moving Quality of Literary and Artistic Works

— Feng Lai

"The real story is within the cover of a book, not so much in the reader's heart." This is a maxim by English literary critic, V.S. Pritchett.

Pritchett means that people read literary works not mainly for perfect structure, beautiful sentences, or imaginative imagery, but to find themselves in the works, discover their own souls, awaken hidden thoughts, illuminate vague hopes in life, memories, or all sad and sweet beliefs and experiences. In other words, every reader has his own life, which, though ordinary, is real, and especially intimate. Therefore, for the vast majority of readers, their own "story in the heart" will far surpass the story "within the cover of a book," far surpass all the changes, twists, and turns of written expression. -- In the end, why do people still read literary and artistic works? This is because people are often confused about their own thoughts, consciousness, and feelings. It is most difficult for people to understand their own mental state and seek a kind of guidance, stimulation, or even reshaping and creative inspiration. How will the mediocre heart be purified? How will the lofty heart be clarified? How will the impetuous one think deeply? How will the desolate one be warmed? How will the weak one be strengthened? How will the ignorant one be wise? How will the noisy world be renewed? Where is the perplexed century heading? Seeking common ground with similar minds, we can build good spirits together, change and sublimate, and eliminate bad ideas...; "Art is the expression of life," therefore, people read books. "Milton is loved by men, Dante is loved by women, young people love Byron, middle-aged people love Wordsworth. People feel alive when they read literary works, just like when one is attacked by sleep and one's hand touches one's knee and finds oneself alive." What this literary theorist said is not wrong. People all crave to discover the true self; -- human nature alone can be moved by this, because the "true" self is actually the eternal character of mankind, the "Greater Self" of the universe, the "humanity" that everyone sees. -- What people look up to in literary and artistic works is to find their own inner emotions from the sensibility of the work, to the world, to the times, and to life, to find life, to review or create the light of the soul, and to lead out more true stories from the depths of the heart from a moving story in the book.

Therefore, Romain Rolland testified: "The value of words depends entirely on the soul they express."

Writing this far, we can clearly understand that a good literary work is a work that can most gratifyingly arouse the greatest resonance in the reader's deep heart, and allow the reader to most intimately experience life and "the truth of life," that is, the first element of the work. How much "moving quality" there is is the key to the human significance and social value of the work, and it is only with this quality that a work can greatly move readers, and only then can it have meaning.

The answer is also very simple, returning to the origin must be true and intimate.

These two include the problem of writing attitude and writing skills, which determine the quality of the work. The style of the work may be different for everyone, but all rivers flow into the sea. There has never been a work that is not true or intimate that can move people's hearts, whether it is ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign.

First, please consider the "truth" of the work: "Even for the throne, never deceive the truth." This motto of Beethoven is worth remembering. Do not fabricate lies, do not create something out of nothing. A writer must go deep, practice, seek truth, and write truthfully. Taking materials from life and life, the brilliance of facts is better than everything. In a complex world, a dazzling era, with thousands of years of human culture in the past and infinite future ahead, under such a great scene, can't our writers write something universal, immortal, and profound? Carlyle, when discussing the poet Burns, once said that his most important representative advantage was "sincerity"; yes, to be sincerely faithful to humanity, life, the inspiring process of human progress, and the eternal virtues of people, to be faithful to writing, the works written can move people.

Balzac writes about French society, Goethe writes about passion, Du Fu writes about turmoil, Li Qingzhao writes about the desolate scene of "the curtain rolling up the west wind," Maupassant writes about the sorrows and joys of the petty bourgeoisie, ... these are all true and concretely touching. It is ridiculous to groan without illness, and artificial fake flowers can never reveal natural fragrance. Although it is not necessary to experience it personally, you should at least use your eyes, ears, thoughts, and heart to experience, understand, or appreciate the works that will be written by you.

Speaking of "intimacy": Since literary and artistic works mainly go to move readers, the soul must resonate, and emotions must converge. Of course, it is impossible to be rigid and unfamiliar in expression and perception. Emerson once said: "Everything that Shakespeare says about kings, every boy reading in the corner feels is true for himself." This sentence truly explains why Shakespeare was able to become a world literary giant and speaks to the psychology of thousands and millions of readers in the world. Because no matter when, where, or who, there is always a kind of contradictory emotion in the heart that is often the same, subtly changing in concealment and eager to explode. A good work must be able to assist, sublimate, and reasonably harmonize this contradictory emotion, but this must have an intimate writing style that makes readers feel related to the writing of sorrow and joy to achieve its effect. People sometimes want to cry, sometimes want to laugh, sometimes have a longing for success, sometimes have unspeakable depression, or may also hide pure tears and mysterious hatred and love, always hoping to find a confidant in a distant land. One day, if they get it, get it in a beautiful literary work, the lines are filled with gentle and warm feelings, and they find the shadow of the soul, then, for a kind and sincere reader, feeling that they are not alone and desolate in the world, and that there is still a precious heart-to-heart connection, how grateful and moved they will be!

The perseverance in the biographies of Beethoven or Michelangelo; the strong personality of "Manon"; the bitter love of "La Traviata"; the tranquility and naturalness of Tao Yuanming's poems; the mediocrity and stupidity of the poor people in Zola's novels; the wit and ingenuity in Shaw's plays; the heroism of the life-long enterprising heart in "Jean-Christophe";... all of this, all rely on the feeling of intimacy, so that countless readers in the world, together with it, feel bored, sigh, realize, struggle, and cheer; and from this, they obtain a spirit that transcends the individual, move forward, and obtain an unprecedented spiritual progress, and obtain a piece of light.

In this way, readers obtain "more, more stories," wisdom, and emotions that are not only beyond the cover of the book, but also beyond what was originally in the heart.

What's more, true works are particularly easy to appear intimate, and intimate works are often true. These two are mutually cause and effect, mutually corroborate each other, and lead to the same destination through different paths; together they form the great path of writing. Because the truth of mankind does not change, the spirit of the universe remains the same, life, life, human nature, and other immortal themes will always be true, intimate, and always able to move people in an excellent and beautiful work.

A work that can always move people is like a radiant gemstone, shining in all time and space!

Let me borrow Lamartine's words to end this article:

"To know how to move people is to know everything."

### Inscribing a Small Painting of Landscape by Shi Chongpeng in the Style of Wang Huanghe, Using the Original Rhyme

The mountain woodcutter's heart is naturally strong;
Autumn deepens, the frost leaves grow old,
Rivers, seas, and white clouds seal.

### Door

— A Chuan

Now, I (millions of people like me) am locked in a lonely, dark, hell-like little house without sunlight and with wind and rain.

This is really a small house, if I raise my hand, I will touch the moldy beams. Every part of the house is rotting, the mud floor is covered with blood, white poisonous mushrooms are blooming and bearing fruit at the foot of the wall, maggots are crawling on the skull, fireflies are flying around hitting people's faces, and there is a window on the blood-stained wall that is as big as Xiao Yanchi's inkstone pool. The window is woven with black bars in longitude and latitude.

There is no sunlight, and mildew gnaws at people's souls. So: I place my hope on that purple door.

"The door should be opened!" I thought: "When the door opens, a large bunch of purple lilacs will squeeze in, and a god with white wings will stand smiling by the door, and the cabin will be filled with fragrance."

"When the door opens, outside is a blue sky, free wind, gentle rain, sunlight paints flower shadows, and raindrops are like thousands of silver arrows shooting towards the ground."

I slowly walked to the door, the purple door was covered with shiny iron barbs, the door, solemn and majestic, faced me.

At the door, I heard screams and cries again, and I smelled the fishy stench of decaying animals again.

"Gentle rain, free wind." I thought.

I kicked the door with trembling feet.

A clanging sound of metal rang out outside the door, someone added a lock to the door again.

I left the door in fear; but outside the door there is gentle rain and free wind.

Suddenly, I showed strength to the door, I handed over my whole life to the door.

I am dancing in the free wilderness, I see millions of people like me lying by the door.

"The door should be opened!" I thought:

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

I nodded again, as a reply. In fact, I am a complete outsider to the ancient and almost lost art of "whistling." Not only do I not understand what the timbre of whistling is, I have never heard it before; is it like the sound of a flute, or a trumpet, or the whistle played by Ruan Xiaoqi?

The reason why I nodded to indicate understanding was partly to encourage Yaoqun to continue speaking, and partly because I did imagine two sounds: one was the sound of the waves on a quiet seaside night, and the other was the wind whistling through a pine forest. At the moment, I would treat them as whistling sounds. If I had to point out another one, it would be the whooshing ghost cries of the north wind piercing through the crevices.

When Yaoqun saw that I nodded to the second point as well, she could not help but be a little surprised, and seemed very happy: "Good, then we can solve the problem! ... You know, according to the ancient whistling score, there are fifteen kinds of vocalization methods. Except for the three kinds of mind whistling, intention whistling, and god whistling, which are too mystical, we can learn the remaining twelve kinds well. Among these twelve kinds, there are three kinds that belong to throat vocalization, called "small sink" and "big sink," which are especially suitable for our ideals; because this kind of whistling sound is extremely subtle when heard nearby, but extremely clear at a considerable distance. ..." When Yaoqun said this, she paused again, her two eyes emitting a flashing glow, as if she wanted to find an affirmative answer on my face.

As for me, in order to hear her continue speaking, even though I was really bewildered in my heart, I tried my best to put on a look of understanding on my face.

"I mixed the two vocalization principles of shortwave flute and throat sound, and as a result, I got a kind of "semi-long wave"—this is a term I made up—vocalization method. I used the lips, teeth, tongue, and throat, according to the ideal mechanical form of shortwave flute and "throat whistling," forced the vocal cords tightly, and issued a "chih" sound. Although this "chih" sound can also be heard nearby, it is especially loud at a distance; the empty range is about two miles, and it can reach the focal point. Therefore, in flat areas, you can play the sound casually, but in mountainous areas, you have to raise your head and whistle into the air."

"Then, why couldn't I hear it just now?" I could not help but persist in this stupid and almost foolish question.

"There are probably two reasons for this:" Yaoqun breathed a sigh of relief, relaxing her strained spirit: "First, you were probably concentrating on other issues, and you have never heard this kind of whistling sound before, so naturally you couldn't hear it; even if you heard it, because it was mixed with other sounds, you probably couldn't distinguish it. The second reason is that this place is at least two miles away from where Mr. Shen is making the sound, and it is also a mountainous area. What we can hear is probably just some aftersounds. You have to practice hard and have extremely sharp ears to hear some of it. Tiger Brother, you know, his senses are sharp and bright, and seem to be extraordinary... I didn't even hear the first alarm."

"Hey!" I breathed a sigh of relief, while stretching my attention, I was amazed at the complex reasons in it. At the same time, I remembered that Yaoqun had just said that the sound made by the Big Fool was "second degree," indicating that there was no danger, so I asked Yaoqun again: "What does 'second degree' mean?"

"Oh," a playful expression suddenly appeared on Yaoqun's face, as if she was preparing to make fun of me, but she immediately corrected her expression; "You were probably so focused on this sound transmission thing that you forgot about our echo in the empty valley and the code method! ... But there are only "three degrees" to this kind of sound transmission—we made them up too—one long tone plus one short tone is the first degree, indicating that we are inquiring about each other's whereabouts, greeting each other, and so on. The second degree; two long dragging tones, indicating a call for help, but not urgent. The third degree; one long tone plus three or four short tones, repeating continuously, indicating danger... The other party's response is the same..."

### Preface to the Tang Shixia Da Ding Painting Exhibition

— Pan Boying

There are two kinds of causes, inner and outer, for painting and calligraphy, just like the theory of Taiji's two forms. The difference between paper and silk, the division of brush and ink, the schools of North and South, the distinction between meticulous brushwork and freehand, and the depth of the author's skill are all due to external causes. As for the dullness or sharpness of the root nature, the fortune or misfortune of the encounter, and thus the feeling in the heart and the expression in the writing, are all due to inner causes. Xie He first discussed the Six Principles and regarded "Qi Yun Sheng Dong" (spirit resonance, life-movement) as the guideline. This is to combine the two causes, inner and outer, for discussion. The root nature is bestowed by heaven, and the encounter is due to the world. What is created in prosperous times is mostly magnificent and grand, and what is created in declining times is mostly strange and transformed. Especially at the time of political changes, the strange changes in the world are even greater, and the expression of the Six Principles is even more obvious. There is no need to talk about ancient times. Yi Zhai, Song Xue, Ba Da, and Shi Tao were all grandsons of the defeated kingdom and masters of the new dynasty. By the time the Qing Dynasty was established and the Republic of China was founded, the situation was very different from the previous era. This is because the political changes before the abdication of the Qing Dynasty were only limited to the change of the imperial family's surname. The rise of the Republic of China was the initial basis of democracy and the creation of a precedent in national history. Speaking of the cause of the five races as one family, the abdication of the Qing Emperor also contributed to it. Therefore, the grandsons and clan members of the Qing Dynasty were not subject to the calamity of cutting grass and uprooting weeds, and had abundant wealth. Those who had enough literary talent to shine were also able to obtain the name of hermits and occupy seats in the deliberations, such as the brothers Pu Xueshai and Xinfan, who were especially respected by the world.

Here is someone who possesses an unparalleled spiritual heart and is endowed with the beautiful virtue of self-cultivation. Born into a noble family, she became a concubine to a close relative. With her outstanding talent, she first advocated participation in politics in Shanghai, but was secretly rejected by Yikuang. It was her father who was rejected. With her gentle and bright quality, she tried her best to assist in the new policies of Emperor Dezong, but she was strangled by Nara. It was her aunt who was strangled. This person is Ms. Tang Shixia. At the beginning of the Japanese invasion, Ms. Tang knew that the events of Shi Jingtang and Zhang Bangchang would reappear in Ling. Fearing the connection of thatch roots, she traveled south incognito and resolutely cut off ties. She lived in seclusion in Songpu, abandoning the world. In her spare time, she found comfort in painting. Time passed by, and fifteen years have passed. Her paintings originate from Ma Xia, and her mind is the same as the ancestral law. Her paintings are elegant and precious, and also draw on the styles of Li Sixun and Li Zhaodao, which are not comparable to Ma Xia's remaining water and broken mountains. Furthermore, the method of the Northern School was transformed by Tang Ziwei with fine brushes, and a new realm was opened. The feud between literature and art is not far from taking lessons. Since the Ming Dynasty, there has never been a master of the Northern School who has not also drawn on the Southern School. Therefore, the Northern School of later generations is not like Ma Xia's great wheel and clumsy cart. The style of her delicate and exquisite style is also seen in Ms. Tang's paintings. With the encounters of Song Xue and Shi Tao, she appeared in the body of a woman. With the style of Xia Gui and Ma Yuan, she came from the hands of weaving and inheriting. With the shameless actions of Shi Jingtang and Zhang Bangchang, she was naturally detached from the outside world. It can be asserted that her paintings will surely be passed down. And those who have a true appreciation of art will surely not abandon them like this, and it can also be asserted.

Recently, Ms. Tang is going to display her books at the Chinese Painting Gallery to introduce them to connoisseurs in Shanghai. In advance, she sent invitations to various celebrities to comment on them. Not despising my humble self, I was also honored to be among them. Alas. My family and Ms. Tang's father's family had a long-standing elegant friendship. When I was young, I often had the honor of receiving teachings from her respected father. With a high-spirited song, he called it a friendship that transcends age. I once saw Ms. Tang at a family celebration banquet, when she was not yet of hairpin age. She was dignified, virtuous, and elegant, with a majestic demeanor. She was like a noble princess of the imperial family. Now, when we meet again, the world is in constant turmoil. However, Ms. Tang is as upright as a bamboo, and her sacred beauty is even clearer. My feelings of joy and sorrow, how can they be expressed? I then thought of Huang Luzhi's aunt, Madam Li, Zhao Ziang's wife, Madam Guan, and even in modern times, Qian Chenqun's mother, Chen Shu, Yun Shouping's niece, Qing Yu, all of whom are immortal people. I am now able to see the reincarnation of Li, Guan, Chen, and Yun, and the glory of the noble princess is far beyond comparison. Therefore, the inspiration from the family and country, and the meaning implied in painting, is exactly in line with the meaning of the inner and outer causes that I have stated, and it is also in harmony with her natural endowment. Therefore, I forget my ugliness and am happy to write this preface for her. Written by Ji Yu, a scholar from the Zanyuzhai, after the Beginning of Winter in the Dinghai year.

### Talking About Phlegm

— Also Said

"Spitting phlegm into a spittoon" is a common sight everywhere; but does that mean there's no phlegm without a spittoon? This statement cannot be established. For example, when eating, everyone says to use a rice bowl. When the words "rice bowl" are mentioned, a bowl of moderate size, piled high, white, loose, and steaming, that is a container for rice, immediately comes to mind. But is it impossible to eat without this rice bowl? This statement cannot be established, at the very least, just as spitting phlegm doesn't necessarily require a spittoon, it's that simple.

Have you seen someone eating hand-grasped rice? Of course, you have. Have you ever seen someone using newspapers to hold rice? Perhaps, because you don't often come to the streets, you haven't seen this wonderful scene. In fact, it's common for street wanderers, clutching their lunch bundles, grabbing cold rice, and using a corner of newspaper casually picked up from the ground to wrap the precious grains of rice.

By analogy, requiring a spittoon to spit phlegm is not only polite and elegant but also something that can be achieved by those who are well-fed and relatively refined. Don't underestimate the spittoon; some households don't have mahjong tiles, but few lack a spittoon. Moreover, in wealthy and palatial halls, able to compete with rosewood furniture, ancient bronzes, calligraphy and paintings by famous people, and brocade curtains, is only the tall, knee-high, polished bright, and heavy, snow-white large copper spittoon.

As for offices, public places, and even temples and monasteries... wherever people go, spittoons can always be found. Some call a vulgar phrase in our folk language "the national curse." If we were to speak reasonably, it seems that the spittoon could also be called "the national utensil," right? Why is there so much phlegm among the people of this country? Alas!

The history of phlegm is also very long. In medical books, there are terms like phlegm asthma, phlegm fire, phlegm syncope, phlegm retention, etc., and the phrase "phlegm obscures the mind" is especially well-known, because it can be followed by "incoherent speech." Phlegm is really a bad thing; phlegm surge and phlegm blockage can lead to death. People with pulmonary tuberculosis often have bacteria in their phlegm, and spitting it on the ground can easily cause infection, which is especially terrible. However, the so-called "cloud covering the moon" sound emanating from the back of the head, combining firmness and gentleness into a pleasing sound, is used skillfully by Old Tan when singing opera, and it is said that it benefits from a portion of the phlegm sound. Perhaps this is the only aesthetic and appreciative aspect of phlegm.

Phlegm is dirty. When writing this word, even the tip of the pen feels greasy and disgusting, let alone seeing mouthfuls of it all over the place. Therefore, other things can be made of transparent materials, but the glass spittoon seems to have not yet appeared in this "plastic" era. Unless, as legend has it, Li Hongzhang, when he was an envoy to Russia, once borrowed a tall-stemmed glass wine glass at a banquet because he was old and had a lot of phlegm and couldn't cope in time. As for ordinary people, even their own phlegm, I'm afraid no one would want to display their true form in a transparent glass container.

On the incense tables in temples, small porcelain spittoons can often be found. It's not surprising that slender, delicate women like Daiyu regard them as companions. On the other hand, gentlemen with heads held high and striding confidently stretch their necks, make a sound in their throats, and cough and spit out that mouthful of phlegm with unparalleled ease. At this time, the question arises: spittoon? Floor? Or the street? "No spitting" means that besides spittoons, handkerchiefs, and paper, which can accept this honored guest, other occasions are prohibited, and the words "anywhere" must be corrected.

People over forty, fake cough, real spit, it's not accidental. One is posturing, and the other is forced. The higher a person's position and status, the better the environment, the more unnatural coughs there are. Conversely, those who are undernourished, of low status, and mentally listless, although they don't cough, have phlegm surging like a tide, with an unstoppable momentum. Therefore, coughing is not necessarily a problem. Adults and gentlemen often use it as a decoration to show their status. Its effect is like walking in leather shoes, the sound of shoes rustling does not necessarily symbolize a strong body but indicates his important position. As for phlegm as a product of poverty and weakness, it is generally recognized.

Therefore, there is a conclusion: instead of prohibiting spitting, it is better to promote fitness; it is both respectable and practical. Western families do not have spittoons and do not have the bad habit of spitting anywhere. This is definitely not due to "prohibition." The Chinese have had a lot of phlegm for a long time. Since we recognize ourselves as weak patients, we should study the source of phlegm and the method of removing it, thinking about everything from the root. To put out a fire by pouring water on it or to whitewash the facade has the same effect as a fake cough. Those who prohibit will prohibit, and those who spit will spit; prohibiting and then spitting, spitting and then prohibiting, it is better to strive for the method of eradication, be active in strengthening the race and fitness, and improve life, so that they will not prohibit or spit, and the people can live!

### A String of Pearls

— Hu Lu

Shanghai is about to launch a campaign to discourage spitting.

Everyone's throat, is it related to illness or catching a cold? A hereditary habit like tuberculosis, coughing and spitting heard everywhere, resonating in harmony.

Atomic bombs are shocking when released, but microorganisms that cause death are wronged! I wonder how to talk about discouraging it? I'm afraid of being deified, raising those grunting Henga generals!

Note: Someone jokingly compares spitting phlegm to releasing atomic bombs, because tuberculosis is commonly called the primary disease, and the word "dan" (bullet) sounds like "tan" (phlegm).

### Appealing for the Refugees

— Si Mang

The weather station issued alarming news: a Siberian cold wave is about to descend upon Shanghai. This news is almost more important than any other news, especially for refugees, and it is more closely related to them, and they are directly affected by it.

There are 200,000 refugees in Shanghai threatened by the cold wave. This alarming figure accounts for almost one-twentieth of the entire population of Shanghai. Although this figure is not very accurate, judging from the facts, it will not be less than 200,000 people.

The Shanghai Municipal Winter Relief Committee recently held a meeting to discuss this issue and decided that the relief funds needed are 60 billion. Although the government has allocated 10 billion, the difference is still very large, only one-sixth of the total amount, and the remaining five-sixths need to be raised separately. In addition to charity matches and increased entertainment donations, we must solicit donations from everyone to make up this figure. Therefore, the fundraising campaign that is currently being launched hopes that everyone, regardless of men, women, old, or young, will do their best to contribute to save the refugees in hunger and cold.

### "Spring Flowers Blooming in Autumn"

— Fan Shouwu

I read a newsletter from Zhenjiang in the Shen Bao of October 31, which roughly stated: "In the garden of Zhang Buqing's residence at No. 10 Hama Courtyard, Nanmen Street, flowers and plants are mixed. Yesterday, the peonies, pomegranates, and crabapples in the garden bloomed one after another. Among them, the peonies were the most peculiar. The petals were purplish-red, and the flower plate resembled a bowl. The empty branches had no leaves, and the flowers bloomed at the ends of the branches. The local people all thought that spring flowers blooming in autumn was a rare and wonderful phenomenon."

According to the seasons, it has already reached the late autumn season when "grass and trees turn yellow and fall, and hibernating insects all droop," but for more than half a month, it has been like the weather of early summer, with gentle breezes and sunshine intoxicating people; [Old Lao's note: The weather has suddenly turned cold since the 18th]. At noon, if you walk a little longer in the sun, you can simply wear summer suits. No wonder the local communication pages of various newspapers have continuously published many news items such as "Autumn is acting like spring, and peaches and plums are competing for beauty," which is the same as our newspaper's "Peonies Blooming." Due to the recent "spring flowers blooming in autumn," I am reminded of the abnormal season of "autumn acting like spring." I occasionally recall a pre-written answer in the "Monthly Ordinance" of the Book of Rites regarding autumn acting like spring and autumn acting like summer: "If late autumn acts like summer, the country will have great floods, winter storage will be destroyed, and the people will sneeze a lot. If late autumn acts like spring, then warm winds will come, the people's spirits will be lazy, and the army will rise but not settle." Of course, this year's autumn has acted like summer, and it has also acted like spring; and not long ago, the yellow floods caused by the autumn tides, and the plague brought by the autumn tiger, do they not all fulfill the prophecy of this abnormal season?

We are faced with man-made and natural disasters, and a world of war and chaos. We appreciate these news about spring flowers blooming in autumn even more. I don't quite believe that Lu Buwei's "Broken and Rotten Court Reports," which mixed the seasonal ordinances of the twelfth month with the stories of the Three Dynasties and the Qin Kingdom, actually contain such a verified philosophy. Could it be that if there are abnormal human affairs in the world, there must be abnormal celestial seasons, and if there are abnormal celestial seasons, there must be abnormal man-made disasters and natural disasters, with each serving as a sign of the other, and always serving as a strong contrast? This point must be left to the great philosophers of the world to answer for us!

Announcement: Mr. Shazhou, please provide your communication address and real name. Mr. Li Renzhong: The payment slip has been sent. Please check and reply.

### A Study of Imperial Positions

— Wang Baili

Opening the history of China and examining the emperors of past dynasties, some reigned for more than sixty years (Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty reigned for sixty-one years, Qianlong for sixty years), while others only held the title for two days, which is truly pitifully short. Now, from the Qin Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty, I have examined those whose imperial position was within four months and obtained the following six people:

Emperor Min of the Later Tang Dynasty during the Five Dynasties, reigned for four months and was murdered by the deposed emperor.

Prince Ziying, son of the First Emperor, reigned for sixty-four days and was killed by Xiang Yu.

Emperor Ningzong of the Yuan Dynasty reigned for two months and died young.

Emperor Guangzong of the Ming Dynasty reigned for one month, fell ill after consorting with a female servant, and died after the doctor administered a red pill.

The King of Changyi in the Han Dynasty was established for only twenty-seven days. He was wantonly playful, and Huo Guang, not daring to shirk his responsibility to the country, obeyed the empress dowager's order and deposed him.

Gao Yanzong of the Northern Qi Dynasty, with the reign title of Dechang, ascended the imperial throne on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month. On the same day, he was besieged by Zhou soldiers. After a night of fighting, the troops were defeated and captured. From beginning to end, it was only two days and one night. Those who like to joke said that he obtained a two-day emperor.

### Advertisements Fifty Years Ago

— Shu Chai Fei

The advertising techniques of fifty years ago were not like today, appearing in newspapers and magazines, large cities, and even the streets and alleys of towns in a provocative and exaggerated manner. Fifty years ago, we found such an interesting advertisement for the sale of toothpaste in an American newspaper:

"I sincerely request members of society to purchase 'Popular Toothpaste.' This toothpaste is not a bit superior to other brands of toothpaste in my store, nor is it a bit cheaper... but I think at least its quality is as good as other brands. I especially recommend 'Popular Toothpaste' because it is supervised by my nephew, and he is a very trustworthy young man. If the sales of 'Popular Toothpaste' can improve a little recently, then he will soon have hope of getting married."

### Transforming Corruption into Integrity

— An Shou

The words and deeds of one or two influential people often create or shift the prevailing atmosphere of an era. This is really not uncommon in history. Obvious examples include the pure and simple discussions of the early Jin Dynasty and the reverence for Buddhism in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, which influenced an entire generation. In the beginning, it was simply because a few emperors, kings, and ministers liked it that way.

During the reign of Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty, there was such a story:

——When Tang Wenzheng Gong (Bin) was the governor of Wu, he encouraged himself to be honest and virtuous, and promoted moral transformation. Those among his subordinates who were corrupt and cruel were all advised and encouraged, and only those who did not change were punished by law. Guo Zongxian (Xiu) was the magistrate of Wujiang at the time and was known for his corruption. Gong summoned him to the province and taught him to be upright and healthy. Guo said, "The reason I am corrupt and cruel is to satisfy the desires of the former Governor. Now that you have vowed to be honest and upright, please grant me a month's grace. If my reputation remains the same as before, please punish me according to the law." He returned to his residence and washed it every day, saying, "The former magistrate Guo Xiu is dead, and now another Guo Xiu has come." His politics underwent a complete transformation. (Xiaoting Miscellaneous Records, Volume 4. Tang Wenzheng)

The protagonist of this story, Guo Xiu, was a very ruthless and capable official. If he had continued on his initial path, relying on his abilities, he would undoubtedly have become a great corrupt official. But what did he end up doing? According to historical records, Guo Xiu's later political achievements in Wujiang were the best in the southeast. Tang Bin recommended him to the court, and he was promoted to censor. He impeached Grand Secretary Yu Guozhu and others for forming factions and engaging in private activities, and for accepting bribes behind the scenes. In his later years, when he was the governor of Hunan, all the corrupt officials were impeached, and the administration became clean.

A famous corrupt official changed into a famous honest official and even eliminated many corrupt officials. The reason was due to Tang Bin's one thought. If Tang Bin were also a corrupt official, then Guo Xiu's corruption would have been even worse, and those who would have been eliminated when he became a high official would certainly not have been corrupt officials but honest ones.

The mechanism is subtle, but the influence is extremely large.

In this era of prevalent corruption, we hope that the rulers will all have the same integrity as Tang Bin, and at least not allow their subordinates to use the proceeds of "corruption" to satisfy their own "desires." Then, transforming corruption into integrity is not a distant hope.
