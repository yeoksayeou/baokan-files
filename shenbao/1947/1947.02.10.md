Xin Tai was recovered at 5:00 PM on the 8th, and Linyi is expected to fall soon. The two armies on the Longhai Railway are engaged in a fierce battle near Ningling, west of Shangqiu.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] The National Army advanced to Fuzhuang and Dashagou, six miles south of Linyi, at noon on the 9th. The Communist army in the city has begun destroying buildings.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] More than ten thousand Communist troops who fled to the area south of Baitabu and Huandunbu are now heavily besieged by the National Army. The Communist army has suffered heavy casualties in recent days and is expected to be completely annihilated soon.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] The Trained Army of Wang Yaowu's unit of the National Army recovered the filth of Xin Tai on the 8th and continued to advance towards Mengyin, the largest supply base for the Shandong Communist army. The Communist troops in the city are showing signs of wavering. Since the previous day, they have been transporting ordnance factories and ammunition depots to Yishui and Sishui. The ox and horse carts on the Yishui-Sishui road are arranged like a long snake.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 8th] For the past two days, the National Army has been advancing towards Xin Tai from Laiwu in three routes. They engaged in fierce battles with the Fourth Division of the Communist Army, led by Liao Rongbiao, and the First Police Brigade, led by Liu Guozhu, in the mountains. By the morning of the 8th, the central route reached Mengyinzhai, fifteen kilometers from Xin Tai, the eastern route was south of Lishan, and the western route was fighting south of Huangyang Mountain. By 7:00 PM on the 8th, the National Army had entered Xin Tai, and more than ten thousand Communist troops retreated southward. Mountainous areas of the territory, reorganize and replenish. Furthermore, more than a thousand troops from the Communist New Eighth Regiment infiltrated Zhu Ji on the border of Shan County and Dangshan on the night of the 7th to cause disturbances.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 8th] The Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Columns of Liu Bocheng's Communist army, which infiltrated the Xiaoba area of Shangqiu, suffered heavy losses after being surrounded and severely attacked by the National Army in Liukouji, Zhangzhuang, and Chu Zhai for several days. The Communist army has now lost its combat capability, and its remnants have recently been broken up into smaller units, fleeing along the Longhai line east and west of Shangqiu, creating loopholes and destroying roads. The National Army is currently driving them out separately. Furthermore, passenger and freight trains between Xuzhou and Shangqiu are running smoothly.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 9th] Tai was recovered by the National Army on the 8th, and the Communist army fled northward.

### A Certain Military Observer Discusses the War Situation: Southern Shandong Has Entered a New Stage

The Communist Army Attempts to Cross the Jinpu Railway and Join Forces with Liu Bocheng's Troops

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] Since Wang Yaowu's large army in Central Shandong recovered Xin Zao, the overall situation in Southern Shandong has entered a new stage. According to a certain authoritative military observer: The Communist army in Southern Shandong, which is surrounded, could take the following five actions: (1) Escape to the mountains, (2) Defend Linyi to the death, (3) Retreat to Jiaodong, (4) Cross the Jinpu Railway and join forces with Liu Bocheng's troops, (5) Flee back to Northern Jiangsu. Among them, the first option was originally the most likely. However, since the National Army in the north occupied Laiyi, Xin Tai, and broke into the heart of the Shandong Communist mountain area, their attempt to preserve their strength and escape to the mountains has been eliminated. However, judging from the Communist army concentrating its main force to launch a fierce attack on Hao Pengju's troops in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, the Communist army seems to be retaliating against Hao's betrayal on the one hand, and on the other hand, regarding Hao's troops as the weakest link in the National Army's entire line, so their attack is clearly an attempt to break through the encirclement and flee back to Northern Jiangsu. Furthermore, Liu Bocheng's troops can once again encircle and attack Xuzhou from both sides in the north, and can still threaten Nanjing and Shanghai in the south. However, the National Army has taken strict precautions against this, and the Communist army's plot will never succeed. In this way, the Communist army's fifth attempt will also be in vain. The Communist army's strategic principle has always been to preserve its strength and avoid decisive battles, so the hope of defending Linyi to the death is also very small. As for retreating to Jiaodong, it is like a mouse burrowing into an ox's horn. Although it can be safe for a while, the Communist army will never take this step unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, according to the current situation, the hope of adopting the fourth option of crossing the Jinpu Railway and joining forces with Liu Bocheng is the greatest. The observer jokingly said that the news from various places recently claiming that the National Army has recovered Linyi is an unnecessary and excessive exaggeration. The National Army's greatest goal at present is to find a way to capture the main force of the Communist army and annihilate it in one fell swoop, so as to plan for long-term peace and stability. Otherwise, even if Linyi is recovered and the Jinpu Railway is opened, the problem cannot be solved as long as the main force of the Communist army exists.

### Communist Army's Aid to Hao Suffers Setback; Flees Back to Luyi and Zhecheng

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] (1) The Communist army that disturbed Hao County fled back to Luyi and Zhecheng.

After several days of fierce fighting from noon on the 2nd to the evening of the 4th, the Communist army suffered about six thousand casualties, leaving more than two thousand bodies (in addition to more than two hundred prisoners). The Sixth and Seventh Columns suffered particularly heavy casualties, followed by the First Column. Among them, there was one injured brigade commander and one injured regimental commander, as well as many officers below the battalion commander level.

[Our Panyang Dispatch, 9th] A person from Dalian said that there are two large ordnance factories in Dalian, manufacturing rifles, light and heavy machine guns, mortars, and bullets, etc. One is controlled by the Soviet army, and the other is controlled by the Communist army. Therefore, Dalian is only a supply base for the Communist army in southern Liaoning and also a source of arms for the Communist armies in Jiaodong and southern Shandong.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 9th] It is reported that the issue of taking over Dalian is difficult to realize in the short term due to the difficult-to-resolve prerequisites such as the economic cooperation proposed by the Soviet Union to our government.

### US Military Dependents Returning Home; Still Needs Some Thinking

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Amidst the voices of the US military withdrawing from China, US troops and their dependents in Peiping and Tianjin have been requesting repatriation. It is learned that the US military's sudden withdrawal this time has caused many personnel problems. Most of their dependents, who arrived in China last autumn, sold or transferred their houses or part of their furniture before leaving the United States, in preparation for staying in China for three to five years. Initially, they did not expect that things would turn out unexpectedly. In the current period of rising prices and housing shortages around the world, US military dependents will still need some thought after returning to the United States. After the US military withdraws, in addition to the personnel responsible for training work who will continue to stay, there is also a part of the population in the US military cemetery registration office that will also need to stay in China for a while until the task is completed.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 9th] According to a person from Taiyuan, there was recently a large-scale battle of two hundred thousand troops on the banks of the Qin River. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. It is said that the Communist army captured the filth of Xiaoyi, gathered twelve brigades, and planned to go north from Pingyao and Wenshui to capture Taiyuan in one fell swoop. Governor Yan, considering the seriousness of the situation, personally led eight brigades to supervise the battle in Pingyao. The two sides then launched a large-scale battle of two hundred thousand troops. After a week of fierce fighting, both sides suffered more than 20,000 casualties. The Communist army's offensive began to weaken, and the situation turned stable. Currently, the National Army is going north from Linqin and has reached Huoxian. Another unit entered Xiaoyi, and the Communist army was attacked from the north and south. The crisis in Taiyuan has passed.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 9th] A certain military observer said that in order to open up the transportation line between Yan'an and the Northeast, the Communist army still has a tendency to invade Datong. The National Army is standing by.

### No Major Changes to the Organization of the Five Yuans; Initial Draft Has Been Prepared in Accordance with the Constitution; The Legislative and Examination Yuans Will Expand Their Scope

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] According to the initial draft of the organizational law of the Five Yuans prepared in accordance with the Constitution, there are generally no major changes compared to the current organizational laws of the various Yuans. The Legislative Yuan will still have one president and one vice president, who will be elected by the members of the Legislative Yuan. The number of members of the Legislative Yuan will increase from the current ninety-nine to about eight hundred, who will be elected by the provinces, cities, border provinces, overseas Chinese, and professional organizations. The term of office is three years, and they can be re-elected. Due to the increase in the number of members of the Legislative Yuan and the increased workload, the original plan was to increase the number of committees from five to fourteen. Later, because the work of the Economic, Labor, Civil and Criminal Law committees could be merged into other committees, it was finally decided to establish ten committees: Finance, National Defense, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture and Forestry, Budget, Transportation, Posts and Telecommunications, Education, and Legal System. Its organization is determined by law. The Examination Yuan currently only has two institutions: the Ministry of Personnel and the Examination Committee. It is said that a Civil Service Protection Committee will be established in the future to determine the civil service system. Furthermore, according to the Constitution, the Examination Yuan will have a number of examination committee members. Therefore, it is not certain whether the Examination Committee will continue to exist. In addition, the Constitution also stipulates that the selection of civil servants in the future should implement a public competitive examination system, and "those who have not passed the examination" shall not be employed. Since the business of the Examination Yuan has expanded, its institutions in various places must also be expanded. The organizational law of the Executive Yuan is not significantly different from that passed by the National Defense Committee last winter. The Ministry of Judicial Administration is still under the Executive Yuan. When drafting the organizational law of the Control Yuan, some people originally suggested changing the organization and functions of the local supervisory envoy offices, but it is said that the original state was maintained in the end.

### Regional Representatives to the National Assembly; Born Under the Constitution; Will Reach Two Thousand One Hundred People

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] According to authoritative estimates, the number of regional National Assembly representatives who will be produced under the Constitution in the future will reach two thousand one hundred. As for how the number of representatives from professional organizations and women should be determined, the initial draft of the National Assembly representative election law currently being drafted has not made a final decision. Professional organizations have previously suggested increasing the proportion of professional representatives. If so, the total number may be close to two thousand. According to Hong Lanyou's estimate, the National Assembly Hall can only accommodate a maximum of two thousand seven hundred people. Therefore, the venue for the next National Assembly meeting may become a problem.

[Central Stomach, Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The National Assembly Resident Professional Representatives Association held its second meeting on the morning of the 9th, with more than fifty people attending. Li Hongru presided over the meeting and resolved: (1) To request the National Government to establish a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association as soon as possible in accordance with the preparatory procedures for implementing the Constitution to be responsible for promoting constitutional work. (2) The association will send a telegram on behalf of the Central Committee, the National Government, the Supreme National Defense Committee, and the Legislative Yuan, requesting that when formulating the next National Assembly representative election law, in accordance with precedent, professional representatives should account for 36% of the total number. Li Hongru, Tang Qiyu, Dai Tianqiu, Guo Heng, Zhao Xuan, Jiang Zhengxiang, Chen Huanzhang, and Chen Yixiu were appointed to explain everything to all parties, and were authorized to draft preliminary principles for the election law for reference.

### Chongqing Students' Anti-Violence Association; Authorities Decided to Ban It

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] In Chongqing City on the 8th, the so-called Student Anti-Violence Joint Association launched a parade and publicity campaign at 10:00 AM. More than ten unidentified people participated. Their actions exceeded the scope of publicity and forced citizens to donate money. They verbally abused citizens who refused to donate as "traitors" and "foreign slaves," which aroused public outrage and led to conflicts and minor injuries. The public security organs are handling the matter in accordance with the law. In addition, the people affected in the ninth and second districts are filing lawsuits with relevant agencies.

### Supreme Economic Committee; The Legislative Yuan Still Insists on Abolishing

The Case Will be Submitted to the Joint Committee of the Legislative Yuan for Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Regarding the issue of the existence or abolition of the Supreme Economic Committee, when the Legislative Yuan discussed the general budget案 last month, it suggested that the committee and its affiliated import control committee be abolished because they had no legal basis. The authorities have not made a final decision on this matter. The Finance and other committees of the Legislative Yuan recently reviewed the organizational law of the committee again and still insisted on abolishing it. It is said that the case will be submitted to a joint committee for review. The draft organizational law of the Public Works Committee, which belongs to the Supreme Economic Committee, has also been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. In addition, the Finance, Economic, and Legal System committees of the Legislative Yuan are scheduled to meet on the 11th to discuss the issue of the existence or abolition of the nine-member committee organized previously.

### Import Control Committee Issues Statement; Refutes United Press's Criticism of the Committee; All Speculation is Absolutely Baseless

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Provisional Import Management Committee issued a statement yesterday, clarifying some of the United Press dispatches issued on the 2nd of this month. The statement said:

"A dispatch from New York by the United Press on the 2nd of this month severely criticized the measures of this committee, saying: According to reports, the Import Control Committee is biased and unfair, uses political pressure, and allows companies set up by certain 'privileged parties' to take advantage of opportunities to engage in activities, etc. This committee firmly denies all accusations that this committee is biased and unfair, and delays issuing permits, intending to give assistance to those who attempt to 'monopolize the market.' This committee does not ignore the fact that some people use unethical methods to try to seize import profits from import business firms, but will take a firm stand to prevent such activities from taking effect. At the same time, all accusations that any person enjoys privileges for any reason and obtains permits from this committee are malicious slanders against this committee. This committee will never allow its staff to engage in any illegal activities. At the same time, it cannot tolerate any slander against the staff of this committee. It is especially warned to people from all walks of life and foreign manufacturers not to be deceived by such absolutely baseless accusations and rumors."

### Government Reorganization Becomes Increasingly Concrete; The Democratic Socialist Party Decides to Participate in the Legislative and Control Yuans; The List of Candidates for the Delegation to Beijing Will Be Decided

[Our Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party has decided to participate in the Legislative and Control Yuans during the government reorganization. The list of candidates has not been specifically decided, but it will be negotiated soon. The list of candidates for the delegation to Beijing will also be decided within days. It is possible that Mr. Zhang Junmai will personally lead the delegation to Beijing. According to a responsible person, the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the government has two guiding principles: one is how to end political tutelage, and the other is how to narrow the gap between the government and the Chinese Communist Party, and ultimately create cooperation and unity among all parties in the country. At present, the second point is clearly difficult to achieve. Therefore, the purpose of participating in the Legislative and Control Yuans at this time is to complete the implementation of the constitution. As for the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan, they do not intend to participate, so as to continue to promote China's democracy and constitutionalism as an opposition party. The Democratic Socialist Party will enthusiastically participate in future local elections. Furthermore, the method of participating in the government this time is a compromise decision made after considering various different opinions within the party, and it is believed that it will not be opposed by members in the north.

[Our Dispatch] Government reorganization is becoming increasingly concrete. The reporter visited a certain member of the Democratic League today to inquire about their views on this issue. Their opinions can be summarized as follows: (1) The current method of reorganizing the government cannot end the domestic military conflict and is of no help to national affairs. Neither the Chinese Communist Party nor the Democratic League will participate. (2) In terms of external significance, what the United States is currently concerned about is that China can restore peace in order to facilitate the export of its capital and goods. If the government reorganization cannot achieve this goal, there are questions about whether the five hundred million dollar loan will be successful as a result. However, on the other hand, China's economic collapse is also not in the interests of the United States. Therefore, after the government reorganization, there may be economic assistance, but it will not be very generous. (3) In terms of internal significance, the question is whether the government's policies are innovative and whether it has the determination to improve administrative efficiency. The personnel of the opposition parties are not necessarily superior in quality to the current government personnel. Under the current political situation, it is also questionable whether the parties and social elites can play a good role in supervision after participating in the government.

[This City Dispatch] Mr. Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 7th to report to the party on the negotiations with the government on reorganization in Beijing. He is scheduled to go to Beijing again this morning (the 10th). It is reported that the list of the party's participation in the Legislative and Control Yuans has been taken to Beijing by Mr. Zuo for submission to the government.

### Temporary Japanese Reparations Plan: 13 Types of Industrial Equipment to be Removed First; Our Country Hopes to Obtain Half of the Total Tonnage

[Report from our newspaper] According to reliable sources in Nanjing: The Reparations Committee of the Far Eastern Commission has designated thirteen types of military industrial equipment to be removed first under the temporary Japanese reparations plan: (1) Thermal power plants, (2) Steel plants, (3) Shipyards, (4) Aircraft manufacturing plants, (5) Naval and army arsenals, (6) Acid plants, (7) *[illegible character]* plants, (8) Steel ball bearing plants, (9) Machine tool manufacturing plants, (10) Light metal plants (aluminum industry), (11) Privately-owned arsenals, (12) Artificial petroleum plants, and (13) Artificial rubber plants. According to estimates by the Japanese government, the total tonnage of the above industrial equipment is 12 million tons. Due to the wide variety of types, the Reparations Committee has not yet been able to decide on the distribution amount for each country. The U.S. government is considering, based on the actual needs of each Allied country, to first allocate a portion within the scope of temporary reparations to various countries. Regarding the quantity of the initial allocation, the U.S. side has proposed either 25% or 20% of the total amount of temporary reparations, while Allied countries have proposed 30%. As of now, nothing has been determined. The Chinese government, in light of the urgent need to restore domestic industry, has negotiated with the U.S. side based on actual needs, hoping to obtain half of the total amount of equipment removed in the initial phase, but there has been no result yet.

The Reparations Committee under our Executive Yuan has established six sub-groups: (1) Machine Tool Group, (2) Shipbuilding Group, (3) Steel Group, (4) Chemical Industry Group, (5) Thermal Power Generation Group, and (6) Light Metal Group, to separately formulate removal plans. However, due to the enormous cost of building factories, they are currently considering annual construction plans within the possible scope of financial capacity to coordinate with the utilization of the dismantled factories. Regarding the initial removal phase, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan has recently repeatedly invited our country to visit machine tool and thermal power plants for selection, and has provided 25,000 machine tools and 12 thermal power plants for our inspection. The inspection date may be around the 15th of this month.

### The Urgency of Closing the Yellow River Breach Increases; Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Cables and Calls for a Unified Appeal from Water Conservancy Associations; Survey of Upstream Reservoir Project to Begin Construction Within the Year

[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 9th] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong, considering that the peach flood season is approaching and the Yellow River breach closure project is becoming increasingly urgent, with the disaster-stricken people at a critical juncture - either surviving if the breach is closed or dying if it is not - has, on behalf of the 30 million people of Jiangsu Province, pleaded for the lives of the disaster-stricken people. In addition to cabling the central government to overcome all difficulties and actively proceed with closing the breach to maintain the national economy and ensure people's livelihood, he has also sent separate cables to the Water Conservancy Commission and the provincial governments of Shandong and Anhui, requesting assistance and a unified appeal.

[Central News Agency, Xiangzhou, 9th] After the change to the upright closure method for the Huayuankou breach closure project, progress has been extremely smooth. The side dam and grid dam extending eastward from the western embankment reached the gap on the 8th, and the flow of water in the main current entering the diversion channel has been slower.

### Editorial: Looking at US-Soviet Relations from the Perspective of Disarmament

Secretary of State Marshall held his first press conference on the 7th after taking office, during which he spoke freely about the US stance on the issue of arms reduction. The main points are five: (1) The goal we seek is to ensure peace and lay a solid foundation for collective security; (2) International control of atomic energy and other effective safeguards are of paramount importance. If atomic energy is not controlled, there is no security for mankind. We attach particular importance to the solution of this problem, and that is the reason why; (3) Any real reduction of armaments is difficult to achieve before a peaceful settlement in Europe and the Far East; Even any practical reduction of armaments is not possible; The US government will seek to avoid a repeat of the tragedy caused by unilateral disarmament and arms limitation after 1921; (4) The US will not reduce its forces until a collective security system is established; (5) If the US does not implement a conscription system, it will not be able to back up its foreign policy with its necessary military strength.

From this, it can be seen that Secretary of State Marshall fully agrees with the disarmament plan proposed by Austin to the Security Council on the 4th. We review the full text of the US proposal, which can be summarized into the following three points: (1) To establish a Disarmament Committee, composed of all members of the Security Council, whose task is to submit to the Security Council implementation measures on the control and reduction of armaments and forces, including methods for effective safeguards; However, some issues that, according to the resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly on January 24 and December 14 last year, should be under the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy Commission, are not within the scope of the Disarmament Committee's tasks. (2) To establish a Security Committee to make recommendations to the Security Council within the scope of the Disarmament Committee's duties, it should determine the relationship between the Disarmament Committee, the Military Staff Committee, and the Atomic Energy Commission. (3) When the Security Council decides to convene a meeting, it should immediately begin reviewing the first report submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission on January 31 last year, and should pay attention to the recommendations made in Chapter 3 of the report.

This new disarmament plan is indeed commendable under the current international environment. Dr. Guo Taiqi, the representative of our country to the Security Council, first expressed his approval, saying that the US plan "particularly emphasizes the issue of international control of atomic energy and advocates giving priority to discussing the issue of atomic energy. The Chinese delegation will fully support it." That is, the Soviet representative, who stood on the opposite side of the United States, could not but express his agreement in principle to the US representative's proposal to establish a Disarmament Committee. However, Gromyko disagreed with the three points suggested by the US: First, atomic energy must be handed over to international control and a monitoring system must be adopted as an effective safeguard, and collective sanctions should be imposed on any country that violates the agreement. Second, the US limits the scope of the Disarmament Committee's duties and must not interfere with the scope under the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy Commission; Third, the US advocates discussing the issue of atomic energy first, and then discussing the issue of armaments. The Soviet representative disagreed with all three points. The US and the Soviet Union each held their own views and refused to give way, almost bringing the disarmament issue to a standstill and making it impossible to continue the discussion.

Therefore, the French representative, who has always been a mediator, stepped forward to resolve the difficulties and attempted to reconcile the views of the US and the Soviet Union, so that the Security Council could reach an agreement on the disarmament issue as soon as possible and avoid causing friction between the US and the Soviet Union again. The French representative, Maurice Couve de Murville, tried his diplomatic skills and actually achieved immediate results, enabling both the US and the Soviet Union to agree to use the draft proposed by the French representative on January 9 as the basis for discussion; the Soviet representative suddenly adopted a compromise attitude, which suddenly made the disarmament issue optimistic. As for the content of the French draft, the main points are two: (1) To establish a Disarmament Committee to submit recommendations within three months to implement the resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly on the reduction and limitation of armaments; (2) The Security Council should review the international atomic energy control plan as soon as possible. The greatest feature of this draft is that it is a moderate compromise that can be accepted by both the US and the Soviet Union as a basis for continued discussion. After discussion by the six-nation subcommittee, the Soviet representative immediately expressed his agreement on three points: (2) To immediately establish a Disarmament Committee to begin drafting a plan for universal disarmament; (2) To immediately discuss the issue of international control of atomic energy; (3) To organize an international army as soon as possible.

Originally, the stalemate created by the US and the Soviet Union on the issue of arms reduction could be broken; however, the US representative Austin still insisted that the draft should stipulate a guarantee, that is, the Disarmament Committee should not intrude into the scope of activities of the Atomic Energy Commission. At the same time, the Soviet representative Gromyko also refused to be outdone and expressed his firm opposition, so the matter failed before success, and the disarmament issue fell into a stalemate, making it impossible to open up, and casting a shadow over the prospect of understanding and cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union. In order to break the current deadlock, Austin directly negotiated with the Soviet representative Gromyko outside the meeting, but the result was that Austin's efforts failed again because the views of both sides remained incompatible. At the same time, the six-nation representatives were also helpless and had to decide to submit the views of the US and the Soviet Union to the Security Council for discussion at a meeting this Wednesday.

The disagreement between the US and the Soviet Union on the issue of arms reduction and the failure to reach an agreement is a disappointing thing for the relations between the US and the Soviet Union, or for the peace of the entire world, especially for us ordinary people who yearn for international cooperation to jointly maintain world peace. Seeing the satisfactory conclusion of the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference and the Second UN General Assembly in December last year, we were all overjoyed and fully believed that the international situation would gradually become clearer in the future. Not only the relations between Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union are expected to gradually improve, but also a true world peace after the war can be achieved this year, so we all hold full hope for the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference next month; but unexpectedly, on the eve of the opening of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the US and the Soviet Union discussed the issue of disarmament and failed to thoroughly resolve this issue with the spirit of mutual understanding and concession. From this point of view, the possibility of improved US-Soviet relations cannot be overstated.

Now, the disarmament issue on which the safety of the world depends will be publicly discussed by the Security Council again. We certainly hope that both the US and the Soviet Union can uphold the spirit of mutual understanding and concession and discuss this issue calmly. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 8th, the US is now carefully trying to avoid a "showdown" with the Soviet Union in the Security Council over the disarmament issue, which shows that the US is ready to compromise; as for the Soviet Union, although there has been no indication of compromise so far, the disarmament issue was first proposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, so he will not insist on his own views and allow this issue to remain in a stalemate for a long time.

### Impersonating Military Service: A Sergeant Cao Zheng Sentenced for Extorting Money After the Scheme Failed

[Our Songjiang Correspondent] Tang Chengxi, a resident of Yexie Town in the county, was drafted into the army last year. Shan Liyan, who knew Tang, said that he could find a way to avoid military service. Shan then introduced Cao Zheng, a sergeant and clerk of the county security brigade. On November 3rd of last year, Tang's wife, He Qiaoyun, met with Shen and He at the Xinxin Hotel in the city. They discussed the matter. Cao would arrange for someone else to replace Tang Chunpei in military service for 15 shi of rice (equivalent to 700,000 yuan in national currency). He Qiaoyun paid 200,000 yuan in advance, with another 50,000 yuan for clothing expenses. The remaining amount would be paid after the matter was completed. Unexpectedly, Tang Chengxi thought of escaping over the wall at the conscription office on December 4th. Cao Zheng, claiming that 450,000 yuan was still owed, went to Yexie with Shan Liyan to demand payment from He Qiaoyun. He refused to pay because her husband had not returned home. She reported the case to the local police station for extortion and hindering freedom, and Shan was arrested and transferred to the court for interrogation. The court transferred Cao Zheng, who was an active military officer, to the county government's military law office for handling. The military law office sentenced Cao Zheng to ten years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for eight years on charges of hindering military service, corruption, and hindering freedom.

### Fighting After the Dragon Dance

[Our Wujiang Correspondent] Mei Shi Li, outside the west gate of the city, has always had a very strong folk custom. When things happen, fighting is the first premise. On the night of the Lantern Festival, there is usually a dragon banquet, which generally scares farmers. At that time, Shi Lai-sheng, leader of the tenth Bao of Shi Mei Township, led the dragon to add to the fun. When the meeting was dismissed, the dragons nodded and saluted each other.

They were only released after others persuaded them and promised to pay them all over again. Later, the district learned of this and sent a team to pursue them, but the bandits had heard the news and fled far away.

### Zhejiang Salt Freely Negotiated Prices: Ministry of Finance Approves Principles

Highest price limited to rice per thousand salt shi

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] The Zhejiang Salt Affairs Administration will implement free negotiation of prices at various important sites, instructing various salt farms to begin implementation in the middle of this month. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that the production of salt in Zhejiang is closely related to the food supply of the eastern region. If it is not properly managed, it will inevitably be manipulated and affect the food supply of the people. Therefore, it has specially approved the principles and instructed them to be implemented. The important methods are that the salt produced by each salt farm must be handed over to the designated storage site and managed by the salt affairs authority. The price sold by the salt producers is determined by the salt affairs authority by convening salt producers periodically, announcing the price for implementation. The highest price is temporarily limited to rice per thousand salt shi. When salt producers hand over salt to the warehouse, they may be issued a part or all of the production loan, which will be returned without interest when it is sold. All salt producers should form an organization and elect a responsible person to represent the salt farmers in price negotiations.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Inspect Police Administration in Various Counties

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent] The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the counties south of the Yangtze River in this province have long been stable, and the entire northern Jiangsu has now been recovered. The police offices originally established in various counties have been reorganized into police stations, and the water police corps have been reorganized into water police stations. In order to understand the actual work of the municipal police agencies throughout the province in order to improve it, police supervisor Cha Jiyu has been specially dispatched to various counties to strictly supervise and assess them.

Merchants and residents in front of whose houses have planted saplings are ordered to protect them carefully.

### Organizing the Tiger Hill Scenic Area

Suzhou Lifts Dance Ban for 20 Days: Raises 30 Million Yuan in Funds

[Our Suzhou Correspondent] Tiger Hill, a famous scenic area in this city, has been in disrepair for many years. With the bright spring weather and increasing numbers of tourists, it is inevitable that it will lose its appearance. Military and government leaders here have paid attention to this and have recently organized a committee to organize and renovate the Tiger Hill scenic area and launch a campaign to raise funds. The method is to lift the ban on dancing for 20 days to raise 20 million yuan. As of the 10th of this month, the full amount has been raised and work will begin soon.

### Hangzhou City Conducts a General Inspection of Opium and Drugs: The Anti-Drug Conference Decides to Start on the 16th

### Five-Nation Peace Treaty Signed Today: Italy Plans to Request the Right to Retain Amendments: Ambassador Qian Tai Represents Our Country in Signing the Treaty with Italy

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] According to government sources: The Peace Treaty with Austria will be signed in Paris on the 10th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Ambassador Qian Tai stationed in France to sign on behalf of the country. Furthermore, according to diplomatic sources, although the Italian government has decided to sign the treaty, it has declared to the four foreign ministers that it reserves the right to request amendments in the future in the form of bilateral treaties because its requests were not accepted by the four foreign ministers. The Italian ambassador to China recently presented the aforementioned statement to the four foreign ministers to our Foreign Minister Wang on the orders of the Italian government.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] It is reported that the signing ceremony for the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland will be held tomorrow at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The writing desks used by King Louis XV and Louis XVI of France will be borrowed from the National Museum for the signing. According to reports, this writing desk was used by the revolutionary government of the time, the Committee of Public Safety, during the French Revolution from 1793 to 1795.

[Reuters, Paris, 9th] As the signing ceremony of the peace treaties with the five former enemy countries is scheduled for tomorrow, it seems that some issues of general concern have not yet received definite answers. The entire Paris is asking: "Will Yugoslavia join other countries in signing the peace treaties?" When South Foreign Minister Simic departed from Belgrade, the Yugoslav government's communique stated that Simic's mission was to sign the peace treaties with Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, without mentioning the peace treaty with Italy. When Simic arrived in Paris yesterday, he declined to comment on this matter. Another matter of concern is the four-power resolution announced yesterday, which does not allow former enemy countries to make oral or written statements at the signing ceremony. It is generally known that the five former enemy countries are all prepared to make statements at that time. These five countries have not yet expressed their views on the four-power resolution, but it is expected that they will protest if they are not allowed to express their opinions at the signing. Delegations from Finland, Romania, and Bulgaria arrived in Paris last night. Representatives from Italy and Hungary have not yet arrived and may all be able to arrive tonight. The atmosphere in Paris is like the scene when the 21-nation peace conference was held last summer.

### Procedure for Drafting the Peace Treaty with Germany: U.S. Representative Proposes Plan: Belarus Demands Huge Reparations from Germany: The Four Powers Agree to End the Principle of Occupation of Austria

[Agence France-Presse, London, 9th] Regarding the procedure for drafting the peace treaty with Germany, the U.S. delegation recently submitted a plan to the Council of Foreign Ministers, stipulating that the four foreign ministers should hold a meeting one month before the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference to draft the peace treaty with Germany in accordance with the instructions separately given by the four foreign ministers. All countries that have participated in the war against Germany with significant military forces should send representatives to attend the meeting. At that time, the four foreign ministers' meetings will establish four committees responsible for handling the following four issues, namely (1) the German political system and its constitution; (2) territorial issues; (3) economic issues and reparations; and (4) disarmament and demilitarization. Each committee will be organized by one representative from each of the four powers. Each member may elect a United Nations representative to join the committee, and experts must be appointed with the unanimous consent of the four committees. The Allied Nations of the United Nations may clearly state their opinions during discussions and may obtain copies of all documents submitted to the foreign ministers for public discussion. The peace treaty with Germany drafted by the four foreign ministers' meetings should first be submitted to the governments of the participating countries and then to the four foreign ministers' conferences.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] The Belarusian representative presented his views to the Council of Foreign Ministers today, requesting reparations worth US$1.5 billion from Germany. The Ruhr area should be handed over to the Soviet Union for joint control.

[Central News Agency, London, 8th Special Dispatch] The Council of Foreign Ministers agreed in principle today to end the occupation of Austria when the peace treaty with Austria comes into effect, and to withdraw the occupying Allied forces within 90 days after the treaty comes into effect. Regarding the issue of repatriation of Austrian prisoners of war, it was decided to hand it over to the Military Committee for handling.

### Greek Political Prisoners: Issue of Execution

The Security Council will meet today to discuss

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 9th] A special meeting of the Security Council will be convened tomorrow morning to discuss the issue of Greek guerrillas sentenced to death. The United Nations investigation team has asked the Security Council whether it can intervene on behalf of six guerrillas sentenced to death in northern Greece. Although the Greek government has ordered a temporary reprieve of the execution, it has also instructed its representative in New York to oppose the investigation team's intervention. However, a telegram from Friday stated that three guerrillas had already been executed because the order to postpone the execution arrived too late. Reliable sources in New York said that the Greek government's order to postpone the execution expired at midnight on Friday, so all the prisoners had been executed. The UK's opinion is that the scope of the investigation team's activities is not limited to Greece alone, but also includes Bulgaria, South, and Albania, so if it wants to intervene, it must include all four countries, and not just Greece. It is generally expected that if the Security Council decides to intervene, it may lead to a crisis in the Greek government.

### Greece Takes Precautions: Prevents Leftist Activities

[Associated Press, Athens, 8th] The Greek Army Garrison Command and local police stations today ordered all their military and police forces to be on alert, preparing to respond to the illegal demonstrations that the Greek Left-wing Front is rumored to be holding on Sunday. Police and army authorities said that the planned anti-government mass rally would not be held here or in Patras or Thessaloniki.

### U.S. Emphasis: Trade Policy

Congressional and Governmental Opinions Diverge

[United Press International, Washington, 8th] Republican leaders in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives stated today that they may part ways on a significant foreign policy issue: the State Department's authority to reduce tariffs without consulting Congress. While key Republican senators seek a compromise to prevent the immediate repeal of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, key Republican representatives are demanding a complete review of the plan. The chairman of the House Budget Committee announced that the committee will hold a closed-door meeting on the 24th of this month to begin hearing opinions from various parties, signaling disapproval of the

Compromise

It is reported that the compromise has the support of senior State Department officials, stipulating the inclusion of supplementary clauses in agreements with other countries, and granting the President the authority to adjudicate tariffs, thereby protecting the U.S. economy. Accordingly, the ultimate power remains with the President, not Congress, which is opposed by some representatives. The Reciprocal Trade Program aims to establish world trade by allowing the State Department to reduce tariffs by up to 50 percent in return for similar concessions from other countries. According to sources close to Republican Senator Vandenberg, Vandenberg believes that the Republican decision on whether to maintain the

Reciprocal Trade

program seems to partially determine whether a unified foreign policy between the two parties will continue. Vandenberg is a potential Republican presidential candidate in 1948, and he clearly wants to prevent the Republican Party from being labeled "isolationist" by the Democratic Party in the upcoming election campaign. Some senators from Western states share this view. Therefore, if the House of Representatives strongly pushes for a thorough reform plan, the Senate may block its passage. This is one of the main reasons why Vandenberg did not want to accompany Secretary of State Marshall to the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow in March.

### Vandenberg Will Not Run: Next Presidential Candidate

[Agence France-Presse, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 8th] Republican Senator Vandenberg delivered a speech here today, urging labor and management to cease their disputes. He stated: "The current situation in the United States, where labor and management are engaged in unrestricted mutual strangulation, is simply suicidal. The government should adopt new labor laws, especially to replace strike bans. Because strikes damage public property, it is tantamount to civil disorder." At the same time, Vandenberg told the press: "I will not run for the next presidential candidate."

### 13,000 Arrested: Supporters of the Punjab Muslim League

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 8th] Seventy-four of the seventy-nine Muslim League members in the Punjab Provincial Assembly have been arrested due to disturbances by Muslim League members in the province, in violation of the Punjab Public Safety Act. These disturbances have been going on for fourteen days. According to estimates by Muslim League members, 13,000 Muslim League supporters have been arrested.

### Military Uses of Infrared Rays: Wartime Secret Now Revealed

[Reuters, London, 8th] Research on infrared rays was a top secret during the war. Now that the ban has been lifted, it is known that infrared rays were also used in combat. For example, infrared rays were used for signaling, which others could not see but could be received by those with special equipment. The sinking of the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee" and another Japanese battleship by small submarines in the giant floating dock of Bergen, Norway, in September 1944, the cutting of underwater telegraph cables in the Pacific, and the North African landings all used infrared rays. In addition, the secret activities of underground movements, the escape of Allied prisoners, and the Battle of the Bulge at night all relied on infrared guidance. Night combat by the Royal Air Force also used infrared rays for signaling. During the two World Wars, infrared rays were the most magical means of communication for the sea, land, and air. Automatic weapons equipped with automatic infrared sights have also been invented, but because the war ended too early, they were not formally used on the battlefield.

### Atomic Energy Control Plan: U.S. Unwilling to Compromise Vandenberg Makes It Clear to Soviet Union That Eloquence Is of No Practical Use Disarmament Issue at a Standstill

[Reuters, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 8th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg stated here: "We will never unilaterally disarm, as most of the world is still separated by the Iron Curtain. The situation behind the Iron Curtain is difficult to believe without seeing it firsthand. But if there are sanctions against violating disarmament agreements, we are willing to disarm simultaneously with other countries. To show international goodwill, the United States is prepared to give up the benefits of the atomic bomb, but this abandonment must be protected by a perfect inspection and control system, and all countries in the world, especially the Soviet Union, must quickly agree to punish those who violate the agreement. This is the price we demand, and this price must be paid. We will never trust any fickle words, because the agreements of Yalta and Potsdam, as well as the recent promises to Poland, have been broken too many times."

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 9th] The representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union in the Security Council subcommittee have completely conflicting views on the scope of authority of the future Disarmament Committee. United Nations personnel here are quite discouraged and pessimistic. The United States hopes that the organizational law of the Disarmament Committee will stipulate that it should not involve matters within the scope of the Atomic Energy Committee, while the Soviet Union opposes making such a provision in the draft. Therefore, when the Security Council meets on the 11th of this month, there will be a tense atmosphere, and it is expected that the veto power will not be used in the meeting, but the Soviet Union's opposition alone is enough to make the organization of any Disarmament Committee exist in name only. Therefore, before the Security Council votes on this case, both sides will do their best to reach an agreement. In general, the discord between the United States and the Soviet Union arises from suspicion, because the U.S. delegation firmly believes that the Soviet Union hopes that the Disarmament Committee will eventually include the scope and function of the Atomic Energy Committee.

### Palestine Problem: New British Plan Details

Establishment of a Five-Year Trusteeship

[Reuters, London, 8th] The Arab delegation attending the Palestine Conference announced this morning after a meeting at the Egyptian Embassy that they are drafting a reply, which will be submitted to the British delegation on Monday, in response to the British government's recent new plan for Palestine. At the same time, according to Ghori, secretary of the Palestinian Arab Party, the Arabs are clearly dissatisfied with the new British proposal. The Jewish Agency is scheduled to discuss the new British plan tonight. It is reported that the latter's content is to establish a five-year trusteeship and convene a constitutional assembly to decide on a permanent constitution. During the trusteeship period, a Jewish and Arab advisory committee will be established to assist the British central government.

### General Election in Japan: Mid-May Two New Parties to Merge

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 9th] The Japanese Cabinet decided on the 8th to expedite the completion of the parliamentary tasks before the end of March, and to secure the passage of the constitutional subsidiary bills during this period. As for when to dissolve the parliament, it has not been decided because it is related to the election of senators and local elections. Interior Minister Uehara stated today that the date of the general election will be roughly in mid-May.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] According to reports: The Cooperative Democratic Party and the People's Party will merge to prepare for participation in the next general election. This is in response to MacArthur's letter to Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru, instructing him to hold a general election as soon as possible after the current parliamentary session is adjourned. Both parties are new parties with few members. The merger of the two parties will increase the chances of being elected during the election. The merger of the two parties can occupy 78 seats in the parliament, so after the merger, it can become a major party in the current cabinet.

Conflicting Opinions within the Socialist Party

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 9th] Socialist Party members held a meeting today to discuss the issue of forming a coalition cabinet. Unjuro Muto, Mikiji Mori, and others advocated abandoning coalition work. Katsuji Sugimoto, Kanemitsu Yoshikawa, and others supported coalition work. Secretary-General Nishio stated that if a general election is held immediately, coalition work should be abandoned. However, the current parliamentary session has many bills, and the session will inevitably be extended to around April 20, and the general election can only be held around May 20. The establishment of a new cabinet will be between the end of May and the beginning of June. During this period, whether politics can be entrusted to conservative power is worthy of consideration.

### Hunger and Cold: Germans Freeze to Death

Berlin Temperature: Minus 20 Degrees Celsius

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 8th] Berlin was hit by a Siberian cold wave at the end of last year. Residents are suffering from hunger and cold, and many have frozen to death. Last night, another six people froze to death in their homes. This morning, the temperature has dropped to minus 19 degrees Celsius, and it is expected to continue to drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius.

### Berlin Fire

Estimated Deaths and Injuries: About 100 People

[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th Broadcast: A nightclub in the British occupation zone of Berlin caught fire this morning. According to police authorities, the number of deaths and injuries is estimated to be between eighty and one hundred.

### Severe Coal Shortage in Britain: Government Faces Crisis

[United Press International, London, 8th] British industry is on the verge of a large-scale shutdown today. At the same time, a Labor Party spokesman warned that the coal shortage crisis threatens the end of the Labor government, and the rise of socialism is at hand. It is reported that the situation in major industrial areas such as London, Manchester, and Birmingham is chaotic, and four million workers will be unemployed starting at midnight on Sunday.

[Reuters, London, 9th] The Conservative Party will hold a meeting this weekend to discuss the coal shortage crisis. The result may be a motion of no confidence in the government in the House of Commons.

[United Press International, London, 8th] Fuel Minister Shinwell announced in the House of Commons yesterday that half of England was without power due to the lack of coal, and he has now become the target of criticism in British newspapers (including Labor Party newspapers). Three Conservative Party local newspapers said, "Shinwell should get out!" The Labor Party's official newspaper, "Daily Herald," said, "Frankly, we think some cabinet members are just deceiving themselves." Shinwell declined to comment on how long the power outage would last, but the press firmly believes that it will be at least two weeks. A minority of Liberal Party members demanded Shinwell's resignation at a meeting in London, but Shinwell told reporters that he had no intention of resigning.

### Heavy Snow in London

[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th Broadcast: While Britain is implementing power cuts, heavy snow suddenly fell today. It is the biggest snowfall in Britain this winter. In some areas, the snow is up to ten inches thick, bringing already disrupted transportation to a standstill.

### French Cabinet Passes: National Amnesty Decree

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] The French Cabinet met today under the chairmanship of President Auriol and passed a resolution stipulating that the French government will do its best to repatriate the people of Alsace and Lorraine who were conscripted into the army by Hitler to attack France and are still residing in German prisoner camps. Finally, a draft amnesty decree was passed, but collaborators were excluded.

### Eliminate the Red Threat in the U.S.: Republicans Determined to Go All Out House Speaker Martin Says

[United Press International, Washington, 8th] House Speaker Martin told reporters today that the Republican Party will eliminate the red threat in the United States. He said: "The Republican Party will work with the House Un-American Activities Committee to deal with what Committee Chairman Thomas calls the Communist conspiracy. The purpose of the Committee is to eliminate the red threat from the United States and drive it out of the government, because a small number of powerful people occupying strategic positions have launched a campaign to destroy the American system and replace it with communism." Martin added: "They are enemies within the household, occupying prominent positions, trying to shake policies and influence public opinion." According to Thomas, last Thursday's confrontation between the Committee and U.S. Communist Party leader Eisler was just the beginning of a campaign to expose the Communist conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government.

### A Serious Report by the U.S. Government: An Analysis of Soviet Strength (Part 1)

— Abridged Translation by Zhang Deqian

The U.S. Library of Congress recently compiled and printed a book studying the current situation in the Soviet Union at the request of Illinois Representative McKinnon. The book is titled "The Practice of Communism" and is published by the Government Printing Office. The book is based on official archives and carefully analyzed, and it is broad in scope, fair in argument, and very valuable. The following is an abridged translation of the chapter on Soviet military equipment.

Five Five-Year Plans to Catch Up with Britain and the United States

In the twenty-five years from 1946 to 1970, the Soviet Union has set up five five-year plans, preparing to implement them in stages. The Soviet Union's national defense equipment is also largely based on these five-year plans. It can be seen from Stalin's recent speeches that he wants to increase the Soviet Union's military strength to be equal to the current military strength of the United States. Stalin once said that, according to his prediction, future conflicts are unavoidable. He has set several goals for scientific research and agricultural and industrial production (actually military production) so that the Soviet Union can cope with all possible accidents and consequences.

In the five-year plan from 1946 to 1950, one of the main tasks was to continue to improve the Soviet Union's national defense capabilities and supply its army with modern equipment.

This five-year plan places great emphasis on scientific research, especially science related to national defense plans. Atomic research is the top priority. They are using great efforts to urge experts across the country to work hard to catch up with Britain and the United States.

In the five five-year plans from 1946 to 1970, those related to national defense are roughly as follows:

(1) Increase steel production to 60 million tons per year (the United States produced 80 million tons in 1945);

(2) Increase pig iron production to 50 million tons per year (almost equal to the United States' production in 1945);

(3) Produce 500 million tons of coal per year (the United States produced 575 million tons of bituminous coal in 1945);

(4) Produce 420 million barrels of oil per year (the United States produced 1.7 billion barrels of oil in 1945). When studying the above figures, we must remember that the United States' production in 1945 reached such a large number because the war situation was urgent and it tried its best to expand the scope of factories. Now that the war has ended, the United States' production may gradually decline in recent years. At the same time, the Soviet Union is planning to expand the factories established during the war.

The United States has begun to realize that several of its richest resources are about to be depleted. At the same time, the Soviet Union claims that more than half of the world's many minerals and raw materials that are important to industrial development and national defense are located in the Soviet Union. In particular, according to the Soviet Union, more than half of the world's known oil and iron ore are in the hands of the Soviet Union. Agriculture is extremely important to national defense, and only the United States can compare with the Soviet Union in the world.

The Soviet Union government has already planned an industrial dispersal procedure, so that if an enemy country invades in the future, it will never again wipe out its industrial center in one fell swoop. The evacuation procedure was accelerated during the war and is still continuing.

Military Strength May Reach Total of Five Countries in 25 Years

The Soviet Union's current military strength is not comparable to that of the United States. Although it still maintains a strong army, it lost millions of young people in World War II, and the new recruits who were later added have not been trained, and many people have not reached the age of military service. Although the Soviet Union can produce a large number of tanks and artillery, it cannot manufacture long-range aircraft that can compete with others. The Soviet Union's electronics industry is also underdeveloped. The Soviet Union's navy has been greatly strengthened in recent years, but it is still very weak compared to the British and American navies. However, in any case, the Soviet Union's potential military strength is worthy of our close attention.

If Stalin's speech on February 9, 1946, is implemented, then, according to official predictions, the original population of the Soviet Union (that is, the population within the original territory of the Soviet Union before World War II) will increase to 250 million within 20 years. If the Baltic countries incorporated into the Soviet Union after the war are included, the population of the Soviet Union can increase by several million, perhaps more, by 1970. At that time, there may be 32 million men between the ages of 20 and 34 in the original population of the Soviet Union alone, of which 22 million are between the ages of 20 and 29, belonging to the most ideal military service force.

During the same period, the population of the United States will reach 160 million, of which 18 million are men between the ages of 20 and 34, and about 10.5 million are between the ages of 20 and 29.

The 32 million men in the Soviet Union in 1970 are almost equal to the sum of the military-age manpower of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy.

### Assembly to Promote Domestic Products Turns Into Brawl One of Twelve Injured Dies 17 Arrested and Released on Bail After Police Station Interrogation to be Transferred to Court this Morning on Disorderly Conduct Charges

Yesterday morning, someone, in the name of the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Products and Resisting American Goods," convened a preparatory meeting. Most of the participants, after arriving at the meeting, discovered that the gathering had political motives and was not a movement to promote domestic goods, so they rose up in opposition, leading to a brawl in which as many as twelve people were injured. Among them, Liang Renda (clerk in the Western shoe department of Wing On Company, Cantonese, 30 years old) died of serious injuries. The circumstances are as follows:

Distributing Leaflets and Singing Anti-American Songs

At nine o'clock yesterday morning, someone, in the name of the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Products and Resisting American Goods," convened workers from various labor unions to hold a preparatory meeting. The meeting address stated in the notice was the Xindu Restaurant. After receiving the notice, the various labor unions, unaware of the truth, mostly sent representatives to participate. There was no one at Xindu, and it was rumored that it had been changed to the upstairs of the Daxin Company, but the result was the same. Finally, they learned that it was being held on the third floor of the China Industrial Bank Building at 334 Nanjing Road. There were more than a hundred participants in succession. The meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo and Deng Chumin, and "A Letter to People from All Walks of Life on Promoting Domestic Products and Resisting American Goods," as well as songs such as "American Goods Are Evil Spirits," "Rascals Who Create Internal Strife," "Can't Drive Away the American Troops, We Are Not Satisfied," and "American Troops, Get Out Quickly" were distributed on the spot. A portion of the participants rose up and sang in unison. At the same time, Luo Longji, Ma Xulun, Ma Yinchu, and others continued to arrive, but left shortly thereafter.

Sudden Brawl, Great Disorder

Most of the participants had originally come to promote domestic goods, but after arriving at the meeting, they realized that it was not a movement to promote domestic goods, but an anti-American movement with political motives, so they rose up in opposition. For a time, there was great disorder, leading to a brawl. During the brawl, some people shouted slogans such as "Down with the National Government." After the Huangpu Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau received a report, it immediately dispatched police to suppress and maintain order. Eighteen members of the crowd involved in the brawl (one of whom, Liang Renda, was seriously injured and transferred to Renji Hospital for treatment) were taken to the Huangpu Branch. Eleven of them were slightly injured. After arriving at the bureau, they were accompanied by police officers from the branch to Renji Hospital for bandaging and then returned to the bureau. After being questioned by the Second Section, they were released on bail separately at dusk yesterday. The case will be transferred to the court for handling this morning on charges of disrupting public order.

List of Seventeen People

The list of the seventeen people taken to the bureau and released that evening is as follows: (1) Cao Zhenkun (China Textile First Factory), (2) Shen Xiafeng (China Tobacco Company), (3) Wang Yuxiang (worker), (4) Wang Fugen (China Textile Sixteenth Factory), (5) Cai Futian (worker), (6) Meng Zhisheng (worker), (7) Chen Xunquan (resident of the Guo Huo Company dormitory), (8) Li Baxiong (clerk at the Sun Sun Company), (9) Sun Shoukang (clerk at the Sincere Company), (10) Yang Jun (worker, resident of the Sun Sun Company dormitory), (11) Shen Shikui (resident of the Guo Huo Company dormitory), (12) Du Xuesan (Guanshengyuan), (13) Xu Weicheng (Sun Sun Company outlet), (14) Liu Zongde (Kang Le Restaurant), (15) Li Ruichun (Wing On Company), (16) Zeng Yongquan (Wing On Company), (17) Song Yong (Wing On Company).

### Deputy Director Yu Visits the Injured

Furthermore, Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, specially accompanied Zhang Renyou, Director of the Huangpu Branch, to Renji Hospital at three o'clock yesterday afternoon to visit Liang Renda, who was seriously injured. At that time, Liang was already in a coma. After the doctor diagnosed him with "fractured base of the skull, concussion and bleeding," Yu instructed the doctor to treat him carefully and comforted Liang's family. Later, Deputy Director Yu personally inquired about the five people brought to the bureau at the Huangpu Branch. Liang Renda died of his injuries at 4:30 p.m.

### Deceased Liang Renda: Parents Deceased, Recently Married

Last night, the reporter visited the residence of Liang Renda, who was brutally killed in a brawl, at No. 6, Yongle New Village, Zhejiang North Road. At that time, Liang's aunt, Liang Qu, had just returned home from the Huangpu Branch in tears. According to her, "The deceased was thirty years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong. He studied at Pui Ching English School in Hong Kong. After coming to Shanghai, he served in the shoe department of Wing On Company for more than ten years. At eight o'clock this morning, he went to the company from home. At about ten o'clock, I heard that there was a fight, so I accompanied his wife to the company to look for him, but we couldn't find him. So we returned home. Unexpectedly, at four o'clock, the hospital sent a car to inform us that he was injured. He died at half-past four. Afterwards, I heard that after he went to the company, someone told him that there was a meeting at the Quangong Building, so he went with them. Unexpectedly, he was beaten and injured in the stairwell." She continued, "Liang got married last May. His wife, Gao Shaoshan, also works in the ticket department of Wing On's third factory. She is currently five months pregnant. He usually has no savings, and his future life will be a problem." She also said, "The deceased's parents died when he was young. He was raised by his uncle and me. It is very unjust that he has suffered this misfortune. Currently, only two colleagues from Wing On Company are helping to take care of the aftermath. I have gone to the Huangpu Branch to ask for justice. I was instructed to go with my niece-in-law again at nine o'clock tomorrow morning."

### Yu Shuping's Statement: Those Involved in the Brawl Have Been Released on Bail Will Spare No Expense to Treat the Injured

Police Bureau Deputy Director Yu Shuping made a statement to reporters at four o'clock yesterday afternoon, expressing two points regarding the Nanjing Road brawl yesterday morning: (1) The bureau did not receive a notice of this morning's worker gathering in advance. The Police Bureau is an organization responsible for the security of the entire Shanghai area. Anyone who disrupts social order and tranquility has the right to be stopped and arrested. Therefore, after the brawl occurred, the police bureau rushed to the scene upon receiving the alarm and immediately carried out their duties. Regardless of the inside story of the brawl, anyone who was found to be fighting was arrested. Now, upon receiving instructions from the mayor, all those arrested have been granted bail. The bail procedures are currently being processed, and they can all be released on bail before tonight (that is, yesterday). This case will be transferred to the local court for handling in accordance with the law. (2) Director Zhang of the Huangpu Branch and I specially went to Renji Hospital at three o'clock this afternoon to visit Liang Renda, who was the most seriously injured in this brawl and is being treated at Renji Hospital. Mr. Liang was injured in the head and is currently in a coma. I have instructed the attending physician to spare no expense on medical supplies and do their best to treat him.

### If Foreknowledge Existed, Incident Believed Avoidable: Huangpu Branch Chief Responds on Two Points

Following the clashes yesterday morning stemming from a "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Boycotting American Goods" meeting, at around 6:00 PM, while the Huangpu Branch was processing bail for those involved in the mutual assault, Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Ma Yinchu, Hu Ziying, and others, representing the "China Academic Workers Association," visited the branch to express their condolences to the injured. Guo and others posed two questions to Branch Chief Zhang: (1) Why did this morning's incident degenerate so badly? (2) How will the police handle this case? Branch Chief Zhang responded: "(1) The police were unaware of this morning's meeting beforehand. It was only after the fighting broke out that the bureau learned that the clash was due to the meeting. Upon receiving the report, the bureau immediately dispatched officers to maintain order and brought those involved in the mutual assault to the station to be dealt with according to the law. Had the police been aware of this morning's gathering in advance, we believe this unfortunate incident would not have occurred. (2) Mutual assault constitutes a disturbance of public order and a threat to peace. This case will be transferred to the court for handling. All those arrested for assault, except for Liang Renda who was sent to the hospital for treatment, will be released on bail before tonight."

### Suggestion for Private Management of Central District Fire Brigade: Chen Tingrui Provides Concrete Plan

[Report from Our Newspaper] Councilor Chen Tingrui, regarding the major fire on Seymour Road and Wuding Road, previously suggested to the Municipal Council that the Central District Fire Brigade be converted to private management. The council then submitted the matter to the Police Affairs Committee for resolution, requesting Mr. Chen to provide a concrete plan for submission to the plenary session for discussion. It is now learned that the council has received Mr. Chen's reply to the chairman and vice-chairman, first outlining the drawbacks of the city's central district fire service: (1) Authority cannot be unified. The superiors' time and energy are largely spent on bureaucratic formalities, so that even after lengthy official correspondence, concrete results are often not achieved. (2) The fire department lacks specialized personnel. New aerial ladder trucks and chemical fire extinguishers cannot be used effectively due to the lack of trained operators. (3) Firefighters' salaries are meager, insufficient for basic needs, resulting in a situation where superiors lose dignity and subordinates disregard discipline. Firefighters are certainly responsible to the citizens when they fail to perform their duties, but is the government not also responsible to the firefighters and the citizens when it fails to do its job? It is unfair to place all the responsibility on the firefighters. (4) Funding is severely inadequate. (5) Firefighting technology is declining.

Next, he argued that the only way to improve the Shanghai fire service is through private management, outlining the advantages as follows: (1) Unified authority. No need to worry about interference. (2) Besides higher-level staff and specialized personnel, the fire department can use a volunteer system, which can greatly reduce expenses. (3) Volunteer firefighters have a sense of service and dedication. (4) All matters managed privately will avoid bureaucratization. The addition of equipment and the purchase of spare parts can all be done openly, eliminating opportunities for corruption.

### US Military Tribunal Concludes; Director Yangge Remains in Shanghai

The US Military Tribunal in China, since the execution of its work in trying Japanese and German war criminals, from the autumn of 1945 to the spring of this year, has been working for two years, having tried successively the Hankou murder case, the case of the victims of the Doolittle pilots, and the German Nazi espionage case, and other cases large and small, for a total of twenty cases. Since the conclusion of the Ohlhaver case, the work of the US Military Tribunal has also come to an end, and the personnel of the US War Crimes Investigation Committee have also returned to their countries one after another, but Colonel Yangge, the director of the committee, is still in Shanghai, because the US military still has a few cases that have not been concluded, and the work of repatriating German war criminals must also be handled, so he will stay for a while.

### Urging Repayment of Old Debts: Former Shanghai Municipal Council Employees Form Compensation Committee, Demand Calculation Based on Cost of Living Index, Large Sum Poses Financial Burden for Municipal Government

[Report from Our Newspaper] Former employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council have been demanding repayment of their retirement funds, savings funds, and pension funds since the victory, but have not yet received a resolution. After Mayor Wu took office last year, he organized the Shanghai Municipal Former Concession Official. The Claims and Debts Liquidation Committee established a team specifically to discuss this matter, but due to various difficulties, it could not be resolved immediately. The French Municipal Council portion is still under investigation for matters such as account books and personnel lists. The Municipal Council portion is said to have drafted a plan, but despite repeated inquiries by reporters, officials have kept its contents secret. According to a municipal government official who spoke to our reporter, if calculated according to the current cost of living index, the amount would be roughly equivalent to the entire municipal government budget for this year, which is clearly beyond the financial capacity of the local government.

According to the Treaty on the Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China, signed by the British, American, and Chinese governments on January 11, 1943, it stipulates that the Chinese government inherits all the claims and debts of the former Municipal Council and is responsible for handling them. Therefore, former Municipal Council employees believe that the Chinese government should respect the treaty, fulfill this obligation, and repay their retirement, pension, and savings funds. Since the treaty was signed by the central government, the repayment should also be the responsibility of the central government, not a matter for the local government. If the amount is said to be too large, the government has profited greatly from the sale of enemy and puppet assets, far exceeding this amount, and a portion of it could be allocated for this purpose.

### Insist on Full Payment Before the End of March

The colleagues of the former Shanghai Municipal Council Association, including the general office, finance office, tax office, engineering office, health office, education office, fire department, Chinese office, and legal office, a total of 5,700 Chinese employees (excluding the police department), specifically organized a compensation committee, which hosted reporters yesterday afternoon to publish a statement to people from all walks of life, demanding that the government authorities make full payment before the end of March this year, and resolutely demanded that it be calculated according to the cost of living index at the time of payment, because this amount is based on the base salary deducted in the Republic of China 25th year. The authorities once intended to issue it based on the December index of more than 5,000 times, but even now, the index has risen to more than 8,000 times. Prolonging it in this way is only detrimental to the government. It is estimated that the average savings per person are about 4,000 yuan.

In addition, regarding the calculation of dates, they firmly believe that Chinese employees should be treated completely equally with British and American employees.

### If Aircraft Accidents Reoccur, Prosecutions for Negligent Homicide Will Be Pursued; Pilots from Two Airlines Despondent, Submit Resignations

Passenger transport on the China and Central Airlines has been ordered to resume by the Ministry of Communications last Friday. However, the two companies' passenger aircraft have not yet resumed flights as of last week. It is understood that because preparatory work is not yet ready, resumption of flights will be delayed for two or three days. However, postal and cargo transportation are still operating as usual for both companies. According to other sources, the heads of flight operations for both companies have been informed by the district attorney's office that if passenger aircraft accidents reoccur, the district attorney's office will file public charges of negligent homicide against the heads of flight operations. As such, the heads of flight operations for both companies believe that passenger aircraft accidents cannot be predicted by human effort, and that the flight operations departments cannot guarantee absolute safety for future passenger transport, and have submitted their resignations to the company authorities. In addition to retaining flight operations personnel to continue working with peace of mind, the company is submitting a request to the Ministry of Communications for instructions on how to handle the situation.

Yesterday, Shanghai held a parade of refugees and child refugees to promote vaccinations (photographed by this newspaper).

### Elimination of a Menace on the Beijing-Shanghai Night Train: Notorious Thief Liu Hangxia and Accomplices to Appear in Court Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the capture of Liu Hangxia, the leader of the "Four Famous Mountains" gang of thieves, the Railway Bureau Police Department yesterday released a detailed account of the case's resolution. According to Liu's confession: They impersonated air force personnel and specialized in stealing from passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai night train, only targeting large sums of money. They committed numerous crimes over the past two months, and the exact number could no longer be remembered. When asked by the Railway Bureau Police Department where the stolen money went, they replied that it was spent on hotels and dance halls. When asked which dance hostesses they were friendly with at the dance halls, they replied that Lu Ping and Da Luo (another accomplice of Liu's) were relatively close, like mistresses. She works the late shift at the Da Hu Dance Hall. Liu Jinshan (another accomplice) had a relatively affectionate and close relationship with Zhang Meihua, a hostess at the MGM Dance Hall. However, according to a letter from Lu Ping yesterday, she stated: "Having read the news in your newspaper on February 9 about the arrest of notorious thief Liu Hangxia, which included a photo of myself, I have investigated and found that I have never had any dealings with this Mr. Liu, and I certainly did not give him my photo. I previously had a photo that I was planning to give to a Filipino musician colleague, but it was discovered missing from my purse. The back of the photo has a note indicating it was intended as a gift to a foreign colleague, which can serve as proof, and I am from Zhejiang Province, so the report of overseas Chinese Lu Ping is also untrue." Liu, Zhang, and the other three criminals are scheduled to be brought to the District Attorney's Office today.

### Military Criminals Meeting Amnesty Requirements: Twenty-Nine More Released

Yesterday, the Shanghai Prison continued to release 29 military criminals who met the requirements for amnesty.

### Various Trade Unions Issue Declaration, Detail Deceptive Participation, Request Government Thoroughly Investigate the Organizing Body

The various trade unions of Shanghai City, regarding the incident yesterday (the ninth) in which many workers were deceived into participating in the "Promote Domestic Goods and Boycott American Goods" meeting and were assaulted, issued a declaration as follows:

"Dear Compatriots: Yesterday, we, the various trade unions, received a notice from the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Boycotting American-Made Goods," asking us to attend a meeting at the Xindu Theater at the intersection of Wenben Road and Tianjin Road at 9:00 AM today to discuss the promotion of domestic goods. The notice stated at the outset that the purpose of the gathering was "to promote domestic goods and save the industrial and commercial crisis." We workers feel the pain of industrial and commercial depression the most, and work hard every day to increase production and support this difficult situation. "Promoting domestic goods" has long been a demand in our hearts. Therefore, we, with a sense of enthusiasm, yesterday evening rushed to the Xindu Theater this morning. After arriving, two friends wearing red flowers on their lapels changed the location, saying that the meeting would be held at the Workers' Building, so I rushed to the Workers' Building again, but when we arrived, the meeting seemed to be already in progress. Mr. Guo Moruo and Mr. Deng Chumin were on the stage, and some people in the audience were singing the four songs "American Troops Get Out Quickly," "Can't Drive Away the Americans," "Bastards Creating Civil War," and "American Goods Are Harmful" The lyrics did not mention the promotion of domestic goods at all, except to stir up anti-American sentiments. We began to feel uneasy, and thought to ourselves, it must be some party using the slogan of "promoting domestic goods" to launch its "anti-American behavior." While hesitating, suddenly the shouts of "Down with the Nationalist Government" and "Support the Communist Party" were raised, and at this point, the true colors were completely exposed. We, this group of workers, were just like many other people in the hall, and a feeling of indignation after being deceived suddenly surged in our hearts. We questioned those friends wearing red flowers and holding leather bags, why were they not "promoting domestic goods" but focusing on "driving out American troops" and "overthrowing the Nationalist Government." Unexpectedly, these words offended those friends wearing red flowers, and without allowing any explanation, they opened their mouths and cursed "saboteurs," shouted "fight," and tables, chairs, and benches all flew over, and the innocent masses were knocked down. After the incident, it was learned that seven people were injured, one of whom had died from serious injuries. I never thought that people who sing the praises of "democracy" and "freedom" would use such shameless means to fool good workers and make them sacrifices for their political infighting. It's really chilling!

The people's eyes are bright, and this kind of trick can only deceive for a while, and cannot deceive us. Although workers have low knowledge, we are confident that we can judge right from wrong, and we will never be used by a few people with ulterior motives. This deception makes people feel as insulted as being raped. We will not play with moving terms, nor will we use flowery language. We will just honestly present the facts to the public and ask for justice and sympathy from fair-minded people.

Finally, we would like to express our attitude with a solemn mood. (1) We will firmly support the movement to promote domestic goods, and we ask the Municipal Council of this city to lead all sectors of society and immediately organize a movement organization that truly represents the public opinion to promote domestic goods and study the active promotion. (2) We will resolutely oppose stealing the slogan of "promoting domestic goods" to engage in political conspiracy. (3) We believe that the "Preparatory Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Boycotting American Goods" should be fully responsible for this unfortunate incident.

### Miraculous and Profound: Youth at Hongqiao School for the Blind Regains Sight After Fifteen Years of Blindness Thanks to Skillful Healing of Austrian Eye Specialist Professor Fuchs, Saving Him from Darkness and Despair

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Even if this is not a miracle, it is at least a rare occurrence in the world. A young man who has been blind for fifteen years, after undergoing miraculous surgery by Austrian eye specialist Professor Fuchs, can now see the light again. This will not only make the beneficiary happy, but I believe everyone who hears this news will feel how magical and profound the things in this world are, and Professor Fuchs' skillful healing technique cannot but be admired and amazed.

Blind Since Three Years Old

This lucky man's name is Wang Dawei, and he is 20 years old this year, from Zhangzhou, Fujian. According to what he told reporters, he went blind in both eyes when he was three years old. Later, he was taken to Singapore by a foreigner for treatment, but it was ineffective, so he was sent to the Shanghai School for the Blind when he was seven years old. When he first came, he could still see some sunlight, but later it became deeper and deeper, until he lost all light. After spending thirteen years at the School for the Blind, although he was able to get comfort materially for these past ten years, everything in front of him was darkness and despair. Like a gift from heaven, Professor Fuchs came to China from Vienna four months ago to lecture, and took up the exclusive task of treating students in the School for the Blind. Professor Fuchs began to examine the eyes of more than 80 students, and found that there were two who could still be restored to sight, one of the two was Wang Dawei.

Eye Bulge Hole Allows Him to See Objects

Professor Fuchs studied Wang Dawei's eyes and found that his right eye had hope, but the surgery was very complicated. If he used the ordinary method of transplanting someone else's eye, it would not work, so he made a hole in his eyeball. The result of the surgery was very good. In just over 20 days, Dawei was able to see fingers from four meters away, and people standing in the middle of the lawn and the windows opposite could be seen. Professor Fuchs said: "In a few months, his eyesight will gradually recover, but now he has to learn to use the help of his eyes to walk and see things. After the membrane is clear, he can distinguish the bait color." In fact, Dawei was able to correctly identify seven or eight of the colors of the scarves worn by many reporters he saw yesterday. He can also speak some not-too-bad English and knows a few English words. After this, he will start to study Chinese well and read formally.

In addition, another person looking forward to seeing the light again is a mountain boy named Shao Encheng, who is seven years old this year, and will have surgery within the next week. Let's pray for him so that this child can also escape the dark world.

Meagerly Operated School for the Blind

The Hongqiao Road School for the Blind was founded 35 years ago by the British man, Mr. Fryer. When it first opened, it had funds of US$70,000 and 50,000 taels of silver. Later, it bought some stocks and relied on interest to maintain it. Today, it has reached the point of exhaustion. After the old Mr. Fryer died, his son George inherited his father's ambition and continued to run it. Now he is going to the United Kingdom and the United States to study new education methods, preparing to return and give greater benefits to blind children in China. During his absence from the school, it is represented by Bao Sang, and Vice President He Zijian has been serving at the school for more than 30 years, asking questions about child-rearing education and doing his best.

School Building Is Clean Everywhere

When the reporters were led to visit the School for the Blind, they found that everything was extremely clean. Professor Fuchs repeatedly said to the reporters that the first thing that surprised and moved him when he first came was that the school was very clean everywhere. He said that he had never seen a blind place that was so clean, and that these tasks of tidying up the grass and trees, moving stones, and sweeping were all done by the blind children themselves. At this time, he was busy introducing Ms. Ye Chonghua, the director of the girls' department, and Mrs. Bao, saying that they were both the results of their supervision. In the middle of the courtyard, the places where you turn the corner are all paved with stones (the rest is cement), which is specially used as a sign for blind children to walk.

When Leaving, He Had Endless Emotions

The school's expenses are very tight, and the handicrafts made by the students can be sold at the school, but the income is very limited. Their standard for fees is that those who have money pay, and those who cannot are exempt. According to regulations, the tuition and accommodation fee for half a year is 410,000 yuan, but only one-tenth can pay. Therefore, all expenses can only rely on donations to survive. Acting Principal Bao showed a sad face and accompanied the reporters to visit the only broken typewriter in the school, saying: This typewriter is really 20 years old. If you want to teach students to learn to type, but there is no money to buy a typewriter, I hope to borrow a corner of the newspaper to appeal to any typewriter store to donate one or two old typewriters, which can also be used reluctantly, which will be very beneficial to the students.

When we watched a group of innocent and lively children. Standing in the sun and playing, but they can't see the sun, everyone's heart will be filled with a sad and regrettable mood, we hope that there will be many Professor Fuchs in the world to save every blind person from the darkness.

### Taikoo Wharf Labor Dispute: Mediation Failed Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] The labor dispute over the scramble for wharf labor at the Taikoo Company has not yet been resolved. Mayor Wu recently summoned labor leaders Chen Shanyu and Zhou Ruisun, among others, to mediate the dispute. Zhou Ruisun was ordered to be detained after making disparaging remarks against officials, and Mayor Wu has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to be responsible for handling his outstanding matters and has ordered Chen Shanyu to use more experienced workers. Zhao Banfu, director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, specifically convened negotiations between Chen and Zhou at noon yesterday in the office of Deputy Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau. Attendees included Chen Shanyu, Zheng Ziliang, Cai Wen'er, Hou Mengfang, Zhou Chengxiang, and others. On the Taikoo Company side, except for Chen Shanyu, all were Zhou's workers. The meeting was chaired by Director Zhao, who briefly stated that legal matters would not be discussed at today's meeting, but rather matters of friendship. In order to resolve the matter, Chen Shanyu was asked to propose a good strategy so that a satisfactory result could be achieved. Zhou's workers dispersed in a huff because Chen Shanyu did not make any response at the time, resulting in the meeting being fruitless. The Social Affairs Bureau will report to the mayor again, requesting that he find a solution.

### Shanghai Tobacco Industry Union Welcomes Zhou Xuexiang's Return to China

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the factory unions and the first, second, third, and fourth district unions of the Shanghai tobacco industry jointly held a tea party at the Atlantic Restaurant to welcome Mr. Zhou Xuehu, who had attended the International Labor Conference and returned to China.

He expressed his hope that Chinese workers must strive for progress in production, promote labor-management cooperation, strengthen unity, and fulfill their national responsibilities. Afterwards, Counselor Ge, Secretary-General Xie, and others delivered speeches with many words of encouragement. The atmosphere at the meeting was unusually enthusiastic, and it adjourned at around 6:00 p.m.

### Fire on Huangpi South Road

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out at No. 508 Huangpi South Road due to careless use of a kerosene stove.

### Reporting Concubine Smoking Morphine Leads to Arrest of Several Drug Dealers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Quanzhi, a local resident living in a straw shed on Jiaxing Road Bridge, reported to the Hongkou Police Station at around 8:00 p.m. on the 13th, accusing his concubine, Bok Jinmei, a Korean woman (33 years old, living in a straw shed on Xingjiaqiao Road), of smoking morphine, stating that his attempts to dissuade her had been ineffective, and he was making this report out of anger. He also reported Chen Cuiying, a young woman who sells drugs, 26 years old, living at No. 63 Fengshengli, North Sichuan Road. After the head of the criminal division ordered Inspector Jiang Tianfu, staff member Ma Jiaxu, Sergeant Xu Daren, and officers Yang Weiguang and Tang Cuncai to investigate, they first detained Chen at the station. According to her confession: The drugs she was selling were purchased from Liu Zongyao at the Jincheng Photo Studio on Beijing Road. The police then arrested Liu, who confessed: He was friends with Zhang Adong, and the drugs were supplied by Zhang. The police then detained Zhang at No. 164 North Jiangxi Road and seized 13 taels of morphine, a mixing bowl, three taels of lactose powder, and a small scale at his home. According to his confession, the morphine was purchased from Gao Yiming at No. 20 Continental New Village, Shigaota Road, and the three taels of lactose powder were purchased from Li Linsheng at Room 417 of the Datong Hotel. The police immediately escorted Zhang to the aforementioned hotel, but Li Linsheng had already fled upon hearing the news. They continued to Shigaota Road and finally captured the ringleader, Gao Yiming (40 years old), and confiscated 9.45 million yuan in stored legal tender.

### A Complete Record of the History of Shanghai City

— Special Article by This Newspaper

Thirty years ago, people who came to Shanghai for sightseeing considered it a strange thing that there were no city walls. Shanghai was at the forefront of adopting new trends, and it had already implemented the demolition of the city walls and the construction of roads after the change of dynasty. Although demolishing the city walls in Shanghai was easier than in other places, building them was inferior. It was built in the thirty-second year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty due to disturbances by Japanese pirates, and it was not until the third year of the Republic of China that the reconstruction of the roads was completed, a history of only 360 years.

Originally, Shanghai was a desolate beach, inhabited only by a very small number of fishermen. It was not until the twenty-ninth year of the Zhizheng reign of the Yuan Dynasty that it was renamed Shanghai County. Even after being renamed a county, it took another 261 years before the county town was built. This was because the people of the coastal areas were strong and brave, often practiced martial arts, and were able to defend themselves, so pirates did not dare to visit easily. Moreover, there were not many officials at that time, and the finances were meager, so it was impossible to raise the funds for building the city. Therefore, they spent more than 200 years under the open door policy.

By the middle of the Ming Dynasty, commerce was flourishing, the number of households gradually increased, and wealthy families also moved to the county seat. At that time, Japanese pirates roamed the seas, and Shanghai had also been visited several times. On the nineteenth day of the fourth month of the thirty-second year of the Jiajing reign, Japanese pirates arrived again, their forces were very rampant, and they attacked places such as Zheng Lianbin Bridge. The county magistrate Yu Xianke fled, and the county was severely ravaged. In the fifth month, the Gaochangdu naval forces were defeated by Japanese pirates, the citizens fled, allowing them to plunder at will, and the county government office was reduced to ashes. In the sixth month, pirates from Jinshan sailed in ships to threaten Shanghai. In two months, they suffered consecutive disasters, so the officials and citizens began to realize the importance of defense, and then proposed the construction of the city.

Before the thirty-second year of the Jiajing reign, the local gentleman Gu Congli had requested to build the city, but it was not reviewed by the Ministry of Works. The Japanese pirates had already arrived, so it was not built. At that time, Shanghai repeatedly suffered from pirate disasters, causing great pain and suffering. Fang Lian, the prefect of Songjiang, saw the people suffering miserably from plunder and proposed building the city. So he gathered the people to plan, collect land taxes, and take out the surplus from the treasury to cover the expenses. He ordered the assistant magistrate Li Guoji to supervise the construction, and immediately surveyed the site and started construction in the ninth month, rushing to build day and night, and it was completed in two months.

When discussing the construction of the city, wealthy families were unwilling to demolish their houses and donate land because property prices were quite high, so there were many opponents. Later, many gentlemen who understood the principles and were eager to do good deeds for the public first donated funds to demolish their houses to help with the construction, so that the opponents had no excuse and had to obey the will of the people and reluctantly support it. The expenses were insufficient, so they relied on donations from the locals. Among them, Wang Xiangyao was the first person to demolish his house and donate land, contributing all his wealth to help with the project. Although the city was built, he had changed from rich to poor. Gong Sheng Zhang Pan not only scattered his family property to help, but also personally held armor and participated in the work, eventually dying from overwork. Lady Mei, the wife of Lu Wenyu, donated 2,000 taels of silver and destroyed thousands of houses in the market, which was also rare among women.

This newly built Shanghai county town had a circumference of nine li, a height of two zhang and four chi, and six city gates: Chaozong, Kualong, Yifeng, Yanhai, Baodai, and Chaoyang. There were only three water gates: one each across the Zhaojiabang in the east and west, and another across the Fangbang. The city wall had more than 3,600 battlements and two watchtowers. The city moat was more than 1,500 zhang long, six zhang wide, and one zhang and seven chi deep, surrounding the city and connected to the tides. In the first month of the second year after the city walls were built, Japanese pirates arrived, approaching the city. But this time, with the city walls, the investigating censor Dong Bangzheng closed the city and defended it firmly, and the Japanese pirates were never able to enter the city. After that, they were attacked many times, but they did not break into the city.

### A Casual Talk About the East and West City Gates: One is an International Trade Market, the Other is a Gathering Place for Religions

Shanghai City is located east of the Huangpu River. Before the concessions were opened, the county town was the most bustling place. Ships came along the Huangpu River, and the Pudong waterfront of the city became the focus of the dock. Therefore, there was an international trade market here very early. The Xiaodongmen (Small East Gate) and Dadongmen (Great East Gate) were places where merchants gathered.

Now, outside of Minguo Road, between Zhoushan Road and Gaoqiao Road, there is a short road called Yanghang Street, which is the earliest place where foreign firms concentrated. This Yanghang Street was already recorded in the Shanghai County Chronicles revised in the nineteenth year of the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty, which shows its long history. At the same time, Yanghang Street became famous not after the opening of the five ports for trade. In the beginning, there were two parallel streets, Inner Yanghang Street and Outer Yanghang Street, but now only one remains.

Old Site of the Customs

The Shanghai Customs was also initially located outside the East Gate. When the sea ban was abolished in the twenty-third year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, the customs was established in the following year, called the "Jianghai Great Customs." Facing the Huangpu River and sitting in the middle, ships entering the port had to pass through there. In the twenty-third year of the Daoguang reign, Shanghai was opened as a commercial port, and then British and French expatriates opened concessions in the north of the city. As a result, the commerce in the northern part of the city gradually flourished, and the prosperity of the southern part of the city was gradually taken away. The Shanghai Daotai then built a new customs house outside the North Gate, also known as the North Customs. The Great Customs at Xiaodongmen became the South Customs, also known as the Old Customs.

As for the West Gate, the first thing that should be mentioned is Huangjiaque Road, which was the former residence of Huang Ming in the Yuan Dynasty. His residence was called Xijiao Yequxuan (West Suburban Wild Interest Pavilion), and people called him Mr. Xijiao (Mr. West Suburb). At that time, although Shanghai had been established as a county, there was still no county town. The county seat was located in the center of the old city, so "Xijiao" (West Suburb) was equivalent to the later "outside the West Gate."

Temple of Literature Park

The Temple of Literature Park is particularly beneficial for people living in the Ximen (West Gate) area, just like the convenience for people living near Zhongshan Park and Fuxing Park. The Temple of Literature was originally a building to commemorate Confucius, and every city and county in the country has one. Shanghai's Temple of Literature has a history of more than 600 years, but in those 600 years, the temple site has changed five times. The current Temple of Literature was built only more than 80 years ago, after Shanghai opened as a port. Initially, the town school was changed to a county school in the first year of the Zhenyuan reign of the Yuan Dynasty (1295), located northeast of Fangbang Bridge and Changsheng Bridge. Soon after, it was moved to the current Jingye Road, and the temple base was slightly expanded. In the third year of the Zhida reign (1310), it was decided to move again, purchasing more than 50 mu of farmland in the Xiangsha field area to build a new school palace, and the Temple of Literature began to be related to the West Gate. In the first year of the Yanyou reign (1314), the county magistrate Wang Gui moved it back to its old home. This time it lasted a long time, and the temple site became more and more grand, safely passing through more than 500 years. Until the third year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty (1853), the Small Swords Society occupied Shanghai County, and the Temple of Literature became their headquarters for issuing orders. When the Small Swords Society withdrew, the temple's halls and ancestral halls were almost completely destroyed. After the war was quelled, construction was started to rebuild it, which is the current Temple of Literature. The Temple of Literature moved several times between the east and west gates, and finally returned to the West Gate.

Ten Directions Forest of Karma

The West Gate can be said to be a gathering place for religions. In addition to the Temple of Literature, the center of Confucianism, there is also a center of Taoism, namely the Baiyun Temple on Fangxie Road, which was founded in the eighth year of the Guangxu reign (1882). Initially, it was just a small Leizu Temple. After six years, it received the Taoist canon and was modeled after the example of the Baiyun Temple in Beijing, and was named "Ten Directions Forest of Karma," and renamed Baiyun Temple.

Christianity also had a share in the West Gate. There was a Biwen Girls' School and a Women's and Children's Hospital, both run by the church. Biwen Girls' School was established in memory of Bi Zhwen, an American Congregational minister. The Women's and Children's Hospital was founded by Rose Nader, a missionary of the American Women's Missionary Society, in the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. These two undertakings run by the church, together with the Temple of Literature and Baiyun Temple, formed a three-legged balance in the West Gate.

### Opening of the Xiaonanmen (Small South Gate) – A Little Anecdote

The Xiaonanmen existed when the county town was first built, as written clearly in the Wanli County Chronicles. Another theory is that it was opened for the Yu Linglong stone in the Yuyuan Garden of the Town God Temple, which seems to have been after the other five gates. But calculating it, this matter is not far from the Jiajing renovation of the city, that is, before Wanli, which is also inconsistent with the facts. Let's write it down for now, so that people who study Shanghai's history can verify it.

Yuyuan Garden was originally the villa of Pan En, a Ming Dynasty minister. There is a Xiangxuetang (Fragrant Snow Hall) inside, which is one of the famous scenic spots in the garden. There are three large stones in front of the hall, all of which are very precious. Among them, the one named Yu Linglong is the largest, more than ten feet high, with a cyan-black color and ten thousand holes, which is even more precious.

This stone was originally an old object of the Nanyuan Garden in Sanlinzhuang, Pudong. When Chu Yu retired to the forest, he often stroked this stone for self-entertainment. He once put an incense burner at the bottom of the stone, and green smoke curled out of every hole in the stone. He also poured a basin of water from the top of the stone, and water flowed from all the holes in the stone. The name Yu Linglong is truly not an exaggeration.

Chu Yu and Pan En were relatives by marriage. Chu's daughter married Pan's son Yunliang. After Chu died without an heir, Yunliang moved this Yu Linglong stone to his own Yuyuan Garden.

Sanlinzhuang is more than ten miles away from Shanghai County, and there is a river between them. It cost a lot of money to transport this stone. Unexpectedly, when crossing the river, a storm broke out, and the welcoming boat and the stone sank into the river together. So they hired good swimmers to search underwater, and used huge ropes to tie the stone and drag it ashore. At that time, there was another stone at the bottom of the water, which was also picked up when tying the rope. It turned out to be the base of the Yu Linglong stone. The coincidence of nature is truly a blessing in disguise.

After the Yu Linglong stone and its base were dragged ashore, they also complained that the road to the city gate was too far. At that time, the local gentry were powerful and directly destroyed the city walls to enter. This gap in the city wall that was destroyed because of Yu Linglong was not only never repaired afterwards, but was instead changed into a city gate, which is the Xiaonanmen.

### Demolishing the City Walls and Filling the Moats to Build Roads: Several Twists and Turns, But Finally Completed

Cao Xiang's Compromise Solution

After the Xinhai Revolution, the situation in Shanghai changed greatly, and the demolition of the city walls was once again paid attention to. Petitions were submitted to the two governors of Suzhou and Shanghai and the civil administrator of Shanghai County, which were subsequently approved.

After the approval, the City Moat Road Engineering Office was established, with the county civil administrator Wu Jing serving as the director, and the mayor Mo Xilun as the deputy director. In addition to the councilors, there were also general affairs, engineering, land, and negotiation departments. The entire project was estimated to cost about 300,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan had already been raised, starting with the demolition of the northern half of the city.

The Property Protection Association Rose Up to Obstruct

The demolition of the city walls did not proceed smoothly, and there were several twists and turns in the middle. The first was the Property Protection Association organized by the tenants of the city moat, which rose up to obstruct it. According to convention, the public land of the city moat was managed by the defense camp, which summoned people to lease it to subsidize military expenses. When the demolition of the city walls was proposed at the end of the Qing Dynasty, the Property Protection Association appeared and showed its skills in the competition between the autonomous office of the urban area under the county and the stationed Green Battalion for the public property of the city moat. At this time, they again used the excuse that the city moat was military land, and disobeyed the order to move, and then demanded to change the narrow road line and set the rental price early, with a surging momentum, threatening to make trouble for those who demolished it. The authorities remained calm in dealing with it. Except for slightly narrowing the section from Xiaodongmen along the city wall to Danfenglou, the issue of the ownership of the city moat was resolved through consultation with Su Dudu Cheng Dequan and Zhu Dabin, the director of the Jiangsu Water and Land Joint Public Property Bureau, and was managed by the county government. The storm subsided.

The British Military Cemetery Prevented the Road Line

Secondly: On the city wall of the northern half of the city, there was a British military cemetery that blocked the road line. The diplomatic authorities repeatedly requested the British consul to choose another site to relocate, but the British consul insisted on changing the straight road line, which almost led to a breakdown. Later, the municipal government found the case of the Public Works Department building a road in Chengdu Road North, so it asked the county government to forward it to the diplomatic envoy for discussion. As a result, the Chinese cemetery with 1.74% of the land on Datong Road was exchanged for the land given up by the British military cemetery. The problem was finally resolved, but the exchange of official documents had delayed a lot of time.

Demolishing the Walls and Filling the Moat to Reconstruct the Road

Another matter was the negotiation with the French Concession. The northern half of the city was originally adjacent to the French Concession. During the normal construction of demolishing the city walls and building roads, the issue of road rights arose again. After consultation between the county magistrate and the French consul, seven articles of the "Joint Measures for the Management of the China-France Road by the Nanshi Municipal Government and the French Municipal Council" were signed, with an attached explanation, and then four additional articles were added. The division of the boundary line and the management rights were separately stipulated. Demolishing the walls and filling the moat to reconstruct the road.

The project started in July of the first year of the Republic of China. While demolishing the city walls, they filled in the city moat and the river, and reconstructed the road. The pavement of the northern half of the city was 850 zhang long, and it was not completed until June of the second year of the Republic of China. While negotiating with the British and French consuls, the demolition project of the southern half of the city was already underway. By the time the pavement of the northern half of the city was completed, it was 890 zhang long, and it was completed in the winter of the third year of the Republic of China. The pavement of the southern half of the city is called Zhonghua Road, and the northern half is called Minguo Road. The current "Shangwen Road," "Fuyou Road," and "Zhaojia Road" are memorials to the city gates of Shanghai.

Remaining Base Land: Surrender the Price and Accept the Lead

The base land remaining from filling the moat and building the road was a total of more than 140 mu. After the Shanghai magistrate presented it to the provincial government, it was approved to be surrendered to the local autonomous group for a price to make up for the missing funds. During the recall period, in order to prevent private sales to foreigners and cause negotiations, the county government sent a letter to the diplomatic envoy to forward it to the land bureau, prohibiting the conversion of land deeds within the city and issuing a general notice to the bookkeepers to comply. In May of the third year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance ordered the establishment of a city moat official property measurement and release bureau. The director general of the bureau, Tao Xiang, and the co-organizer, Zhu Junbi, implemented the sale, abolished the road engineering office, and simultaneously cancelled the land that had been previously accepted, and the total land price was returned. The measurement and release bureau ended in the fifth year of the Republic of China. A total of more than 1.2 million taels of silver were collected for land prices. In addition to the project costs, Zheng Rucheng, the garrison commander of Shanghai, used 300,000 yuan in the name of work relief, and the remaining funds were all transferred to the Ministry of Finance.

### The Demolition of the City was not Completed, Adding City Gates: Wanting to Maintain the Old and Preserve the City Walls, and also Wanting to Promote the Prosperity of the Market

Cao Xiang's Compromise Solution

Since the opening of the sea ban, Western ships have been strong and cannons have been sharp. This ancient city wall is no longer enough to defend, but has become a burden on commercial development. Therefore, there is a proposal to demolish the city.

In the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the county gentleman Yao Wenyan and others requested the Shanghai Daotai Yuan Shuxun to play a special role, citing the Tianjin case, allowing the demolition of the city walls and the transformation of the road to facilitate transportation. At that time, Daotai Yuan was very sympathetic, but conservative gentlemen still rose up to oppose it, and it was never approved by the two governors of Liangjiang.

The plan to demolish the city could not be realized, but the prosperity of the northern city was increasing day by day, and the city must be constantly improved. The following year (the first year of Xuantong), Cao Rang proposed a compromise solution, that is, to open city gates to allow vehicles to pass through. After several discussions, the government finally permitted it, and construction started from the Xiaoximen first.

This new city gate is about three miles north of the Dananmen. A large hole was made in the city wall, 14 feet high and 16 feet wide, with a crescent shape on top, titled Shangwen, and two iron gates were added. At that time, the manual expenses were estimated at more than 2,000 taels of silver, and one city guard was set up.

After the Shangwenmen was completed, the Gongchen and Fuyou gates were added, all of which were completed in the second year of Xuantong. Therefore, in addition to the original six gates and the Xinbeimen (New North Gate) added during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, Shanghai City added three more gates.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Sends Documents to Various Provinces and Cities: Discussing Comprehensive Price Controls, Measures to be Taken Against Excessive Floating Capital

Affected by the recent gold and banknote fluctuations, the prices of essential daily necessities in various places have risen uniformly, such as rice, oil, sugar, and miscellaneous grains, all showing alarming increases, becoming more and more serious, and having a profound and significant impact on people's livelihoods. The way to suppress and stabilize prices urgently requires a comprehensive price control policy. It is learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has already sent documents to various provinces and cities, soliciting suggestions and opinions on price controls for reference and implementation. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau of this city yesterday drafted a letter of suggestions and opinions on controlling prices in this city. It is reported that it advocates strictly restricting the prices of raw materials in producing areas based on quality, and also advocates strengthening the implementation of the "Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times" promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is said that these price control measures are expected to be announced and implemented in the next few days.

The recent price increases in this city have many reasons, but the overabundance of floating capital and the unusually loose money supply are also major causes. In recent days, the amount of money remitted to Shanghai from various places has been increasing, gathering in the gold and commodity markets, which has caused a sharp rise in prices. It is learned that the authorities have taken appropriate measures to prevent the concentration of floating capital in this city. The Central Bank has recently imposed strict restrictions on the amount of weekly remittances to Shanghai from various commercial banks and firms. If the amount exceeds the prescribed standard, they must state the reasons to the Central Bank, and the remittance will only be allowed after the bank's approval. The exchange rates of remittances from various places are also regularly adjusted to strengthen the implementation of management work.

### A Small Number of Improper Manufacturers: Using Loans for Speculation

Lending Banks and Firms Have Dispatched Personnel for Spot Checks and Have Found Evidence: It is Decided to Recall the Loans in Advance and Request Punishment

Previously, government financial institutions had held various loans one after another in order to relieve industry and commerce, so that industry and commerce could obtain funds and resume production after the war. Unexpectedly, some manufacturers borrowed funds and used the loans for speculative businesses and hoarding goods for improper purposes. It is learned that the authorities have discovered the secret, and have dispatched auditors from various lending banks and firms to conduct spot checks on the borrowing manufacturers. As a result, it has been found in this city and Zhenjiang that there are indeed many manufacturers who have used loans for improper purposes. The authorities believe that this kind of action not only violates the purpose of holding loans, but also promotes the bad trend of speculation. Therefore, the banks and firms plan to recall the loans from these manufacturers in advance, and at the same time submit them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to request instructions on punishment measures. It is also learned that the authorities attach great importance to the recent surge in gold prices and its relationship to the flow of loans into the speculative market. They are currently planning countermeasures and will severely crack down on these improper manufacturers.

### Statistics on Pig Bristles Exported to England

[Reuters, London, 8th] In 1946, a total of 10,684 dan of pig bristles were imported into the UK from China, valued at £1,500,000. In 1945, it was 5,575 dan, valued at £680,000, and in 1938, it was 17,589 dan, valued at £460,000. These figures represent 70%, 60%, and 50% of the total value of UK pig bristle imports, respectively.

### A Total of 564 Financial Institutions in this City

With the influx of floating capital into Shanghai from various places, there have been many newly established financial institutions in this city in recent months. According to statistics from the Audit Department of the Central Bank, as of recently, there are a total of 564 various financial institutions in this city. Among them, commercial banks are the most numerous, with a total of 206. Qianzhuang (money shops) are the second most numerous, with a total of 92. There are a total of 61 state-run and province-run banks and branch offices, 6 county and city-run banks, 7 yinhao (silver shops), 13 trust companies, and 131 insurance companies, totaling 564. The authorities are paying close attention to the use of funds by various banks and firms, and are currently stepping up inspections. If it is found that they are secretly participating in speculative manipulation, they will be dealt with severely according to law.

### Shaoxing Wine Prices Rise

Shaoxing wine is one of the special products of Zhejiang Province, produced in Shaoxing and sold in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hebei, and Tianjin. During its heyday before the war, the output could reach 300,000 jars per year, with each jar containing 500 jin. Due to the destruction by the enemy and puppets, the output after the war is less than one-tenth or two-tenths of that. According to the Goods Tax Bureau's investigation, only more than 25,000 jars were produced last year, and the selling price is determined by the year of manufacture. The newly manufactured ones last year were only 40,000 yuan. Since the Lunar New Year, the price of raw material glutinous rice has risen, and the price has increased by 30%. Each bian (50 jin) of new goods is 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, three-year-old Chenshao is more than 80,000, five-year-old Huadiao is between 100,000 and 130,000, ten-year-old Taidiao is 160,000, and those over 15 years old have no fixed price. The export situation is still good. Last year, about 70,000 jars were sold to Beijing, Shanghai, Fujian, Jiangxi and other places. According to those familiar with the matter, if the traffic in various places recovers, it can catch up with the heyday before the war in two or three years.

### Orchid and Bamboo Branch Prices Rise

According to yesterday's telegram from the producing area, high-quality orchid and bamboo branches have risen by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Good goods such as Kuilan bamboo require 330,000 to 340,000 yuan, so the inventory in Shanghai is gradually becoming tight, but actual sales have not moved, and it is not easy to be too high for a while.

### Longan Turns Upward

A large number of miscellaneous large-grain longan, called Fang, has been opened for more than one hundred pieces. Because the market is quite appetizing, the price has tightened, and it has risen by about 20,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan.

### Tungsten Filament Shortage

Tungsten filament, the main raw material for manufacturing light bulbs, has recently been difficult to obtain due to the lack of American goods and the dwindling inventory in the Northeast, as well as difficulties in searching and carrying. Osaka merchants are hesitant to move forward, so the goods arriving are becoming scarcer and scarcer, and the inventory in the market is gradually lacking. Those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell them easily, and the prices are getting higher and higher.

### Southbound Yarn Market Applies for Permit: Textile Control Commission to Start Handling This Week

[This Newspaper News] The Textile Control Commission has decided to start handling applications for permits for southbound yarn and cloth for this month starting this week. The amount of southbound transportation has been approved at the regular meeting of the Textile Control Commission on the 6th, namely 5,546 pieces of yarn and 133,299 bolts of cloth. For special projects, there are 2,400 pieces of yarn and 59,679 bolts of cloth.

In addition, the commission's purchase of cotton yarn will also be distributed batch by batch starting this week. The approved purchase notices will allow each yarn factory to submit the stack receipt and receive payment. The commission's inspection and sampling work has already been completed for 16 factories. However, because there are as many as 100 types of cotton yarn, it has been decided to find ways to complete the inspection work next week to facilitate the purchase work.

### Black Market for US Dollars Soars: Export Industry Not Optimistic: Export Goods are Smuggled to Hong Kong and Guangdong

[This Newspaper News] Since the promulgation of the export subsidy measures, the prices of China's main exports have soared. Pig bristles are quoted at 1.8 million yuan per dan, an increase of 60% to 70% compared to before, and there is a price but no market. Tung oil prices have also risen to about 270,000 yuan. According to a person in charge of an export company, at the above prices, even with a 100% subsidy, there will still be losses after export. Therefore, the export of pig bristles and tung oil is not better than before the export subsidy measures were announced. In addition, the black market for US dollars has soared recently, and various export goods have been transferred to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. If the outlet in Hong Kong cannot be cut off, and the government does not have other effective measures for export, then it may be impossible to seek the normalization of China's export business. The effect of this subsidy measure is only to increase the domestic prices of various exports, so that a variety of industries on the verge of collapse can get a slight respite. Its effect on the entire export business is minimal.

### Egg Industry Plans for Export: Lowering Costs through Collective Purchasing

Since the government announced subsidy measures for export goods, various export trading firms have been actively planning for the export of goods. Egg trading firms in this city are also currently preparing and have already telegraphed importers in the United States and Britain to make contact. Once replies arrive and the market prices are favorable, they plan to ship large quantities for export. According to Zheng Yuanxing, General Manager of Maochang Foreign Firm, egg product exports were substantial before the war, with five categories: fresh chicken eggs, frozen eggs, egg yolks, egg whites, and dried egg sheets. Before the war, the annual export of fresh chicken eggs was 400,000 cases, with 360 eggs per case. Frozen eggs were 40,000 to 50,000 tons, and egg yolks, egg whites, and dried egg sheets were 5,000 tons, with a current value of about 200 billion yuan. After the war, due to production being less than half of pre-war levels, egg product exports were only about one-third of pre-war exports. If civilian production increases and inland transportation becomes smooth, it is hoped to restore the previous state within two years. Recently, the import price of fresh eggs in the United States is USD 0.33 to 0.35 per dozen, while the retail price is USD 0.50 to 0.60. Britain has agreed to import one-third of our pre-war export volume, but prices are still under negotiation. Currently, the overseas market price and the domestic purchase price, even with subsidies, still have a 50% difference. To achieve balance, either prices need to be raised overseas, or purchase prices must be lowered. Once negotiations are settled, a meeting with industry members will be convened to discuss concrete details. Plans are also being made to lower costs and engage in collective purchasing to increase exports.

### Spring Overcoat Fabrics Active

Yesterday, the overall trend of woolen fabrics remained firm, with standard market prices holding both overtly and covertly. Fine wool, lustrous woolens, and patterned woolens were even more popular, with both wholesale and retail prices rising. Spring overcoat fabrics like Harris Tweeds, Homespuns, Four-Ply Herringbone, etc., saw active sales, especially with Hangzhou merchants making eager purchases. The transaction price of the Shanghai-produced Harris Tweed was from 30,000 to 55,000 yuan per yard, and Herringbone from 18,000 to 65,000 yuan. Imported Four-Ply Homespun was quoted at 140,000 yuan for the top grade, 110,000 yuan for the second grade, and 75,000 yuan for the third grade. Yuanfeng-branded Xuangwei woolen fabric with markings was 85,000 yuan, without markings 82,500 yuan, 777-striped Xuangwei 95,000 yuan, and 555-branded patterned woolen fabric 100,500 yuan.

### Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Raise Funds to Purchase Rice for Relief in Fujian and Guangdong

[Our Guangzhou dispatch, 9th] Since the Spring Festival, the price of rice in Guangzhou has surged from 60,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight) to break through the 100,000 yuan mark. Other commodity prices have also risen simultaneously, causing widespread suffering among citizens. According to a spokesperson from the provincial government, the reasons for the rice price increase are: first, the rise in gold and foreign currency; second, the increasing smuggling of rice. The provincial authorities are currently holding daily meetings to prevent the outflow of grain and stabilize rice prices. Furthermore, Huang Kaiying, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Relief Association for the Motherland's Famine in South Vietnam, recently met with Chairman Luo to report that the association has raised 40 million Vietnamese dong to purchase 4,000 tons of rice, of which 500 tons are designated for Fujian and 2,500 tons for Guangdong for relief. Export procedures are currently being processed in Vietnam. Amidst the rice shortage, this is truly a blessing for the people of Guangdong and Fujian.

### Book Industry Resolves to Raise Prices: Calculated at 1400 Times the Original Price

Due to the continuous soaring prices of newsprint, the book and newspaper industry has been greatly affected. At 3:00 PM on the 8th, the Book Industry Commercial Association held an emergency meeting to save costs and prevent losses. It was resolved that from the 9th onwards, prices would be calculated at 1400 times the original price (previously 900 times).

### British Imports of Raw Silk: China Accounts for Slightly Less Than One-Tenth

[Reuters, London, 8th] In 1946, British imports of raw silk totaled only 326,109 pounds, compared to 576,411 pounds in 1945 and 5,296,860 pounds in 1938. The respective values were £1,140,000, £1,750,000, and £1,920,000. The largest quantity was imported from Italy, totaling 270,883 pounds, valued at £981,818 (compared to 170,498 pounds in 1945, valued at £509,603, and 142,218 pounds in 1938, valued at £56,320). Imports from China totaled 27,746 pounds, valued at £11,975 (compared to 124,676 pounds in 1945, valued at £386,153, and 278,534 pounds in 1938, valued at £85,391).

### Chinese Fir Wood Becomes Popular

The market for Chinese fir wood has been invigorated by the surge in finance and various commodity prices. Buyers are eagerly purchasing at lower prices, giving a boost to the long-stagnant market for Chinese fir.

### New Great Weaving Factory: Rumor of Chuan Liangjun Taking Over

The "New Great Weaving Factory," which was liquidated on December 5th of last year, was a large-scale operation located on Xinfengzhou Road in Nanshi, covering an estimated 12-13 mu (a unit of area) of land and housing 500-600 rooms with over 400 silk weaving machines. At the time, various circles expressed regret. Although the labor and management sides went through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Besides high-interest loans, labor disputes were also a major factor in the liquidation.

It is reported that recently, the factory has negotiated a takeover with Mr. Chuan Liangjun of the "New Light" company. A draft agreement has been signed, and the takeover process is currently underway.

### Introduction

Mr. Xu Wancheng has recently compiled his years of observations into a book titled "How to Build Our Country," which elaborates in detail on economic construction. It was published yesterday and is distributed by Shanghai Longwen Bookstore.

### A Discussion on the Import Quota Allocation System

— Infantryman

The quota allocation system represents a significant shift in trade policy. It directly restricts the quantity or value of certain imported goods in order to protect or aid domestic industries, improve international lending, and implement exchange control. Therefore, it is a key industrial protection policy. However, compared to the protection policies that have been implemented in the past, it has many entirely new characteristics.

First, it directly limits the quantity of imported goods. Traditional protection policies, such as nurturing tariffs for nascent industries, cartel tariffs for protecting monopolistic industries, or so-called relief tariffs for maintaining general industries, all used tariffs as a tool for protection. This involved directly increasing the import price of foreign goods through increased tariffs, and indirectly reducing the quantity of imported goods, in order to protect domestic industries. However, this indirect method has recently become less effective in the current international economic climate. Because the gold standard has been suspended and exchange rates have depreciated, tariffs may not necessarily increase the price of imported goods under so-called exchange dumping. Moreover, even if the price of imported goods can be increased, it may not necessarily limit the quantity of imports due to differences in commodity types. Therefore, the desire to achieve appropriate import restrictions has led to the creation of the quota allocation system, which uses a direct method to limit the quantity of imported goods.

Second, it is not merely a method of implementing import restrictions. It places a specific limit on the quantity or value of imported goods from the outset. Because indirect restrictions using tariffs cannot definitively determine the extent to which import quantities can be limited, the quota allocation system determines the quantity of goods to be allowed for import from abroad after considering the domestic consumption and domestic production of a certain commodity. It then decides how to allocate this determined total import volume. This includes (1) external allocation – whether to allocate equally or proportionally to importing countries; (2) internal allocation – how to determine the import volume for each domestic importer; and (3) seasonal allocation – how to appropriately divide the total import volume into monthly or quarterly import quantities. The above items not only restrict the quantity of imports, but also add a sense of allocation, hence the name quota allocation system.

Third, since its introduction, the quota allocation system has been implemented as a temporary measure through emergency legal actions in many countries. In other words, it is a matter of administrative order rather than law. This is also one of its characteristics. When tariffs are used to restrict imports, the increase in tariffs is in principle a matter of law because tariffs are similar to taxes (except for sliding-scale tariffs). However, the quota allocation system does not require special legislation and is often implemented through emergency orders. For example, Article 3 of the French Tariff Law of 1910 recognizes the right and obligation of the French government to take emergency measures to counter any actions by foreign governments that may hinder French trade. The French government has implemented the quota allocation system for many commodities based on this provision. Therefore, it is generally accompanied by a time limit and is a temporary restriction, usually lasting no more than a year. We should note that the quota allocation system is merely a temporary and exceptional emergency measure, not any significant change in trade policy. However, there are now many people who argue otherwise. Therefore, this temporary emergency measure tends to gradually transform into a permanent and established system.

There are also many relevant issues in the implementation of the quota allocation system:

First: Does the implementation of the quota allocation system conflict with the Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause? This has been a subject of discussion in the League of Nations. The answer largely depends on the content of the quota allocation. Some cases violate the MFN clause, while others do not. For example, stipulating the rate of land imports for neighboring countries does not, in fact, cause any harm to distant third countries. Similarly, allocating import ratios to various countries based on reasonable past standards and fair proportions cannot be said to violate the MFN clause in substance. (To be continued)

### Expulsion for False Credentials: Female Student He Fangling Disappears from Hubei Women's Normal School; Ministry of Education Orders Original School to Search for Her

Remaining Students with False Credentials Temporarily Allowed to Audit Classes

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 9th] Hubei student He Guojie suggested to the Ministry of Education that schools and educational bureaus should prioritize academic performance and abolish the credential system after his sister, He Fangling, a student at the Hubei Provincial Second Women's Normal School, disappeared after being expelled for false credentials. The Hubei Provincial Department of Education, because seven other students were also expelled for false credentials at the same time, requested permission to temporarily allow them to audit classes and specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education ordered the department to instruct the principal of the original school, along with the student's parents, to jointly search for the missing student He Fangling. As for the remaining seven students, as their credentials were not genuine, it was inconvenient to approve their student status. They are temporarily allowed to audit classes, and if they pass the end-of-year examinations, their formal student status may be approved. According to a certain educator, this is an issue worth studying. If a student possesses equivalent academic ability and excellent performance, but is expelled solely due to false credentials, it can be said to be legal but not reasonable. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, two types of students have emerged: (1) those whose families are in occupied areas and do not want to work for the enemy, and who study on their own under the guidance of their fathers, brothers, or private tutors; (2) those who, in times of extremely high tuition fees, are unable to afford education due to poverty and study on their own in their spare time. The academic abilities of these two types of students are often no less than those of students from schools, but their only shortcoming is insufficient credentials when applying for further education. For the sake of cherishing these diligent young people, the educational authorities seem to have a need to provide remedies.

### Students of Sino-French Middle School Demand to Repeat Grade: Oppose Demotion

[Our report] The Sino-French Middle School Protection Association held a reception for reporters at the Huazhong Road Youth Hall at 2:00 PM yesterday. Liu Jisheng, Chen Ruiliang, Zeng Yiliang, Pan Jinlong, Cao Xiuzhou, and other student representatives of the association stated that although the principal of the Sino-French Middle School is a Chinese national, Ma Yunxiang, the power is still wielded by the French principal of the Mother's Academy, Jules. Its educational methods still follow the style of the past concession era, and the oppression of students is extreme. This time, more than 60 of the 80 students in the second year of high school were demoted (i.e., demoted from the first semester of the second year of high school to the second semester of the first year of high school, or even to the third year of junior high school; first-year high school students were demoted to the third year of junior high school). They have made four demands to the school authorities and the Municipal Education Bureau: (1) to repeat the grade without being demoted (i.e., those who were originally in the first semester of the second year of high school should remain in the original grade); (2) to make up for past missed classes; (3) to use Mandarin Chinese to teach subjects such as geometry and algebra, except for French; and (4) to hope that the school will reform and adopt student opinions. They also said that the Municipal Education Bureau has promised to investigate and reply, but since the Sino-French Middle School has already started school today, the students are impatient and, in order to avoid the pain of dropping out of school, appeal to people from all walks of life for assistance.

### Group A Football Second Round: Youyou Suffers Crushing Defeat to Jewish Team: 4-1, Jewish Team Avenges Defeat in First Match; Penalty Kick Saves Youyou from Total Defeat

[Our report] In the second round of the Group A football league, Youyou suffered a crushing 4-1 defeat to the Jewish team. Youyou conceded four goals in the first half, leading to an insurmountable situation. In the second half, they scored a penalty kick, avoiding a shutout. The Jewish team was able to avenge their defeat in the first match. There were more than 3,000 spectators at Yiyuan, creating a lively atmosphere.

Jewish Team Scores Four Consecutive Goals

Both sides were evenly matched. Youyou adjusted their midfield and defense, making their defense strong, while the Jewish team also had two defenders, Xipansi Ting and Lisibao, plus McNitti as their goalkeeper, forming a formidable trio. Therefore, the two sides fought fiercely for a quarter of an hour without any gains. However, due to Youyou's midfield being shifted back, losing the ball repeatedly in the middle, Zhang Rongguang was too eager to save the ball and committed a handball inside the boundary at 20 minutes. The Jewish team's Quebisiji took the penalty kick and scored in the corner of the goal. The Jewish team took the lead 1-0. At 35 minutes, the Jewish team's Edward dribbled past alone, and Zhang Rongcai abandoned the city to save, but the ball slowly rolled in, and Youyou lost another goal. The whole army scattered, and the Jewish team's Baojie took the opportunity to score again, making it 3-0. Before the end of the first half, Zhang Rongguang abandoned his post, causing Edward to score again. The Jewish team had an absolute advantage of 4-0 in the first half.

Youyou Team Breaks Shutout

After the break, the two sides switched sides and fought again. The Jewish team started with the same lineup, while Youyou replaced Cao Qinfang as the left winger and Yatuomali as the right inside forward, with Zhu Meilong retreating to defend the middle. After the contact, Youyou launched a general counterattack. At two minutes, Cao Lao San single-handedly advanced and shot from 15 yards, but McNitti caught it directly. Not long after, Chen Xiaoping fell and tripped the ball in the penalty area. Si Tuolun intentionally shot at an angle, resulting in a wild shot. At 15 minutes, Lei Shuping broke into the enemy's territory, and Kapusiting was too eager to save the ball and violated the rules. Cao Qinfang took the penalty kick, and the ball went into the net from the left corner, 1-4. Youyou broke the shutout. Although morale improved, McNitti's skills were agile, and he defused the danger one by one. At 20 minutes, McNitti caught the ball and ran four steps, which was ruled as a free kick. Cao Lao San took the free kick, and the ball flew out of bounds. After that, the two sides fought fiercely. The enemy general Edward made several advances, but all failed. As a result, he became angry and took some rough actions, receiving a major warning. When time ran out, the Jewish team defeated Youyou 4-1.

Jewish Team

McNitti, Xipansi Ting, Lisibao, Luo Ai, Mailvxi, Kapusiting, Baotuolun

Youhai Team

### Weekly Forum: A Protest Against the "Suicide Education" System!

— Zhang Tingchao

Some Opinions Regarding the Revision of Curriculum Standards for Primary and Secondary Schools

Currently, China is experiencing a peculiar phenomenon: on the one hand, there is a surplus of manpower with countless people unemployed; on the other hand, there is a perceived lack of talent, making it difficult to find competent individuals for various jobs. What is the cause of this distorted situation? Leaving aside the negative influences of "lobbying and seeking connections" and "nepotism," the reality tells us that the main reason lies in the impracticality of young people's knowledge. The impracticality of knowledge stems from the flaws in the education system. Consider the thousands upon thousands of secondary school graduates who leave school each year, hoping to serve society. Whether they are high school or junior high school graduates, even those with high grades and excellent performance, what practical work can they actually undertake? Don't they have to start learning everything from scratch? The situation is even worse for those with poor grades and weak performance. Aren't the jokes like "Li Bai was a Ming Dynasty person" and "The capital of Zhejiang is Wu County" a disgrace to educators? If secondary school students are like this, what about university students? It is truly heartbreaking to say that, except for a few specialized institutions, most ordinary organizations get a headache when they see university graduates. A piece of paper and a square hat elevate their worth, but they are completely clueless about practical work. If things continue this way, education will inevitably go bankrupt in the near future, and the so-called "universal education" and "cultivating talent" will never be realized!

The current education system has been in place for over twenty years, and its effects are roughly as described above. Take the curriculum standards, for example. It is said that these standards were initially formulated by the Ministry of Education in consultation with experts from across the country. I remember that when these standards were about to be promulgated, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education convened representatives from various schools in the city to discuss them in groups. I was one of the representatives at the time. After reviewing the curriculum standards, I said at the meeting: "Before examining each item in detail, I have a question—are such heavy curricula suitable for students' health?" The chairman's response was: "These were specially formulated by experts invited by the Ministry of Education, so there probably won't be any mistakes!" Hearing this, I felt both amused and exasperated and immediately left the meeting. This cannot be blamed on the chairman, as there are many such people in all strata of society. In reality, the so-called "expert formulation" is nothing more than gathering a few people of relatively high status, closing the door for discussion, writing whatever comes to mind, relying on their own ideals, aiming high and far, and only seeking superficial beauty, without considering whether it is feasible or what the advantages and disadvantages of implementation are. The so-called "experts" are nothing more than a few high-ranking officials, plus a few returned students with connections! It is no wonder that the curriculum standards formulated under such circumstances are "useless." What is strange is that for so many years, no one has come out to say a word, watching the school education decline day by day without trying to remedy it. This at least proves that all those engaged in education hold the naive view that "these were formulated by experts invited by the Ministry of Education, so there won't be any mistakes." Many people are now advocating "Education First," but if we continue to follow this old path, even with funding and talent, this slogan will remain just a slogan. Therefore, I hope that the Ministry of Education thoroughly re-examines the secondary school education system, formulates new regulations, and ensures that they are practical and adapt to the environment, so that we no longer hear the fallacy of "What is the use of studying?" And the experts hired should not necessarily be high-ranking officials or returned students; the first condition should be good teachers who have at least ten years of classroom experience under the current education system.

The biggest shortcomings of the current curriculum standards are: (1) too much and not thorough enough, (2) neglect of reality. The heavy curricula prescribed by the current standards cannot be handled by people with average intelligence. The purpose of education is not just to create students with outstanding talent, but to create general talents, especially those who are less intelligent, because intelligent people are ultimately a minority! We should not sacrifice the majority of people with lower intelligence in order to suit the abilities of a few intelligent students. Moreover, there are other feasible and appropriate ways to utilize the talents of intelligent students without hindering the less intelligent ones (detailed later). Why must we force the shoe to fit the foot? Consider the many courses that every secondary school student has to take: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, advanced algebra, analytic geometry, biology, chemistry, physics, Chinese, English, history, geography, and civics. And none of these are simple or superficial; on the contrary, they are all quite advanced and detailed. Not to mention those with poor talents, even those with above-average abilities feel overwhelmed. As a result, those who are willing to work hard bury themselves in books day and night, just to cope with exams, without any interest at all. They have no opportunity to absorb some necessary knowledge outside of textbooks, and some even bury their lives in books. Those who are unwilling to work hard are daunted and give up on these many courses, believing that their intelligence cannot cope with them. They harden their hearts and simply ignore them, seeking a way out on the wrong path. This wrong path includes cheating, plagiarism, and substitution, among other dishonest practices. Students who are more disciplined but not good at cheating have no choice but to waste years of their lives and drop out of school halfway. Are all these people incapable of being cultivated? Absolutely not. Among them are many young people with outstanding talents who can be cultivated and developed in certain disciplines. However, these many heavy and impractical subjects tightly bind them, block their path to advancement, and a thousand-mile steed ultimately "dies in the stable." This is a loss to the country, a sin of the education authorities, and a shame to the nation!

Speaking of practicality, generally speaking, how many people in China can receive high school education? High school graduates should be in high demand in society, but in reality, in which sector of agriculture, industry, or commerce can a high school graduate be expected to do some practical work? I dare to say boldly that among them, those who can write an ordinary note that is considered clear, smooth, and flawless are as rare as morning stars; not to mention junior high school graduates. Other things like geometry, algebra, biology, physics, and chemistry have no place to be used at all. Perhaps the education authorities have two reasons for compiling such curriculum standards: (1) These many subjects are common knowledge that a high school student, a person who has received education, should know; (2) As preparation for further education, because everyone has different interests, some specialize in engineering, some specialize in medicine, some in politics, and some in agriculture, so it is necessary to lay a foundation in each subject. Regarding the first layer, we don't need to talk about theory; we just need to try to find a lawyer and ask him to solve a very common geometry or algebra problem, and see if he can handle it. Or ask a doctor which cities the Pinghan Railway passes through, and see if he can answer in detail without error. If they cannot solve it or handle it, we have good reason to say that they have no common knowledge. But in reality, how many people possess all such common knowledge? When they were in school, they generally put in a lot of hard work, generally went through dozens of exams, and some even received awards, but because their brains cannot store so much material, new goods come in and the stored goods are cleared out. The hard work they put in at the beginning is all in vain, and most of the time is wasted. To be honest, this so-called common knowledge, when a student steps into the door of a specialized school, except for things related to her field of study, everything else is forgotten completely. Why wait until he becomes a lawyer or a doctor? The original intention of compiling curriculum standards was to hope that everyone could solve common problems, but the result is that they can't even figure out addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They hoped that everyone would know that there is Tiger Hill in Suzhou, but the result is that they even forget the Himalayas. Instead of going into shallow things with deep books and trying to be detailed but being superficial, why not put more effort into the important and essential aspects?

Based on what was said above, the second reason—"preparing for further education"—is self-defeating. Since students have different interests and specialize in different subjects, the so-called "artistic cultivation" and "preparation" should also be given different priorities. Why must a student who is preparing to become a doctor be forced to put in effort in literature and history along with everyone else, and a person who wants to become a lawyer be forced to put in effort in biology and geography? The unreasonableness of the curriculum standards is to cater to this illogical entrance examination. The need to thoroughly revise the curriculum standards is clear evidence that the entrance examination urgently needs to be reformed. Moreover, those who go on to further education are a minority, so what about the majority who don't go on to further education?

What the world, especially China, urgently needs now is undoubtedly specialized talent. This is an ironclad fact. Therefore, the responsibility of the education authorities is to quickly create this kind of specialized talent—specialized talent with roots, solid foundations, and rich experience, not superficial and nominal specialized talent, and certainly not jacks-of-all-trades who know a little bit about everything but are not proficient in anything. So why should we sacrifice 80% of young people's time during their studies on impractical "miscellaneous" subjects? If we don't change course and catch up quickly, China will forever suffer from a talent shortage, and even if education is universal, at most there will be 450 million jacks-of-all-trades!

In addition to the above-mentioned drawbacks, the current education system also has a major flaw: students only know how to play hide-and-seek in the prescribed textbooks, and in the large fields of society and the world, it can be said that their eyes are blind, their ears are deaf, and their mouths are mute. In particular, their hands are virtually useless. A frail body cannot withstand the blow of the west wind and falling leaves. Even if everyone in China is such a university student, what good will it do for society and the country? The Four Books and Five Classics and the Eight-legged Essay of the imperial examination era misled the youth of the country and gradually sent the country to its doom. This kind of education that fools the people and harms the country will always be hated and cursed by the Chinese people. It is unexpected that today, thirty or forty years after the abolition of the imperial examination, the so-called education is still the policy of fooling the people in the feudal era, stuffing these many impractical books into the minds of young people in a cramming style, plus one exam after another. This heavy pressure makes schools and students lifeless, without even a chance to breathe. This kind of education is "suicide education." If it is not thoroughly reformed as soon as possible, China will never have hope of progress!

Generally speaking, the current education system puts students completely in a passive position. They are only allowed to accept, not to initiate. They have to eat what they like, and they have to swallow what they don't like. The specialized schools are surrounded by copper walls and iron walls, becoming a forbidden area for a very few people. A golden hoop is added to each student's head, and they can't step beyond the prescribed boundaries. I really don't understand what those majestic and prominent so-called education experts interpret the word "education" as. Do they think that just singing high praises and playing with official documents is enough? Or do they really not know what education is and what kind of people China needs? If it belongs to the former, then I don't need to say more. The turbulent democratic torrent will sooner or later wash away these dregs of the times. If it belongs to the latter, I still have a glimmer of hope. I hope they give up the bad habit of "sticking to old ways," try to save this ruined situation, save the country, and save the youth!

I have no backing, so I don't qualify as an expert; if I'm not an expert, I don't have the right to "formulate a plan for reference." However, based on decades of experience in school education and witnessing the near bankruptcy of school education, although I left the education field a year ago due to the pressure of life, I am unwilling to remain silent. I will roughly provide a few opinions to arouse the attention of social elites and education pioneers, and then urge the government to "order" improvement. In that case, throwing a brick to attract jade, for the future of education, that is, the future of China, may be of great benefit.

The current so-called education is always: in the morning, they take their books to school, enter the classroom, and sit there quietly listening to the teacher's explanation. The explanation always escapes the scope of the textbook. This is the same for one, two or three lessons, and then they eat lunch. After lunch, it is still these same three lessons. Then everyone disperses, and the school thinks it has fulfilled its responsibility, and the students and teachers think they have completed a day's work. It's the same every day, every month, and every year, until graduation. If this is considered education, then it is an understatement to view education as such a simple thing. Doesn't everyone know that moral, intellectual, physical and communal education are equally important? However, what "education" is there besides cultivating "bookworms" in this kind of school education? I think: First, future school education should reduce classroom hours and increase extracurricular work. In the classroom, the teacher is only in a guiding position, and the textbook is only a guide. A teacher should aim to arouse students' interest in research, so that students can express all their words and ideals in fact. There are many people in China who talk big, make arguments, and preach great truths, but there are countless who are short-sighted and don't know what society, the country, and the world are. Those who can truly lead the masses, seek truth from facts, and do things in a down-to-earth manner are truly rare. To correct this problem, we must first overthrow the previous cramming education and focus on enhancing students' initiative, cultivating their cooperation habits, and fostering a spirit of service. In terms of curriculum, we should encourage them to read freely, express themselves freely, and write freely. In particular, we must pay attention to experimental work, and make full use of the environment and existing equipment as experimental tools. The most ridiculous thing is that many schools even treat courses such as chemistry and physics as "literature" courses, explaining according to the text and translating according to the formula, without any experimental work at all. It can be said that this is a great absurdity! In terms of self-cultivation, we should always correct their extravagant, frivolous, fraudulent, and lazy habits, allow them to hold meetings freely, form associations freely, organize various competitions, and reward service work. School supplies should be made by the students themselves as much as possible, and cleaning work should be done by the students themselves. In addition, things like gardening, music, art, and volunteer schools should all be included in the normal curriculum, with teachers responsible for guidance, assessing grades at any time, and adapting to individual talents. In addition to teaching and grading papers, teachers should especially go deep into the student population, interact with them more, pay attention to their words and deeds, personality, and strengths at any time, and provide guidance, commendation, and encouragement. Speaking of this, "teacher qualifications" become a big problem. Excellent teachers are not necessarily university graduates, returned students, or masters and doctoral students. The most important thing is in terms of integrity. They must have a clear conscience, be free of current bad habits, and be able to lead by example to be qualified to be teachers. There are many teachers now who use the school as a base for political activities, or as a temporary ferry boat for shelter, or as a nursing home that does not seek advancement, or even think about turning students into cash cows, or make friends with students for pleasure. No matter how outstanding their learning is, they are not worthy of being "teachers." Of course, to demand excellent teachers, the first thing is to improve teacher salaries. This is just talking about the matter.

Second, in terms of curriculum compilation, we should pay attention to practicality. On the one hand, we must consider that graduates of all levels of schools can do some practical work in society. On the other hand, those who have the strength to pursue further education can go to school. Students' health must be especially taken care of. Elementary school students are not fully developed, so they should do more activities and read less. Therefore, the elementary school curriculum should be reduced as much as possible. I think the courses to be taken should only be four: Chinese, mathematics, common knowledge, and labor. The average time in the classroom each day should not be more than four hours (the senior grades may be slightly increased appropriately). English is not necessary at all, because the English that elementary school students learn in a year can probably be learned well by middle school students in a month. Moreover, if these English students do not go on to further education after graduating from elementary school, they are of no practical use at all. The goal of Chinese is only to be able to understand the newspaper and express one's own meaning in writing. The time it occupies should be at least two-thirds of the entire curriculum. Mathematics only needs to learn the "four arithmetic operations" well and skillfully. More than 80% of the time should be spent on numbers, reducing application problems as much as possible. Relatively difficult problems that require thinking should be absolutely rejected. Common knowledge includes history, geography, physics, and chemistry, and only needs some very common outlines. The simpler the better, and most of it can be included in Chinese. For example, geography only needs to know how many oceans, continents, major countries, provinces, cities, main railways, mountains, and rivers there are in the world, and their locations, the main products of the country, and what the earth, the sun, and the moon are. These items are already sufficient, but they must be repeatedly repeated to keep them firmly in mind. The answers should be as familiar as answering one's own name.

The junior high school curriculum is still mainly Chinese and mathematics, with English and common knowledge as supplements. The goal of Chinese is to improve thinking, enrich information, and be able to express opinions and handle ordinary documents in practical terms. Mathematics should pay attention to practical arithmetic, such as profit and loss, interest, measurement, etc. The numbers can be cumbersome, and the questions must be straightforward. The purpose is to seek rapid, accurate, smooth, and fluent calculation. Other things such as algebra and geometry should be superficial, refined, and skilled, and avoid being profound. Science and history are still included in the scope of common knowledge, but we should mention the most prominent, and compared with the elementary school curriculum, we may slightly increase one or two, but still focus on refinement and skill. In addition to training accurate pronunciation, English should teach basic grammar, especially the use of dictionaries, cultivate self-study skills, and focus on the construction of simple sentences, eliminating bad habits such as memorizing rules and definitions.

High school must be divided into subjects. In addition to Chinese and foreign languages, which are prescribed as common compulsory subjects

(This must be advanced, and non-liberal arts students do not need to study old literature), the rest are assigned according to categories. It can be roughly divided into six departments: engineering, mathematics and physics, commerce, law and politics, medicine, and literature. The first year focuses on basic subjects, and the second and third years focus on specialized subjects. Except for literature, law and politics, and mathematics and physics, we should reduce theory as much as possible and focus on practicality. For example, for a formula, we don't need to study its source in detail, but just be able to use it freely. In addition, each student should take an elective course such as shorthand, typing, drawing, calligraphy, or music. Each senior high school must have at least two departments, and its equipment and student allocation must have clear regulations.

In this way, in terms of students' prospects, if an elementary school graduate comes out to be an apprentice in a company, firm, or factory, he at least understands reading and calculation. A junior high school graduate can be self-sufficient by doing some copying, dispatching, accounting, proofreading, and ordinary letters. High school graduates are even more specialized in their studies. As long as the politics is on the right track, they don't have to worry about finding a way out. It's probably not too different from the current university graduates. As long as they undergo short-term practical training, even if they can't be engineers, they can handle being a supervisor or technician. Even if they can't be judges or doctors, they are qualified to be clerks or nurses. As for high school graduates who want to continue their studies, the subjects of the university entrance examination should of course also be classified and linked to the courses taken in high school, and separate standards should be formulated. Since high school is divided into subjects, the level of university specialized courses can also be greatly improved, and the weight of practical work can be increased.

According to the above-mentioned method, it may seem too easy for a few students with outstanding talents. If this statement is true (in fact, it is not true, because learning will not be too refined, and there are more things to learn outside of reading), the school authorities can assess the situation and allow special promotion, on the one hand to save their time, and on the other hand it is an excellent reward method. Speaking of this, we should think of the strict restrictions of the current curriculum—no junior high school graduation certificate cannot apply for high school, no high school diploma cannot apply for university, and cannot transfer schools without the certification of the school authorities. These and many other unreasonable restrictions do not know how many young people lose their studies, how many parents cry out, and how many geniuses are buried! The education authorities have set these rules. It is not known on what grounds these were established. It is truly unfathomable. If the country really wants to popularize education and create talents, this absurd and outrageous restriction must be eliminated; otherwise, it is no different from using the education suicide system to harm talents!

Students now have one more extremely painful thing to do, and that is to cope with exams. Taking a high school graduate as an example, before and after his graduation, there is a big exam, and some schools have to have another graduation exam, followed by a joint exam. When applying for universities, in order to leave a way out, they have to apply to at least two places. In this way, in just one short month, he has to cope with five exams, burying his head in a tense atmosphere every day, and the time is just in the summer, the sun is scorching, and the weather is hot and stuffy. This system is really close to cruel. Unless the government admits that school education is not on track, it should admit that these exams are contradictory. Since the school is approved by the government, then the graduates of this school are of course qualified, but the government refuses to admit it and must have a joint exam. If the graduation exam passes and the joint exam passes, it is clear that they are qualified to enter the university, but the university refuses to admit it and still has to go through an exam. To say it straight, this is clearly the government not trusting itself, and as a result, students suffer in vain. Otherwise, why not combine the three exams into one? But then again, many middle school students have made many jokes in the joint examination before, such as "Li Bai was a person of the Ming Dynasty" and "The capital of Zhejiang is Wu County", etc. These are all the brilliant achievements of the joint examination. Of course, students like this are not allowed to graduate. Perhaps because of this, some people say that the joint examination cannot be abolished, but since there is a joint examination, then the school exam is superfluous. At the same time, the school allows students who are far below the standard to graduate and participate in the joint examination, which is clearly poor school management and misleading children. It should be strictly prohibited and must not be ambiguous. In the final analysis, the curriculum standard is unreasonable, and the government cannot shirk its responsibility.

Finally, what I want to arouse the sympathy of the Chinese people is that students do not pay enough attention to physical education. The average physique of Chinese people is below that of foreigners, and the difference is very large. Of course, food and nutrition are a major reason, but the lack of exercise is indeed an undeniable major factor. On the one hand, the curriculum is too heavy, and on the other hand, the environment is bad, so that most students are either weak white-faced scholars or lazy worms with depressed wills. Therefore, we should urgently reduce the curriculum, and the school should formulate measures to force students to exercise more, so that they become interested in exercise. This will not only help the soundness of the physique, but also prevent them from indulging in improper entertainment.

The above is just to serve as an issue for improving school education. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity that the Ministry of Education is working on revising the curriculum standards for secondary schools, I have brought it up to discuss with gentlemen across the country who care about education. As for the detailed implementation plan and many other problems that urgently need to be improved, they all need to be considered and decided by the education authorities and education "experts".

### Basketball League: Hua Yang Suffers First Defeat to Chen You, Railway Jing Defeated by Encas, Qiang Hua Women's Team Wins Against Women's Youth Hong

[Report from our Newspaper] In the second Basketball League, two matches were held last night. In the women's division, Qiang Hua defeated Women's Youth Hong by a large margin of 63 to 23. In the second division of Group A, Hua Yang suffered its first defeat to Chen You, 45 to 36. In the final match, Encas defeated Railway Jing by a large margin, 47 to 19. The details of each match are as follows:

Women's Division

In the first match of the women's division, Qiang Hua played against Women's Youth Hong. The Cao family team showed their strength, with Manli, Manti, and Huang Jun dominating the game. Huang Jun scored the first point, and the score quickly rose. Women's Youth Hong only managed to score one goal by Wu Minjue. In the first quarter, Qiang Hua took a commanding lead of 21 to 2. In the second quarter, Women's Youth Hong still did not improve. When Zeng Zhaoqing joined the game, their momentum slightly increased, but at halftime, the score was 33 to 7. After switching sides, Wu Minjue and Wu Hanlian of Women's Youth Hong made some contributions, but the Cao family team was still very dominant. In the third quarter, the score was 52 to 12. In the final quarter, Women's Youth Hong strengthened their defense, and both teams scored 11 points. In the end, Qiang Hua won by a large margin of 63 to 23.

Group A Second Division

In the second match, Hua Yang faced Chen You. Both teams were perennial winners in the second division of Group A, so the game was very intense. Shi Jiuquan of Chen You scored the first basket, and Ji Youkun of Hua Yang responded. From then on, the score went back and forth, with only one point separating the teams, 7 to 6, 8 to 7. The situation was very tense. Eventually, because the "fatty" (referring to a player) was slower in his movements, they gradually fell behind. At halftime, Chen You led 17 to 11. After switching sides, Hua Yang fell further behind. Ji Youkun was also called for his fifth foul and was removed from the game, further demoralizing the team. Huang Cunrui and Wang Bingfu of Chen You made near-shots and long-shots, making the score 41 to 26, securing their victory. The "fatty" had plenty of stamina left, but time was not on his side. In the end, Chen You won 45 to 36, and Hua Yang suffered their first defeat.

Group A First Division

In the final match, Encas played against Railway Jing. Jiang Guoping of Railway Jing scored the first point with a free throw, but Krosky of Encas responded with two points, gaining strong momentum and quickly taking the lead 9 to 1. Railway Jing switched to a slow-passing strategy, but the opposing team was tall and strong, leaving Railway Jing helpless. At halftime, Encas led by a wide margin of 22 to 7. After switching sides, the game was still dominated by the foreign players. Yang Xianji of Railway Jing managed to score a few points, but that was all. In the end, Encas won by a large margin of 47 to 19. Railway Jing suffered a crushing defeat.

### Lixin Institute of Accounting Flourishes Amidst the Hardships of the War of Resistance

— Jia

Lixin Institute of Accounting was built upon the foundation of Lixin Accounting Firm, founded by accountant Pan Xulun. It is divided into two parts. The preparatory school was established in the spring of the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928] and has a history of twenty years. However, the preparatory school was not suitable for training high-level talents, so there was a proposal to establish a vocational school in the 26th year [i.e., 1937].

At that time, Chen Qicai and Wang Yunwu served as chairman and vice-chairman of the board, respectively, and Pan Xulun served as the president. Qian Xinzhi, Jiang Hengyuan, Song Hanzhang, Liu Gongyun, Wu Yunchu, Wu [missing character] Mei, Du Yuesheng, Rong Hongyuan, Zhang Jianwen, Zha Jimin, Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, Qian Naicheng, Chen Wenlin, Li Hongshou, and Wang Fengxin successively joined the board of directors. The copyright of Lixin's accounting books, donated by Lixin Accounting Firm, was valued at 100,000 yuan. The school also possessed 4,000 volumes of Chinese and foreign books, a startup fund of 5,000 yuan, and 60,000 yuan from Pan's years of professional earnings, totaling over 170,000 yuan, which served as the foundation for establishing Lixin Institute of Accounting. However, the August 13th Incident [beginning of the Battle of Shanghai in 1937] brought about an initial setback. By the 28th year [i.e., 1939], the situation in Shanghai gradually recovered, and approval was obtained from the Ministry of Education to formally open the school. By the 30th year [i.e., 1941], the first graduation ceremony was held, but the school encountered another setback due to the fall of the foreign concessions. In the 31st year [i.e., 1942], the school moved inland to Beibei, Sichuan. After three or four years of hard work, ten school buildings were established, and the scale was roughly formed. After the victory [of the war], the staff returned to Shanghai. Due to a severe housing shortage, Pan first used his own three-story, five-bay Western-style house at 466 Pulishi Road as a temporary school building and planned to build a new campus on the original site in Xujiahui. The preliminary plan has now been realized, with four buildings of various sizes being constructed.

The Textile Building and Zongjing Hall are a three-story reinforced concrete structure, named in commemoration of the large donations from the textile industry. It includes a large auditorium that can accommodate 1,000 people and fourteen classrooms of various sizes that can accommodate 70-80 to 140-150 people. Siyuan Hall commemorates the enthusiastic donations of Lixin's students and alumni, with the implication of "when you drink water, remember the source." The entire campus covers more than 40 mu, and various constructions are underway. It is envisioned that this young sprout, which has grown amidst the hardships of the war, will develop and flourish without limit.

### Three Hundred Miles of the Lu-Xi Battlefield

— Zong Chunlin, Special Correspondent from Xuzhou

Three Days of Aerial Reporting from Xuzhou

Three Days of Aerial Reporting from Xuzhou, Zong Chunlin, Our Correspondent in Xuzhou

It was the time of heavy snow. Yutai, an ancient city on the shores of Weishan Lake, stood tall in the biting north wind. Snow swirled, and ice locked everything down.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, Yutai once fell into the hands of the Communist army. Because the local people could not bear the oppression of the "road-ripping army," they launched a revolt throughout Yutai. At that time, there were more than 20,000 armed righteous people, who finally recovered Yutai. Before this, the county seat was very solid and strong, but it had all been torn down by the Communist army.

### Yutai: An Ancient City on the Shores of Weishan Lake

The current city is an earthen stockade, formed by connecting countless small bunkers into a large bunker. Thousands upon thousands of firing holes are densely distributed on the walls around the city like stars.

North of Fengxian, we already smelled the air of the "Liberated Zone" and experienced the "benevolent rule" of the "Liberated Zone." The villages were desolate, like a pool of stagnant water. Walls had collapsed, houses had been demolished, and doors, windows, and trees had all been swept away. Even the dogs in the villages had been killed by the Communist army, because dogs were considered obstacles to night marches.

Yutai has an east-west street, which is not very long. There are more than 200 shops, but they are all in their twilight years. It is as poor as a group of aging patients, and none of them can open their doors, because even their remaining food, tattered cotton wadding, and broken basins and bowls... have long been "liberated" by the "road-ripping army."

This small city on the shores of Weishan Lake was once a paradise in the north, because the silted land on the lake was particularly fertile, and farmers could reap without laboring. It used to be a place of wheat barns, fish markets, peanuts, bean oil, cotton, and lake rice. Every year in the late spring, when the spring breeze thawed the ice, fishermen transported goods by small boats. Sometimes, when the sun was just rising, the young men walking on the ancient roads would hum a few lines of the love songs they were accustomed to singing. But now everything has changed, and everything has been "ripped" away and "liberated" by the "road-ripping army."

### Fang Xian: A Man of Great Valor

Calm, resolute, and brave, General Fang is a typical young military officer.

As if everyone still has fresh memories of what happened three years ago, one can recall that the Japanese mobilized the Kwantung Army stationed in Northeast China, using overwhelming force to attack Hunan. However, they ran into a major obstacle in the city of Hengyang. At that time, our General Fang stubbornly defended the city for forty-seven days, a historical event that shocked both China and the world, and still lives vividly in the hearts of every patriot.

General Fang is very tall, and his face has a deep expression, which matches his resolute character.

He is from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. This loyal and patriotic general was born in Xuzhou, "the ancient battlefield in front of Mount Jiuli" (Bai Juyi's poem). He is currently the commander of the Xuzhou Garrison Command and the commander of the 88th Division, and is only in his thirties. He graduated from the third class of the Whampoa Military Academy and was a classmate of General Wang Yaowu, who is currently stationed in Jinan, and they are very close friends.

In the small house of his headquarters, there is a scroll of poem given by a poet: "A husband values vitality, not seeking it for himself alone, how can one obtain ten thousand li of fur, to cover all four borders within, may the masses all know me warm, and there be no cold people in the world."

He is a devout Christian, and the "Bible" is always with him.

### Jinxiang: Immovable as a Mountain

The area around Jinxiang and the founding area north of Yutai are the regions where the brothers of the 88th Division are fighting hard to defend the country and protect the greater Xuzhou area.

The Communist army copied the old trick of "encircling" and "attacking the fertile soil," attempting to launch attacks on the periphery of Xuzhou. Liu Bocheng and Yang Yong led three columns and a group of bandits, according to estimates from prisoners and intelligence, totaling about 30,000, along with two puppet commissioners' offices and nine puppet county governments, plus local bandits, totaling more than 150,000.

For a whole month, the city of Jinxiang remained as impregnable as a golden soup. Li Wenmi, the brigade commander of the entire 88th Division, fought hard, and the people of Jinxiang all participated in the battle. The Communist army forcibly collected countless old people from Juye, Shuming, Dongping, Dong'e, Ningyang, and Sishui, and taught them to carry bundles of sorghum stalks to fill the trenches, taught them to tie large knives to their hands and climb the city walls, and taught them to carry a large hammer to bomb the national army's bunkers.

### A Week of Chaos

—

The market last week was extremely chaotic, and general production enterprises felt lost. In this situation, budgets cannot be established, and production cannot be planned, which is not a good phenomenon.

Originally, China's production enterprises were already struggling due to the low-price dumping of foreign manufactured goods. After the victory, imports of production goods were very few, and imports of consumer goods were more numerous, which increased costs and made it difficult for exports to compete with foreign goods. If the current chaotic situation does not stop soon, the future will be difficult, and the situation will become even more serious!

The mentality of speculation and self-interest should be eliminated immediately, but the biggest prerequisite is the government's early clarification.

### Saving the Silk Industry

— Ren Chongliang

Last year, all industries and businesses were in a slump, especially the silk industry, which suffered from many problems and huge losses. The entire silk industry is trending towards total collapse. Although the government recognized the importance of the silk industry in exports and implemented silk purchases, the scope of purchases was limited to raw silk reeled from loans, and the standards for purchase prices were very strict, so manufacturers still felt that it was not enough to cover costs. Last autumn, due to weather conditions, the autumn cocoon harvest was poor, and raw materials were scarce, so that most factories had already closed by the end of last year. Of the dozens of silk factories in Wuxi, only "Yongtai," "Jiatai," and "Meixin" have opened this year, but the stock of dried cocoons in Wuxi, according to experts in the industry, is not enough to support the factories with 300 machines until the new cocoons are available. Therefore, most of the silk factories this year will be forced to shut down until May of the lunar calendar. However, after receiving the new cocoons, the prospect is still not optimistic. The competition from Japanese silk is a fatal blow; the invention of "nylon" and "rayon" is the fundamental reason affecting the future prosperity of the silk industry. The causes and consequences are complex and intertwined. Here, I would like to briefly describe the importance of the silk industry to rural areas and the ways to save it, as far as my humble opinion can reach.

### The Golden Age: Domestic Silk Competes with Japanese Silk

Since the emergence of the silk industry in our country, farmers have used their spare time from farming to grow mulberry trees and raise silkworms. The climate and land conditions are all suitable. The farmers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang rely on this as their main side business. However, because Chinese people adhered to old methods and did not seek improvement, the quality of their products was poor, and the overseas market was seized by Japan. Before the war, a few insightful people shouted loudly and strived for improvement, so that in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic [i.e., 1936 and 1937], their products could be compared with Japanese silk. Unfortunately, the War of Resistance broke out, and the remaining foundation was almost destroyed by the Japanese invaders. The near success was a pity. Since the victory, due to the devaluation of foreign exchange and prices, high wages, and sluggish foreign sales, the silk industry has been in a slump, creating today's terrible depression.

The silk industry can earn foreign exchange and prosper rural areas, and is closely related to the national economic lifeline. It cannot be allowed to take its own course. There are several ways to save it:

(1) Improving Sericulture: 300 catties of Japanese dried cocoons can be used to reel one dan [a unit of weight] of raw silk. According to the raw materials received last year, 600 catties are needed to reel one dan of raw silk in our country. According to the current cost of reeling silk, raw materials account for about five-tenths of the total cost. Therefore, with the same machinery and labor, and selling at the same price, Japanese merchants can make a profit, while we still have to lose money. Therefore, poor raw materials are a major reason for the losses of our silkworm farmers and silk factories. Before the war, Yongtai Silk Factory and others recognized this and first implemented "cooperative rearing and forced hatching," established silkworm rearing cooperatives, and trained technical personnel to guide villagers in silkworm rearing. As a result, the results were excellent, the farmers' output increased, the manufacturers' reeling was easier, the reeling costs were reduced, and the quality was improved. Both manufacturers and rearing households benefited. Therefore, it is appropriate to first restore the silkworm rearing cooperatives, in order to improve the quality of cocoons and reduce costs.

### Future Improvements: Competing with Japan

(2) Remodeling Japanese Latest Silk Reeling Machines: Most of the silk reeling machines in our country are old-fashioned sitting reeling machines. There are only a few with "multi-spindle" standing reeling machines. Most manufacturers have short capital and cling to short-term benefits, so they do not seek improvement. Comparing the performance of standing reeling machines with sitting reeling machines, the results are about 70% higher with standing reeling machines. However, compared with the most advanced Japanese machinery, the difference in output is almost doubled. Therefore, the urgent task is to send silk industry experts to Japan as soon as possible to learn the manufacture and reeling of these machines, and then advocate it for the people of the country, so that it can be successful.

(3) Training of Workers: Last year, the Hefeng Silk Mill in this city invited Japanese technicians who had not yet withdrawn to visit the factory. According to the technicians, when working with this kind of standing reeling machine in Japan, (referring to Hefeng's standing multi-spindle machine), the results could be much higher, which shows that the training of workers has not been perfected. The service spirit of Japanese female workers is especially admirable, and they can consider the factory's costs when increasing wages. In contrast, Chinese workers want more wages, and they do not care about whether the factory can maintain its operations. The mentality of killing the chicken to get the eggs, if this concept is not eliminated one day, then the future of the silk industry will inevitably lead to its own extinction.

### Artificial Fibers: Research Should Also Begin

(4) Research on Artificial Fibers: Since the invention of "nylon" rayon, it has only been eight years, but the progress has been rapid. According to an article on nylon manufacturing in this publication, DuPont in the United States produces 20 million pounds of rayon per year, which can make 450 million pairs of silk stockings, with amazing sales. Therefore, after nylon stockings entered the market in Shanghai, the sales of domestic silk stockings have decreased greatly! The slowness of nylon compared to natural silk is self-evident. Nylon is a product of science, and its progress is rapid. In contrast, because silk has natural conditions, its progress cannot keep pace with silk. Taking the improvement of sericulture as an example, 300 catties of dried cocoons to reel one dan of raw silk is already the most advanced method of breeding cocoons. If we work hard to study it, it may be possible to reel one dan of raw silk with 200 catties of cocoons. But if you want to reel one dan of raw silk with 100 catties of dried cocoons, this is absolutely impossible. Therefore, research on the manufacture of rayon is also a matter of urgency. This is something that cannot be resisted. If you cling to sericulture and reeling and do not seek research on artificial fibers, it is like hitting a stone with an egg, and you will inevitably be crushed and fall behind.

In short, the way to save the silk industry at present is to strive for improvement in raw materials, machinery, and labor. The existing silk industry in Japan should be used as a reference. And research on artificial fibers should also be expedited, because this is the only way to conform to the scientific principle of "outdoing nature."

### The Employer's Psychology

— Chen Xiang

The success of a business depends largely on the efforts of its employees. In order to get employees to work hard, employers must understand how to use people. Unfortunately, most employers are ignorant of this, so that the businesses they run cannot achieve success. Here are two of the more common mistakes that employers tend to make, for reference. I hope employers will pay attention to them, as it will greatly help the development of their businesses.

Some employers praise hardworking employees in secret or in their hearts, but they are always reluctant to praise them in person. The psychology of an employer who is stingy with praise is that they are afraid that after praising the employees, they will think of higher salaries.

The employer's praise is a great encouragement to the employees, and they will become more diligent and work efficiency will increase greatly. Even if they receive a little more salary, they deserve it.

An employee with special merits is of great benefit to the employer. The employer makes money because of this, and in this case, the credit should be given to that employee. However, some employers are jealous of employees with merits, and even use the logic of "only I have the store, and only the store has you" to deduce the conclusion that "your merits are actually a manifestation of my merits."

Such employers are too short-sighted. The employees will regret, why not be lazy? And it will often anger him to seek development elsewhere, and choose a better tree to perch on, which is a great loss for the original employer.

### A Standing Silk Reeling Machine

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

2. Cooperative Spirit

To make employees increase their service period, the first key point is that there must be a cooperative spirit between the employer and the employees. Under normal circumstances, the employer and the employees are in a position of opposition. The employer thinks that the employees are mechanical and cannot understand their true value. On the employees' side, they think that the employers are all profit-seeking and use the employees as a tool to make money. If both sides have this kind of mentality, then there is no way to talk about cooperation. So to talk about cooperation, then the first thing is to remove this mentality. On the employer's side, whatever can be done, whenever possible, should be done immediately, so that the employees can be sincerely convinced. The expression of this spirit should be paid more attention to and implemented by the employer, and it is best to have this spirit expressed from time to time.

This of course also depends on the situation of the enterprise organization or factory. If the situation is good, then it is easy to implement. If the enterprise itself is in a bad situation, such as encountering a market downturn, or the industry cannot be developed, or is affected by the situation and cannot carry out business for a while, then the employer will have the pain of being unable to do what he wants. But even in this situation, he should openly and honestly explain to the employees, so that they can understand and sympathize. In the movie "The Great Man Edison", Edison owed debts to others because his invention was not successful, and could only hide under the table. He also did not have the power to distribute salaries, so he had to dismiss all his employees. But those employees were able to understand his difficulties and were willing to work for him without taking salaries. This kind of cooperative spirit is very touching. But everything depends on human effort, especially in handling personnel affairs. As long as there is that kind of motivation, it can be implemented.

Spring and Autumn (a literary section)

### 文以人傳

— 胡山源

It is indeed common for people to be known through their writings. It goes without saying that some people who have established virtue and accomplished great deeds are remembered for generations because they also established their words. But even impoverished scholars, humble commoners, and even villagers, who have neither earth-shattering achievements to shake the times nor towering virtues to lead the masses, are valued and immortalized simply because they have writings, whether voluminous or containing poignant words. Therefore, in our country that reveres antiquity and values literature, for thousands of years, everyone has valued literature. Besides using it to obtain fame and fortune, some write books and establish theories, while others compose poetry, all hoping to make themselves last for a long time through it. They only focus on their writing, and they truly want to be remembered through their writing. Some, whose writing is not particularly good, are even proud to have a few lines quoted in the collections of great writers and poets, leaving behind their names. To be remembered through one's writing has become a widespread and deeply ingrained belief.

But strangely, when we look at the works that have been passed down to the present, are they really that numerous? How many of these writers who hoped to leave a lasting legacy do we actually know? Although the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library in Four Sections) can be said to be vast, shouldn't there be more after thousands of years of transmission? Of course, the chaos of past dynasties has caused the loss of books, which is a major reason. However, why have many books not been lost? The burning of books by Qin Shi Huang ultimately could not overcome Fu Sheng's memory, nor could it eliminate the common people who presented books to the imperial court during the Han Dynasty. This is an ironclad fact! How many of the poets praised in works like "Sui Guo Shihua" (Poetry Talks of the Sui Kingdom) are truly household names? Those who read these "poetry talks" only regard these poets as fleeting clouds. Therefore, I cannot help but say that it is not people who are remembered through their writing, but writing that is remembered through people!

Yes, writing is remembered through people. It is because they are people who have established virtue and accomplished great deeds that their words can also stand the test of time. Yue Wu Mu (Yue Fei) was not a literary figure, so why is his "Man Jiang Hong" (All Red River) poem sung even by children? Conversely, those who lacked virtue and accomplished nothing, and even harmed the country and the people, even if their writing was ingenious, like Qin Hui and Yan Gao, how many learned people have seen their writings? Furthermore, we might as well briefly examine a Chinese literary history. Are there any extremely bad villains among the famous writers? I think not. Cao Cao was indeed a "cunning hero in a chaotic world," but he was also a "capable minister in a peaceful world." He can be considered one of the famous writers. Wang Anshi has been completely vindicated today. He was definitely not the person described in "Bian Jian Lun" (On Distinguishing Traitors). He is also undoubtedly a famous writer, and indeed, he became one in his own lifetime. Therefore, it is impossible to say that all famous writers throughout history are people who have established virtue and accomplished great deeds. There are certainly those who are romantic and unrestrained, those who are pedantic and stubborn, or those whose actions were not entirely satisfactory. However, as long as they do not "exceed the bounds of great virtue," then "small deviations are acceptable." The writings of such people may be passed down, but this cannot overturn the principle that writing is remembered through people. Because if someone is truly extremely bad, I believe that either their name will not be in literary history, or not a single one of their works will be passed down! If they have been passed down to this day, then they are certainly not the worst people. And if we were to investigate their life, it would probably be the case, and their transmission would be fair, if their writing is indeed good. This is still writing being remembered through people!

I say this not to make empty arguments, show off my knowledge, or pick up on the words of others and boast as if I have discovered a secret. These words are originally known to everyone. My intention is simply to remind today's writers not to put all their effort into writing while forgetting about being a good person! "Living in this world," being a good person is the most important thing! A person who cannot write is still a person in the end; but what will writing amount to if it doesn't make a person?

I am not telling today's writers that they must be good people in order for their writing to be passed down, as if being a good person is for the sake of their writing being passed down. Such actions of seeking fame and reputation will never give their writing value. I am simply saying that if good people have writing, their writing will surely be passed down. There is no need to worry about it, let alone putting the transmission of writing before being a good person. Even if the writing is not passed down, what does it matter! The person is still successful!

What is even worse is: those who have put the way of being a good person behind them, and do not even bother with the effort of writing, yet all day long they only think about using writing to show off, seek fame and fortune, and even want to dominate the literary world and leave a lasting legacy. I am truly worried for them: they will ultimately not be remembered; even if they are, it will probably be "infamous for ten thousand years!"

So, what kind of people should we be? And how should we act? This, I think you also know, so there is no need for me to say more, isn't that right?

Writer's Anecdotes

### 大仲馬

— 沈思

Alexandre Dumas (1803-1870) was a wealthy French writer. He was also charitable and often distributed his wealth to the poor. He was also a prolific writer; in one year, he published forty novels. However, it is said that many of his works were plagiarized and ghostwritten. He ran a "Fiction Factory," which employed over two hundred workers. He himself was the foreman who directed and supervised the work.

### 江南書簡

— 李文勳

In my rural residence, I miss you, truly feeling "kind sir, you make me age." Yesterday, I received your letter from Chongqing, bringing back many memories. I still remember last winter when I lived in Hongyan Village in the suburbs of Chongqing. Every day I sat by the Jialing River watching the quiet water, my hometown appearing vividly in my mind, my homesickness lingering. Every day, I thought of my childhood Jiangnan, my lovely hometown. After spring came, I moved to Shenxian Cave in the city. One evening, I accidentally flipped through old books and suddenly came across a beautiful poem by Mr. Jiang Baishi, which said: "Vast is the misty Lake Ze, a fisherman's silhouette faint, Jade Peaks layered protect cloud garments, The Long Bridge is deserted on this cold spring night, Only a poet returns in a lone boat." At that time, the whole of Chongqing was filled with the sound of the Yangtze River flowing eastward, and only I was living alone by Shenxian Cave, reading this little poem, I was filled with mixed emotions, touching on countless feelings, wishing I could sprout wings and ride the wind home. But who would have thought that a year later, I would be alone again in the rural Jiangnan, every day missing the "When shall we trim the west window candle together, and talk about the night rain of Bashan" land of heavenly abundance? People are truly such busy creatures.

Now there is no need to hold a bundle of barren poems and weep to anyone. However, tonight, braving the cold wind and night dew, I stand blankly outside your door. Please open your door for me. I will bring ten years of flowers and love to the depths of your heart. Only after ten years do I understand that pain is the only noble thing for people. In order to weave the mysterious crown of my life, even if it were like the scattered treasures of ancient bronze cities, unknown pure gold, and the nocturnal light of the seabed, letting you pick them yourself would not be enough to weave the splendor of this crown.

These days my life has become stable, some thoughts, a small river of sighs...

In 1831, Goethe climbed the Ilmenau mountain peak again and saw the poem he had left here thirty-eight years ago, saying: "Soon, you too will rest..." The old man couldn't help but shed tears because, at this time, Goethe, as his young lover Charlotte said, could only look forward to the final reward - death, which is the final scene of turning the great nature into flames, riding on the "spiritual chariot" he praised and ascending to heaven. Goethe - the great father of eternal aesthetics, finally martyred to the gods he believed in - nature, life, and art - completely transformed into a bundle of flames. This sacrifice, this martyrdom, is so moving.

Lately, I have been dreaming more, thinking of the scenery of Beibei, the rural feelings of Bishan, my youthful years, and the autumn walks along the Jialing River.

I am always terribly lonely, a loneliness like losing consciousness. I need to talk, I need a kind heart to accommodate my love, I want to say a little hope to you from this gloomy morning, from this lonely hour. If we can get a little pitiful echo and response across the heavy mountains and rivers, sun, moon, and stars, by the charcoal fire, in the cold night wind and snow, your voice and laughter often linger by my side, I seem to see your shining eyes every day, and hear your beautiful Soprano singing. Do you still remember the Christmas night among the green trees, when we quietly walked hand in hand on the Songlinggang Road and our hearts beat? Do you still remember the glances and gentle smiles in the sunlight of the hot springs? These have all scattered like smoke.

Now my wealth is only this little bit of language. I love them, protect them, save them, and want them to become my loyal servants in my difficult days.

You said in your letter: Tolstoy is a kind of music, he makes criminals repent, makes evildoers turn to good, makes misers become generous... I admire your lovely lyricism. You also said that Tolstoy is like a solemn mountain, and you are working hard to climb to his peak. In my opinion, he is not only a mountain, but also a state of mind. It depends on how much sincerity and love you have to approach him, to climb him, to breathe the solemn atmosphere of the high sky of life. Every effort, every step, is a kind of completeness, a kind of occupation. The first and the last are the same pilgrims, with sincere hearts united, will linked with will. As Tolstoy himself said, the kingdom of God is not in heaven, but in the hearts of mankind.

Reading your passionate letter, I am very touched. As long as we can have sincere and public-spirited efforts, it is as if we are in the morning light and rosy clouds, our whole body is full of solemnity and hope.

### 風箏

— 翟放

Childhood stories, along with the memory of kites, are vaguely reappearing.

I remember when I was young, every time the spring sun generously shone on the people of the earth, and the gentle wind brushed people's clothes, we would run to the sunny hillside to hold a grand "kite" competition. Seeing whose kite was high, whose was far, and whose was exquisite. Sometimes, if we weren't careful, the kite string would break! The kite with the broken string would slowly descend, and the sweat on our foreheads would drip continuously. We would eagerly chase after it, across the wooden bridge over the stream, over the small hill, across the vast field ridges, and hold an even greater race; everyone would search for that kite with the broken string. After finding it, we would tie the string back together and let it bathe in the spring sunlight again, washing away the dirt it had picked up after landing... We would then start singing songs again:

The kite floats!

The kite is high;

Whose is far,

Whose is high?

Rise up,

Rise even higher.

Today, I opened the window and looked up at the kites in the sky, soaring in the spring sunshine. The blue sky, the white kites, how beautiful, how poetic! However, I can only envy them alone by the window. Childhood stories have been replaced by a melancholy memory!

### 記金松岑

— 呂白華

Mr. Jin Songcen has died.

When the few words reporting his death on the newspaper leaped into my eyes, I doubted whether it was true! Because anyone who was familiar with him also thought it was best if it wasn't true. But, he ultimately died.

A pair of thick-rimmed glasses, so dignified and gentle, I will always remember. During the period when I worked with him, although this period was too short, he was the head of the Chinese Department of Guanghua University. We know that Guanghua was famous at the time for its "literature," and this promotion was entirely due to him. Therefore, Principal Zhang Shouyong insisted on him coming out. He was very enthusiastic. If a student he cared about hadn't been seen for a few days, he would be concerned: "Why haven't I seen him? I wonder how he's progressing?" At that time, I only held a concurrent position at Guanghua teaching "Chinese Literary Criticism" at "Daxia," running over twice a week, but I almost always went to his place. He and his grandson lived together in his room, also because his grandson was studying at the school, and he valued this third generation in his old age. It is said that he was like Kang Cheng to Xiao Tong of the same hometown, his talent being bent for this position. When the bandit atmosphere invaded this only concession, he took Xiao Tong to the countryside. Guanghua maintained its studies under a strategy of changing its name and dividing its territory to conceal itself, but he refused to set foot on this land again no matter what.

In the countryside, he indulged himself in poetry. Of course, the expression of words is easily pointed to as a crime, and ordinary poems about wind and moon are not what a concerned recluse would do. Therefore, he used allusions to the emperor to express the accumulated anger in his chest. In this way, he did not lose the allegorical nature of poetry. He once sent me many long poems, and I also allowed them to be published in the "Collection of Contemporary Poetry and Prose" that I edited, all of which satirized current events, such as "Startled Butterfly" and "Lion's Mane Fur." I am very ashamed that I dared not publish them all at that time. His original manuscripts were on Anhui Provincial Annals Hall paper, and I still treasure them in my chest to this day. The last poem was aimed at the enemy invaders, and I will record it here so that we can understand the loyalty and insight of this steadfast scholar. The title of the poem: Snail Swallows Elephant. (Self-note: This is a saying in Huang Shangu's poem)

"The elephant king is born of a strong tribe, Only the ivory is more beautiful than jade, The snail slowly covers its small freshness, Chewing by others, discarded in the ditch, The Bashe anciently had the ambition to eat elephants, In three years, the bones are exhausted, The conch shell also gathers turtle and crab groups, Its weak strength does not allow it to carry the continent, Wriggling and climbing to the axis, The old bear grins and lingers. A tender waist and a gentle mouth, Are the most treacherous places for cunning heroes, Passion and jealousy, both front and back are tormented, Peace and war are at a crossroads, with a hundred anxieties, The thatched pavilion faces the river, unloaded three times, Mud snails spin and prawns jump."

His poems are best in the ancient style. Similarly, his mastery of ancient prose surpasses that of Ouyang Xiu and Liu Zongyuan. He himself also said: "After Zhang Taiyan, I can't think of a second person." This is certainly not a self-important statement, but rather a matter of being hidden and silent. Now, Mr. has passed away, who can trace the flowing wind!

### 踏雪尋梅

— 許士騏

Speaking of plum blossoms, it gives us an abstract aesthetic of noble transcendence, jade purity, and ice purity. They are praised by poets, admired by celebrities and beauties, and depicted by painters and calligraphers. In the severe cold of the north wind, they condense fragrance and bloom, with sparse shadows and horizontal slants, uniquely marking a style. They symbolize a simple and authentic, great and lofty life.

People who live in Jiangnan only know that Xixi in Hangzhou, Dengwei in Suzhou, and the Wanqing Hall of the Plum Garden in Wuxi are concentrations of plum blossoms and fragrant snow seas. But remote places go unnoticed. Kunming, a paradise on earth with a mild climate in all seasons, I have seen Tang plum and Song cypress, jade trees and jade branches, and I was amazed. Last year, in the last month of winter, I happened to be in my hometown of Zhijiang County. I once went to find plum blossoms in the snow, to a secluded path in the western suburbs. Through a delicate and beautiful Taiping stone bridge, I looked up to the Taibai Tower of a generation of poetry masters, entered the Xiqian scenic area, and after several twists and turns, reached the Plum Blossom Ancient Na's tomb path. Although there was no grand scene of a plum forest and fragrant snow sea, there were also old trunks and iron branches, which can be regarded as century-old trees. Above them are the Changqing Pagoda and the Pi Yun Peak. I wrote a draft of the remaining snow at the foot of the mountain where the north wind howled and water dripped into ice, and I am glad that this trip was not in vain.

"Emerging from the mud without being stained, washing in the clear water without being seductive," this is Zhou Dunyi's comment on loving lotus flowers. "Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains," and "Although the chrysanthemums are gone, there are still frost-resistant branches," this is the style held by the pastoral poet Tao Yuanming Tao Qian. "The flowers are all withered and only they are fresh and beautiful, occupying the scenery in the small garden; Sparse shadows slanted horizontally in the clear and shallow water, and a faint fragrance floated in the yellow dusk of the moon," this explains why Lin Chushi loves plum blossoms. But what are the plum blossoms' own feelings? Allow me to write Tang poet Wang Qi's poem about plum blossoms below as the ending of this article.

"Not subject to a speck of dust, content with a bamboo fence and thatched hut;

Only because he mistakenly knew Lin Hejing, he angered the poets to talk about him to this day."

### 一寸山河一寸血164

— 葉勁風

A drop in the bucket 164

- Ye Jinfeng

Just as "zero four" (04) had passed, Tsurumi seemed to remember something again, and immediately apologized to Yaoqun and us, "Excuse me," then went straight to the telephone and called out the number.

As soon as I heard the number, I knew he was calling the Japanese military headquarters' office secretly located in Beiping; in other words, it was the headquarters of the special services stationed in the city. Yaoqun and Little Tiger didn't understand Japanese, and stared blankly, their round eyes open wide.

"No matter what the situation is, just ask for Wu Dingyuan, a thin man in his thirties or forties with a Beiping accent, mostly in a suit, perhaps disguised, an engineer, formerly at Changxindian, and now somewhat mentally ill. No matter how serious the situation, I want this man, and he must not be harmed in the slightest!"

These were Tsurumi's words on the phone, sounding like a special command. What authority did Tsurumi, just a newly promoted colonel, have to command Matsui and Sakai? This is called "a monk from the capital is king when he's abroad." Moreover, given how much Konoe valued Tsurumi, it wouldn't take twenty-four hours for the brains of the military and intelligence agencies to figure it out, as long as they weren't complete fools. Although Tsurumi's rank wasn't particularly high, he was extremely popular both domestically and abroad.

Only after making this call did Tsurumi seem to feel more at ease. Yaoqun, Little Tiger, and I all breathed a sigh of relief. Especially Yaoqun. After I had roughly translated the meaning of Tsurumi's words on the phone, the color returned to her face, and her pair of clear eyes sparkled with an unusual joy:

"Mr. Gu, you're really a warm-hearted person, so protective of your friends."

"No, Mr. Wu is practically committing suicide by going there. I imagine he's going for revenge, to kill Japanese people. Do you think he can succeed? As for my own actions, Miss Yao, you'll slowly understand what kind of person I really am." For some reason, Tsurumi's cheeks flushed red.

"Others may not know, but I can't not understand what kind of person you are. However, today's matter should be seen as an exception. Isn't the danger a bit too great?" The word "danger" refers to Tsurumi speaking regardless of his own suspicion. As Yaoqun said this, a blush also appeared on her face.

At this time, Little Tiger, with his large eyes wide open, was busily darting them back and forth, from Tsurumi's face to Yaoqun's face, and then from Yaoqun's face back to Tsurumi's.

The room fell silent again.

"Aunt, don't you have something else to say?" Little Tiger broke the silence. It seemed that he had mustered up all his courage to speak, because his hands were clenched into tight fists as he spoke, as if preparing to fight.

Yaoqun seemed to wake up from a dream after being reminded by Little Tiger!

"Oh...! Mr. Yue," she smiled at me slightly, "Since Mr. Gu is also here, I'd like to mention something to you. After leaving Xiehe, Tiger and I happened to run into Zhang Jinlong at the Beijing Hotel, the one we invited to help out in Tongzhou. I told him that Tiger and I were immediately going to the Tongguan or Niangziguan area. I asked him if he could find a way to quickly notify the fort and ask our elder what is the number of people can he send to help..."

"Has Mr. W approved of this matter?" I interjected. A few days ago, after returning from Tongxian, I received a secret telegram from Tsurumi, on the one hand hoping that I would go to Japan, and on the other hand saying that the Lan Group of Doihara was preparing to actively enter Shanxi, and calling me to prepare to move to Shanxi as well. I had mentioned this to Mr. W, but there had been no concrete discussion of the relocation plan. I didn't expect Yaoqun and Hucheng to have begun to implement it in reality. Therefore, when I heard her asking the fort for brothers to help, I asked her if she had already received approval from Mr. W. This involves two issues: (1) Yaoqun and Hucheng have joined Mr. W's organization and must follow orders in everything; (2) The action must be economical, and there must be provision of armaments. This is not an action by one or two people, and cannot be done casually.

### 敬老大會

— 心耳

According to reports, Shenyang is "respecting the elderly" again. Another "Respect for the Elderly Assembly" was held. It is said that there were ninety-one elderly people over the age of seventy-one, and the ninety-five-year-old Wang Xihou was invited as the birthday star, and each person was given a piece of clothing material.

"Respect for the Elderly Assemblies" have been held many times. If one closes one's eyes and imagines it, the white-haired, wrinkled-faced old people gathered together, their expressions endearing, it must be quite a sight to see. In this day and age, human lives are like weeds. It is already difficult to survive, and it is naturally even more difficult to live to an old age. Not to mention a cannonball suddenly falling from the sky, even calmly soaking in yellow water or calmly eating grass roots is hardly a way to prolong life. I believe that the reason for "respecting the elderly" is quite profound.

When relief workers rush to a disaster area and see that the civilians are all pale and emaciated, they immediately conclude: they lack nutrition. So they get some canned milk or milk powder and call it relief. "Relief" is the opposite of "nutrition," which is a bit... awkward, as Shanghainese would say, isn't it? However, these nutritious items will disappear halfway. It seems that Chinese people have become accustomed to soaking in water and eating grass roots, and perhaps they can truly be refined into bodies of copper bones and iron tendons. Haven't our scholars already invented the theory that "Chinese people are a nation born to endure hardship"? In recent years, we have still been holding "Respect for the Elderly Assemblies" everywhere. "It is rare for a person to live to seventy years old since ancient times" is a well-known saying, which is originally the case, and should be rare. But whether this is related to copper bones and iron tendons is not known for a while.

If a Chinese civilian lives to be thirty years old, it becomes news. Generally, we don't hope for such days, do we?

Apart from this, I really can't think of any other reason for "respecting the elderly." If one says that living long is rare, and it is rare, why should one respect it? If this person has a career and writings that benefit the country and the people, then even if they are not old, they are worthy of respect, so why wait until they are old? And if this person has only lived a century in vain, leading a parasitic life, filling their stomach with bird's nest, white fungus, or vitamin pills, truly "eating their fill all day long, without using their minds," and therefore lives long, or worse, becomes riddled with illness, with phlegm everywhere, relying on others to serve them in order to live on, what is there to respect? (Should Tang Lhe and Zheng Xiaoxu be respected?)

"Respect the elderly and honor the virtuous" is an "ancient teaching," but what era is that "ancient"? There weren't as many gold bars and as much bird's nest and white fungus as there are today. The Great Harmony of the Book of Rites is still the political ideal of today. If we are to respect the elderly, I think it won't be too late after we have realized this ideal. Now, to burn incense and kowtow three times to a white beard, to put it more practically, should it be "celebration"?

If someone can be seen as living a thirty year life, it would be news, though most certainly such times shouldn't occur.

Moreover, the reasons for "venerating old age" are difficult to surmise. To say that longevity is rare is merely, rare - what reason is there to venerate? If the old-aged person performs heroic deeds or writes great texts, it would be worthy to venerate him if he benefits state and people, even were he not yet old. Yet what to do if some old aged man has lived a century merely to be parasitic, his stomach filled with luxury foods while idling, or more often, is riddled with illness, spitting phlegm as a burden to others, existing merely to survive. Is such a person worth venerating? (Should we venerate Tang Lhe and Zheng Xiaoxu?)

The common line "venerating old age and respecting the moral" comes from antiquity, but what specific ancient age is the one in question? There weren't as many gold bars and luxury foods then. I think only after a certain utopian dream is realised would it not be so late to venerate the old. It seems that burning incense and bowing to some white bearded old person is merely 'celebrating' his existence.

Scientific Knowledge

### Iodine and Detection

— Bai Gao

Besides the few uses listed in chemistry textbooks, iodine (Clodine) can now also be used for detection work. It can be used to detect hidden fingerprints, as well as forged or altered paper bills. The procedure is very simple, but first, you need to know how to make iodine.

Industrially, iodine was previously derived from kelp ash. Now, most of it comes from Chilean saltpeter. As for making iodine at home for experiments, you can use tincture of iodine (iodine dissolved in alcohol). You only need to extract the alcohol from it to obtain iodine. The method is to pour the tincture of iodine into a large glass test tube, then gradually heat the tube with a lamp. After the alcohol has completely evaporated, the tube will emit a gas, purple like an eggplant and with a pungent, acrid smell. This is the characteristic of iodine vapor. Iodine vapor is very heavy and poisonous and should not be inhaled. When it reaches normal temperature, it becomes solid, and its properties are similar to chlorine gas.

When iodine vapor comes into contact with the cold wall of the upper part of the test tube, it condenses there into a solid. This direct transformation from solid to gas, and then directly back from gas to solid, without passing through the liquid state, is called "sublimation" in chemical terms.

Iodine can be used for "chemical detection" experiments. The iodine needed for this kind of "chemical detection" is not solid iodine, but purple iodine vapor. During the experiment, after pressing our fingers on a piece of white paper, of course, no trace will be visible on the paper. However, if you bring this paper into contact with iodine vapor, fingerprints will appear at the point of pressure, very clearly. If the paper just pressed by the fingers is stored away and tested several months later, the iodine vapor can still reveal the hidden fingerprints on the paper.

Iodine vapor can also be used to detect counterfeits. Whether it is paper that has not been touched, paper that has been erased with rubber, or dry paper and paper that has been wetted and then dried again, the colors revealed on the paper by iodine vapor can be used to distinguish them. Even traces made on paper by blunt objects can be revealed in the same way.

### ### Fire

— Translated from Esquire

"I heard your factory caught fire, is that right?"

"Yes! The losses are huge!"

"Are your factory's products flammable?"

"No, they're fire extinguishers."

### ### Window of a Spring Morning (1)

— Yi Fan

Every house has its own window to welcome the spring morning; every person also has his own window to welcome the spring morning.

You open the window of your house every morning, open your own window, and look at this big city: is this really spring? Doesn't look like it, does it?

Winning the Lottery

Good news: "The four notorious mountain bandit gangs, operating in Shanghai, have been captured." Liu Hangxia, who impersonated an air force officer, reportedly confessed to being 21 years old and serving as their "Chief of Staff." It is alleged that he stole $30,000 in U.S. dollar bills belonging to Premier of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen from the U.S. dollar market on Shaanxi Street in Chongqing in the spring of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941).

Song Ziwen, U.S. dollar bills, and thirty thousand of them, that's better than winning any lottery.

Praising a Prodigy

But have you ever calculated that at that time, this Mr. Liu Hangxia was only fifteen years old? Ordinary children are probably in junior high school, while he was already serving as "Chief of Staff," although there might not have been any official appointment letter or anything like that.

He is a prodigy. What do you think, sir?

Destroying Talent

Therefore, we cannot help but express our regret for the Railway Bureau's police department's success in cracking the case. They destroyed a genius.

If Mr. Liu's talent had been allowed to develop, he would definitely have achieved results exceeding thirty thousand U.S. dollars or the like.

Mocking Pedantry

No doubt, some people will discuss the issue of education because of this. So let me say in advance: this gentleman is extremely pedantic. His life can be considered over in China.

Incompatible

A friend living across the street is complaining again.

He earns 200,000 yuan this month, but he has a big plan: in addition to buying two dan of rice this month, he also wants to buy a new pair of leather shoes. Looking at the prices these days, he is very worried, saying that his plan is bankrupt and the new leather shoes will be in vain.

How stupid this person is. Is it really bad to eat without shoes? I bet he can still buy rice with those 200,000 yuan by the end of the month.

Considering the Past and Future

There's another aspect that also proves this person's stupidity. Serves him right to be worried. Because he hasn't thought comprehensively about the past and the future.

With his current monthly salary, he could imagine he is living in the spring of a year ago, when an income of 200,000 yuan was equivalent to 30 dan of rice. He would be very happy.

By analogy, he could also imagine that he is living in a year from now, when his money can only buy one dou of rice. So being able to buy two dan of rice now, wouldn't that be a great profit? He would also be very happy.

Emulating a Literary Master

Moreover, this person clearly cannot become a literary master.

For example, Balzac. He could sign a blank check for a large amount and hide it in his pocket, pretending to be very rich and swaggering through the market. -- A rich man is just someone with an extra check.

Learn from the literary masters.

### ### 1947: The American Year

— Zhong Qi

What are the chances of winning peace?

Any event that you encounter in 1947 is mathematically possible. You might get a million dollars, but the chances are slim; you might die, but that chance is also rare.

To give you a mathematical idea of the opportunities this year, Fortune magazine selected many ordinary and unusual, but possible, facts; it also lists many things that you couldn't buy during the war, and this year you can calculate your chances of buying them.

Of course, these numbers are not absolutely accurate. For example, strikes can affect the entire trading structure. However, the opportunities listed here are entirely based on known facts—including government statistics and writers' opinions. For example, the chances of an accident are based on insurance company statistics, and your chances of buying a new car are based on its production figures. Here is 1947:

Wedding Banquet

If you are married, your chance of having a child this year is one in twelve. One in ninety of the babies born in the United States this year will be twins, one in eight thousand will be triplets, and one in six hundred thousand will be quadruplets.

The chance of dying from lightning is one in 350,000. This year, 400 people will die from lightning in the United States.

Death

The average chance of death this year is one in ninety-four: if you are under twenty, the chance of death is one in one hundred and ninety; twenty to forty is one in two hundred and sixty; forty to sixty is one in one hundred; seventy and over is one in thirteen.

The chance of burglary is one in four hundred and twenty.

The chance of drowning is one in nineteen thousand. In the year before last (1945), 7,150 Americans lost their lives this way.

The chance of going to jail is one in two hundred and seventy. In 1944, 488,976 people were jailed, and this year's total will definitely increase.

Car Accident

The chance of a car accident is one in three thousand four hundred. In 1945, the total number was 28,600.

The average chance of suicide is one in ten thousand: if you are under twenty, then the chance is one in one hundred and seven thousand seven hundred. Thirty to fifty is one in five thousand six hundred.

The chance of falling to death is one in four thousand nine hundred. This year, 27,800 people will die from falls.

The chance of a fire is one in one hundred and two. In 1945, 350,000 houses were damaged by fire.

The chance of getting a full hand in bridge is one in 635,013,559,600.

The chance of getting married is one in nine. Although this is based on age, three million American citizens will get married this year, and 500,000 babies will be born at the same time.

The chance of getting divorced is one in sixty. This year, about 500,000 couples will think that their union was a mistake.

Getting Rich

The chance of earning a million dollars is one in two million one hundred thousand. This number is based on last year's report from the U.S. Treasury Department. Only forty people netted a million dollars.

The chance of buying a car is one in two. American car companies' production can now supply this need.

Other household furniture: the chance of buying a washing machine is one in two; radio one in three; electric stove one in two; refrigerator one in two, vacuum cleaner one in two; full set of furniture one in two. These indicate the purchasing power of Americans.

The chance of building a new house is one in ten, and the chance of repairing one is one in four (translated from Fortune magazine's New Year's issue)

But we must ask: what are the chances of the American people winning peace this year?

### ### A Year of Testing International Standing; Compatriots Overseas Face Disaster Everywhere

Siam, once a tributary state of China, paid tribute to our country every year. Later, it was seized by Britain. Although it is now independent, it is still under British "protection." This newly emerging country, which once had a "courtly relationship" with China, clearly harbors an "old grudge" against its "former master" and is not very "friendly." It has always harbored a psychology of contempt and disdain towards overseas Chinese. Not only did it massacre them in the past, but now it does not allow overseas Chinese to receive education from their motherland. Last year, the government lodged a "serious protest" against this, but Siam ignored it and nothing came of it.

The Commissioner-General of the Siamese Police met with a Central News Agency reporter on the 3rd of this month, saying: "There are currently more than 300 overseas Chinese here waiting for transportation to leave the country; most of them have committed crimes such as 'murder and robbery,' 'violation of public security,' etc. Some of them should have been deported during the last war, but due to the lack of ships, they have been stranded until now..."

If they don't deport them, that's fine, but if they do, it's more than 300 people. This is the "special treatment" that Chinese citizens abroad receive. According to someone familiar with the situation, most of these deported overseas Chinese were arrested before the war for allegedly being anti-Japanese, and have been detained for several years. After the restoration of the motherland, they were not rewarded. Now, however, the Siamese authorities are accusing them of "murder and robbery," "violation of public security" and other "trumped-up" charges and deporting them.

American commentators have said: "1947 is a year of testing China's international standing." What we have seen in the past month or so is: peace talks are distant, French troops are landing in the Xisha Islands; overseas Chinese are being despised, bullied, "blocked" and deported abroad... The "achievements" of these "tests" are already "spectacular," and what will happen in the future is of course imaginable.

### ### "The Terrible Half-Dozen"

— Ming Gui

Dr. Hamilton of the University of California reported to the American Physical Society on February 1 that six new toxins have been discovered, all non-gaseous, all-metal substances derived from atomic fission, and are the most virulent toxins known to the scientific community. These six toxins are "praseodymium," "promethium," "americium," "cerium," "silver," and isotopes of iron, hence the name "The Terrible Half-Dozen." Americium and uranium can produce these six toxins when they split, but uranium itself is not as toxic as its products. These six new toxins are all ordinary metals, but when produced by atomic fission, they emit radiation as isotopes for months. When humans are attacked by radiation, bone marrow is their greatest weakness. Radiation kills bone marrow faster than other tissues. Toxins can reach the bone marrow by penetrating the inner layers of the bone. If eaten with food, they will not be transported into the bloodstream, so they cannot reach the bones and are excreted from the body without harm. If inhaled into the lungs by spraying or if the wound comes into contact with the toxin, it can reach the bone and be fatal.

The power of atomic energy can give life and can also cause death; it can heal human diseases and can also destroy human life; it can threaten peace and can also safeguard peace. Benefit and harm have absolutely different effects. After the invention of the atomic bomb, the lives and property of 100,000 people in Hiroshima, Japan, were sacrificed in the first "field test," which also accelerated the end of the war and reduced a lot of consumption. Now, six new highly toxic substances have been discovered during the manufacture of atomic bombs. I wonder how many people's lives will be waiting to be "experimented on" with these six new toxins?

### ### The Disabled Driving Cars

— Gao Wu Hong

We often think: "What should a person who makes a living by technique do if they become disabled?" "If a car driver's hand becomes disabled, it's impossible to change careers, wouldn't they be unemployed and waiting for death?" In fact, in scientifically advanced countries, these kinds of shortcomings that were impossible to overcome by human power in the past are being remedied at all times.

According to a dispatch published by the British Information Service in London: In order to facilitate the driving of cars by people with artificial hands and feet due to disabilities of the four limbs, a certain British automobile company has been continuously researching for ten months and hired doctors and automotive experts as consultants. A new type of car has now been invented. Nine units of machinery are installed in the car. After it was manufactured, it was assisted and tested by disabled veterans. The results were excellent, driving was convenient, just like an ordinary vehicle.

Now this new type of car is already in mass production in the UK, but at present, because the domestic demand is quite large, it is not directly accepting reservations from other countries.

What was considered a difficult problem in the past is now being solved one by one. Man will conquer nature, science is truly omnipotent!
