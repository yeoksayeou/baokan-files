### National Army Encircles the Yimeng Mountains, Fierce Fighting Underway in Central Shandong, Communist Forces Attacking Jiaoji Railway Driven Back

[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 21st] National forces in Shandong Province are currently advancing from Linyi, Yi County, Yanzhou, and north of Mengyin in multiple directions, adopting a large encirclement strategy against the Communist forces in the Yimeng Mountains. The Communist forces in the Yimeng Mountains are estimated to number over 20,000, with their main force still concentrated in the Feixian and Sishui area. Liu Bocheng's First and Second Columns in western Shandong have retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River, with the majority of their main force still in the area north of Yuncheng and Juye. Communist forces in central Shandong are frequently moving, and the National Army is attacking Xintai and Laiwu.

[Three Newspaper's Xuzhou Dispatch on the 21st] Approximately 30,000 remnants of Chen Yi's forces launched fierce attacks on Laiwu and Xintai in multiple columns on the evening of the 20th. The National Army is fighting bravely to intercept them, and the battle is currently underway. Military sources claim that these Communist forces are making a last-ditch effort and will be completely defeated within days. Additionally, about 50,000 to 60,000 remnants of Chen Yi's forces are currently concentrated in Sishui. If the National Army directly attacks Sishui, the Communist forces may flee north across the Yellow River. Reports that the main force of Chen Yi's remnants are concentrated in Rizhao are inaccurate. The front lines in Tengxian and Zaozhuang have become quiet.

[Central News Agency Jinan Dispatch on the 21st] The National Army, which advanced from Laiwu towards Xintai and Mengyin, originally aimed to support the southern National Army's offensive against Linyi. Now that the city has been recovered by the military and the mission is complete, the National Army on that route automatically withdrew from Xintai on the 19th and shifted to a more advantageous position.

[Central News Agency Jinan Dispatch on the 21st] Wang Songpu, the head of the Communist militia in the Second New District of Gaomi, recently led 180 officers and soldiers, carrying rifles and grenades, to surrender to the 15th Brigade of the Jiaoji Railway Protection Police.

[Another Dispatch] After the defeat of the Communist forces in southern Shandong, they regrouped their forces and moved towards central Shandong, attempting to prevent the National Army from advancing south and to open another battlefield to reverse their decline. This deployment has been completed and launched first on the Jiaoji Railway in Nanxian on the 19th. The Third and Fifth Police Brigades, the First and Second Independent Regiments of the Western Sea, attacked Shahe Town and Huibu and other places. Subsequently, at twelve o'clock on the night of the 20th, the First and Sixth Divisions, the New First Division, the Fourth, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Liberated Army Columns, and the First and Second Police Brigades were combined, using Laiwu as the center, and coordinated to attack the National Army in the triangular area of Tusikou (15 kilometers north of Laiwu), Qingshiqiao (5 kilometers north of Tusikou), Hezhuang (10 kilometers southwest of Boshan), and Dazhai Heiyu (20 kilometers south of Mingshui). The battle is fierce. At the same time, the Seventh and Eleventh Liberated Army Columns, the Seventh Police Brigade, etc., in order to coordinate the Laiwu operation and cut off the Jiaoji Railway, also fiercely attacked Jinling Town (13 kilometers east of Zhangdian) and Madui (7 kilometers west of Zhangdian). The National Army calmly responded, and the Jiaoji Railway was closed to traffic on the 20th. Communication equipment along the line was destroyed.

[Another Dispatch] The Seventh and Eleventh Liberated Army Columns of the Communist forces that attacked Mashang Station and Jinling Town Station on the Jiaoji Railway were driven back to the area north of the railway by the National Army's counterattack at noon on the 21st. The railway line is still under the control of the National Army, and the railway bureau has sent engineering vehicles to rush to repair it. The major battle in central Shandong, with Laiwu as the focal point, is still underway.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 20th] The National Army in southern Shandong advanced to a point nine miles southeast of Feixian at noon on the 20th. Feixian will be captured soon. A major battle is brewing near Tengxian on the Jinpu Railway.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch on the 1st] The Communist forces trapped in the Yimeng Mountains raided Laiwu and Tusikou and Binshanzhuang to its north before dawn on the 21st, encountering resistance from the National Army, and fierce fighting is taking place. This force is pieced together from the remnants of the Second, First, New Sixth, Fourth Liberated Army Columns and Ninth Liberated Army Columns of Chen Yi's defeated forces after retreating from Tai'an and Sishui. Their intention is obviously to attempt a probing breakout from the northern foothills.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch on the 21st] The National Army's pursuit units in western Shandong captured Liu Bocheng's Second Column of the Communist forces near Longji between Juye and Yucheng on the evening of the 20th. The Fifth Regiment, the only remaining regiment of that column, was completely wiped out.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 21st] When the National Army in western Shandong recovered Jiaxiang on the 20th, all 1,200 remaining personnel of Liu Bocheng's Second Column of the Communist forces were captured. On the 21st, the National Army continued to advance towards Yuncheng with the speed and force of a sweeping gale.

[Central News Agency Zhengzhou Dispatch on the 21st] The Communist forces south of the old Yellow River in western Henan, unable to stand their ground because Juye, Jiaxiang, and other counties were recovered by the National Army, have been fleeing to the north bank from Yuncheng in recent days. The remaining 4,000 or so who fled north across the railway from east of Fan to the Yanjie area northeast of Minquan are in an increasingly desperate situation, as they are now caught in a pincer movement by the National Army and feel they have no way out.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 21st] Over 2,000 remnants of Wei Fenglou's forces in eastern Henan were encircled and annihilated by the National Army at Danchengji between Luyi and Huaiyang on the 19th. Over 300 were captured, and seven or eight mortars were seized. The remaining 1,000 or so broke through and fled to the area near Feihekou southeast of Luyi, and the National Army is currently encircling and annihilating them. Additionally, over 3,000 remnants of Zhang Taisheng's forces are still wandering between Suixian and Tuocheng.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch on the 20th] The Communist forces under Wen Jianwu in the Funiu Mountains area of western Henan have concentrated in the territory of Lushi and Songxian, venturing out in all directions to cause disturbances, seemingly attempting to cross the Yellow River secretly. It is also reported that remnants are appearing in the territory of Luoning County. Another unit of Communist forces that crossed the Luo River to the north suffered extremely heavy casualties after being surrounded by the National Army. A large contingent surrendered entirely under the leadership of Qin Zhuoting.

### Elite Troops from Chahar Arrive in Beiping, National Army Advances Towards Mancheng, Over 3,000 Communist Forces in Eastern Hebei Surrender

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] Under the unified command of the Eleventh and Twelfth War Zones in the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, joint operations are becoming increasingly close. Yesterday, another powerful unit arrived in Beiping from Chahar. This unit was originally intended to reinforce the Xushui Campaign, but now that the campaign has ended victoriously, it is stationed in Beiping on standby. The military strength in the Beiping area is currently unprecedented. The Commander's Office specifically mentions this to dispel various rumors.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] The offensive and defensive battles near Mancheng, west of Baoding on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, have intensified. After the Xushui Campaign, part of the National Army's forces reinforced the Mancheng area. The fighting in this area has been stalemated for over a week. The Communist forces are doing their best to defend to the death, and the fighting is extremely fierce. Communist forces who have broken into smaller units are also actively attacking various stations between Ping and Bao. Last night, Songlin Store, Yongle, Liulihe, and even Xiaogouqiao in the suburbs of Beiping were all attacked by Communist forces on National Army outposts, and were repelled. Only Changqing Town, 20 miles west of Liulihe, is still under siege by over 2,000 Communist forces. Reinforcements will arrive tonight.

[Our Baoding Dispatch on the 21st] Fierce battles continue in the Suicheng Qicun area of Xushui and Mancheng Counties. It is reported that the National Army moving south from Yixian has withdrawn from Dawangdian to fight against the main force of the Communist forces. Over 10,000 troops of Nie Rongzhen's forces are circling around Tanghu, attempting to attack the National Army advancing west from the rear. The National Army in Baoding captured Machang and Jiangcheng yesterday. The two strongholds continue to point west to Mancheng.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] After the Xushui Campaign, the main remnants of the Communist forces mostly infiltrated the Taihang Mountains to reorganize. One unit fled to Baiyangdian east of Baoding, and another brigade fled to the north bank of the Yongding River south of Beiping. Small battles still occur near Xushui. Song Kentang, a staff officer of the Eleventh War Zone, came to Beiping after the campaign to report to Sun Lianzhong, and returned to Baozhen on the morning of the 22nd. Traffic on Pingbaoding will resume on the 24th. This decision requires emergency repairs with 12,000 shared sleepers.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] Clearing the Pinghan Line is a necessity after the Jinpu Line, according to military experts. They say that restoring traffic to Baoding and Shijiazhuang is not difficult because the main force of the Communist forces has left this section, but this is not necessary. The Xushui Campaign proves that the National Army's change of tactics against the Communist forces has been quite successful, that is, it is not necessary to defend unnecessary strongholds to the death or automatically abandon them, and to concentrate the main force to pursue and annihilate the main force of the Communist forces.

[Central News Agency Baoding Dispatch on the 21st] The Communist forces that previously harassed eastern Hebei have had their main force largely destroyed after being pursued and suppressed by the National Army. Cadres at all levels, as well as village-level cadres, have successively surrendered. Since the 2nd of this month, over 3,600 people have surrendered to Jie County. The National Army has provided comfort and appropriate resettlement to all.

It is reported that the withdrawal will be completed before March 12. In addition, all Soviet troops in Liushutun northeast of Dalian have been withdrawn.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 20th] Dalian's sanitary equipment has been taken away by a certain party. The railway hospital is occupied by the Soviet side, and the Communist Party occupies the Red Cross Hospital and Boai Hospital. Medicine is extremely scarce.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 20th] The Southwest Wazi Store in Piziwo, on the eastern coast of the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, is one of the water sources for Lushun and Dalian. However, before the Sino-Soviet agreement, when the former Soviet military commander met with our military, we urged the withdrawal of the Soviet troops stationed across the border in that area. In addition to saying that he had to ask for instructions, the Soviet commander stated that the importance of the Wazi Store was not specified when the agreement was signed, seemingly indicating a long-term intention to occupy it.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 21st] The Communist forces are increasing and expanding three military forces. It is now learned that there are no problems with the weapons of these three armies. They are forcing every ten families in Dalian, Jinzhou, and other places to send one man to train in the Soviet-controlled area of the Liaodong Peninsula. In addition, the Communist forces in Yingchengzi northwest of Dalian are rushing to build fortifications.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 20th] There were originally very few Communist forces on both sides of Wazi Store. According to reports from the frontline National Army, the Communist forces in this area have suddenly increased. In the midst of the Soviet Union's refusal to cede Wazi Store, this action by the Communist forces is of considerable concern.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 20th] According to reports from the frontline National Army, many Communist forces have recently been transferred from Dalian to the Shihe area.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 20th] There are currently two Chinese newspapers in Dalian: one is the People's Call, run by the Communist Party, now renamed the Dalian Daily, and the other is the New Life Daily. Both are four pages wide. There is no shortage of paper in Dalian, and many vendors are carrying paper to sell outside.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 21st] Dalian Shipyard, a well-known shipyard in East Asia, has been destroyed.

### Goldsmiths in Various Places to Form a Union
### Goldsmith Industry in Beijing Holds Emergency Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] According to sources in the gold shop industry in Beijing, the economic emergency measures plan has had a significant impact on the industry, so they have initiated the organization of a "National Gold Shop Merchants Union" to use collective strength to protect the interests of the industry.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] After the Ministry of Finance announced the measures for handling gold jewelry, the gold shop industry in Beijing held another emergency meeting, believing that under the new measures, it was almost impossible for the gold shop industry to exist. The meeting unanimously agreed that according to the provisions of Articles 2 and 4 of the new measures, the gold shop industry had only three months to live. After this period, it would be like a death sentence. It was decided to telegraph the Social Affairs Bureau to the Ministry of Finance, hoping that it would adopt the four suggestions previously proposed by the Association and formulate other management measures under the principle of not violating national policies and maintaining legitimate transactions, so as to avoid the unemployment of the general public; and it was decided to temporarily not resume business until a reasonable solution was obtained.

### Gold Deposits in Hong Kong Banks Reach US$7 Million, Gold Has Nowhere to Go, Prices Continue to Fall

[United Press Hong Kong Dispatch on the 21st] It is known that there are gold bars worth more than US$7 million currently stored in the vaults of various banks, but since the Chinese government promoted strict economic measures that prohibited gold trading, importing the gold bars into China has become unprofitable. Banks estimate that a total of US$10 million in gold arrived from the United States and Mexico last month, but now this has ceased because the Hong Kong government no longer issues import licenses. The current price of gold in Hong Kong is HK$270 per tael, which is lower than its import cost. If China continues to ban gold trading, these merchants will lose heavily. Although the price of gold in India is higher than in Hong Kong, both the Indian and Hong Kong governments do not issue import and export licenses.

### Measures for Price Evaluation and Implementation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Measures for Price Evaluation and Implementation have been approved for implementation by the Supreme National Defense Council at its 220th regular meeting on the 20th. These measures are formulated based on the principle of stabilizing prices within the Economic Emergency Measures Program. The key points of the measures are as follows:

Price Evaluation Councils to be Established in Important Locations

(1) In all important locations nationwide where price evaluation is necessary, the Executive Yuan shall separately order the establishment of Price Evaluation Councils. (2) The responsibilities of the Price Evaluation Councils are as follows: (A) To evaluate the selling prices of essential daily necessities for the people; (B) To assist in reporting violations of negotiated prices. (3) Each Price Evaluation Council shall have one Chairman, concurrently held by the head of the relevant bureau in municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and by the head of the relevant bureau or section in ordinary cities or counties; seven to eleven members shall be selected and appointed by the local government from the local councils, chambers of commerce, labor unions, industrial and commercial guilds, and security agencies. (4) Each Price Evaluation Council shall have one secretary and a number of staff members, concurrently held by personnel dispatched by the local government. (5) Price evaluation shall be divided into initial evaluation and re-evaluation. (6) The initial evaluation shall be conducted by personnel from the relevant bureau or section and representatives from the relevant trade associations for the goods being negotiated. After the price negotiation, a report shall be submitted to the Chairman of the Price Evaluation Council. The Chairman may approve and implement it in advance if deemed appropriate or if prompt handling is necessary, and then report it to the Price Evaluation Council. (7) Re-evaluation shall be conducted by convening all members of the Price Evaluation Council when the Chairman of the Price Evaluation Council deems the negotiated price inappropriate or when one-third or more of the members request it after the initial evaluation. The prices of goods determined by the aforementioned re-evaluation shall be submitted by the Price Evaluation Council to the head of the local government for approval. (8) The goods subject to price negotiation shall be limited to essential daily necessities for the people, excluding edible salt. The types shall be designated and publicly announced by the local government based on local conditions. (9) The standard for price negotiation shall be based on the cost of the goods, with appropriate profit margins added separately based on local industry practices. (10) The calculation of the cost of goods may include, in addition to the manufacturing cost or the original purchase price, interest (not exceeding the loan interest rate agreed upon by local silver and money exchanges), taxes, transportation costs, warehouse rent, management fees, insurance premiums, and depreciation. (11) The prices of various goods that have been evaluated and approved shall be publicly announced by the local government and reported to the competent authorities for record. (12) Shops selling price-evaluated goods must mark the approved price standards in front of the store or on each item, and the selling price must not exceed the approved price.

Re-Evaluation When Costs Fluctuate

(13) When the cost of goods fluctuates dramatically, and there is a need to evaluate a new price, the price may be re-negotiated, but the price may not be increased before it has been negotiated and approved. (14) If local governments deem it necessary to negotiate prices for businesses related to the daily lives of the people, such as hotels, bathhouses, and barbershops, the provisions of these measures shall apply. (15) Those who violate the approved negotiated prices shall be punished in accordance with the Regulations for the Suppression of Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices.

Business Restrictions on Commercial Firms and Banks

[Another dispatch] Restrictions on the resumption of business by commercial firms and banks and the establishment of branch offices have been designated by the Ministry of Finance for seventeen cities and will be announced and implemented immediately. This provision is based on Article 5 of the Measures for Strengthening the Control of Financial Operations within the Economic Emergency Measures Program. The Ministry of Finance shall, based on the distribution of silver and money exchanges in various localities, designate restricted areas and suspend the resumption of business by commercial firms and banks and the establishment of branch offices. The Ministry has now, in accordance with the aforementioned provisions, designated Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, Jinan, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Suzhou, Yongjia, and Kunming as restricted areas.

### Relief Funds Changed to Purchase Cotton Cloth UNRRA Agrees to Our Proposal Rumor that Rooks Has Instructed Shanghai Branch to Draft Plan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, today requested the Central Committee of UNRRA to immediately consider measures to assist China. Authoritative sources have learned that UNRRA has not taken any action on China's request to increase cotton and other major consumer goods in place of the originally planned durable industrial facilities.

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] It has been learned from reliable sources that senior UNRRA officials strongly support China's proposal to make cotton cloth worth $49 million and sell it on the open market. At today's extraordinary meeting of the UNRRA Nine-Nation Central Committee, Director Rooks strongly advocated using $49 million in relief funds to trade for cotton and supply it to China. According to reliable UNRRA sources, Rooks has sent a telegram to the UNRRA China Branch in Shanghai, instructing it to prepare a detailed plan. After receiving a reply in early next week, it will be submitted to the Central Committee for discussion and action. It is expected that although this matter arose from the appeal of Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun, calling it "practical and psychological assistance to China's current situation," Rooks will personally take charge of this matter. Other well-informed sources say that UNRRA had prepared $19 million to purchase medical supplies to assist China, but Ambassador Gu Weijun's appeal strongly stated that China is an agricultural country, and what farmers urgently need is cloth. If they can purchase this item at a reasonable price, they are willing to sell agricultural products cheaply. Therefore, assisting China with cotton is a great help to the country. Rooks also said that the Chinese authorities have suggested that 10% of these cotton assistance supplies can be used to relieve the poor, and 5% can be used to sew cotton clothes. It is also learned that UNRRA materials have been sold in China and other countries, and the proceeds have been transferred to the headquarters and used as relief funds.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] It is expected here that UNRRA will soon approve China's cotton purchase plan. Before approval, the UNRRA Central Committee is awaiting a formal guarantee from the Chinese government that the cotton purchase plan it proposed is truly for the welfare of Chinese farmers and not for enriching black market speculators.

Associated Press Releases Inaccurate News Executive Yuan Relief Administration Will Protest to Egerton

Executive Yuan Relief Administration personnel were very angry at UNRRA personnel for violating discipline and speaking arbitrarily. It has now been decided to ask Director Huo to protest to UNRRA General Egerton on two points: (1) Investigate the speaker mentioned by the Associated Press. If UNRRA personnel cannot be found, the Associated Press should be held accountable. If it is fabricated by the Associated Press, please ask the agency to issue a responsible statement: (2) The UNRRA office in China should issue an official statement denying this immediately. If UNRRA does not respond within days, Executive Yuan Relief Administration staff will jointly sign a protest to clarify the truth.

The amount of fines already paid before the sentence reduction should be counted into the amount of fines after the sentence reduction. However, if the amount already paid exceeds the amount of fines after the sentence reduction, the excess portion should not be counted.

For special criminal cases that should have their sentences reduced, if the sentence has already been reviewed and finalized, the sentence reduction should be carried out by a ruling of the court of first instance.

For cases that have already been judged and finalized and should have their sentences reduced, the sentence reduction should be decided by the county magistrate or trial officer in the county government that also handles judicial matters.

Before boarding the plane, Mr. Yeh made a statement saying, "The efforts made by the Military Mediation Department under the leadership of General Gillem and Marshal Marshall for peace in China over the past year, I believe, will definitely not be in vain. I believe peace in China will arrive before long." Yeh also shouted the slogans "Long live Sino-American friendship!" and "Long live the united Chinese people!" after reviewing the U.S. military honor guard for the last time. His planned statement on the conclusion of the Military Mediation Department was not released before boarding the plane, and he cautiously avoided the simple questions posed by reporters. Those flying to Yan'an with him today included Xue Zizheng, Huang Hua, Xu Bing, and twenty others, including an American woman suffering from lung disease and her five-year-old daughter, "Niu Niu". Yeh and his party arrived at Xiyuan Airport at 7:05 a.m. Gillem, Cai Wenzhi, and American and government officials above the rank of section chief, including Mr. Mann, all came to the airport to see them off. Mr. Yeh suddenly cut off his short beard today and changed into a new gray cloth overcoat, appearing in a completely new image.

On the way back, the reporters visited Mr. Yeh's former residence at No. 2 Jingshan East Street, known as the Plum Garden New Village of Beiping, and saw that the house was in a mess, but no valuable materials were found. Only a copy of "Seeing and Hearing" magazine with a picture of Chief of Staff Chen Cheng on the cover was left on Mr. Yeh's desk. Perhaps this Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Group Army also had a special interest in General Chen Cheng and was studying him?

Editorial

### The Issue of Gold Jewelry Sales in Silver Shops

Since the implementation of the emergency measures to ban speculative gold trading, the response from all parties has been good, according to reports over the past few days. However, the second item of the Economic Emergency Measures Program, regarding the crackdown on speculative trading to stabilize the financial market, included the "Measures for Cracking Down on Speculative Gold Trading," which stipulates in Article 1 that "the buying and selling of gold bars and gold jewelry is prohibited, and violators will be confiscated." As a result, the silver shops and jewelry stores in Beijing and Shanghai are all in a state of closure. Representatives of the Shanghai Silver Shops Association have been holding meetings for days to petition and have submitted four suggestions to the government, awaiting the government's announcement of measures to handle the gold jewelry manufactured by silver shops and jewelry stores. If the interpretation of Article 1 of the "Measures for Cracking Down on Speculative Gold Trading" is followed, then the buying and selling of gold jewelry by silver shops and jewelry stores is also illegal. If business operators do not abide by the law and are cracked down, and stop their buying and selling activities, the gold jewelry they have already manufactured must also be confiscated. If this is the case, then the entire silver jewelry industry in the country will be suspended under the gold rush, and some skilled workers will be forced into unemployment, adding another disaster to the turbulent society.

Prohibiting the buying and selling of gold and preventing gold from being the target of speculation is something that gold-producing countries and countries with the most gold reserves have long had control measures for. However, prohibiting the people from using gold as clothing is an unprecedented example, rarely seen in the world. Our country's policy of prohibiting the buying and selling and free circulation of gold this time is originally a wise policy, but because it was completed in a hurry technically, it also included the buying and selling of gold jewelry, and violators will be confiscated. However, there should be reasonable arrangements for the gold jewelry manufactured by silver shops and jewelry stores, so Article 9 of the "Measures for Cracking Down on Speculative Gold Trading" stipulates that other measures will be formulated separately, which is clearly authorizing the Ministry of Finance to provide administrative relief. Then, the Ministry of Finance should quickly formulate these measures to calm people's hearts.

Now, the measures for handling gold jewelry in silver shops and jewelry stores as stipulated in Article 9 of the measures have been announced by the Ministry of Finance yesterday. The provisions of these measures obviously have many loopholes and are worthy of further consideration. Article 2 stipulates that the manufactured gold jewelry must be registered with the competent authority, and the registered gold jewelry should be sold within three months after the announcement of these measures. Article 3 stipulates that the registered gold jewelry that has not been sold after the three-month period should be exchanged for national currency at the local central bank. What we don't understand about these provisions is: (1) Does this mean that the silver jewelry industry will not be allowed to continue to exist after the three-month period? (2) The price at which the central bank dumped gold on February 12 was 7.3 million yuan, 5.62 million yuan on February 9, and 5.72 million yuan on February 8. On February 18, after the National Government promulgated the Economic Emergency Measures, the central bank reset the gold price to 4.8 million yuan. 7.2 million yuan, 5.62 million yuan, and 5.72 million yuan were all the prices at which the central bank dumped gold, and now silver jewelry stores are required to sell it to the central bank for 4.8 million yuan. Isn't this transfer causing silver jewelry stores to suffer significant losses? This provision does not make sense in terms of reason and sentiment. Furthermore, if silver jewelry stores sell all the manufactured gold jewelry, they will definitely not have any gold left to make gold jewelry. The previous measures only have provisions for silver shops to sell their gold jewelry to the central bank, but there are no provisions for how silver jewelry stores should obtain gold to make gold jewelry. This one-sided approach really seems ill-considered.

Furthermore, looking at the overall picture of these measures, the announcement of these measures seems to be facilitating people with gold bars to exchange their gold bars for gold jewelry. If people don't have gold bars, how can they make gold jewelry from the original gold and "entrust" it to silver jewelry stores? The result of the implementation of these measures is not only the danger that the entire silver jewelry industry will go bankrupt, but also the destruction of the general public's habit of using the surplus funds earned from hard work to purchase gold jewelry as savings. As a result, not only will hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs, but it will also destroy a virtue of the people.

Every administrative measure inevitably has both advantages and disadvantages. The government should theoretically have some kind of administrative relief for the affected parts. Regarding the issue of prohibiting the sale of gold jewelry in silver shops, what kind of relief should be given? We believe that the four suggestions of the Shanghai Silver Shops Association: (1) The weight of each piece of jewelry manufactured and sold by silver shops should not exceed two taels on the customs scale, and small bars should not be melted and sold; (2) It is requested to allow the receipt and exchange of gold jewelry, and the price should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the central bank; (3) The gold jewelry received and exchanged, in addition to being used for melting and manufacturing jewelry, the surplus should be sold to the central bank, and if it is insufficient, the central bank should be requested to replenish the quantity sold; (4) The operating profit should be determined by the Silver Shops Association with reference to the operating conditions and the cost of living index, and with the consent of the central bank. These opinions should be worthy of reference for financial legislation; the restoration of the buying and selling and exchange of gold jewelry, as long as it does not involve speculative factors, is worthy of consideration.

In short, the nature of gold jewelry sales is different from the so-called gold bar sales. Gold jewelry sales are a form of people's savings; it does not have speculative factors in itself. If its value is in accordance with the regulations of the official price and it is not melted and sold in small bars; and the profits and wages of gold jewelry are controlled by the state, it should not conflict with the government's major policy of cracking down on gold speculation. At present, the majority of the people support the government's measures to crack down on gold speculation, but they are psychologically shaken by the danger that the gold jewelry earned from hard work may be frozen or become waste. Everyone is shaken, which is not good governance. Su Shi said: "If the people are unhappy and the customs are uneasy, there is no compensation for resentment even with the classic texts." Therefore, the financial legislative authorities should give administrative relief to the reasonable and non-speculative operations of the current silver jewelry industry nationwide!

### The U.S. Seeks Repayment of Lend-Lease Loans; The Soviet Union Has Agreed to Consider It; The U.S. Is Willing to Continue Supplying the Soviet Union with Materials Under the Principle of Cash Transactions

[United Press Washington Dispatch on the 20th] Negotiations on the Soviet Union's debt of $1.1298 billion under the Lend-Lease Act have been delayed for a year, and today the Soviet Union has agreed to consider it. However, the State Department emphasized that the Soviet Union has not yet agreed to pay, and under the repeated urging of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, Molotov only agreed to "consider" it. The State Department is working hard to resolve the repayment of Lend-Lease loans with countries such as Britain, France, Belgium, Australia, Turkey, and New Zealand, all of which have been resolved before June. Negotiations are currently underway with China, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, and South Africa.

The United States had previously urged the Soviet Union to start negotiations on payment six times, but the Soviet Union ignored them. The U.S. Congress, in a fit of anger, stopped all shipments to the Soviet Union on January 1. However, the State Department announced today that the United States is still willing to ship food, leather, steel bars, tools, lubricants, and mining machinery worth 25 million yuan originally planned to be supplied to the Soviet Union after the war under the principle of cash transactions. When Lend-Lease, all non-cash transactions, ceased after the victory, the Soviet Union had separately ordered goods worth 25 million yuan from the United States.

As for the 1.1298 billion yuan under the wartime Lend-Lease Act, the Soviet Union is afraid that it will not pay it in full, because the original agreement stipulated that "losses and consumption during the war will be regarded as donations from the United States. However, the Soviet Union should pay for the remaining war materials that can be used for civilian purposes, such as trucks and tires."

[Reuters Prague Dispatch on the 20th] Czech News Agency Moscow reporter Saitga said: The Moscow side gradually believes that the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy will change from an active offensive policy to a positive counter-offensive in the future. This counter-offensive will greatly disappoint those who thought they could intimidate the Soviet Union. The position of Soviet leaders and politicians has become more consolidated after this general election, and they can devote themselves to the struggle for true peace based on justice and humanity.

### Implementing Effective Control of Atomic Energy; The Veto Should Not Apply; The British Representative Insisted on This Point in the Security Council

[United Press Success Lake Dispatch on the 20th] British representative Cadogan recently declared at the Security Council that the United Kingdom still insists that the veto should not be used for countries that violate the regulations on the control of atomic weapons and conventional armaments. When the United Nations conducts discussions on universal disarmament, the United Kingdom will submit a proposal.

[Reuters New York Dispatch on the 20th] During today's Security Council debate on the atomic energy issue, French representative Donnel suggested that the Atomic Energy Commission should submit its second report before June 30. At the same time, he also argued that the Security Council should pay attention to the points that have been agreed upon in the first report of the Atomic Energy Commission, and not pay too much attention to the points that have not been agreed upon. British representative Bedegan said that after studying the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union, he felt that a consensus agreement could be reached on the following three points: (1) It is technically possible to control atomic energy for peaceful purposes. (2) The control power should belong to a single international organization. (3) The control system should be established by multilateral conventions. Cadogan also said: We welcome the fact that Soviet representative Gromyko expressed acceptance of the point in the Baruch Plan that punishes violators of the control. However, we still hope that the veto will not be used to evade control. He also said that although there are still points that have not been agreed upon by the Security Council on the issue of atomic energy control, it is still possible to design implementation methods for the points that have already been agreed upon. The Security Council then decided to reschedule the discussion to 8:00 p.m. next Tuesday.

[Associated Press London Dispatch on the 20th] The meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers today discussed Yugoslavia's request for Austria to cede 1,000 square miles of land, and opinions were still not unified.

The United States believes that if Austria wants to become a free and independent country, it cannot be made to lose land. As of now, the four representatives have agreed on seven political clauses of the Austrian Peace Treaty, and there are still disagreements on the other eight clauses.

### President Truman Advocates; Implementing Compulsory Military Service; Budget Amendment Passed by the House of Representatives and Moved to the Senate; Leaders of the Army and Navy Oppose Reducing Defense Spending

[French News Agency Washington Dispatch on the 20th] President Truman declared at a press conference today that the United States has a need to implement compulsory military service. As for the position of Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, I advocate appointing Lilienthal. Regarding the unification of the U.S. Army, I will submit a detailed plan to Congress soon, and will follow it with a message to Congress on compulsory conscription. As for the U.S. financial situation, I believe that no matter what the Republicans think, revenue will exceed expenditure at the end of the next fiscal year.

[Associated Press Washington Dispatch on the 20th] The Republican-controlled House of Representatives today passed the budget amendment by a vote of 239 to 159. This amendment was proposed by the joint budget committee of the House and Senate, advocating reducing President Truman's proposed budget of 37.5 billion yuan for the next fiscal year by 6 billion yuan, including the expenses of the Army and Navy. Republican Chairman of the House Budget Committee Nussen said that after the budget is reduced, it can guarantee a 30% reduction in personal income tax. This case will now be submitted to the Senate for discussion, but Republican senators in that house only support reducing the budget by 4.5 billion yuan, so that the funds for the Army and Navy will not be reduced. The commanders of the Army and Navy have protested, saying that reducing military spending by 1.75 billion yuan will endanger national security.

### Los Angeles Electroplating Factory Explosion - City Shaken, Heavy Casualties - Black Smoke Billows Like an Atomic Bomb

### Prime Minister Attlee Announces British Policy Statement on India in the House of Commons

[British Information Service, London, 20th] British Prime Minister Attlee made a statement on India policy in the House of Commons yesterday, stating: "Promoting Indian self-government has always been a consistent policy of successive British governments. In implementing this policy, the responsibility of the Indian people has gradually increased, and the internal affairs and military of India are dependent on both Indian officials and civilians. In terms of the constitution, the Acts passed by the British Parliament in 1919 and 1935 both represent Britain's transfer of major powers to India. In 1940, the British government further recognized a principle, that India should draft its own new constitution and build a fully self-governing India. In 1942, the British government urged India to establish a constituent body once the war ended.

"The British government feels that this policy is very appropriate and in line with sound democratic principles. Since taking office, the government has diligently implemented this policy, hoping to complete it as soon as possible. The Prime Minister's statement on March 15th of last year was widely praised, stating that the Indian people should decide their future national structure and constitution. In the view of the British government, the time has come for the Indian government to transfer responsibility to the Indian people.

"Last year, the Cabinet Mission went to India and consulted with Indian representatives for more than three months, with the aim of assisting them in resolving the method of self-drafting a constitution, so that the handover of responsibilities could be smoother and faster. The Cabinet representatives only made suggestions when the Indians and Muslims were unable to reach an agreement. These suggestions were published in May of last year, mainly proposing that India's future constitution should be determined by a National Assembly, and the National Assembly should be composed of representatives from British India and Indian princely states representing all sectors of society and various interests.

"After the Cabinet Mission returned home, India has produced a provisional central government, with the participation of major political leaders who exercise great power under the existing constitution, and all provincial governments of India that are responsible for legislation are also included.

"Currently, opinions among various parties in India are still conflicting, so that the National Assembly cannot function. The British government regrets this very much. According to the original plan, the National Assembly must represent all parties. The British government is willing to transfer responsibility to the responsible authorities stipulated by the constitution that conforms to the plan of the Cabinet Mission and is approved by various parties in India. Unfortunately, there is currently no hope for the emergence of such a constitution and responsible authority. This phenomenon is full of crises and should not be allowed to continue indefinitely. The British government now intends to take necessary actions to transfer power to the Indian authorities no later than June 1948.

"The current population of India has exceeded 400 million. In the past century, as a member of the British Commonwealth and Empire, it has enjoyed peace and security. If the Indian people want to fully develop their economy and achieve a higher standard of living, the need for peace and security is even greater today. The British government is eager to transfer responsibility to a government supported by all the people, and this government must be able to maintain peace and govern with fair and effective means. Therefore, the various parties in India should abandon their prejudices and prepare to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the country next year.

"The Cabinet Mission has planned meticulously for several months and has largely agreed on the method of completing the constitution, and has published it in a communiqué in May of last year. Therefore, the British government has agreed to submit to Parliament the constitution made by the Constituent Assembly that meets the suggested conditions and contains representatives of all parties. However, if the constitution cannot be completed by the Constituent Assembly within the time proposed in Section 7, the British government will consider who to transfer the power of the central government of British India to within a limited time, whether British India should be transferred entirely to a certain form of central government, whether some areas should be transferred to the current provincial government, or whether it should be transferred in other more reasonable circumstances that are most beneficial to the Indian people.

"Although the final transfer of power must wait until June 1948, various preparations must be made in advance. The important point is that the efficiency of the Indian civil administration must be maintained, and its national defense must also be fully prepared. However, during the transfer process, it will undoubtedly be difficult to implement the provisions of the 1935 Government of India Act one by one. At that time, new laws will have to be enacted to ensure that the transfer of power can proceed smoothly."

"As for the Indian princely states, as the Cabinet Mission has made clear, the British government has no intention of transferring the rights and obligations belonging to the princes to any government of British India. The British government has no intention of ending the monarchical system of the Indian states before the final deadline for the transfer of power, and will consider entering into separate agreements with each state during the transition period."

"The British government believes that British commercial and industrial interests in India have good opportunities to operate in this new environment. There has been a long and friendly commercial relationship between Britain and India in the past. Continuing this relationship in the future will be beneficial to both parties. Before concluding this statement, the British government must, on behalf of the British people, sincerely express its best wishes to the Indian people who are moving towards the final stage of self-government. The British people all earnestly hope that although the relationship between Britain and India may undergo fundamental changes, the relationship between the people of the two countries will never be severed because of this. The British people hope to continue to do their best to promote the further welfare of India."

Prime Minister Attlee then issued the following additional statement:

"Members of this House are often informed of the events announced today. Field Marshal Wavell, since the beginning of the war, has served as senior commander in South Asia, the Middle East, and India. In 1943, he became the wartime Governor-General of India, and has been in office for almost four years. During his term, he devoted himself to public service and achieved remarkable results. Now that British-Indian relations have entered a new stage, the government believes that this is the best time to approve Field Marshal Wavell's departure. His Majesty has appointed Admiral Lord Mountbatten as his successor. He will hand over the British-administered Indian government to the local people so that they can achieve happiness and prosperity. After taking office, Lord Mountbatten will continue to serve as an active member of the Royal Navy according to his wishes. I firmly believe that members of Parliament will recognize that Lord Mountbatten will certainly be able to perform the new task happily, and at the same time, members will be pleased that His Majesty has approved Lord Wavell's promotion to the peerage," he said.

Lawrence Statement

[United Press, London, 20th] After Lord Lawrence, the British Secretary of State for India and Burma Affairs, made a statement on India in the House of Lords, the members of Parliament were shocked. Lord Lawrence's statement on British policy towards India was the same as that made by Prime Minister Attlee in the House of Commons. Opposition leader Cripps rose and said that this policy was tantamount to abandoning India.

### Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and Postal Workers Union Resolve to Demand Salaries Still Be Paid According to Index - Wu Kai-hsien Expresses Unfairness Regarding Rationing

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon, chaired by the chairman of the federation, Shui Hsiang-yün. In addition to reporting on the visit to Nanjing last week, they discussed in detail the issues raised by the members regarding the impact of the freeze on the cost-of-living index on the future lives of workers. It was decided to appoint Shui Hsiang-yün, Chou Hsueh-hsiang, and Ch'ou Chang-chiang and 18 others to form a petition delegation. They will take the night train to Nanjing tomorrow to petition the National Defense Supreme Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other relevant agencies, requesting the maintenance of the cost-of-living index and proposing remedial measures to improve the lives of workers. The delegation also decided to petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Bureau of Social Affairs in the next two days.

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, believing that the economic emergency measures announced by the central government and the declared freeze on the cost-of-living index, while commodity prices cannot be suppressed, will inevitably affect the efficiency of postal workers, held an emergency meeting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday at the union's clubhouse on Wuchang Road. The chairman of the union, Wang Chen-pai, Shui Hsiang-yün, an executive director of the National Postal Workers' Union, and more than ten representatives from postal workers' unions in Hankou, Hunan, Nanjing, and other places attended to discuss the issue of remuneration. It was decided to join with more than 50 representatives from postal workers' unions along the two railways to take the night train to Nanjing tomorrow to petition the Ministry of Communications and relevant parties, requesting that employees' salaries be paid according to the cost-of-living index.

### How Will This Month's Wages Be Paid? - Decision to Be Discussed and Determined Within Days

[Report from our newspaper] Since the government announced the economic emergency measures plan, decided to supply daily necessities to public servants and industrial workers, and stipulated that the wages for February should not exceed the January cost-of-living index, how the wages of workers this month should be paid is of great concern to all sectors. Yesterday, the reporter visited Wu Kai-hsien, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, to inquire about this issue. According to him, it is currently being discussed with relevant parties and will be decided within days.

Wu stated that the government's supply of daily necessities to factory workers will be implemented from March because purchases could not be completed this month. In addition to paying wages according to the January index, it will be stipulated that the difference between the average price in February and the average price in January for the supplied five pecks of rice per person per month, one hundred catties of coal briquettes, and two lengths of cloth every six months will be converted into legal tender and paid. The average price for February will be announced by the authorities. However, the General Federation of Trade Unions has expressed dissatisfaction with the government's method of supplying daily necessities, believing that the quantity and types of supplies should not be different from those for public servants and teachers. One hundred catties of coal briquettes cannot cook five pecks of rice, and the food intake of laborers should not be less than that of mental workers. Moreover, the January cost-of-living index was calculated based on 1.9 pecks of rice per person. He believes that this request is reasonable. Also, it is unfair that workers have rations, while employees of other companies and businesses do not, and the wages of workers cannot exceed the January index. Therefore, he believes that all those whose wages are calculated based on the cost-of-living index should be handled in the same way. This morning (yesterday), he argued with relevant leaders for a long time at the Bank of China on the second floor, but there was no result. It has now been submitted to the mayor for instructions and will definitely be resolved within days. Wu also stated that if this issue cannot be resolved and the Bureau of Social Affairs has difficulty operating, he will resign.

Wu also stated that when workers are given rations in the future, each factory will only register the required quantity with the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Bureau of Social Affairs will forward it to relevant agencies for allocation and sale. The rationing of public servants and teachers will be handled by another agency of the Municipal Government.

### Gold Black Market Transactions; Reward People for Reporting; 20% of Confiscated Gold as Bonus; Two Procurators Visit Supervisory Group to Discuss Coordination and Implementation Issues

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Economic Supervisory Group's investigation of the gold rush is gaining momentum. Yesterday morning, the High Procuratorate and the District Procuratorate sent Procurators Lin Wopeng and Zhu Xiyu to the Supervisory Group for discussions. They discussed in detail the coordination issues that may arise during future enforcement. It is understood that both parties have decided that if the investigation results only in administrative liability, the punishment should be handled by the administrative authorities without being transferred to the court. If there is a definite violation of the Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Regulations during Extraordinary Times, it will be sent to the court for strict handling. At 2:00 PM, an important meeting was held on the third floor of the Garrison Headquarters. Commander Xuan Tiewu, Chief Secretary of the Economic Supervisory Group Li Zheng, Gold and Currency Group Leader Xu Youzuo, Supervisory Committee Members Zhang Qingzhen, Gu Fengxiang, He Hanwen, Wan Can, Director Dai of the Ministry of Finance, Director Gao of the Four Joint Offices, and two auditors sent by the Audit Department attended. During the meeting, the participants reviewed the financial panic and discussed how to concentrate efforts and divide labor. It was decided that Supervisory Committee members would focus on investigating government officials using public funds for speculation, while Ministry of Finance personnel would be responsible for investigating banks and money houses. To prevent and eliminate future gold black market transactions, it is proposed to reward people for reporting. Twenty percent of the gold seized as a result will be used as a bonus. However, this method is still pending approval by the highest authorities. As for the "blacklist" that all sectors are eagerly awaiting, it is believed that the Economic Supervisory Group will complete it soon, but because it is of great importance, it is feared that it will be difficult to release it before it is submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval. Therefore, "action" will also have to wait. However, according to Chief Secretary Li Zheng of the group, who spoke to reporters yesterday, "No matter what, the truth will come out by the end of February!"

### Collection of This Year's Land Tax Commences; Three Flexible Measures Approved

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the collection of this year's land tax, the Municipal Government, in order to adapt to the actual needs, specifically approved the following three flexible measures yesterday: (1) This year's land tax will be implemented under a new system. All tax registers are recently compiled and may inevitably have discrepancies with the original registers. To prevent the registration of property certificates by fraudulent means, a stamp of "Not for Property Certificate" will be affixed to the land tax receipt, so that property disputes can be resolved separately according to law. (2) Recently, prices have soared and the cost of tax registers has become increasingly expensive. In order to show consideration for poor farmers and save manpower and resources, each grain household will be subject to a minimum amount of 500 yuan. Those below 500 yuan will be exempt from tax, and a system of combining households will be adopted. Although there are many scattered households in the original grain register, the number that falls below 500 yuan after being combined should not be large, so the relationship with the treasury revenue is still small. (3) Recently, small denominations of currency below 100 yuan have become rare. In the future, the tax will be collected in units of 100 yuan, and amounts below 100 yuan will be rounded off for collection.

### Teng Yongxi Tried for Suspected Concealment of Automobile Materials

Claims to Have No Prior Acquaintance with Wang Zhuchen; Deposit Was Introduced by Wang's Brother-in-Law

[Report from Our Newspaper] Teng Yongxi, the former Deputy Director of the Putuo Branch Bureau, who is suspected of hiding stolen goods for Wang Zhuchen in the case of Wang Zhuchen's concealment of materials from the enemy Changdao Foreign Firm, was investigated by the District Procuratorate and prosecuted. The Criminal Division 8 of the District Court held its first public hearing at 2:00 PM yesterday. According to Teng, he served as the Deputy Director of the Jiangning Branch Bureau and the Putuo Branch Bureau in this city, and has now resigned. He has no prior acquaintance with Wang Zhuchen, but is a classmate of Wang's brother-in-law, Yu Qingjian. At the time, Yu came and said that he had purchased a batch of automobile materials in Hongkou and asked him to find a way to store them. Because he did not know that they were enemy property concealed by Wang, he introduced them to be stored at the Central Machinery Factory. According to the witness Fan Rongchun (Manager of the Central Machinery Factory), because Teng was the Deputy Director of the police bureau in charge, he did not suspect anything wrong with the search for storage. The automobile parts were sent by Teng accompanied by Yu Qingjian on August 8th last year. On August 13th, Gu Dingyi, a staff member of the factory, read the Shen Bao that day and saw a report about Wang Zhuchen hiding enemy property. The materials that the informant reported to the investigation team that Wang Zhuchen had moved out of 2 Beihai Ning Road were roughly the same as the materials that Teng and Yu had sent in. Therefore, he reported it to the police bureau for investigation, etc. Judge Wang Jiazhuo believes that the case is not yet clear and needs further investigation, and ordered a rescheduled hearing. The defendant Teng Yongxi was released on his original bail.

### Reader Consultation Legal Questions

(1) Intention to Commit Bigamy

Ling Shiwu asks: My nephew married a woman from his hometown in 1926 and they have two children each. Their life is stable. After the victory, my nephew was transferred to another place, and his family remained in their original location. Recently, someone from that place said that my nephew is planning to marry a woman from another place, which has raised questions. I respectfully request your response: (1) If he marries a woman from another place, can my nephew's wife sue him for abandonment or bigamy? (2) If they do not marry but cohabit, can my nephew's wife sue him for abandonment or adultery? (3) Can a lawsuit for abandonment only be filed when my nephew stops providing living expenses for the family? (4) If he secretly marries the woman outside and the matter is discovered six months or a year later, does she still have the right to sue under the law?

[Attorney Mi Xitong answers] (1) Abandonment should be judged based on whether he bears living expenses or not. She can sue for bigamy. (2) Abandonment is as answered above. She can sue for adultery. (3) Yes. (4) She cannot sue after six months from the date of knowledge.

(2) Demolish House and Return Land

Lu Cheng asks: In 1937, I rented a piece of vacant land, about three fen, from the Jia family and built three flat houses. A lease was signed for ten years, with rent paid annually, and the house would be demolished and the land returned upon expiration. However, the Jia family has sold the land to the Yi family, and the Yi family lives in another place, so no new land lease contract has been signed and rent cannot be paid. Please advise: (1) Can I ask the Yi family to renew the lease after the lease expires? If the request is denied, how should I resolve it? (2) Because I have surplus houses to rent to tenants, there are no deposit fees. If the land expires and the house is to be demolished, and the tenants are notified in advance to move out, how should it be resolved if they refuse to move out? Is there any legal regulation for tenants to request relocation fees, and can I refuse to pay? (3) Can I interfere with the subletting of the second-hand tenants who privately collect transfer fees, and take back the house for my own use?

[Attorney Mi Xitong answers] (1) Yes, otherwise apply to the court for renewal of the lease. (2) You can sue to the court for eviction. There are no legal regulations for relocation fees, but they can be paid out of good grace. (3) It is possible if there is a special agreement in the lease.

According to a Hangzhou report: Jiang Dongfang, the eldest son of Jiang Yun, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fifth District of Zhejiang Province, is sixteen years old and was studying in the third grade of junior high school in Hangzhou. He was expelled by the school for being absent from class for more than fifteen hours last semester. After learning of this, his mother went to negotiate with Jiang Wenwei, the former principal of the school, who in turn negotiated with the newly appointed Principal Qi to make an exception and allow him to return to school. On the 11th of this month, Jiang brought money to the school to register on his mother's orders, but was still not allowed. Fearing that he would be scolded by his parents, the student left without saying goodbye. On the afternoon of the 15th, while the family was in a state of panic, they received a plain letter from Shanghai without a return address, stating that he was going north that day and would return to Hangzhou after June. His mother was very concerned about her son and negotiated with the school for days. It is heard that the school is sending personnel to the Suzhou area to search for him.

勝負有關錦標
The Outcome Affects the Championship
　今晚籃球有激戰
There Will Be a Fierce Basketball Game Tonight
　華聯火併恩卡斯
Hualian to Clash with Enkas
　甲二部重要比賽晨友對綠林
Important Second Division Game: Chengyou vs. Lulin

　　平凡已久之二屆籃球聯賽，今晚將有激刺鏡頭出現，甲一組由上屆冠軍華聯出戰恩卡斯，五時半起在巿體育館舉行。其他二塲首塲培爾對印第安，次幕晨友對綠林，門票仍售二千元及三千元。
The second basketball league, which has been uneventful for a long time, will have exciting moments tonight. In the first division, Hualian, the champion of the previous season, will play against Enkas, starting at 5:30 PM at the City Gymnasium. The other two games are the first game, Pearl vs. Indian, and the second game, Chengyou vs. Lulin. Tickets are still sold for 2,000 and 3,000 yuan.

　　首塲甲二部培爾對印第安，前者曾於上週冷門突出，擊敗綠林，士氣旺盛，日前對抗甲申之役，雖遭敗北，但戰鬥力已充份發揮，俞氏昆仲王為公等聯絡頗見默契。後者為西青乙組勁旅，巨人隊凱捷密洛夫一手訓練，惟出師以來，每戰俱北，且曾棄權一次，該部殿軍一席，大有非彼莫屬之槪，但該隊長力充沛，培爾應知審愼。
The first game is Pearl vs. Indian in the second division. The former had a surprising upset last week, defeating Lulin, and their morale is high. In the battle against Jiashen the other day, although they were defeated, their fighting power was fully demonstrated. The Yu brothers and Wang Weigong and others have shown good coordination. The latter is a strong team in the second group of Xiqing, trained by Kiejie Miluofu of the Giants. However, since their debut, they have lost every game and even forfeited once. The last place in the division seems to belong to them, but the team has plenty of stamina, and Pearl should be cautious.

　　次幕同組晨友遭遇綠林，晨友對本屆甲二部首席，頗有染指之企圖，出師以來戰無不勝，聲勢喧赫，麾下健將史久全等，皆為球壇知名之士，綠林小將，經錢旭滄之熏陶後，球藝猛晋，王介平，葉云山，陳正淼，樂嘉洲等，投籃準確，防宗嚴密，上週不幸遭培爾毒後，發奮圖勵，今日兩雄相遇，倘綠林能勝，則與晨友積分相等，晨友告捷，則該冠軍，已在掌握中，為冠軍前途計，必各出全力，以決雌雄。
In the second game, Chengyou of the same group will face Lulin. Chengyou has the ambition to win the top spot in the second division this year. They have been undefeated since their debut and have a loud reputation. Their strong players, such as Shi Jiuquan, are all well-known in the basketball world. After being trained by Qian Xuchang, the young players of Lulin have made rapid progress in their skills. Wang Jieping, Ye Yunshan, Chen Zhengmiao, Le Jiazhou, and others have accurate shooting and tight defense. After unfortunately being poisoned by Pearl last week, they are determined to work hard. Today, when the two strong teams meet, if Lulin can win, they will have the same points as Chengyou. If Chengyou wins, the championship will be in their grasp. For the sake of the championship, they must both go all out to determine the winner.

　　壓軸戰甲一部華聯相逢恩卡斯，華聯係籃壇盟主，若吳成章孔廣益任相成唐實堃卓國榮包松圓陳學崇李震中等，婦孺皆知者，惟上月中曾遭春茂毒手，殊為遺憾，此番前車可鑒，必力爭上游，故勝利似無問題，勢必難免。今日秩序錄下：
The final game is Hualian vs. Enkas in the first division. Hualian is the leader in the basketball world. Wu Chengzhang, Kong Guangyi, Ren Xiangcheng, Tang Shikun, Zhuo Guorong, Bao Songyuan, Chen Xuechong, Li Zhenzhong, and others are all well-known. However, they were poisoned by Chunmao in the middle of last month, which is a pity. This time, they must learn from the past and strive to move forward, so victory seems to be no problem and inevitable. Today's schedule is recorded below:

　　培爾—印第安（甲二）五時卅分　裁判俞菊廬吳效堤
Pearl - Indian (Second Division) 5:30 PM Referees: Yu Julu, Wu Xiaodi

　　晨友—綠林（甲二）六時卅分　裁判凱捷密洛夫陶勃林基

論今晚籃球戰
On Tonight's Basketball Games
　各組進入精彩階段
Each Group Enters an Exciting Stage

　　籃球聯賽，目前已進入精彩階段，女子組綠隊五戰五勝，雪白三戰不敗，明日二隊相逢作冠軍決賽，自以綠隊冠軍較有把握。甲二部晨友保持四戰四勝紀錄，而綠林雖日前不幸，敗於冷門小將培爾，然實力仍在。陳正淼之入竄，葉雲山之托送，舒家義之中央突破，均為令人頭痛之殺手鐧，，晨友後防將極感棘手。然唯一致勝之訣，在於以牙還牙，利用王炳福何增之主竄，王蓉生史久全之中距攻勢，及黃存瑞之遠射。但存瑞如果犯了「射球寒熱病」，應速以他人易之，並可採穩紥穩打之戰術，綠林小將將無亂中偷襲之機。如果這一塲勝了，即冠軍天下可定，得不到晨友盃無關緊要，聯賽盟主，才是眞的光榮。
The basketball league is currently entering an exciting stage. In the women's division, the Green Team has five wins in five games, and the Snow White Team is undefeated in three games. The two teams will meet tomorrow for the championship final, and the Green Team is more likely to win the championship. In the second division, Chengyou maintains a record of four wins in four games, and although Lulin unfortunately lost to the underdog Pearl the other day, their strength remains. Chen Zhengmiao's incursions, Ye Yunshan's passes, and Shu Jiayi's central breakthroughs are all troublesome trump cards, and Chengyou's defense will find it very difficult to deal with. However, the only key to victory is to fight fire with fire, using Wang Bingfu and He Zeng's main incursions, Wang Rongsheng and Shi Jiuquan's mid-range attacks, and Huang Cunrui's long-range shots. But if Cunrui suffers from "shooting fever," he should be quickly replaced by someone else, and a steady and solid tactic can be adopted so that the young players of Lulin will have no chance to sneak attack in the chaos. If they win this game, the championship will be decided. It doesn't matter if they don't get the Chengyou Cup. The league championship is the real glory.

　　甲一部巨人與油隊是不敗的常勝軍，然上屆盟主華聯，及仁餘，海陸青，恩卡斯均有問　之資格，今後各塲，將極精彩，日來體育館內之清冷氣氛，將一掃而空。
The Giants and the Oil Team in the first division are undefeated victors, but Hualian, the champion of the previous season, and Renyu, Hailuqing, and Enkas are all qualified to compete for the championship. In the future, each game will be very exciting, and the cold atmosphere in the gymnasium in recent days will be swept away.

　　今晚首塲甲二部培爾逢印第安，無關緊要的，但印第安如吃了敗仗，則　軍一席，非伊莫屬。次幕甲二組晟友戰綠林，前面已提到，無疑問的，這是一幕精彩之戰，如果不出冷門，晨友可穩獲甲二部冠軍。
Tonight's first game in the second division, Pearl vs. Indian, is not important, but if Indian loses, the last place in the division will belong to them. The second game, Chengyou vs. Lulin in the second division, has been mentioned earlier. There is no doubt that this is an exciting game. If there is no upset, Chengyou can steadily win the second division championship.

　　壓軸戰華聯戰恩卡斯，這是華聯輪戰五强之始，華聯首仗即出冷門為黑馬春茂勝去，然華聯的威風仍在，今晚預料大李一定出戰，眞是千呼萬喚始出來。想阿弟老包及學崇，在李震中的組織下，定會予番將一個「莫奈我何」，球迷要看好球，今朝開始了，今晚各隊名單抄錄如下：
The final game is Hualian vs. Enkas. This is the beginning of Hualian's round-robin battle with the five strongest teams. Hualian's first game was an upset, with the dark horse Chunmao winning. However, Hualian's prestige remains. It is expected that Da Li will definitely play tonight, which is truly a case of being called upon a thousand times before finally appearing. It is thought that Ah Di, Lao Bao, and Xuechong, under the organization of Li Zhenzhong, will definitely give the foreign generals a "what can you do to me" attitude. Fans who want to see a good game, it starts today. The rosters of each team tonight are recorded below:

　　〔華聯〕任相成（7）卓國雄（5）孔廣益（10）包松圓（8）吳成章（6）張良雄（3）陳學崇（9）李震中（）

（德文）對恩卡斯
(De Wen) On Enkas
　華聯應勝
Hualian Should Win

　　今夕籃球聯賽，甲一組華聯遇恩卡斯，以言智略，穩健，華聯皆高出一籌，恩卡斯自主將却利勃脫離去，攻守均形色减色，今晚華聯應以包松圓，任相成，吳成章，張良雄，陳學崇上塲，局勢已可穩定，大李（震中）無出塲必要也。
In tonight's basketball league, Hualian of the first division meets Enkas. In terms of strategy and stability, Hualian is superior. Since Enkas's main player, Que Libo, left, both their offense and defense have been weakened. Tonight, Hualian should field Bao Songyuan, Ren Xiangcheng, Wu Chengzhang, Zhang Liangxiong, and Chen Xuechong. The situation can be stabilized, and there is no need for Da Li (Zhenzhong) to play.

　　甲二組晨友對綠林，不啻鍋標決戰，晨友曾有敗辱汕隊的實力，以動作快速見長，綠林全隊默契工夫，不在晨友之下，勝利雖以晨友較大，仍將為一塲劇烈競爭，晨友傅其俠與綠林葉雲山飛奔全塲的鏡頭，可供欣賞。
The second division, Chengyou vs. Lulin, is no less than a championship showdown. Chengyou has the strength to defeat the Shantou team and is known for its fast movements. Lulin's teamwork is no less than Chengyou's. Although Chengyou is more likely to win, it will still be a fierce competition. The sight of Chengyou's Fu Qixia and Lulin's Ye Yunshan sprinting across the court is worth admiring.

　　另一塲培爾應勝印第安，培爾每塲作戰，都能保持常態，而印第安目前的狀况，實在是　乙組資格都够不上的一個隊伍。（昌年）
In the other game, Pearl should win against Indian. Pearl can maintain their normal state in every game, while Indian's current situation is that they are not even qualified for the second division. (Chang Nian)

This association and the United States Amateur Athletic Association cannot tolerate this. Amateur athletes who can receive compensation for lost work time are no different from professional athletes. Bloom also said that it is doubtful whether the Soviet Union will participate in the 1948 World Games. The condition for participating in the World Games is that they must be members of the International Amateur Athletic Association or its affiliated organizations. The Soviet Union has not joined these organizations and should not be allowed to participate according to the law.

Open Badminton Singles and Doubles
　三塲俱成一面倒
All Three Games Become One-Sided
　李國璠單打輕取鄭墨
Li Guofan Easily Defeats Zheng Mo in Singles

　　〔本報訊〕羽毛球公開個人錦標賽，昨晚第二夕，六時起賽，初高級單打各一塲，高級雙打一塲，俱成一面倒形勢。初級單打司巴二對〇勝老將趙鐵保，高級單打李國璠二對〇輕取鄭墨，高級雙打徐國華李國璠二對〇勝王中成與伊凡諾夫，巿體育館空氣尚不寂寞。茲將比賽情况述後：
[Our Report] In the second evening of the Open Badminton Individual Championship last night, starting at 6 PM, one preliminary and one advanced singles match, and one advanced doubles match, all became one-sided. In the preliminary singles, Si Ba defeated veteran Zhao Tiebao 2-0. In the advanced singles, Li Guofan easily defeated Zheng Mo 2-0. In the advanced doubles, Xu Guohua and Li Guofan defeated Wang Zhongcheng and Ivanoff 2-0. The atmosphere at the City Gymnasium was not lonely. The details of the competition are described below:

　　初級單打
Preliminary Singles

　　首塲為初級單打，司巴最初頗佔優勢，五比二領前，老將趙鐵保善施高壓球，戰成各七各八平物，司巴幾下失誤，大呼「上帝」，反成十比十一為趙超出一分，瞬復見十二平手，難解難分，趙先進十三，因體肥吃力，願以二分定勝負，被「高鼻子」得利。
The first game was the preliminary singles. Si Ba initially had a significant advantage, leading 5-2. Veteran Zhao Tiebao was good at high-pressure shots, and the score was tied at 7 and 8. Si Ba made a few mistakes and shouted "God," which turned into 10-11, with Zhao leading by one point. Then the score was tied again at 12. It was difficult to tell who would win. Zhao advanced to 13 first, but because he was overweight, he was struggling. He was willing to decide the outcome with two points, which benefited the "tall nose."

　　第二區司巴仍因善奔便宜，對方心有餘而力不足，雖擬嚴密防守，卒為司巴以位置球屢次進製，戰成十五比七，老將軍一笑了之，勝負非所計也
In the second set, Si Ba still benefited from his good running. His opponent's heart was willing but his strength was not enough. Although he intended to defend strictly, Si Ba repeatedly scored with positional shots, making the score 15-7. The veteran general laughed it off, as the victory or defeat was not what he was concerned about.

　　高級單打
Advanced Singles

　　鄭墨先獲二分後，李國璠即不再容情，連得九分，未幾，即以十五比二結束首局，情緒未見緊張。
After Zheng Mo scored two points first, Li Guofan showed no mercy and scored nine consecutive points. Before long, he ended the first game with 15-2, and he did not seem nervous.

　　再戰第二局，李仍「輕描淡寫」，十五分頃刻立就，鄭則無所獲。
In the second game, Li still "painted lightly," and the fifteen points were quickly achieved, while Zheng gained nothing.

Essays and Anecdotes	Tears of Separation by Zhang Qiqu

Hui's plan to go to the United States began a year ago in Chongqing. It only gradually became concrete three months ago. With the Ministry of Education's approval, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' approval, the embassy's approval, obtaining a passport, applying for foreign exchange... step by step approaching, until the shipping company sent the notice of the departure date, we were not very interested in the farewell. Because in these three months, with each step forward, we held a farewell feast, sandwiched between Christmas, New Year, and the Lantern Festival, conveniently bidding farewell, and we don't know how many times we have treated her to wine and how many times we have danced. Now that she is really going on board, it's just eating and dancing! It's so boring.

Farewell words and blessings have also become commonplace. So, on the eve of boarding, everyone just quietly had a home-cooked meal and went to bed early to avoid being flustered the next day.

Traveling should be like this. Take things lightly. The eight years of the War of Resistance are just a fleeting moment; although going to the United States is ten thousand miles away, with today's scientific advancements, it is not as difficult as traveling from Nanjing to Beijing a hundred years ago. Those who are reluctant to part and act like children are just unable to control their emotions and are simply creating trouble for themselves.

Hui said: "Separation has a strange feeling, and tears will naturally flow. So it's best if everyone doesn't see me off, just vaguely, like going to Nanjing or Hangzhou, and let the ship sail away. "But I don't believe it. I want to see her off. I am confident that I can control myself. Qing and Yu, regardless of any reason, insisted on seeing her off at the pier. So the three of us helped her carry her suitcases and sent her to the Huangpu Wharf. There were already many passengers on the dock. A large 15,000-ton ocean liner was tightly docked against the riverbank like a screen, with a bridge ladder in the center for luggage and passengers to board. Those seeing off were not allowed on board and stood below waving to relatives and friends on the deck. Occasionally, there were one or two faces with sorrow, but most were happy.

Of course, those Americans were returning home and should be happy; Chinese people, whether going to study, investigate, meet lovers, or make a fortune overseas, should be even happier. Those with sorrowful faces are still creating trouble for themselves.

Qing said: "Maybe there isn't a single couple among the send-offs today. Otherwise, they definitely wouldn't not cry."

I don't believe it.

After the luggage was loaded onto the ship, Hui came down again to tell us about the general situation in the cabin and then went with us to eat shepherd's purse wontons near the pier. That was authentic Chinese dim sum, and after crossing the ocean, she would have no chance to enjoy such refreshing flavors again! Although the price was cheap, the taste was authentic. We casually talked, ate, and laughed, like having dim sum in a small restaurant. Although Hui admitted that her emotions were relatively fragile, she was calm and composed amidst everyone's nonchalant laughter. Qing had always been confident and strong, so naturally, there was no trace of sorrow either.

After eating, we smoked and chatted in the dim sum shop, waiting for time to pass. Time is a strange thing. If it were a traitor going to the execution ground, he would cherish these two hours very much. He could write a will, compose a farewell poem, write a letter to the chairman, complain, and scold people as much as possible; however, we just spent it in lighthearted conversation.

At two o'clock in the afternoon, we sent her back to the ship. At this time, there were even more people seeing her off. In the crowd, Yu first noticed a chubby foreign woman with tears all over her face. The remnants of lipstick from her relatives and children were on her cheeks, which was very ridiculous. Because the ship was about to depart, those who had boarded no longer came down, but just waved to the people below. Hui also stood on the deck, smiling and throwing candies at us.

Soon, Yu discovered a Chinese girl in a leather coat, standing far away alone, wiping her tears.

At this time, the river wind was very strong, the air pressure was quite low, and it looked like it was going to rain. Some foreign children were jumping and shouting below, greeting their mothers on the ship. Two foreigners were playing the accordion, and one was singing to relatives and friends below. One foreign man had just walked onto the bridge and quickly retreated to the base of the bridge, and another foreign man jumped up and hugged his neck for a kiss.

Foreigners express emotions more strongly than Chinese people, which is admirable.

Another old lady was wiping her eyes; after all, she was a woman. Men, at most, were like those three Chinese youths who looked like students, silently leaning on the railing and looking at each other.

Hui's smile had disappeared at some point. Qing was just walking alone in the distance, trying hard to restrain herself.

Three firecrackers were set off at the bow of the ship, which seemed to be a signal that it was about to set sail. There was a commotion on the shore, and people on the ship and ashore waved their hands together, mostly foreigners. As for the Chinese, Hui's hand was dragging and unable to wave! Qing was facing the river, taking off her glasses and putting them on again, not knowing what she was busy with. My heart began to feel a little heavy. But I was still objectively observing other people's expressions to regulate my own emotions.

The ship still hadn't left, but it was really starting to rain. Fortunately, it wasn't heavy, just a drizzle, hitting our faces, which was perfect for covering up people's tear stains. Several big men were also wiping their faces with handkerchiefs, not knowing whether they were wiping away rain or tears. But an old foreign man, because his hands were busy waving to the people on the ship, had no time to wipe his face, and I saw tears the size of soybeans rolling down.

After a while, the bridge was hoisted up by the sailors. More than a dozen workers on the shore held it up and worked together to remove it. With a loud noise, it was laid flat on the ground. This indicated that the ship was about to depart. There was another uproar on the shore, with people waving their hands up and down. Behind me, six or seven foreign men, eight or nine women, and more than a dozen children began to sing a farewell song. The singing was quite loud, but the sound was a bit shaky, and because of the slowness, it sounded a bit like a funeral song, making it even more sad. Those people were singing, waving, wiping tears, and blowing kisses with their hands.

The singing was hateful, and every sound seemed to drag me into the sorrow of parting. I could only stand firmly by the ship, waiting for the end of that funeral song.

The rain was getting heavier, and Qing and Yu were also standing stiffly in the front row, looking up at Hui. Although they were less than eight feet away from the railing, one was on the ship and the other was on the shore, as if separated by a natural barrier. Hui kept crying, first burying her face in her hands, as if afraid of being laughed at. Later, she simply revealed her crying face and stared blankly at the shore, seeming to be looking at us, yet seeming to see nothing, just lost in thought.

A Chinese girl standing next to Hui, whose relatives had already left, was still standing sadly on the deck, looking at the motherland she was about to leave with tearful eyes; on Hui's left, the three Chinese students with worried faces also waved their hands down, not knowing whether it was because the wind was strong and they were afraid of catching a cold, or whether they were afraid that the rain would wet their faces, only seeing them wave their hands once and wipe their noses twice. Looking closely at the direction of their gaze, it was clear that there were also three female guests below wiping their noses with them.

There were obviously more people crying. Old and young, men and women, foreigners and locals alike. Some people were also laughing, but that kind of laughter might have a deeper meaning than crying. Only me, I could control myself. I was fighting with the atmosphere of sorrow and parting, resisting the farewell song that sounded like a funeral march, and meeting Hui's tearful eyes. I wanted to stand firm in this torrent of tears and give the crying a reprimand!

Why cry? Since people have arranged their own destiny, they should bravely accept this fact. Crying is cowardly, it is contradictory!

With a crash, the ship was unmoored! At the same time, a spring-like tremor occurred on the shore and on the ship, and the highest level of the deck, two foreigners were braving the rain and playing the accordion again, and the foreigners on the second deck and their relatives and friends on the shore sang a majestic farewell song. The previous group singing the farewell song sang even more vigorously at this time, and the voices trembled even more, like praying in a church. An old priest on the ship also waved his hand sluggishly below.

Suddenly, the ship's whistle roared, and the sound was like a heavy bomb falling into the heart of the river, and like the echo of an empty valley, rumbling and hitting my heart fiercely. I couldn't hold on anymore. The ship, which was originally close to the dock, had now cracked a gap, that gap, like symbolizing the imperfection of life, and this imperfection was gradually expanding and expanding. People on the ship leaned half their bodies over the railing, ignoring the surging river water below, just waving their hands desperately to the shore. The farewell guests on the shore, like chasing a lost dream, walked forward step by step. Forgetting the rain above, the mud below, the coats that had already been soaked, the hands that had been stained with tears and snot, just waving! Shouting! Cherishing this last second!

Another whistle! My heart shook again.

This sound was like a long sigh of a hero, indicating a firm departure from this land! Originally, the passengers and the send-offs were very close, just like one person leaning on a window upstairs and one person standing downstairs. Now, it was like a piece of land suddenly divided into two, one piece was abandoned here, while the other went to another world across the vast ocean.

For three months, although we had been talking about farewells every day, and saying goodbye every day, we were still living together after all. No matter how we imagined it, we could not truly experience the taste of separation. Only this whistle, a song, and the fact that the ship's hull was gradually leaving the riverbank, made people deeply feel "separation".

The ship, like a soldier marching on an expedition without looking back, sailed proudly towards Wusong. I was originally only focusing on waving my hand, and I myself was waving desperately for her to see, but now the ship was going further and further away, and it was impossible to distinguish a single target, so I had to wave wildly at the whole crowd, and there was no point in waving any further. So the three of us left like we had lost something, and we slowly left the pier with our heads lowered. When we walked to the road, we remembered that there were many wet and greasy things on our faces. Regardless of whether it was tear stains or rain, we should wipe it off! Lest people recognize that we had just returned from seeing off at the pier.
Where are Today's Literary Figures Going? By Hu Shanhu

Looking at the records in the newspapers and listening to the news in the publishing industry, it seems that those who mainly work by writing have reached a dead end, and it is unlikely that there will be a miraculous turn for the better.

To save foreign exchange, newspapers are reducing their page count; with fewer pages, news and advertisements must maintain their original state, and the first to be sacrificed are naturally the various supplements and special columns that depend on literary figures for their livelihood.

Printing costs are soaring, sales are not guaranteed, and regular periodicals and single-volume books are shrinking and decreasing as much as possible. Publishers say that only blank paper is valuable; once it is printed with words, it is worthless. They also say that closing the door and sitting idle is easier than opening the door and doing business.

Among the literary figures, some capable people who know the times have long stopped writing. Some have gone into politics. Although the salary of civil servants is not high, they are still officials of some kind, and everyone likes to be an official. There must be a reason for this, and it is better than being a literary figure with no way out. Some have gone into business, learning the ropes from scratch. Aren't the people who live the most luxurious lives in Shanghai businessmen? Those who have property simply close their doors and stay at home, ceasing writing altogether.

Of course, there are also literary figures who do not become officials, do not go into business, and have no constant property, but are still able to live, and live very well. However, there are not many such literary figures, and we cannot generalize the majority from the minority and say that literary figures still have such a good way out.

Those who change careers and abandon the position of a literary figure are no longer literary figures; those who do not change careers but appear as literary figures with the attitude of politicians have actually left the base of literary figures and cannot be counted as literary figures either. Therefore, today's literary figures are suffering from the inner torment of having nowhere to express their spirits and the external pressure of difficult lives, and are only struggling on the line of death, with no way out!

Where are today's literary figures going? Perhaps this is a question that everyone is concerned about!

But heaven never seals off all exits! Who says that today's literary figures have no way to go? In addition to changing careers or semi-changing careers, there is still a way to go!

To alleviate the pressure of life, I think it is not difficult, based on my experience during the War of Resistance. Passively, reduce the needs of life and implement cost-cutting; actively, do extra work that is not contrary to your profession and implement income-generating. During the War of Resistance, when my family was at its most difficult, I lived in a money shop, and my family mainly ate porridge, while I taught at four universities and two night schools, teaching thirty-nine classes per semester. Our family actually managed to cope with it this way.

To relieve spiritual depression, I think it is especially easy. If articles cannot be published, they can simply be accumulated. Articles that are only timely and not lasting are not of much value. Not writing articles can also be a preparation for writing articles: experienced writers can use this to collect materials, and young writers can use this to learn more. In addition, there is another very meaningful and enjoyable job that can be done, and that is to educate the next generation.

Older literary figures do not need to call themselves old writers and act like they are selling their age; but based on their own experience and knowledge, they should sincerely and calmly guide those immature and aspiring young people. The times are so bad, but we still have to prepare ourselves for a cultural restart, let alone the younger generation! We should look further and not forget them. Of course, we cannot have any prejudices when guiding them, so as not to destroy this promising next generation.

"To gain the talents of the world and educate them," therefore, educating the next generation is indeed the most enjoyable thing.

The above is what I said because I was thinking from the perspective of the literary figures themselves. For those who have changed careers or semi-changed careers, I only have hope that they can return to the position of literary figures. I dare not satirize or scold them, and I hope that the literary figures who have changed careers will not misunderstand.

This is a very serious era. All those who are literary figures, whether current literary figures or past literary figures (literary figures who have changed careers), should find a way out for themselves and for individuals. Satire or scolding are unnecessary.

Where are today's literary figures going? I am willing to throw a brick to attract jade in soliciting more valuable answers.
Meeting Yuanzhi and responding to Xin Hai's invitation, briefly describing Sullivan, suddenly having a glimpse, and despondently composing this, to the tune of Partridge Sky. By Yuli

Reflecting the image, a startled goose separates the spring seat, the person before me is the person from last year. Shoulder-to-shoulder sweet words are infinitely charming, swaying silver lamps are especially affectionate. Searching for old dreams, dreams are like dust, changing notes, a thousand layers of regret remain. When will I go to West Lake in a straw raincoat, repenting for all the love and anger in my heart!
Rhyming with Yuli's original poem by Guanya

Dreams are broken, the silver screen is dim, and there is no spring. The water flows and the flowers fall silently, with no one around. The soul melts before the treasure tree statue, I long for you, looking through Penglai after our farewell. The lotus turns to inches, the musk turns to dust, vainly shedding clear tears to stain new traces. Who pities the days of jade smiles and pearl fragrance, and even divines that love will turn to anger today!

Every inch of territory lost, an inch of blood shed. By Ye Jingfeng
"Is there any way to get that Miss Pingzi here?" Mr. W asked.

"Maybe that woman is her... aunt?" Hu Cheng actually opened his mouth too. I thought he understood the topic we were discussing now; and he was someone who was not confused, so he would immediately think of the woman who threatened Mr. W's secret agency.

"Even if she's not here, we can still try!" I suddenly added this sentence.

"Oh!" He Jian understood.

"But? ... Yaoqun also seems to know what I'm up to."

"That's right," I found their surprise just now a little funny, "treat people in the same way they treat you... but this is also a last resort, and it's not entirely certain."

Only two people here might not understand my plan, one is Mr. W, I haven't known him for long after meeting him, and there hasn't been time to talk about my life story; so he doesn't know that I have some kind of trick. The other is Hu Chen, one is because he is young and lacks some knowledge; the other is because Yaoqun discussed the issue of spy technology with me the day before yesterday due to a chance opportunity. She said that she used to follow that foreign teacher and learned some preliminary applied psychology and understood some hypnotism, but unfortunately she didn't have time to practice, etc. But I advised her to give up on this; because this thing is not like other sciences, in addition to theory and design, other implementations are all on the material level. The subject of this thing is completely on the spiritual level; to put it mysteriously, it is completely a kind of "telepathy" effect. The control of this kind of telepathy, just like boxing skills, requires years of training and cultivation to have a little certainty. Moreover, there is also a big problem of whether a person's innate talent is suitable for this kind of cultivation. Hu Chen was not with us when I discussed this issue with Yaoqun, so he didn't know about it at all.

When I advised Yaoqun to give up on this, she had some doubts, so I had to tell her about my learning, experimentation, cultivation, and various experiences, and she believed it. So today, as soon as she heard me say that "there is a way", her thoughts were so quick that she guessed it immediately.

"Can it be done?" Yaoqun widened her beautiful eyebrows, as if recalling the content of the subject she had learned before.

"It can be done in a big way," I nodded to him. Then I told Mr. W and Hu Chen in a few simple sentences about the topic of my question and answer with her, so as not to leave them in the dark.

"I seem to remember a kind of 'remote suggestion' method..." Yaoqun was searching her memory.

"Almost there," I encouraged her to continue.

"...But remote suggestion requires that the subject has been suggested once or twice before it can perform special conduction, right? You don't even know how tall Miss Pingzi is, let alone how old she is?..."

"No, it doesn't matter much. We can use a transitional method for indirect conduction..." I was about to announce the method I planned; because at this time, Mr. W and He Jian, as well as Hu Cheng, were impatiently hoping that I would explain all the plans at once; especially Hong Jian, seeing me studying academic questions with Yaoqun in such a leisurely manner, wished he could give me a shot, but Yaoqun interrupted me again:

"Indirect conduction also requires a suitable medium. Isn't that right?"

"That's right, don't we have a ready-made medium here?" I glanced at He Jian, "Isn't Mr. He a ready-made transitional bridge? ... As long as I tell Brother He some simple 'self-hypnosis' methods and let him experiment, and then I will help from the side with my telepathy... I hope to connect to telepathy, and things will be easy to handle."
Literary and Art World by Hua

The "Level Literary Weekly" edited by Yu Zaichun and Zhang Junxiang has been typeset. The content includes translations by Mi Guangqian, Yuan Shuibai, Wei Jinzhi, etc., and is scheduled to be published on March 1.

Tian Han's 50th birthday is being enthusiastically celebrated by the film and drama circles.

The contract between Shanghai Drama Society and "Guanghua" is difficult to continue because the front desk demanded too high a guarantee (the number was 6 million before the film price increase, and it needs to be doubled after the price increase), so "Shangju" will have no place to use its talents and will soon revive "Cronyism" as a farewell performance to the audience.

There is talk of Yuan Xuefen making a comeback.

"General" Sheng Jialun came from the Northeast by order, for several months, (once went to Hong Kong to order equipment) ate all over Shanghai, and said to people: "The things are delicious."

Fei Mu led a location shooting team to the Soviet Union, but this year's spring was cold, and the peach blossoms did not bloom. This trip yielded nothing, and he has now returned to Shanghai. It is said that the time for completing "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains" is expected to be extended by another year.

"Golden" Zhou Xinfang (Qilintong) announced that he will stage "Wen Tianxiang" soon and is stepping up rehearsals.

Geng Zhen had a lover in the rear. The woman was already married, but her husband had been studying in the United States for many years and could not be found. Unexpectedly, he recently returned from being gilded, and the couple repaired their old relationship. Lao Geng was disappointed and greatly "saddened."

He Xuechu and his wife recuperated in their hometown for several months. After returning, they underwent an X-ray fluoroscopy, and their lungs were very clear. Friends were happy for them.

Jiang Junchao departed from Hong Kong to Shanghai to negotiate with Lan Ma and others to go to Hong Kong to film.

Free Talk	Beethoven's Music is Further Away from You! By Wei

On the Conversion of Radio Prices in the Market

Would you like to listen to a Beethoven symphony?

Would you like to listen to a low-pitched love song by Bing Crosby?

Would you like to listen to Hollywood jazz music?

I believe you would. When you are quietly in front of a dim light, you will definitely want to turn on the radio you have on hand, select a radio station you like, and listen to your favorite songs, so that your irritable mind can be immersed in the mellow, sweet, and warm songs.

However, this kind of enjoyment in life, spiritual nourishment, we have now lost the only chance to comfort ourselves due to the heaviness of life. (Although, what I am talking about is only limited to the middle class, how can ordinary people talk about it?)

Before the war, radios were originally aristocratic entertainment items. A slightly better radio would cost around forty or fifty yuan to one hundred yuan. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the price of radios was much cheaper than before the war. Naturally, the RCA Philips radios from before the war cannot be bought now. Most of the radios used in the market as store promotions are new products from the United States after the war. These radios are all famous brands, with many names. Most of the large ones are samples, and the price of each one is around 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. There is no square box on the surface, and there are four or five vacuum tubes, but there are two problems: first, the filaments are easy to burn out, and generally have a lifespan of no more than one year, and second, many small radios cannot be repaired when they are broken, because Shanghai does not have these new sensor parts. Where are you going to repair them?

The reason why the United States wants to manufacture this batch of sample-style radios to dump to the mountain country is very simple. First, if good radios are sold first, who will want these radios with simple materials and short vacuum tube life in the future?

If the lifespan of this batch of sample radios is one year, then the later batch of better radios can follow up.

Radios similar to the Air King brand were all the rage for a while because you could have a radio with not-so-bad sound on your desk for only 150,000 to 200,000 yuan, which would satisfy your desire for radio programs to some extent. Isn't this a pleasant thing?

However, after this gold rush and foreign exchange adjustment, the prices of radios on the market have fluctuated greatly.

A small radio that used to cost around 200,000 yuan now sells for 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, jumping three times at once!

A new Philips shortwave radio will rise by more than double.

All materials such as No. 38 wire, earphones, vacuum tubes, and all radio parts have increased by an average of three times in price.

That is to say, a radio that was priced at 3,300 yuan in foreign exchange now has to be settled at 12,000 yuan.

During this conversion period, the radio jumped to a throne of three times the price.

A set of five-lamp vacuum tubes used to cost only 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, but now it costs more than 200,000 yuan. A Telefunken earphone used to cost only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, but now it costs more than 100,000 yuan.

Music, and all the broadcast programs that you are interested in, are further away from your life and more inaccessible.

If you feel very threatened by life, do you still have the spare time to purchase a radio that costs five or six hundred thousand or more than one million yuan?

This is almost a dream.

Recently, there is a kind of pocket radio on the market that uses Tiandi money (the large one uses a mineral device) and sells for 120,000 yuan, but the sound is small and weak. People who are obsessed with broadcasting will definitely not be satisfied, right?
Ingrid Bergman, the Actress Who is Popular in the Film Industry by Guohua

Sweden is a place that produces big stars. There was Garbo before, and Ingrid Bergman after. And Bergman's success has surpassed Garbo's. The first film that Shanghai audiences knew Bergman from was "Casablanca", the second was "The Bells of St. Mary's", and the third should be "Iron Heart Like Iron", which is about to be released at Dahua. According to the American "Vanity Fair" magazine: Last year (1946), there were nineteen films in Hollywood that were very popular, and the rental fee for each film was about 4 million US dollars. Bergman alone had four of them, with a total income of 21.75 million. The second was Bing Crosby, whose film rental income totaled 18 million. Among the nineteen films, the first to make money was naturally "The Bells of St. Mary's" starring Bergman and Bing Crosby.
Bergman also discussed "vampires" in another scene in "Iron Heart Like Iron" by Mai Ye

Ingrid Bergman also appeared on the Broadway stage. Her "Joan of Arc" made her win an unprecedented victory like Joan of Arc, conquering Broadway. According to the "Life" magazine report, as long as Bergman is willing to continue acting, this play can always sell well. From this point of view, it can be imagined that Bergman is popular in the film and drama circles.

Earlier this month, a real "horrific news" occurred in Versailles, France: near this beautiful city, a "vampire" who came and went without a trace was discovered. He attacked women several times, stripping them naked and then biting their entire bodies, sucking human blood, putting their lives in danger. The latest telegram said that this "ghost" has been arrested. The case will be tried in the future, and the process is afraid that it will be more sensational than first-class detective novels and the most popular horror movies.

The telegram said it very briefly, but there is enough material for us to determine that this "ghost" is just a male sexual pervert. I believe that this criminal will be identified by psychologists using scientific methods to see if there is a hand disease in his brain, and it is very likely that he will be sentenced very lightly in the future, or even acquitted. He will not be sent to prison, nor will he be executed, but he will always have to stay in a mental hospital.

In the second half of the 18th century, there was a Marquis de Sade in France who wrote many novels. The male protagonists he described always liked to use various cruel methods on women, and the male protagonists themselves perversely obtained sexual satisfaction. His whipping of her was nothing more than the pursuit of sexual stimulation, and when the whipping reached its fiercest point, he would obtain sexual climax. During this period, no matter her screams, pain, or convulsions, ... none of them could help fuel his sexual lust. This is obviously a kind of perverted behavior. Later, people realized that the male protagonist in the novel was just the author's incarnation, and he himself had this kind of perverted sexual desire. Therefore, his name later simply became the sign of this kind of "pleasure" perverted sexual behavior, that is, the so-called "Sadism", which we usually translate as "sadism", "sadist", "sadist", etc.

As for stripping the woman's entire body before committing the crime, the motive is probably more of a manifestation of a perverted sexual behavior, and not just as a preliminary preparation for biting their entire bodies. We can easily speculate that the struggle and resistance of a woman being forced to strip naked by a thug, and the shock and horror she expresses emotionally when suddenly attacked, are in the eyes of the sadist, the ultimate "sexual stimulation." Perhaps, the pursuit of this stimulation is the purpose of his crime.
"Life" Magazine is About to Increase in Price by Hua

A long time ago, when I wanted to subscribe to "Shipping Digest", I asked the Dongya Bookstore, and the staff told me that it would cost six or seven US dollars a year (I don't remember clearly), and more than 20,000 in legal tender. I regret that I shouldn't have hesitated at the time and procrastinated until now. The day before yesterday, I went to ask, and it cost more than 90,000 in legal tender. I was hesitant before because of 20,000, but now I can only sigh at the "ocean" because of more than 90,000. If I can't subscribe to magazines, I can only buy one to see what's there, I bought a copy of "Life" magazine. The December 23rd international edition had already increased in price, but now it has fallen to 1,500 yuan, which made me feel happy when I bought it, as if I had bought some cheap goods. After that, I bought a copy of "Time" from January 27, but it cost me 4,000 yuan without discount. The staff replied to my question, "This is the new 'Time', when the new 'Life' comes, it will naturally increase in price!" After I bought it and read it in my small room, I felt that this "spiritual food" has really become a luxury, and it is not something that we, the national people of this country, can enjoy.

Writing here, I heard a squeaking sound from the rats on the bookshelf, as if they were saying to me, "Well, you are wearing tattered old clothes, you are living in dirty and dilapidated houses, you are a small person in an ancient country of two thousand years, ..."

I can only put down my pen.
Rescuing Child Prodigies - "Thoughts on Untitled" One of Many by Meng Long

Occasionally, I saw a gossip news item saying that it was rumored among the people in Guangxi that a new child prodigy had been discovered in Liujiang. Two years ago, he was only three years old, and he could already hum the sentence "The grass is green in Jiangnan for thousands of miles, kill the Japanese and return to Nanjing." At that time, the enemy's power was still rampant. Unexpectedly, in the summer and autumn of that year, Japan was indeed defeated, as predicted by this little poet, so they recognized him as a child prodigy.

It is said that this child prodigy, in terms of appearance, except for a protruding forehead, is the same as ordinary children and has no special characteristics. One common point is that he is living a miserable life eating grass roots and tree bark like other Guangxi children, and he has no nutrition at all, so his physical condition is very weak.

What aroused my curiosity was not the child prodigy's poem, but a tail at the end of this news item. It said: It is hoped that the government should find ways to educate the child prodigy, and in the future, he may become a special talent for the country.

I think: Whether the child prodigy can be called "divine", and whether the child prodigy's old poems have another ghostwriter, I will not discuss it for the time being, I will only talk about it based on the facts. Child prodigies are the same as ordinary children, and if they are not given nutrition, even if they are lucky enough not to die, the "protruding forehead" part will become more and more protruding. Even if they are lucky enough to be given nutrition, and in education, they still hum "The grass is green in Jiangnan for thousands of miles" and other kinds of stuff, at best, they can only create a monster in the old poetry world in the future - maybe this is the so-called "special talent"?

I see, this is not necessarily the case. "The grass is green in Jiangnan for thousands of miles", although it cannot be said that it is not a line of poetry, but such a line of poetry, in the eyes of adults, is already "a headache". Is it really "once is too much, can it be repeated?" I am afraid that if he hums like this, his destiny will at most begin with "child prodigy" and end with "child prodigy" - why? It is because he matures and dies early.

In a word: Rather than save a "special talent", it is better to save thousands upon thousands of ordinary children!
Film Talk Iron Heart Like Iron by Liu

For the sake of the call of two famous actors, Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman, I believe it is a work cherished by the audience.

However, because of the emptiness of the content itself, although it is strange and painted with mysterious colors, its evaluation cannot surpass the recently unanimously praised "Madame Curie".

Although "Madame Curie" is just a scientific biographical film, it has content, inspiration, and complete form. It should get the honor it deserves.

"Iron Heart Like Iron" is not the case. Its content only tells the story of a husband with a perverted mentality who is preparing to murder his wife. In terms of content, it is overhead. Moreover, the development of the story is not rigorous and complete enough. Therefore, the organization of the whole film is not very reasonable. For example, it is not very clever for the young policeman to rashly enter the heroine's inner room and immediately reveal the secret of the whole play.

Director George Cukor, although a master (he has directed films such as "Gaslight"), is limited by the limitations of the story and cannot exert his best. This is a pity.

However, the director can grasp most of the atmosphere. The initial warmth, the mist, and the gas street lamps are all very strong.

Bergman and Boyer's acting skills are excellent and pure. It is definitely worth seeing.

### Chinatown "Mayor" Talks About Recent Events of Overseas Chinese - Li Zhenhui Insistently Asks Mayor Wu to Smoke a Cigar

[Our Newspaper's Report] Fellow countrymen in the motherland may not be very familiar with him, but among the overseas Chinese in New York, almost no one doesn't know Li Zhenhui - this Mr. Li, praised as the "Mayor" of New York's Chinatown, was born and raised in the United States for sixty years. He only stayed in China for eighteen months during his first return to the country. This time, he was delighted to make his second visit to the motherland, and he felt especially happy to meet the mayor of Shanghai the day before yesterday. The "Mayor" Li, who smokes ten cigars a day, didn't want to enjoy the pleasure of cigars alone, and insisted that Mayor Wu put down his pipe and try a cigar as well, and then he began his interesting conversation.

Li's English name is Shaney (Shave Head). He knows that people will find it strange why he uses this special name, so he always tells everyone that when he was little, his father often shaved his head completely. At school, his classmates didn't know what his name was, and when they saw his bald head, they called him Shayey. From then on, no one knew his real English name except for "Bald Head".

At the same time, because he smokes ten cigars every day, his friends gave him the nickname "Five times Five".

New York's Chinatown currently has six thousand overseas Chinese, who have been living and working in peace under the leadership of "Mayor" Li for the past twenty years. In addition, all 30,000 overseas Chinese in New York regard "Mayor" Li as their leader. At the same time, he also holds an important position in the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of America. Almost all overseas Chinese in the United States are members of this association, and it bears a very large responsibility, including organizing Chinese education so that every Chinese child attends Chinese school after finishing school in the United States. During our country's war of resistance, the association mobilized every overseas Chinese to donate five U.S. dollars per month to contribute to the motherland. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association is also responsible for helping unemployed overseas Chinese. During the period of economic depression in the United States, the U.S. government organized relief for unemployed people throughout the United States and provided them with jobs, but very few Chinese went to ask for relief because they helped each other and sought ways out.

The most admirable thing is that it is rare for overseas Chinese in the United States to go to court to file lawsuits. If disputes occur between families, they often hold family meetings to discuss and resolve them. If they cannot be resolved, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association will mediate or adjudicate.

Representative Li brought a common saying from overseas Chinese in the United States, especially the elderly, to the fellow countrymen in the motherland. He said, "Most of them grew up in the United States and have never seen the motherland. Their greatest hope at present is to be able to return to the motherland once. The elderly all hope to return and sleep in the ground of the motherland." Overseas Chinese crowd to board ships back to the country every day, but unfortunately, there are few ships and many people, and transportation is inconvenient.

Finally, "Mayor" Li expressed his deep admiration for Mayor Wu. He believes that Mayor Wu has the talent of New York Mayor LaGuardia and has the same courage, but Mayor Wu's environment and the various measures he needs to cope with are actually more difficult and arduous than those of Mayor LaGuardia.

### India Answers Our Government's Protest - Pan-Asian Conference - Purely a Cultural Organization - Does Not Invite Countries to Participate

[United Press, Nanjing, on the 21st] It is reported that the Chinese government has lodged an informal protest with India because India invited Tibet to attend the Pan-Asian Conference. The Chinese government also pointed out that Tibet is a part of the Republic of China, and India's invitation to Tibet is actually insulting. However, according to the Indian side, the Chinese government's protest is unnecessary because the invitation to Tibet was issued by Indian Prime Minister Nehru in his personal capacity as the president of the Indian Council of World Affairs and does not represent the Indian government. It was also pointed out that the conference is a purely cultural organization and does not invite countries to participate. For example, six or seven Soviet federations were invited, but the Soviet Union was not included in the invitation.

### Yangzheng Will Hold a Memorial Service - For a Forty-Year-Old Teacher

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Cao Hao, the founder of the Municipal Yangzheng Elementary School, styled Hanting, was a respected member of the Shanghai Xiaonanmen family. He taught at Yangzheng Elementary School for more than 40 years, tirelessly. He died of illness on the 19th of last month at the age of 75. It is reported that Mr. Cao wrote a self-eulogy before his death, saying: "Having lived in the world for seventy-five years, I have protected the Confucian temple and managed the ancestral hall. I have worked hard to assist schools and have wholeheartedly cultivated them. I have never planned for personal gain and have always sought public welfare. My intention is sincere, and I have tried my best to be a human being. I have encountered three or four disturbances, including internal strife and foreign insults. The Jin Dynasty was completely destroyed, and there was no home to return to. In my later years, I lost my sight and suffered from hemiplegia. Heaven has repaid me in this way, could it be the karma of a previous life?" Qian Xuanqing, the principal of Yangzheng, said that Mr. Cao had a clear conscience, was selfless and strict, was kind to people throughout his life, and was upright in his dealings with the world.
