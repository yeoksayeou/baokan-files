### Wedemeyer Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing; Issues Written Statement Clarifying Purpose of Visit to Shanghai; Invites Chinese and American Figures to Exchange Views Today

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, Jiangwan Airport presented a lively scene due to General Wedemeyer's arrival in Shanghai. Commander Xuan and Chairman Fang arrived around 9:00 AM and waited quietly for the distinguished guest. At 9:45 AM, Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan drove in and, seeing the people on the scene, exclaimed, "You came very early." Representatives of 36 Shanghai organizations, led by Xie Renzhao, Wang Zhuyi, and Shui Xiangyun, arrived successively. American Consul General Davis, Flying Tiger General Chennault, and American military personnel also arrived one after another. The number of welcoming personnel at the airport exceeded two hundred, forming a long line with a welcome flag inscribed in Chinese and English with "Welcome General Wedemeyer Delegation." The 701st Platoon of the U.S. Military Police stood ready for inspection by the special envoy. At exactly 10:00 AM, an airplane shadow appeared in the clear sky. At 10:05 AM, the silver giant Samsung aircraft with tail number 49149 landed. The tall and slender Special Envoy Wedemeyer, wearing a Han blue casual suit and a white pith helmet, stepped down from the aircraft door. Consul General Davis took the lead to shake hands and pay respects. Mayor Wu then shook hands to express his welcome, saying: Shanghai representatives from all walks of life originally planned to hold a grand welcome ceremony, but because they learned that the investigation was busy with official duties and time was precious, they only sent representatives to the airport to welcome them. He then introduced Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, Chairman Fang, and Director Chen Guolian to meet with the Special Envoy. Wedemeyer walked to the front of the welcoming line, shaking hands and greeting everyone one by one. There were many old friends among the special envoy, and they were very happy to meet. Hu Yunqiu, the manager of the Sino-Belgian Bank, brought his family to the airport to welcome Wedemeyer. When they met, he asked, "Is your nose better?" Wedemeyer repeatedly said, "Better, better." Ms. Wu Weici, representative of the Chinese Women's Association, and Ms. Yang Tianlin, daughter of Yang Xiaotian, presented flowers to pay their respects. Wedemeyer thanked them repeatedly. At 10:15 AM, Special Envoy Wedemeyer and the investigation personnel drove to their private residence to rest.

Written Statement

After arriving, Wedemeyer issued a written statement, stating the purpose of his visit to Shanghai and his impressions of China. The content is as follows: "As I pointed out in my first press release after arriving in Beijing on Tuesday, during this short trip, members of our delegation will visit various places as much as possible and obtain authoritative materials from a variety of different sources. Over the past four days, we have sought factual information and gained a lot. We have obtained statistical data from various government departments, as well as materials from the education, industry, commerce, and other professional sectors. We hope to obtain a cross-section of the political, economic, and psychological state. Therefore, the initial visit to Shanghai will provide a good opportunity to supplement the financial and economic materials we have already obtained. We have received many suggestions of different natures from many authoritative sources. Those who made these suggestions are all people of your country who hope to establish a stable political and economic system. Therefore, what we said in our first speech, that we are most concerned about learning about the measures taken by China in the hope of revival and how effective they are, has aroused the sympathy and resonance of countless patriotic and selfless people of your country. At the same time, I have obtained affirmative expressions from these sources: that in order to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of China's politics and the smooth restoration of economic stability, many constructive steps should be taken. What our delegation is now concerned about is what constructive steps have been taken."

### Developing Sino-American Trade; Chamber of Commerce to Submit Written Opinions

[Our Newspaper] According to Ge Jiecun, a standing director of the Chamber of Commerce, who told reporters: General Wedemeyer originally planned to talk with representatives of China's industrial and commercial circles during his visit to Shanghai, but this has been cancelled due to the excessive time. Shou Jingwei, secretary-general of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, said: Marshal Marshall's visit to China in the past focused on the political aspects, while Wedemeyer's visit this time has also involved the economic sector. The Federation of Chambers of Commerce will submit written opinions within a few days for General Wedemeyer's reference, focusing on developing Sino-American trade. Industrial and commercial circles originally planned to publicly host Wedemeyer, but this has been cancelled. However, before Wedemeyer came to Shanghai, the American side hoped that China's industry and commerce would prepare materials, so it is not impossible for some industrial and commercial leaders, such as Xu Jizhen, Li Fuxun, and Han Huiqing, to visit Wedemeyer in their private capacity for a few minutes of conversation. Zhang Yujiu believes that Wedemeyer's trip to Shanghai is too hasty to meet with representatives of China's industrial and commercial circles, but he may leave economic advisors in Shanghai when he goes to Beijing tomorrow to contact China's industrial and commercial circles and conduct investigations.

### U.S. Policy Toward China Association Issues Open Letter to Special Envoy Wedemeyer, Urging the U.S. to Honor Promises and Provide Economic and Military Assistance to China, and for the Soviets to Compensate for Losses in Northeast China

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] The U.S. Policy Toward China Association (the late Powell, publisher of the China Weekly Review, once served as its president) has recently issued an open letter to General Wedemeyer, Special Representative of the President, urging the U.S. to honor its promise of "providing only economic assistance and military supplies to the National Government of China." The letter, dated July 17, was forwarded to Wedemeyer through the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing. The salient points are excerpted below:

When President Roosevelt approved Secretary of State Hull's note to Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Nomura Kichisaburo, on November 26, 1941, he finally adopted a firm stance to fully realize the Open Door Policy announced by former Secretary of State John Hay in 1899 and included in the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 by former Secretary of State Hughes. In his note to Nomura, Secretary of State Hull insisted that the U.S. and Japan should agree to cooperate only with the National Government of China in "political, economic, and military affairs." However, in the Yalta Secret Agreement, President Roosevelt granted certain privileges in Northeast China to the Soviet Union, thereby agreeing to undermine the Open Door Policy. Both sides also made a clear understanding that the Soviet Union would only recognize the National Government of China. The following August, the above understanding was formally documented in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and the Soviet Union agreed to provide only economic assistance and military supplies to the National Government of China. Since then, the Soviet Union has deliberately violated almost every point of the treaty, providing only assistance and military supplies to the Chinese Communist Party. We have also violated the Yalta Agreement, as we have provided assistance to both the Chinese Communists and the National Government. We believe that at present, we should respect the Open Door Policy of 1922 and the rumors about China's independence and territorial integrity. Therefore, we must continue to give our fullest support to the National Government of China, as we did in times of crisis, "because this crisis gave rise to the Pearl Harbor incident." We should also respect President Roosevelt's sacred promise made at the Cairo Conference to "return the Northeast to the Republic of China." Now is the time for the Soviet Union to abide by its sacred agreement and for the National Government of China to recognize various principles and obligations, and for the United States to make a decisive contribution to the war in the Pacific. Since the Victory over Japan Day, our government has refused the National Government of China to purchase military arms or ammunition and requested the United Kingdom to take the same attitude, but today is the time to provide China with assistance so that it can defeat the Communist rebellion instigated, directed, and armed by the Soviet Union. The National Government of China is fighting for us today, just as the United Kingdom did in 1940 to 1941. We should establish a policy that respects all our words and international agreements, restores our credibility in the eyes of one billion people in Asia, and avoids a more terrifying Second Pearl Harbor incident.

### Regarding the Japanese Peace Treaty and the Future of the Nation, the Government Should Declare its Position Early; Supervisory Committee Members Propose Five Recommendations

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] As the United States invited the eleven member countries of the Far Eastern Commission to hold preliminary discussions on the Japanese peace treaty, members of the Supervisory Yuan, Liu Shidu, Yang Zongpei, Cai Zisheng, Wang Guanwu, and Liu Yantao, proposed five recommendations, advocating that the government make a clear statement on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. The recommendations, approved by Yu Youren, have been submitted to the Executive Yuan. Before presenting the recommendations, Liu and others first stated: "Our country's war of resistance against Japan, after eight years of bloody battles, has achieved victory, but a peace treaty has not yet been signed. Recently, it has been heard that the United States has invited the member countries of the Far Eastern Commission to preliminarily discuss the issue of the Japanese peace treaty on August 19. The Japanese peace treaty is not only the conclusion of settling the blood debts of the war of resistance but also the prelude to opening up the future of the nation. Our government should have declared a clear position and attitude on this major issue so that the participating countries can understand it and respect the opinions of our country, which led the war of resistance against Japan. However, to this day, the government has not made any expression on this matter, nor has it ever expressed any views on the occupation of Japan. It has not submitted any documents in the Far Eastern Commission, which foreign critics find strange. As of today, it is impossible to remain silent."

The five recommendations of Liu and others are: (1) Although our country embraces forgiveness toward Japan and does not dwell on past grievances, the peace treaty should strictly stipulate in all aspects to guarantee that there is no danger of being invaded again, such as never allowing the establishment of an army, destroying military industries, and re-educating the Japanese people. (2) MacArthur's advocacy that Japan retain the industrial standards above 1930 to 1934 should be opposed by our country. According to the Cairo Declaration, Japan should be reduced to an agricultural country. Our country must insist that Japan's industry cannot exceed China's industrial level, so as to prevent economic aggression from happening again. All equipment of Japan's industry that exceeds the current level of China's industry should be dismantled and used to compensate for all public and private losses during the war of resistance. The materials to be compensated to our country should also include sufficient ships for transportation. (3) The value of the materials absorbed by Japan and its puppet government in China by issuing counterfeit currency should be fully compensated by Japan. It is reported that the gold and treasures in the Bank of Japan are worth about 200 million U.S. dollars, and the Japanese government secretly holds diamonds, gold, and cloth worth 75 billion yuan, which should be used as compensation. Our country should demand at least half of it to reorganize our monetary system. (4) Our country and Japan must open up trade with each other only on an equal industrial level, otherwise, our country's industry will inevitably suffer oppression. (5) After the peace treaty is signed, our country should continue to participate in military occupation and political supervision for a considerable period so that Japan can be thoroughly democratized, and there will be no more monopolistic capitalists or militaristic warlords, and there will be no danger of aggression again. The conclusion states that the above points are the minimum conditions for opening up the future of our country and meeting security requirements, and we should make a clear statement based on the position of a victorious country.

### The Motion to Postpone Opening Trade with Japan is Passed by the Standing Committee of the Senate, and the Decided Measures are Submitted to the Government for Implementation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Standing Committee of the Senate held a plenary review meeting on the issue of temporarily postponing the opening of trade with Japan on the 26th. Representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Economy, and Finance were invited to attend and report. The meeting was chaired by Cao Dehui. After the report, the chairman presented the two proposals on trade with Japan that had not been concluded in the Standing Committee meeting on the 25th for discussion. One was proposed by Zheng Kuiyi and others, "Requesting the government to temporarily postpone the opening of trade with Japan before signing the peace treaty with Japan," and the other was proposed by Xue Mingjian, "Proposed to request the government to temporarily postpone the opening of trade with Japan." After heated debate among the senators, a conclusion was reached at 12 o'clock as follows: "The two proposals are merged for discussion, with two measures: (1) Request the government to temporarily postpone the opening of private trade with Japan before the peace treaty is signed; (2) In order to seek temporary exchange of goods with Japan, the past barter trade methods with Japan can be improved or expanded. Submit it to the government for handling." The meeting on the 26th was a plenary review meeting. However, as decided by the plenary meeting of the Standing Committee on the 25th, the conclusion made by the plenary review meeting is the conclusion of the Standing Committee, so it will be submitted to the government for handling according to the decision of the review meeting.

At today's meeting, Huang Zheng, a representative from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reported that after learning that MacArthur's headquarters had decided to open Japan's foreign trade, and after our delegation to Japan reported that various countries would send business inspection groups to Japan, the ministry invited relevant agencies to study the methods. It was then decided to send a business inspection group to Japan to study the actual situation of industry and commerce in Japan. At the same time, he telegraphed our ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, about three things: (1) Does the decision on whether trade with Japan requires the control of Japanese institutions need to be passed by the Far Eastern Commission? (2) Has it been passed by the Far Eastern Commission? (3) Has our representative expressed any views? Ambassador Gu replied that the Far Eastern Commission is discussing this issue. Therefore, what we are considering is whether we can prevent it from opening if we object? If we take an opposing attitude and do not open up, and other countries can still trade with it, it will also be a loss for us diplomatically. Zhu, a representative from the Ministry of Finance, reported that the issue of opening up trade with Japan is related to the Ministry of Finance in two points: (1) Trade with Japan requires payment in U.S. dollars, but our U.S. dollar reserves are too small. Some people believe that we can exchange sugar and salt for U.S. dollars, so there will be no difficulty. However, according to the investigation, our past trade with Japan has always had a large deficit, so this point is worth noting. (2) The Allied Headquarters stipulates that the price of goods is based on the world market price to support Japanese exporters, which will be a major blow to our commerce in the future. Yang Shuren, a representative from the Ministry of Economy, also continued to give a brief report on the receipt of the notice from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the preparations for the business inspection group to Japan. Senators Xue Mingjian, Wu Zhaoxu, Gan Jiaxin, and Zheng Kuiyi raised questions one after another after the reports from the various ministries, and the representatives answered them on the spot before leaving.

Opinions of the Senators

Then, the senators once again raised their opinions on "temporary postponement." Almost all of the proposers and speakers opposed the opening, but because international diplomacy had to be taken into account, there was room for consideration. Therefore, none of the speakers advocated opening. Wu Zhaoxu said: "I believe that the issue of opening up trade with Japan is not a policy decision, but a technical discussion. We transport raw materials out and import consumer goods. And since we have sent a business inspection group to Japan, we naturally cannot prevent Japanese business groups from coming to our country. Following this, the Japanese can go to our Northeast and our Taiwan. In the future, disputes will continue to occur, and the Wanbaoshan Incident may be repeated. Can we not take this as a warning?" Gan Jiaxin believes that after opening trade with Japan, whether there will be any impact on Sino-Japanese relations politically should be considered. At the same time, we can focus on discussing the following points: (1) Please notify the government that the Allied Headquarters should adopt strict control policies on trade with Japan and should not support the remnants of Japanese imperialism; (2) The unreasonable measures in the policy of opening up Japan's foreign trade should be corrected by the Allied Headquarters. For example, after our country promulgated the import and export subsidy measures, the United States immediately announced countermeasures to offset our country's export promotion measures. Should similar events also occur in trade with Japan? Attention should be paid to this; (3) The government should make plans for the current financial and international trade situation for the opening of trade with Japan; (4) Before these preparations are completed, temporarily postpone the opening of trade. Later, several senators raised their opinions, believing that if Japanese goods flood the market in the future, and various market items compete to dump, our country's industrial and commercial economy will inevitably suffer a severe blow. If there is another war in the future, it will not be possible to see it today.

Decision to Merge the Two Proposals

Also, the representative of the Ministry of Finance stated that before the peace treaty with Japan is signed, it is not subject to the restrictions of the International Trade Conference, and tariffs can be freely determined, increased, or changed. Therefore, our country's tariffs on Japan may have a special tariff, that is, (1) those that help our industrial production need not be increased, such as bleaching powder, sulfur, and other chemical raw materials; (2) luxury goods and those that compete with us can be increased. However, Xue Mingjian reiterated that Japan has announced a plan to trade with our country for a surplus of 500,000 U.S. dollars this year to continue its economic aggression. This point alone is enough to alert us, and if our people commit smuggling and other acts, our surplus may reach 10 million U.S. dollars, which is unimaginable. After much discussion, it was finally decided to merge the two proposals. The second measure in the original first proposal, which was to convene representatives of people's organizations and industrial and commercial experts to formulate a trade plan to strive for the initiative in trade with Japan, was considered difficult to implement and was reserved.

### Wan Can Recommends Again, Emphasizing Four Points

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The "Re-recommendation" proposed by Supervisory Committee member Wan Can and others regarding the opposition to the opening of trade with Japan has been drafted and is being submitted to the President of the Yuan for review, and it will be formally submitted soon. In addition to restating the various opinions in the original recommendation, the re-recommendation specifically emphasizes the following four points: (1) Our country has not yet restored normal relations with Japan; (2) According to the plan proposed by Japan, our deficit will exceed 50 million U.S. dollars, which is obviously unfavorable to us; (3) Our wounds have not yet recovered, and it is not appropriate to resume trade with Japan in terms of law and reason; (4) If we resume trade with Japan at this time, it will not be easy to speak at the peace conference in the future.

### The U.S. Will Host the Japanese Peace Conference Regardless of the Soviet Union's Refusal, and All Countries Except the Soviet Union Agree to the U.S. Proposal

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] Newsweek recently reported that the U.S. government will proceed with hosting the Japanese peace conference regardless of the Soviet Union's refusal to participate. The magazine also pointed out that the U.S. will make the following recommendations at the conference: The U.S. delegation will be ordered to promote a non-retaliatory peace, so that a demilitarized Japan can achieve economic survival and become a stabilizing factor in the Far East. The Japanese government will have every opportunity to express its views on the various peace treaty terms to the Allied Headquarters, which will forward them to the conference. The U.S. will propose that the treaty not include clauses for paying reparations, and the U.S. is prepared to waive its own reparations claims and will urge other countries to waive their claims as well.

[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] The U.S. State Department announced today that all eleven member countries of the Far Eastern Commission except the Soviet Union have agreed to hold a preliminary Japanese peace conference according to the guidelines proposed by the United States. Except for China and France, the United States has received formal replies from all other countries. China and France have also informally expressed their agreement, and China also advocated that the Japanese peace conference should be held in Shanghai rather than Washington or San Francisco as proposed by the United States.

### Japanese Naval Bases Will Be Developed into Trading Ports

### Luo Jialun Gives a Speech in India Titled "Freedom from Fear"

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 25th Dispatch] Our Ambassador to India, Dr. Luo Jialun, held a cocktail party at the India International Friendship Society on the evening of the 24th. Among the distinguished guests were Miss Charlie Mountbatten and members of the diplomatic corps in Delhi. Ambassador Luo gave a speech entitled "Freedom from Fear." As Mr. Luo arrived, the orchestra played our national anthem, and all the guests stood at attention. The garden where the evening was held was decorated with our national flag. In his speech, Mr. Luo mentioned the war of ideas, saying: "Whether deception has no malicious intent or may even be motivated by altruism, deception seems to be the cause of hatred, and there is no doubt that this kind of hatred will inevitably cause a strong reaction. Thought is not as good as deceiving others. I firmly believe that the freedom of the nation is closely linked, but it is by no means in the form of a Nazi concentration camp." Mr. Luo also said: "I hope that other countries will no longer provide weapons or armed assistance to the parties of neighboring countries to continue the open rebellion against their legitimate governments and to fight against their motherland, which they did not have to split from." According to Mr. Luo's opinion: "Whenever and wherever there is interference or restraint, there is no freedom." Mr. Luo also asked: "What happiness is there in life if you live in self-made fear?"

### The Fushun Massacre That Shocked the Country Fifteen Years Ago is Investigated on the Ground

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 26th] Yamashita Mitsunan, Kinuyama Yumikan, and other major criminals in the Fushun Pingdingshan case that shocked the country fifteen years ago have been arrested one after another. The Northeast Headquarters Military Tribunal recently sent personnel to investigate the atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders on the ground and will exhume the remains of the victims and collect evidence of the crimes. Pingdingshan is a small village six kilometers northeast of Fushun, where Huangri Fushun miners lived. On September 15, 1932, anti-Japanese martyr Deng Diaohang led the Volunteer Army to attack Fushun at night, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The next day, the Japanese army searched extensively and captured a volunteer soldier living in Pingdingshan. They then falsely accused the village of communicating with the Volunteer Army, falsely claimed to take pictures of the residents of the village, and coerced them to an open space outside the village, where they were strafed with machine guns. More than 2,700 innocent people, women, and children were killed.

### Editorial: How Can We Allow the Netherlands to Act Unilaterally?

Since the Netherlands used force against the Republic of Indonesia on the 21st, we are not only worried about the fate of our millions of overseas Chinese, fearing that they will be affected as innocent bystanders, but also concerned about peace in Southeast Asia. According to reports from Agence France-Presse, the Chinese district of Medan in northern Sumatra has been burned down since the Netherlands launched a large-scale offensive against Indonesia; and the Chinese district in Sambas has also been looted by the military. The news has further deepened our concern for the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese. At the same time, according to reports from the United Press, the Netherlands has refused China's offer to mediate, arguing that the Dutch-Indonesian conflict is a matter of internal affairs and does not allow other countries to intervene. If this news is true, then we cannot help but express our deep regret for the unilateral actions of the Dutch authorities in Indonesia!

First, China is not only directly affected by the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, causing our millions of overseas Chinese to suffer the misfortune of being affected as innocent bystanders, but also indirectly affected, which is enough to disrupt peace in Asia. Therefore, under any circumstances, no matter how sufficient the reasons for the Netherlands to use force against Indonesia, China cannot stand idly by. Moreover, China has no intention of siding with any party in the Indonesian issue, only hoping that both parties can adopt diplomatic negotiations to reach a peaceful resolution so that both parties can live in peace. We expressed great satisfaction when the Linggadjati Agreement was signed. Subsequently, the talks fell into a stalemate due to the unresolved issue of mixed constabulary. Our government expressed great concern and instructed Jiang Jiadong, the consul general stationed in Batavia, to exert efforts to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute to avoid another outbreak of war. However, the conflict still inevitably occurred. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs again instructed Consul General Jiang to continue to work hard on the ground, preferably to mediate and turn hostility into friendship, in order to safeguard the safety of millions of overseas Chinese and peace in Asia. This goodwill and painstaking effort has not only failed to be understood by the Dutch government, but it has even rejected our mediation. This unilateral behavior of the Netherlands will inevitably arouse the anger of the Chinese people; at the same time, our concern for Indonesia will inevitably increase. We will never stand idly by because of the Netherlands' refusal. On the contrary, we will continue to work hard. China, as the only permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in Asia, can bring the Dutch-Indonesian conflict to the United Nations on behalf of Indonesia, promoting international common intervention.

Second, the Netherlands must pay attention to international public opinion. Not only do Britain and the United States consider the Netherlands' use of force in Indonesia unwise, but all Asian countries express indignation at the Dutch army's arrival in Asia to massacre the Indonesian people. Nehru of the Indian National Congress has long publicly pointed out that the Netherlands' use of force against Indonesia is a great insult to Asia, and expressed that India will assist Indonesia in fighting to the end by all possible means. Many Australian university students also demonstrated in front of the Dutch consulate the day before yesterday, protesting the Netherlands' use of force in Indonesia. As for the Chinese people, they unanimously believe that the Netherlands' adoption of high-pressure policies or threats of force against Indonesia is a way for the Netherlands to cut itself off from India. How can the Dutch authorities turn a deaf ear to the roars of the people of various Asian countries? The British Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, also believes that the Dutch-Indonesian conflict is a great loss to the world economy, which will not only exhaust Indonesia's resources but also make future cooperation between the Netherlands and Indonesia more difficult. The Dutch authorities should pay special attention to and consider these valuable comments.

Third, although the current policy adopted by the Dutch government in Indonesia has been approved by the Dutch parliament, and the Communist Party's proposal to immediately cease war actions has been rejected by the parliament, the Dutch political situation is still in a state of flux. Not only does the Communist Party resolutely oppose the Netherlands' use of force against Indonesia, but all enlightened people believe that the Netherlands' adoption of an imperialist approach to treating colonies will inevitably lead to failure sooner or later. Standing in a third-party position, we can say impartially that the Netherlands' use of force against Indonesia may achieve smooth progress in the initial stage of the war; but future facts will certainly prove that Indonesia is like a "quagmire," trapping the Netherlands in the quagmire and making it unable to save itself.

In short, as we look around at the current international situation and look at the Dutch domestic political situation, the Netherlands' use of force against Indonesia is absolutely an unwise move. There are also many wise people in the Dutch Socialist Party. How can they lead the Netherlands on a path of suicide without realizing it? It should be known that all countries in the world, whether it is Britain, the United States, or Asian countries, will not allow the Netherlands to act unilaterally in Indonesia.

### A Major Test for the Citizens of Shanghai

People's organizations from all walks of life in Shanghai held a Great Meeting for Suppressing Communists and Building the Nation and Comforting the Troops on the 20th of this month. At the meeting, a decision was made to launch a 10,000-yuan troop-comforting campaign, and it was scheduled to start fundraising today. The preparatory committee held a meeting the day before yesterday and also decided on several specific measures that are not only practical but also take into account the hardships of the people. The total amount of donations is expected to be 10 billion yuan. This amount is not small, but as long as the fundraising is done properly and those with money donate enthusiastically, the so-called "many a little makes a mickle," it will not be difficult to achieve the goal of 10 billion yuan.

The biggest feature of this 10,000-yuan troop-comforting fundraising method is that it is completely based on the people's autonomy and willingness, and does not have any compulsory nature, let alone adopt an apportionment method. From our point of view, there are two profound meanings for the preparatory committee to adopt this method.

First, the role of comforting the troops is not about the people donating 10,000 or 100,000 yuan, but about the people truly understanding the meaning of suppressing Communists and building the nation. To be honest, the reason why China's politics and economy have been brought to this point, and the reason why the livelihood of the people across the country is so painful, is entirely due to the Communist bandits. The Communist bandits are the source of all chaos in the country. They attempt to destroy the bright future of the country and seize power in a situation where the country is in chaos and the people are living in misery. If it were not for our loyal and brave soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines, even the people in Shanghai would not be able to live a normal life like they do now. Regarding this point, the United States' fact-finding mission that came to China with General Wedemeyer saw that the root cause of China's political and economic ills was the threat of the Communist Party, which prevented the government from implementing large-scale social and economic reforms. Therefore, the only way out for China in the future is to strive to quell the rebellion like a "brave man cutting off his wrist." The people in the rear must not ignore the importance of suppressing the Communists. If the Communists are not suppressed, the nation cannot be built. Mayor Wu said in his speech at the troop-comforting meeting, "Suppressing the Communists is as important as resisting Japan." These words are most worthy of deep thought by all the people of Shanghai.

Second, Shanghai is China's only treaty port, and it is also the center of China's industry and commerce. There must be many wealthy families who, based on the principle of "those with strength contribute strength, those with money contribute money," should donate more money to make a strong expression to the soldiers who are on the front lines risking their lives to suppress the rebellion for the people. However, on the other hand, there are also many poor citizens in Shanghai who cannot get enough food or clothing. Although they also understand the current national affairs, and even their patriotism is no less than anyone else's, they are constrained by their economy and cannot contribute money to the troop-comforting campaign. We should take into account the hardships of the people and let them act naturally. We must not force them to donate money.

### Dutch Government Directly Refuses China, Britain, and the United States to Participate in Mediation; Gromyko Expresses No Intention to Interfere; Dutch Offensive Stalls, Yogyakarta Front Temporarily Stabilizes

[Our News] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: Although Indonesia has appealed to the United Nations to intervene in the Dutch-Indonesian war, no party has yet submitted this issue to the Security Council. Neither the Arab countries nor Australia have taken action. The most noteworthy is the Soviet Union's attitude. According to Gromyko, the Soviet Union has not considered submitting a complaint to the Security Council on behalf of Indonesia.

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] According to sources, the Dutch government has notified the Chinese government that it does not want a third party to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian conflict. The Dutch government has also delivered similar notes to Britain and the United States, arguing that the Indonesian conflict is a purely internal affair. The notes state that the actions in Java are "police actions," and express gratitude to the Chinese government for its concern. They also imply that this dispute is not a matter for any foreign country. The purpose of the Dutch note to the Chinese government is to reassure China's expression of concern about the Indonesian war and to instruct the Consul General in Batavia, Jiang Dong, to "do his best to mediate to prevent the situation from worsening." Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot immediately elaborate, it is believed that the note will prevent the Chinese government from making further attempts at mediation. According to qualified observers here, due to the Dutch government's direct refusal of the intervention of China, Britain, and the United States, any similar steps thereafter must be taken by the United Nations. They believe that if the United Nations intervenes in the Indonesian dispute, the Dutch government will likely take the same position, that this matter is purely an internal affair and not within the scope of the United Nations Charter.

[Reuters, Paris, 25th] The Dutch Embassy in Paris recently issued a statement, expressing gratitude for Britain's obvious intention to mediate the Indonesian conflict, but stating that it must depend on how the situation develops before deciding whether it is appropriate to appeal to friendly countries again.

[Central News Agency, New York, 25th] When interviewed by a reporter from the Central News Agency, An Du, Chairman of the American Indonesian Association, commented on the news report that the Chinese government would formally propose mediating the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, saying, "The Republic of Indonesia will welcome this move," and that before action is taken by the United Nations, any mediation method proposed by any country related to the Asian colonial issue is acceptable to the Republic of Indonesia.

[Reuters, Melbourne, 25th] Opposition leader Menzies said that the Australian government's permission for the Waterside Workers' Federation to boycott Dutch ships is tantamount to tacit support for Indonesia. Although there are those in Java who seek genuine independence, there are also those who have colluded with the Japanese. The Netherlands is Australia's ally, and in the current conflict, Australia should at least maintain a neutral attitude.

[Our News] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: According to a Dutch communique, the Dutch army is now doing whatever it pleases and is invincible. The Indonesian army along 150 miles of the northwest coast of Java has been cleared. Although the Indonesian side claims to have launched successful counterattacks in Java and Sumatra, this has been denied by the Dutch.

[United Press, Batavia, 26th] The Indonesian army's resistance has gradually increased, so the Dutch army's advance towards the Republic's capital, Yogyakarta, has gradually slowed down. The two Dutch prongs advancing towards Yogyakarta from Cirebon have also stopped advancing. In the last 24 hours, the Dutch army has only made progress in western Java. The Dutch army is currently attempting to regroup mechanized units in Cirebon and continue to advance along the coast towards Cirebon, with the aim of completely isolating western Java. The Indonesian army is currently obviously avoiding frontal warfare. Dutch communiques indicate that they are working to defend their supply lines and avoid being sabotaged by the Indonesian army. The Dutch army's progress in Sumatra has also been slow.

[United Press, Batavia, 26th] Yogyakarta Radio broadcast today that although the Dutch army announced that casualties on all sides "have not reached three digits" so far, the total number of Dutch casualties has reached 9,000.

[United Press, Batavia, 25th] According to Indonesian sources, a half-battalion of foreign volunteers has joined the Indonesian army and is preparing to go to the front to fight.

### Military Police in Hongkou Uncover an Arms Trafficking Organization - Two Masterminds Awakened from Dreams and Captured - Investigation Reveals Four Previous Sales of Military Weapons

The Garrison Headquarters Investigation Department received a secret report a few days ago, learning that there was a tightly organized arms trafficking organization in the Hongkou area.

The three points to be deleted are: (1) The No. 3 barber using his position to put his hand on the female customer's shoulder. (2) The No. 3 barber proposing to Fan Ruhua unsuccessfully and attempting to commit suicide by cutting his tie with a razor; the action of cutting the tie should be deleted.

In this film, we borrowed the kind and lovable character of the barber to perform our story. In the end, our characters resolutely abandoned their masks, using the spirit of self-reliance to satirize those parasites who are well-fed and idle, have no legitimate occupation, and only want to speculate and make money.

### Striving for Quotas for National Assembly Representatives and Legislators - National Federation of Vocational Groups - Resolves Six Measures - Cables Request for Swift Reconsideration and Correction

[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Federation of Vocational Groups held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Federation, presided over the meeting and reported that the Legislative Yuan had repeatedly and arbitrarily reduced the quotas for National Assembly representatives and legislators from vocational groups, even disregarding the decisions of the State Council. The Chamber of Commerce Federation had held multiple meetings and strongly argued against this, and had also issued a declaration of protest at a joint meeting of supervisors. It is willing to unite with all vocational groups to act together until the goal is achieved.

Maintaining the Rule of Law - Must Be Fought For

Subsequently, representatives expressed their opinions. Xu Junwu of the Nanjing Journalists Association reported on the Legislative Yuan's reduction of the quotas for legislators from vocational groups and said that the capital was sympathetic to the vocational groups' request for reconsideration. The Ministry of Social Affairs also believed that the calculations were incorrect. Wu Yun Chu, Chairman of the Industrial Association, stated the circumstances of the industrial sector's petition in Beijing. Luo Qinghua pointed out that the Legislative Yuan's violation of the State Council's decision and arbitrary reduction was an illegal act. To maintain the spirit of the rule of law, the quotas for legislators and national assembly representatives from vocational groups must be fought for.

Fair Competition - Should Not Be Biased

Lawyer Zhang Danping said: Being elected as a legislator and national assembly representative is purely a national duty and not a right. Competition is a virtue. The Legislative Yuan should not be biased. If it is said to be modeled after Europe and the United States, focusing on district elections, the low level of education of the people in our country makes it difficult to achieve democratic results and does not conform to national conditions. Xu Xueyu stated that the Shipping Federation would be in the same step with various vocational groups. Mao Xiaosen of the insurance industry proposed the slogan "No representatives, no taxes." Xu (blank) Chu, Zhu Huiqing, and others also spoke successively.

Finally, Six Measures Were Resolved

Finally, six measures were resolved: (1) Cable Chairman Chiang of the National Government and the State Council, requesting that the Legislative Yuan's illegal and arbitrary decision be swiftly reconsidered and corrected in the shortest possible time, and cable relevant agencies to unanimously support this. (2) Cable vocational groups in various provinces and cities and overseas Chinese vocational groups to act together. (3) Organize a special committee to preside over and promote the vocational participation movement. (4) For legislators who violate public opinion and obstruct the vocational participation movement, this federation should publicly rebuke them. (5) Cable the Ministry of Social Affairs to temporarily suspend vocational elections until this issue is legally resolved. (6) If necessary, this federation will notify various national vocational groups to convene a temporary joint meeting of representatives to jointly seek a practical and reasonable solution. In addition, a telegram was sent to various vocational groups across the country and various ministries and commissions of the National Government.

### If Volunteer Soldiers Cannot Be Recruited Sufficiently - Conscripting Draftees According to Law - Limited to Those Who Are 21 Years Old

The procedures for applying for deferment and exemption from military service for draftees in this city have been launched in various districts and neighborhoods. Draftees are enthusiastically going to various districts and neighborhoods to apply. The Military Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Department has also extended office hours. Yesterday, the Propaganda Committee of the Military Service Association convened its first meeting. In the afternoon, Mayor Wu also summoned Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Chen Tianqiao, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, for talks. According to Zhang's statement after attending the mayor's meeting, "This city's conscription will first recruit 3,000 volunteer soldiers. It is estimated that this time, the number of volunteer soldiers can be recruited sufficiently. If 3,000 cannot be recruited, draftees will be conscripted according to law, limited to those who are 21 years old (born in 1927)." Zhang also said, "Many citizens in this city are still unclear about the laws on deferment, call-up, and exemption from military service, so there is anxiety. I would like to specifically state a few important points regarding deferment, call-up, and exemption from military service."

### Summary Explanation

As follows: (1) Those who are studying in high school and have not graduated can apply for deferment according to law. Those who have graduated from high school and the reason for deferment no longer exists cannot apply, but those who are admitted to university and obtain a certificate of study can apply for deferment at any time (not subject to time restrictions). (2) Current employees engaged in national defense technology who have obtained a technical employee registration certificate from the Labor Bureau of the Ministry of Social Affairs can apply for deferred call-up, but those who have not registered must first have their affiliated agency or factory prepare a register and provide proof before processing the application. (3) Those who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their family and have no siblings, or whose father is over 58 years old, will be deferred from call-up, but those who have siblings who are under 18 years old can also be deferred from call-up. However, the neighborhood and district chiefs will use the original household registration booklet as a basis for proof. If the draftee himself is serving in Shanghai, he must have proof from the neighborhood chief of his original county (city), township, or town. Before this proof is obtained, the service agency, factory, or store will provide proof temporarily, pending the arrival of the proof from the original residence, and then the formalities will be processed. (4) Those with physical deformities, disabilities, or chronic illnesses will be exempted from military service with proof from the neighborhood chief. (5) The application period was originally scheduled to end on the 29th of this month, but fearing that some draftees may be away in other places and unable to arrive to complete the application procedures before the 29th, they will also be allowed to complete the application procedures before August 5th during the review of deferment, call-up, and exemption from military service applications at the neighborhood office. The neighborhood chief shall not refuse. Zhang also said that the amendment to the regulations on punishing those who evade military service and those who obstruct military service by military service personnel or other personnel

### Neighborhood Chiefs Engage in Corruption - Citizens Can Secretly Report

The first conscription work in this city will begin in early August. On the eve of this conscription, it is reported that some unscrupulous neighborhood chiefs are using their authority to engage in corruption. The authorities in charge of military service were extremely angry after hearing about this. Yesterday, they specifically stated to reporters: If citizens learn of any corrupt practices, they can secretly report them to the Shanghai Garrison District and the Municipal Garrison District, and the Municipal Government. Once verified, they will be severely punished. According to the Shanghai Garrison District, the age for volunteer conscription was originally set from 21 to 25 years old, but now, in order to encourage enlistment, it has been relaxed to 30 years old.

### Punishment Regulations

There are detailed and explicit provisions in each article. I hope citizens will pay attention to them. As for the punishment of personnel handling military service, there are also detailed provisions in the regulations, such as those who deliberately release or conceal draftees, evade military service, and make false certifications for exemption from service, prohibition from service, removal from service, deferment from conscription, and deferment from call-up, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years but not more than five years. Those who obtain property from conscripts or their relatives by fraudulent means, demand, promise, or accept bribes for official actions, or obtain improper benefits shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years but not more than ten years and have all their bribes confiscated. Those who force men who should not be conscripted to serve in the military or commit acts of humiliation against men who have been conscripted into active service shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years but not more than seven years. If such acts result in death, the perpetrator shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment; if such acts result in serious injury, the perpetrator shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for not less than ten years. Therefore, as long as citizens in this city understand the laws and follow the legal procedures, there is no need for anxiety.

### Enriching the Spiritual Food of Armed Comrades - Discussing Promotion of Cultural Services to the Military - Nine Measures Resolved to Collect Books and Pictorials

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party and the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee, considering that the front-line combat troops are extremely lacking in spiritual food, decided to hold a tea party yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. at the New Life Club to discuss the promotion of the cultural services to the military movement. Dozens of celebrities from the cultural, publishing, film, theater, and broadcasting industries were invited, as well as Shi Yongling, a specialist from the News Department of the Xinjiang Garrison Headquarters who recently came to Shanghai, and Yu Jizhong, Director of the Political Department of the Northeast Headquarters, who reported on the actual situation in the Northeast and Northwest regions, respectively.

Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Committee presided over the meeting and stated in his speech: The suffering of the material life of the front-line combat troops is self-evident, and even worse is the panic of spiritual food. Due to transportation difficulties, soldiers regard seeing pictorials and magazines as if they had obtained a treasure. Shanghai is the central area of culture, with numerous writers, and should take on the responsibility of providing assistance so that their inhuman lives can receive spiritual comfort.

Subsequently, Specialist Shi and Director Yu gave speeches separately. In addition to reporting on the local situation, they unanimously believed that the destructive power of the external cultural invasion forces in the border areas was more violent than the atomic bomb. Therefore, the significance of the cultural services to the military movement is extremely important. Shanghai is the cultural center, and it is firmly believed that the cultural services to the military movement will have satisfactory results.

Afterwards, Pan Gongzhan, who is also the Director of the Cultural Committee, stated in his speech: All citizens of Shanghai should appreciate the hardships of the soldiers fighting to the death with the communists on the front lines. "Spirit is more important than material," was what the leader used to encourage the people from beginning to end during the War of Resistance. He firmly believed that the effect of 100,000 books would be better than a 10,000 yuan military comfort movement. He hoped that people in the cultural field would rise up together, show their strength, and prove with facts that Shanghai is not a dead city!

Later, Tao Baichuan, Liu Shi, Ji (blank), Xie Renzhao, and others spoke successively. The following cultural services to the military measures were resolved: (1) Collect existing cultural works. (2) Collection scope: A. Magazines, B. Pictorials, C. Books, D. Novels, E. Newspapers. (3) Collection standards: A. Rich in national consciousness and patriotic thought, B. Enhancing interest in life, C. Rich in humor, D. Simple and easy to understand, E. Each book should not exceed 100 pages. (4) Collection period: A. Long-term, B. One-time collection. (5) Collection procedures: A. General books and publications should be sent directly to the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee (address: No. 128 Seymour Road), B. Sent directly to the designated location. (6) Please ask all Shanghai broadcasting companies to increase military comfort programs, such as lectures, songs, and stories, to show military comfort. (7) Please ask Shanghai calligraphers and painters to jointly hold a military comfort charity exhibition and donate calligraphy and paintings to comfort the military. (8) Please ask theater and film directors and screenwriters to write and perform more stories related to the national spirit to inspire morale. (9) The Shanghai press should organize a military comfort visiting group to visit the Northeast, recording the touching stories of the soldiers.

### District Chief Bao Strongly Denies Being Falsely Accused - Willing to Accept the Death Penalty If Extortion Is Found - Councilors Testify - Did Invite Guests Indeed

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Xu Jia Hui District Chief Bao Dachuan being accused of extortion and corruption was heard in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday. Bao stated in court, "The demolition of the plaintiff's house was ordered by the Municipal Government. There was no extortion. If the court finds anything, I will accept the death penalty." The plaintiff, Zhou Yinchun, said, "The house was built in 1938, and raised by four feet this year. I have been contracting air force projects in the big field. When the district chief came to notify me of the demolition, I was not at home. Later, my wife, Cheng Xiaobao, told me. The police station came with the district chief to demolish the house and said that if I paid 10 million, the district chief could help. So, on April 19, I went to Councilor Xie Qingbai to ask him to intercede with the district chief. On the 27th, Xie invited Bao to the Jieerjing restaurant, and Bao agreed to help, but he did not talk about money." Subsequently, Cheng Xiaobao was questioned and claimed that "The district chief came before 9 pm on April 16 and told me about the demolition of the house. My husband was not at home at the time. I asked him to help, and he said it would cost 10 million. Qiao Zhihe, an accountant who had recently fled from northern Jiangsu, was present." Eighth District Councilor Xie Qingbai also rushed to the court to testify, saying that Zhou had asked him to ask Bao for help and that he did invite guests on the 22nd. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer argued, pointing out that Councilor Xie had publicly called Zhou a rascal at the previous district people's congress, claiming that the request for 10 million was false, and that there were records. The plaintiff claimed that Qiao Zhihe had recently fled from northern Jiangsu, but Qiao had been in Shanghai since 1940, with a household registration booklet as proof. Wu Shaoshu's private letter was also presented, stating that Wu was willing to come to court to testify. The court ordered the case to be adjourned for further investigation and the defendant was released on the original bail.

Judge Cao questioned them in detail. According to Chen, "I have worked at Xinhua for nearly ten years. The sparks from the welding on the day of the fire would definitely not have caused a fire." Yin Baozi's testimony was roughly the same as Chen's. The coppersmith Zhu Fusheng stated, "There was chaff and asphalt in the interlayer between the third and second floors, but before welding, the gaps were sealed with waterproof cement. After welding, the pipe became hot, and cold water was poured on the pipe with a lead tube. After welding, I also asked Yang Shisheng, an employee of the Telecommunications Bureau, to inspect it. Although the defendant was not at the scene when the fire broke out, according to the people watching the alley, thick smoke first came out of the Naxun Road window of the warehouse, which was a long distance away from the welded pipe, and there was also a wall in between. Please investigate further." Zhang Jingen's testimony was similar to Zhu's. Then the witness Hou Xianting, who discovered the fire, was called. According to him, he returned home on the 8th at night, passed by Naxun Road, and found thick smoke coming out of the Maocheng warehouse window and heard an explosion. Next, Jiang Fuxiang, Cheng Jiajian, and Xu Xuebin, employees of the Telecommunications Bureau, were called. Jiang and Cheng both speculated that the fire must have been caused by debris in the interlayer. Xu, who was a resident employee of the Telecommunications Bureau, stated that the defendant did not pour water on the pipe with a lead tube after welding. At the end of the hearing, it was decided that the debate would be held at 10:00 AM on the 30th. The defendant remained on bail.

### President of Jiaotong University, Wu Baofeng, Left Shanghai Yesterday

### Hu Shi Summoned Ma Dayou Yesterday to Discuss Accepting Beiyang University

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] After the Ministry of Education ordered Peking University to take over Beiyang University in Beiping, Hu Shi summoned Ma Dayou, the person in charge of the College of Engineering, in the morning to talk about technical issues. Ma said: After Peking University added a College of Engineering last year, only the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering were established first due to limited equipment, with a total of more than 70 students. This year, the departments of Civil Engineering and Chemical Engineering will be added, accommodating more than 200 students. The reason for not planning to take over Beiyang University in Beiping was because of the different academic systems. The College of Engineering of Peking University is a five-year system, with the first two years for basic education, and the next three years for undergraduate studies. Beiyang University in Beiping is a four-year system. Now that it has been decided to take over, it will maintain its original system. The original students of Peking University will move to the department to attend classes. The equipment is sufficient for use, and professors will be selected for employment based on their merits. It is also learned that the majority of the faculty, staff, and workers of Beiyang University in Beiping have held meetings to oppose it due to concerns about employment issues, and the alumni association of the College of Engineering of Beiping University also opposes it.

### Relief for Northwest Textbook Shortage, Textbooks Also Shipped

[Xi'an News] The textbooks in the northwestern provinces were previously uniformly supplied by the Seventh Joint Office, with each family coordinating the supply and adjusting the surplus to make up for the shortage. This summer, the Ministry of Education changed the method of printing and supplying national textbooks, ordering the education departments of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces to find their own ways to be printed by local printing houses. After many discussions, the cost was much higher than the price limited by the Ministry of Education, making it impossible to compete with the bookstores, so no one was willing to undertake it. Therefore, they turned to consult the publishing industry to find ways to transport and sell them. However, the small bookstores in the "Shanghai Publishing Forecast" were not trustworthy, and the schools did not dare to trust them. Occasionally, those who sent money to order books did not receive any response at the deadline. As for the Commerce, Zhonghua, and Zhengzhong families of the Seventh Joint Office, they no longer have the obligation to supply national textbooks without fail at this time, and they are unwilling to waste huge transportation costs and interest and risk sacrifice. After repeated consideration, they cabled and obtained approval from the Shanghai General Administration Office to allocate a certain amount from the libraries of the Chongqing and Chengdu printing offices and ship them as soon as possible, which may be able to meet some of the needs, but it is still far from the original required amount.

### Chaoyang College's Finances are Extremely Tight, President Shi Hosted a Report for Tianjin Reporters Yesterday

[Tianjin, 26th] Shi Zhiquan, President of Chaoyang College in Beiping, came to Tianjin a few days ago to raise funds for the college. He hosted a report for reporters from various newspapers in Tianjin on the 26th. According to the report, the college was founded in the first year of the Republic of China by Wang Youling, formerly known as Chaoyang University. Later, due to non-compliance with the establishment, it was changed to a college in the 19th year, with three departments of Law, Politics, and Economics. More than 6,000 students have graduated, and there are currently more than 1,000 students. Before the 77th Incident, the college received a government subsidy of 10,000 yuan per month.

The degree of financial difficulty is unprecedented since the establishment of the college. The salaries of faculty and staff in the college are less than half of those in other universities. Taking the president as an example, after兼主任, he only gets 600,000 yuan per month so far. Shi hopes that all sectors will provide more assistance.

### The Qunsheng Team Sends Good News from Hong Kong: Overwhelming Victory in the First Match Against South China

[Report from This Newspaper, Hong Kong Airmail] The Philippine Qunsheng Basketball Team finished their tour of Singapore and took the opportunity to play two exhibition matches in Hong Kong. They played South China on the 23rd and Hong Kong United on the 24th?

On the 23rd, the weather was sunny and rainy. Although the game was held at 6:00 PM, it could not be completed due to the rain, and the fans were not satisfied. Although South China is the Hong Kong champion, their skills are not yet fully developed, and they are all rising stars. It feels like Liao Hua is the vanguard, as there are no great generals in Shu. The match was simply a performance by Qunsheng. For a considerable amount of time, even the South China players were watching the other team practice "passing." There was no real competition.

At the start of the match, Qunsheng sent Li Shiqiao, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, Chen Jinde, and Yang Renhui to play, while South China sent Zhan Shejiang, Li Zhuowen, Che Xuan, Li Jingcheng, and Shi Zhenda to fight. In the first quarter, Qunsheng took a small victory with a score of 17 to 13. In the second quarter, South China could not cope. Qunsheng quickly scored points. Before the end of the first half, the score was already 35 to 16, with the visiting team leading by more than half. By the third quarter, the visiting team's good players were substituted off.

### President Zhang of the National Bank Returns to Shanghai from Nanjing: Talks Freely on Financial and Economic Issues

Reform of the Monetary System Cannot Be Achieved in the Short Term; Trade with Japan Will Never Relax Control Procedures

[Report from This Newspaper] Zhang Jiaxuan, President of the Central Bank, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. He was designated by the government as one of the five representatives to liaise with Mr. Weidemei, the US special envoy. He told reporters that Mr. Wei's mission is to collect various military, political, and economic data of China. Our government is actively collecting relevant data, such as finance and economics, for Mr. Wei to report to President Truman upon his return to the United States. The staff of the National Bank is responsible for compiling financial sector materials. (1) Regarding the monetary system issue, the government is constantly conducting meticulous research. However, the word "reform" must be fully prepared, and it cannot be rushed in the short term. (2) The US loan to China is still under negotiation. (3) The issue of opening trade with Japan is of great importance and is still under study. He occasionally believes that the relationship is not very important, because our country's foreign trade is currently adopting a control policy. The import of goods from any country must be approved in advance. Items that our country does not need are not allowed to be imported. Future trade with Japan should also be like this. However, industrial raw materials are extremely scarce, and their products are difficult to compete in foreign markets. What items do we need, and what items do we not need, should be studied in detail, so as not to be completely laissez-faire. (4) During this trip to Nanjing, an agreement has been reached with the Ministry of Agriculture. For North China, it is planned to provide a steady supply of 100,000 tons, exchanging huge amounts of flour from Shanghai for coal from the north. The first batch of 300,000 bags of flour has now begun to be shipped to the north. (5) The problem of smuggling in South China has recently improved slightly. The Hong Kong authorities are gradually cooperating with us, and the phenomenon is good. The personnel of the South China Import and Export Management Committee have all been determined and will be established soon to actively carry out work. (6) The third term quota will be announced next month. The number will not be much different from the previous term. The allocation amount is awaiting approval from the National Economic Committee.

### The Situation of Strength Turning to Weakness Is Vague; The Rise of Chinese Stocks Is Obstructed; Yonggonghui Reaches the Limit Repeatedly

Yongsha repeatedly tried to move forward, but the ticket help had a lot of deposits and the young and strong faction of the northern gang, etc., repeatedly sold hard when they were high, and the countertop was doubled and loosened, and the upward momentum was finally obstructed.

Li Fuxun, Xu Jilu, Xu Weiming, and Wang Yansong served as the presidium. Chairman Li Fuxun first reported: "Since I took over, it has been one year and two months. Important matters include: (1) Since taking over the Clearing House, the number of exchanges has increased month by month. The daily average amount of exchanged instruments in June of this year was over 11,694 billion yuan, with over 126,700 instruments, averaging over 9.22 million yuan per instrument, which is sufficient to indicate the gradual expansion of the scope of exchange.

If any bank has difficulty in paying the full amount at once due to capital turnover, it can be paid in two installments, limited to the end of September to the end of November. As for US dollar bonds, each bank should also work hard to solicit and sell them. When encountering a tight position, the National Bank should be allowed to use them as collateral for financing at 70% of the face value. (2) The association's funding: The monthly fee portion is changed from 3,000 yuan per unit to 5,000 yuan, and the temporary fee is changed to a temporary subsidy. (3) Regarding the application for registration and licensing of the same industry, the association will submit it to the competent authority for prompt handling. (4) In accordance with the resolution of the National Banking Federation, the collection of various donations is prohibited.

### Communists Loot Beipiao

— Special Correspondent Jing Feng

Jinzhou, 21st (Air Dispatch)

Coking Expert Murdered

In June, the flames of war in the Northeast blazed red across half the sky. Trains between Shenyang and Changchun were impassable, replaced by mule-drawn carts. The eye of the Northeast, Xiaofengman, was unable to release electricity, and the inability to discharge water created a situation of collapse. Xi'an, Benxi, and Beipiao mining areas shut down, and the industries of various cities were directly or indirectly suspended.

The fifth offensive by the Northeast Communist Army created a suffocating situation in the Northeast. In the aftermath of this offensive, a tragic incident occurred: the murder of Mr. Yu Zailin, a coking expert from Beipiao. His body was exposed for four days. After the battle, all that remained of Yu Zailin was a blurred head and thirteen incomplete bones from his lower body.

Beipiao in western Liaoning is a well-known low-quality coal mining area. A large power plant there is even more important to the industrial and mining enterprises of Fuxin, Jinzhou, and Jinxi.

Beipiao's coal is one of the best coking coals in the country. Proven reserves are over 200 million tons. From the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic, and even earlier, the coal was extracted sporadically. In 1921, a joint government-business company was established for formal development. Before the September 18th Incident, the daily maximum coal output of the mine had reached about 2,500 tons. After the September 18th Incident, during the fourteen years of Japanese operation until August 15, 1945, the highest daily output was over 4,000 tons.

After the Japanese surrender, the mine equipment was first transported away by the Soviet army and then destroyed by the Communist army. In early January 1946, the National Army entered Beipiao. In the middle of the same month, the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent personnel to take over. At that time, there were more than a thousand Chinese and Japanese employees and about eight thousand workers. Since most of the mine's machinery and equipment had been transported away, and the buildings and power equipment had been extensively damaged, the daily output after resumption of work was reduced to a hundred tons.

In October of the same year, the mine was taken over by the Resources Committee, which established Beipiao Coal Mine Co., Ltd. Through the efforts of employees, repairing machinery, supplementing equipment, and procuring materials, by June of this year, significant progress had been made. The daily coal output had reached 1,500 tons. The planned annual output of 400,000 tons could have been achieved ahead of schedule, but unfortunately, this drastic change occurred again!

In the past, the mine had been occupied, destroyed, and relocated by the Communist army four or five times. The losses in the Guanshan, Sanbao, and Nanpiao mines were significant. There was almost daily intelligence of Communist army intrusions near the mining area. Relying on employees to stand their posts and work hard, they overcame many difficulties.

This time, it was at 4:00 AM on June 26th. The mine was attacked by a large force of the Communist army. The ferocity broke all previous invasion records. At the same time, the Jinlingsi Railway Bridge, the transportation hub between the mining area and the outside world, was first controlled by the Communist army, and the mine employees had no way to advance or retreat. General Manager Lei Baohua requested reinforcements from Jinzhou. At this time, the responsible persons in the factory, including Ding Yaozhong, the director of the employee affairs department, Zhang Qingchun, the director of the general affairs department, and Yu Zailin, the director of the engineering department, personally led the mine police and soldiers to resist desperately, waiting for reinforcements.

On the 29th, a part of the National Army stationed in the mine was disarmed by the Communist army. Before noon on July 1st, the last part of the National Army was also disarmed. The mine police of more than seven hundred people died in large numbers due to the exhaustion of ammunition. On July 1st, they and all the mine employees were captured at the same time. Yu Zailin, the director of the engineering department, was killed at that time. More than fifty other senior and middle-level employees, including Ding Yaozhong and Zhang Qingchun, were captured.

The entire mine fell into enemy hands at 2:00 PM on July 1st. During their eight days in Beipiao, the Communist army transported away all the movable working machines, tools, and mining materials and equipment, such as coal cars, ball bearings, safety lamps, explosives, detonators, electricity, motors, steel plates, and steel bars. Because the reinforcements were coming, knowing that they could not stay, they retreated on the afternoon of the 8th, taking the captured personnel with them.

The National Army rescuing the mining area was delayed in the middle of the journey and was only able to enter Beipiao on July 9th.

Today, the mining area has been recovered. Fortunately, the major equipment such as the power plant has not been destroyed, but all the personnel, equipment, and self-defense forces have been lost. The employees have lost their sense of security, and the engineering leaders have been captured. They are all extremely discouraged and unwilling to risk going again.

Now, the mine is requesting urgent disaster relief, appeasing the displaced employees, sending the families of the captured personnel, and forming a temporary agency to maintain everything in the mining area, transporting grain and funds to stabilize the workers. As for how to resume work, because of the many difficulties, it will have to be two months later!

### Taiwan Flood

— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

Taipei, 20th (Air Dispatch)

Taiwan almost never has a year without disasters: typhoons, floods, these natural disasters hinder the progress of construction, destroy existing construction, and deepen the suffering of the general public of farmers. The government, while constructing, has to prepare repair costs equal to the construction costs, or else it can only seek permanent construction. However, the Japanese were unable to do this in the past, and the authorities after the takeover are even more unable to bear the double construction costs.

From late May to early June of this year, the entire island was immersed in thunderstorms for a whole month, which was even worse than the yellow fog season in the interior. Because of the thunderstorms, the streams surged, and the embankments collapsed, resulting in the submergence of fields, the loss and destruction of livestock and houses, and the death and injury of villagers. In addition, mountain torrents erupted, and landslides and ground fissures directly destroyed roads and bridges and blocked transportation. According to statistics, the rainfall in these twenty-two days from May 24th to June 16th was 1,265.8 mm, exceeding the rainfall in the same period in 1946. Taking Taichung County as an example, the continuous rainfall for twelve days in June was 774.3 mm, which has not been seen in decades.

The most serious situation in this flood was in Taichung County. The revised loss figures of the county are: (1) 61 sections of embankments collapsed; (2) 50,000 mu of land was buried and lost; (3) 21 people died and 91 were injured; (4) 680 heads of livestock such as cattle, sheep, and pigs died; (5) 1,826 households were affected; (6) Property, rice, sweet potatoes, and transportation losses: The total value is 5,855,200,000 yuan.

An elderly senator, at a symposium convened by Chairman Wei, loudly exclaimed: "You can't see the disaster in the city, but when you see it in the disaster area, the devastation is unbearable." When reporters followed Chairman Wei to inspect the breach of the Wu River, the guide said, "This is just one breach, there are many breaches that need to be repaired urgently, and the farmers are begging for relief and repairs."

According to a survey by the Water Conservancy Group of the Public Works Bureau, there are problems with 111 embankments throughout the province, including Taichung, Hsinchu, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Dongtainan Bay. The total length of the washout is 9,656m, and the length of the gaps also reaches 7,589m. Most of them are embankment feet, embankment slopes, washouts, collapses, and gaps.

Disasters are sufficient to test the strength of the people and the concern of the government. The people of Taiwan have reached a climax in this performance. After the Taichung flood, the County Council and the government established a Flood Emergency Relief Committee, first borrowing money from banks in the county to repair the embankments to prevent the streams from rising again and expanding the gaps. At the same time, they promptly handled damage surveys and relief work. Under the financial constraints, the relief funds required 13 million yuan. In addition to provincial and county subsidies, they also launched donations in various townships, distributed clothes and food allowances to the victims, and provided death compensations. The emotions were as tense as putting out a fire. In the repair of the embankments, the engineering personnel of the Public Works Bureau and the Civil Engineering Section of the County Government provided technical cooperation and issued subsidies. For the gap parts, bamboo baskets in the shape of bamboo shoots were used to build dams and temporary embankments. For the washout parts, bamboo snakes were used for emergency repairs. Among them, the Wufeng gap was repaired by mobilizing 500 workers every day, and it was completed in a few days.

Highways and railways were directly damaged. However, due to emergency repairs, there were no long delays in traffic. In Taiwan, you can see the scene of emergency completion of processing and manufacturing. Engineering technicians are at their best trial at this time.

Without water conservancy, there would be no Taiwan. Taiwan was constructed into an island with abundant sugarcane, rice, and fruits through the artificial construction of water conservancy by the Japanese. No mechanical scientific power can change the topography of the island. The Central Mountain Range, this watershed, pours into the sea like a waterfall when it rains. It is short, turbulent, and dangerous. In the past, there were plans to prevent floods and afforestation to prevent rain, but now they have not been moved at all. It seems that it is becoming more and more difficult to prevent natural disasters with human power!

The flood is still the first page of this year's disaster. The typhoon that can sweep across the Pacific at any time is stretching out its ruined hand and will attack seabirds without warning, even if it breaks through the meteorological forecast network!

### Yu Zailin's Martyrdom Before and After

Yu Zailin, a coking expert, whose courtesy name is Zuiling, was 39 years old this year. He was from Diangang Village, Dongxiang Township, Sheng County, Zhejiang. In July 1932, he graduated from Tianjin National Beiyang Institute of Technology. He served as an intern at the Kailuan Mining Bureau, a technician at the Construction Committee, an assistant researcher at the National Defense Design Committee and the Qiyuan Committee Mining Office, and a technician at the Ministry of Economic Affairs Mining and Metallurgy Research Institute. In November 1942, he was sent to the United States for investigation. In April 1945, he returned to China and served as the director of the Washing and Coking Plant of Tianfu Mining Company. After the victory, he was transferred to the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Northeast as a takeover commissioner and was successively sent to work at the Changchun and Fushun Mining Bureaus. In December 1946, he was transferred to the Beipiao Coal Mine Company as the director of the Engineering Department. He had served in the mining and metallurgy industry for 15 years and was particularly respected for his experience. He was one of the few smelting experts in China and had written many works. His parents died early, leaving behind his wife and three sons and two daughters, who are now all in their hometown of Sheng County, Zhejiang. His family has no permanent property, and his death was bleak. Yu was brutally murdered at 2:00 PM on July 1, when the Beipiao Coal Mine fell. His body was exposed until July 9, when the mine was recovered. Because it had been pecked at by birds and animals, only the head and twelve sections of bones remained, making it almost impossible to identify. The situation was extremely tragic. His remains have now been transported to Jinzhou for re-burial, and a memorial service is scheduled for August 1. (Sent by Jing Feng from Jinzhou)

### A Complete Picture of Guangxi Agriculture: From Barren Land to Oasis

— Our Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong

Wuzhou, 20th (Airmail)

A desolate desert may not bloom with beautiful flowers or bear abundant fruit, but the laborers who cultivate barren land often inspire a sense of utmost respect. Guangxi, located on the southern border, has been dauntingly barren since the Qin dynasty expanded its territory. Over thousands of years, people migrating to the Guiling mountains have opened up avenues of production with their own hands. To this day, barren lands have transformed from infertility to oases.

In Guangxi agriculture, only the southeastern river areas can be considered to have some produce. In the northwest corner, mountains stretch endlessly, and smoke from cooking fires extends for miles. Besides relying on mountains for fields and struggling to plant corn and sweet potatoes for a year's sustenance, there is practically nothing. Therefore, people's lives are especially difficult. The number of people who do not see a single grain of rice all year round, and only fill their stomachs with miscellaneous grains, accounts for more than 15%. When famine strikes, mountain floods erupt, and crops in the valleys are swept away. When drought comes, mountain water sources dry up easily. Therefore, during disasters, compatriots in the northwest corner of Guangxi die particularly quickly and tragically. It is truly lamentable to speak of!

Rice, Beans, and Millet: Alleviating Guangdong and Hong Kong's Needs

Although agricultural products in the southeast are not abundant or precious, the yearly income from hard work is considerable. If production methods can be rapidly improved and natural and man-made disasters reduced, the future is promising. The products include rice, beans, millet, potatoes, peanuts, etc. If there are no poor harvests, there is a considerable surplus, which is then used to alleviate the needs of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and other places. In the past two years, there was a great famine in Hunan and Guangdong. If it were not for the rice from Guangxi, the consequences would have been even more severe. Having to share their own scarce food with others, the hardships of the people can be imagined. In the river basin area, 65% is paddy fields. In the southeastern half, from Nanning to Wuzhou, there are generally two harvests a year (once in July and once in October), yielding about 14 million dan, which is supplied to the whole province and as far as Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong. This year, severe floods have caused a loss of no less than 20,000 mu. Farmers in towns like Zhenbian have even been forced to commit suicide as entire families. Putting a grain of rice in their mouths is filled with indescribable bitterness!

Five Kinds of Plants: Relied Upon by Millions

Besides rice and miscellaneous grains, because most of Guangxi province is hilly terrain and has a subtropical climate, many farmers also rely on other crops for a living. Cotton, hemp, tobacco, sugarcane, and tung oil have all had considerable production in recent years. The number of people who depend on these five plants for food exceeds four million.

Cotton-Producing Areas: 4 Million Mu

Cotton production only became noticed after 1936. The southwest area of Guangxi is a cotton-growing area, so the yield is far less than that of Shaanxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. However, the cotton-growing area has rapidly increased to more than 4 million mu in ten years, with an annual output of more than 1.12 million dan. The production areas are distributed in the upper reaches of the Pearl River. Every year, the products are processed into cotton yarn and then transported and sold to the interior, as far as Yunnan and Guizhou, becoming the largest source of family handicrafts. The beauty and durability of Guilin homespun fabric is something that those who stayed in the rear during the War of Resistance probably have a deep impression of. Secondly, in areas such as Pingle, Hexian, and Yulin in eastern Guangxi, the textile industry is also very developed. Some women even dedicate their entire lives to weaving and do not marry, also making a living. Recently, in order to develop the province's light industry, the construction authorities have started with the textile industry, investing heavily in setting up textile production cooperatives in Wanglin and other places, to provide standards.

Ramie Production: Less Than Cotton

As for ramie production, it is far less developed than cotton. Only in northern and western Guangxi, there are about 455,000 mu of hemp fields, which can produce about 600,000 dan per year. The market for ramie is concentrated in Pingle and other places in eastern Guangxi, and most of it is exported to other provinces, because the quality still needs to be improved, so sales are very low.

Growing Tobacco Makes a Fortune: 200,000 per Dan

In Guangxi, people who grew tobacco this year have made a fortune. A dan of tobacco leaves can fetch a price of more than 200,000 yuan, and merchants are still afraid of not getting enough. It is estimated that the total tobacco sales in the province can generate 100 billion yuan in revenue. As foreign exchange rates are high and the sales of foreign cigarettes are declining, Guiyang, Guangzhou, and other places have set up factories to manufacture their own cigarettes. The cigarette factories in Guangxi that had closed down in the past have also made a comeback, competing with foreign cigarettes. Taking advantage of local materials, the value of tobacco has increased tenfold, and this year's harvest has also been bountiful, so the only ones who can smile are the tobacco farmers. The tobacco-producing areas are mostly in northern Guangxi, about 300,000 mu.

The Opium Problem: Not Quite Dead

Thinking about many issues from a single word like "tobacco" often increases a sense of mystery. Besides tobacco, opium seems to be in a state of rebirth and not dead in the mountains of northwestern Guangxi. Although the law puts the word "death" on people's heads, many people feel that the word "money" is more interesting than "death." This spring, various places started to eradicate opium, and Tianhe County eradicated 100,000 plants in one go. Almost none of the county heads sent to the border between Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou did not lose their positions because of opium. In Xilong and Xilin counties, poppies were planted on the roadside, ignoring the authorities. The cooked opium paste is sold for 150,000 yuan per liang in western Guangxi, and the further east along the river, the more profitable it becomes. Therefore, Baise, a small city in western Guangxi, has appropriately become a paradise for adventurers. If poppies are also included in agricultural products, one cannot help but think of Xikang half a year ago....

Sugar Industry: A Model Example

In Guangxi, the only industrial product that is relatively well-known is the sugar industry, which can be regarded as a model. From Nanning through Guixian to Dakoujiang of Guiping, it can be called a sweet city. The sugarcane fields stretching across this area reach 223,333 mu, with an annual output of 6.7 million zu of cane sugar. Among them, Guixian is a special case. In 1936, the provincial government established the largest sugar factory in the country here, hiring foreign technicians to engage in mass production. Although it was bombed by enemy aircraft during the war, it has established the foundation of the Guangxi sugar industry. Now the province is working hard to restore it, and the future is promising. At present, there are small sugar factories everywhere in Guixian, selling no less than 3 million dan to northern Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangdong every year, which is the most promising path in Guangxi's small industry. Unfortunately, this year's floods and subsequent insects have caused incalculable damage to sugarcane fields, which is a major catastrophe for the sugar industry.

Tung Oil Production and Sales: Gradually Heading Upward

Tung oil production and sales were also quite reputable in Guangxi before the war. The planting area was nearly 253,000 mu, with an annual output of 311,800 dan. Exports to Hong Kong and Guangdong reached 220,000 dan, accounting for more than 70% of the output. After the war, exports were cut off, followed by the destruction of the war, so it almost fell into decline. However, because tung oil is an essential raw material for industry, the trend of smuggling to help the enemy during the war was rampant, becoming a major disaster. After the war, based on the needs of the international market, the tung oil industry has revived. Although it has not been able to increase production for a while, the authorities have been actively paying attention to promoting widespread planting. 70% of the province's land is suitable for planting tung trees, especially in northwestern Guangxi, where the mountains are bare and the fields are barren for miles. Even the official wasteland is as much as 400,000 mu. If it can be vigorously developed, with ten years of tree planting, when the green plains are lush, what are we afraid of: perpetual disasters and drought? The most terrible thing is to shed tears for the starving on the one hand, and not to think about the reasons why the starving are starving on the other hand. Considering the national economy and people's livelihood, we really must make timely efforts.

Fennel and Cinnamon: Sold Widely at Home and Abroad

In addition, specialties such as fennel and cinnamon in Longzhou, southern Guangxi, have fennel for medicine and oil extraction, mixed with star anise oil, with an annual output of more than 18,000 dan, which is a treasure of Chinese medicine. The latter also produces 40,000 dan of cinnamon twigs and 700 dan of cinnamon oil every year, which are sold at home and abroad. If it can be improved in detail, there are also unlimited benefits.

Tropical Fruits: Mass Production

Next in line, tropical fruits can also be said to have everything. In Beiliu, Rongxian, and other places, the orchards are as wide as dozens of miles. Lychees, longans, bananas, watermelons... are all produced in large quantities. Rongxian Shatianyous are even famous throughout the country, more than Fuzhou pomelos. If it were not for the years of disasters, Guangxi should not be so terribly bitter. However, in fact, today's Guangxi is deeply mired in the abyss of starvation. One year of war and two years of drought have caused the rural economy to collapse like a mountain. A grain of rice contains a tear, and they have to endure many nameless sufferings. Who knows when there will be a good harvest?

### The Abundance Celebration Ship Struck a Reef and Was Destroyed by Fire in the Waters of Dapeng Bay

— Our Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng

Wind Signal No. 1: Could Not Avert Disaster - Alert Captain: Foreign Warships Rescued

Hong Kong, 23rd (Airmail)

Property: All Gone

Lives: Fortunately Safe

Since the "Xi'an" ship, which sailed the Hong Kong-Guangdong line this spring, caught fire in Hong Kong and burned more than 100 passengers to death, sea passengers have been deeply wary. Unexpectedly, on the 19th of this month, the "Fengqing" giant ship with a displacement of 6,167 tons struck a reef and had an accident in the middle of the night on the way from Hong Kong to Shantou. The ship was sailing on the Singapore-Hong Kong-Shantou-Xiamen route. This time, it carried nearly 2,000 returning overseas Chinese from Singapore. When the tragedy occurred, there was a hurricane raging. For a time, the sound of the wind and rain was mixed with the cries for help from women and children. Fortunately, British and American warships rushed to the rescue, and the passengers were all rescued. However, public and private property was completely lost, including the hard-earned blood and sweat of many overseas Chinese over the years, which was all gone in an instant, making them feel extremely miserable.

The Fengqing ship originally belonged to the German Prince Mail Ship Company. After World War I, it was listed as a U.S. war trophy. Later, the U.S. sold the ship to the San Francisco China Mail Ship Company, renamed Lili. In 1933, Hefeng Company bought the ship for HK$750,000, renamed Fengqing, and sailed on the Nanyang route. When World War II broke out, the British government requisitioned the Fengqing, specializing in transporting military supplies in the Indian Ocean. It encountered danger twice but escaped unscathed. After the war, it still sailed on the original route. Because it was a national ship, it was popular with overseas Chinese. Its career was prosperous, and its profits were very high. It is said that before his death, the Founding Father traveled to the United States twice on this ship to promote the revolution, which is still talked about by Hefeng Company.

Encountering a Hurricane: Alert Captain

The Fengqing ship sailed from Singapore to Hong Kong this time with more than 3,000 people. Excluding those who disembarked in Hong Kong, there were 630 people going to Shantou and 580 people going to Xiamen, including children, about 1,400 people, plus crew members, vendors, etc., totaling nearly 2,000 people. It left Hong Kong at 7 pm on the 18th. Half an hour later, the Hong Kong Customs hung up Wind Signal No. 1. (If the ship was scheduled to set sail after 7:30 pm, the departure would inevitably be postponed due to the impending hurricane.) Unfortunately, the ship had already set sail and could not return. At 3:50 am on the 19th, a strong wind blew and huge waves were like mountains. The ship was sailing in the waters of Dapeng Bay and could not withstand the impact of the storm, so it struck a reef. At that time, in order to protect the lives of the passengers, the captain continued to move forward after hitting the reef. As a result of moving forward, although the hull was cracked, it could still be stranded on the reef. If it went into reverse, the whole ship would be in danger of sinking immediately. Because of the captain's alertness and decisiveness, the lives of 2,000 people were preserved, which can be said to be a blessing in disguise.

Hull Cracked: Cries Shocked the Sky

In order to understand the actual situation after the accident, the reporter interviewed Mr. Chen Weixiong, a passenger who returned from the accident. According to reports, there were winds and waves after the ship left Hong Kong. After nightfall, the passengers went to sleep early. He also felt dizzy due to excessive turbulence. Around 3 am, he suddenly heard a loud noise. He jumped up and walked to the deck. At that time, the ship's gong was ringing loudly, indicating that it had hit a reef and was in danger. The whole ship was lit up with electric lights, and the order was disrupted. The cries of women and children shook the sky, and they scrambled for lifebuoys. The state of panic was indescribable. After the hull was stranded on the reef, the huge waves gradually cracked it into three sections, with the head facing the sky and the rest sinking. The passengers gathered at the bow of the ship, waiting for the arrival of death. His leather shoes were also lost in the chaos, and all seven pieces of luggage fell into the sea.

Three Warships: Rescued Bravely

At 6 am on the 19th, a Russian merchant ship "Nahoda" happened to pass by. Knowing that the Fengqing was in distress, it sailed closer to attempt to rescue. However, the wind was very strong and there were many reefs. The Russian ship did not dare to get close. At 6:30 am, the British warship "Hart" sped in. Initially, the warship planned to use the method of transferring ships, approaching the Fengqing. Twice it attempted to dock, but the steel cables were broken by the strong wind. It had no choice but to use small boats to rescue. Each boat could hold more than ten people. Women and children were first, and the old and weak were second. The order was still good. Later, the American warships "Herkins" and "Fox" arrived at 8 am, and the Taikoo Company's "Hunan" ship also arrived at 11 am. They cooperated to rescue. British soldiers guarded the ladders to prevent crowding. However, once the ship was about to tip over, the people in the back rushed to get out first, and the order was disrupted. The British warship fired chemical bullets from the machine gun at the "Fengqing," and the crowd calmed down slightly. By 7:30 pm, all the passengers had safely left the ship, boarded the warships, and returned to Hong Kong.

Rescued Alive: Property All Lost

When Mr. Chen arrived in Hong Kong, he and other passengers were sent to Taoyuan by Hefeng Company for temporary accommodation. The reporter then went to Taoyuan to inspect and saw more than a thousand overseas Chinese sitting on the ground, with nothing but the clothes on their backs. During the rescue, the warships did not allow any luggage to be brought on board, even small packages had to be thrown into the sea. Among the overseas Chinese, many had worked abroad for decades and brought their families back to their hometowns to retire. This time, their lives were saved, but all their property was lost. How would they make a living after returning to their hometowns? The sadness was evident in their faces, which was truly tragic.

Wreckage Burned: Misfortunes Never Come Singly

Hefeng Company has decided to send the passengers to Shantou and Xiamen back to their hometowns for free to deal with the aftermath. In addition, each person will be given HK$50 for travel expenses. As for the loss of luggage, the company said that the matter was extraordinary and it has suffered heavy losses itself, so it cannot compensate. The stranded overseas Chinese are currently petitioning the Hong Kong government, asking for relief, but there is no result yet. The wreckage of the Fengqing that had not yet sunk suddenly caught fire and was destroyed, which is believed to have been caused by pirates looting and setting fire. It is truly a case of misfortunes never come singly.

### Major Coal Mine Disaster in Yiyang, Henan: More Than 100 Workers Buried in the Mine

— Our Correspondent Boquan

Kaifeng, 22nd (Airmail)

The Yiyang coal mine in Henan Province has abundant output and good coal quality. Since the major coal mines in Fenglezhen, Anyang, Jiaozuo, and other places were destroyed by the Communist army one after another, the authorities have paid close attention to the Yiyang coal mine. The Ligou mine in the county has been working day and night since it was exploited by the Yiluo Coal Mine Engineering Office in June 1946, sparing no effort. In a few months, the daily coal output reached more than 200 tons. Therefore, the engineering office has been working hard to expand the underground roadways in the mine, but there are only two well eyes on the ground. The air is not circulating, and the equipment is very simple. The safety of the workers has never been paid much attention to. Once suffocated by the air, they have no solution and are left to die. There have been few improvements. At around 12 o'clock on the night of July 3, a sudden explosion occurred in the mine, the sound of which reverberated through the clouds. 146 miners working above and below ground were there and 41 managed to escape in time. 37 were slightly or seriously injured. Over 100 people were trapped at the bottom of the mine. As of 3 pm on the 4th, no emergency rescue measures had been found, which is very worrying. It is generally believed that this unfortunate event was caused by simple equipment. The victims' families cried and wailed, which was heartbreaking.

### Appealing to Compatriots from All Walks of Life to Economize on Food and Clothing to Help the Flood Victims in Guangdong and Guangxi

Our newspaper will collect donations on behalf of the bank from today and transfer them to the bank

This summer, floods in Guangdong and Guangxi have inundated hundreds of miles, and dozens of counties have become swamps. The number of people and animals who died is countless. The fields and crops have been submerged, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. The houses have been washed away, and the losses are enormous. The flood victims have no way to appeal for help. The tragedy is indescribable. Mr. Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, Bai Chongxi, Song Ziwen, Shao Lizi, Ye Gongchao, Dong Xianchu, and other people from Guangdong and Guangxi have been rescuing the victims and raising relief funds. The newspapers have all reported on it. I know that people at sea will not be able to sleep or eat well when they hear of this tragedy. So how can we help? The key is to save money to help the victims, contribute effort, run around to raise funds, and donate money. The more the better. If our 4 million citizens in Shanghai have this heart and work together to raise funds, the effect will be considerable. "Helping neighbors in distress" is an ancient lesson. People often say "It is most joyful to do good." Let all the citizens of Shanghai rise up and take action. I pay my respects to the victims of disaster nine times.

Letter from the Fund-Raising Committee of the Guangdong-Guangxi Flood Relief Association: Dear Sir, Our association officially started working on the second floor of No. 336 Jiangning Road (Gordon Road) on July 20. The donation books have also been printed. There are three copies. The first copy is a temporary receipt, which is given to the donor.

Leaving Home for Eight Years and Returning in Triumph: The Old Residence Was Assessed and Completely Changed

Dear Editor: In 1916, my friend Mr. Ling gave me a house in lieu of money worth one thousand yuan. The term was six years, and it expired in 1922. Mr. Ling was unable to redeem it and did not request to renew the lease. In 1937, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and I withdrew westward with the army. After the victory, I returned and saw that the house was still standing alone, but it was occupied by Mr. Ling again, and he had registered with the government before me. According to the Civil Code, if the redemption period of an item exceeds twenty years, the property rights should belong to the pledgee. Please ask: (1) According to the above situation, should this house belong to the pledgee? (2) To whom should the land occupied by the house belong? (3) Is it valid to apply for an objection after the government's land registration announcement period expires and before the property ownership certificate has been reissued? (4) If the land registration authority refuses to accept it, can a lawsuit be filed in court? Please give me answers to the above four points, and I will be very grateful. Reader Wu Yizhi

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan's Answer] (1) If the pledger does not redeem the item at the original pledge price after two years of the expiration of the pledge period, the pledgee obtains the ownership of the pledged item. (2) Since the pledged item is a house, it does not include the land. (3) To claim ownership of the pledged house, a lawsuit should be filed in court to resolve the issue. As for declaring an objection to the land administration authority, it can be done at any time. (4) If the land administration authority refuses to accept the declaration of objection, a lawsuit can be filed in court to resolve the issue.

### On the Art of Cinema

— Yan Zhewu

The progress of cinematic art has surpassed the achievements of all past art forms. It is the younger sister of the new arts of the 20th century, more comprehensive and expansive than theater. Some call it the "Eighth Art." Indeed, since the perfection of cinematic art, the universe and human life have undergone extraordinary transformations. We appreciate the gifts of cinematic art itself, and, moreover, we discover its "true value" to humanity in terms of philosophy, cosmology, and outlook on life. This true value shows the unique qualities of cinematic art compared to other arts.

The Unity of Science and Art

The invention of cinema, unlike other arts, does not rely solely on human effort. It is not like sculpture, which relies solely on carving, music, which relies solely on orchestras, or painting, which relies solely on colored brushes. Its growth process is a series of scientific inventions and advancements.

Cinema originated from the invention of photography. "Still films" then evolved continuously, giving rise to "lantern slides." Lantern slides further developed into "moving pictures," eventually culminating in story-driven silent films—movies without sound.

Further scientific discoveries, such as the conversion of sound waves into light waves and the reflection of light waves back into sound waves, led to the evolution of silent films into talkies.

With the emergence of natural color film, color movies have dominated the world film market at this stage, cherished by the vast majority of people.

Beyond the satisfaction of sight and sound, "sensory stimulation" will be projected during movie screenings, making movies an art form with both color and aroma!

The above deduction and narration prove that the development of this artistic realm is due to the gifts of science. The achievements of science are precisely the achievements of art, uniting what was previously considered to be science in opposition to art, and now blooming into magnificent artistic buds in the realm of science! This cannot but be regarded as a new creation in the universe.

The Interweaving of Time and Space

Theater is a three-dimensional spatial-temporal art. Cinema, although also limited to a certain space—the screen—still expresses three-dimensional objects and phenomena, also products of the spatial-temporal dimension. The screen and the stage have the same effect: within a limited time and space, they can express events occurring in an infinitely long time and space. This shortens the distance between "past," "present," and "future" in time, and also shrinks the vastness of the universe in space—the east, west, south, and north—every place!

Moreover, the universe's phenomena are a great flowing current of change, with time and space being the basic framework of all things. The expression of any art is limited by space; the scope of cinema is all-encompassing. Everything in the universe can be captured by the camera, without any obstacles. In an instant, it can switch from the wilderness to the ocean, and from the tropics to the arctic. It realizes Shakespeare's famous saying: "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players." The expansiveness of cinema's subject matter surpasses that of any other art.

Furthermore, the changes of "time" have unlimited breadth within the limited garden of the screen—within a small space. Time often forms the trajectory of movement in space. The magic of cinema is that it advances time through space, incorporating several imagined spatial coordinates into "one" unchanging "space."

As for the sequence of human life, under the mercury lamps, it can often be changed at will. Sometimes, the "wedding" scene is filmed first, and then the "engagement." This kind of "spatialization of time" jumps breaks the mundane life sequence and is a great creation of cinematic art.

The Relativity of Motion and Stillness

All things in the universe are constantly being created, so the universe is inherently a flow of change. Time is inherently a part of that change; because time is ever-present, all things in the universe are in motion. In fact, what we call "stillness" is merely a relative term to "motion." It only signifies the existence of a certain material state. If this philosophy is considered profound, cinema can be used to prove it.

Human "movement" is nothing more than the continuous expression of a process of changing from one posture to another. Photography is often a "still image" of an object's momentary existence. "Motion" is often the result of the continuous transformation of individual "still images" in a short period. Sixteen still images can be obtained in one minute, and these sixteen different postures, when projected continuously under light, form "movement" and are endowed with life. Therefore, the art of cinema is nothing more than an explanation of the relationship between "stillness" and "motion" in the universe.

In terms of the technical aspects of filmmaking, there are many variations in speed, such as "fast motion" and "slow motion." By "coordinating" real-life movements with changes in the speed of filming, several illusions can be created. These illusions often explain or analyze human life and natural phenomena. This is another great wonder of cinema.

When a movie is projected on the screen, the screen itself is a static space; however, this static container conceals countless "dynamic" states! A person sitting on a train appears to be static, but the train is moving, which is an example of Einstein's theory of relativity. Similarly, the story portrayed in cinematic art is dynamic, but the screen itself is static, seemingly illustrating another aspect of relativity.

Based on this relative perception of "motion" and "stillness," filmmaking often uses illusions to reverse the order of moving and still objects. For example, the movement of trains or airplanes is often filmed in a studio, and then a moving background is "replicated" and superimposed. When projected, the audience believes that the train is moving and the airplane is flying. This kind of photographic technique that deceives the audience is created by deeply understanding the relativity of motion and stillness. This is another explanation of the universe's concepts by cinematic art.

The Connection of Dreams and Reality

Dreams are often products of imagination, and imagination is often something that is desirable but unattainable. In the realm of literature and art, no creation can express imagination concretely, subtly, and three-dimensionally. Because the head of "idealism" may soar into the sky, "reality" is, after all, merely something on the ground. However, since the advent of cinema, it has overcome past difficulties, expressing what is desirable but unattainable, holistically and realistically. For example, talking birds, trees that can make fire, gods flying through the clouds and seas, demons charming holy couples, boats sailing on land, and the splitting of the sea. Due to the advancement of cinematic art techniques, all "impossibilities" have been overcome! There is no such word as "impossible" in the realm of cinema. All dreams can become reality, which can satisfy the pursuit of personality and spirit. The essence of cinema is to make people have "daydreams." It is the "dark light" of the human spirit! Cinematic art is reality in dreams, and even more so, it is reality in dreams!

Especially in the realm of fantasy, no one can see themselves outside of themselves, but cinema can allow actors to sit in the audience and appreciate their own creations. What is this if not a dream of life? Yet it is "real."

The Extreme of Sight and Sound

All art forms provide "entertainment for the senses," but the enjoyment of sight and sound differs in each. For example, painting has the visual experience of color, while music belongs solely to the realm of hearing. Performing arts have advanced to a comprehensive expression of sound, light, lines, etc., but they ultimately cannot match the pinnacle of achievement bestowed by cinematic art, which is aided by science! Cinema uses electricity, light, sound, and color directly and compatibly, giving the audience the greatest sensory experience of sight and sound! The so-called "three-dimensional color movie" can be called the new pride of sensory art in the 20th century!

Theatrical performance often uses the actors themselves as tools for artistic expression. Dynamic artistic creations often cannot be preserved, but cinema can make up for this defect! A concentrated and astonishing performance can be passed down to future generations! Therefore, cinema has also taken away the honorable throne of theatrical art! It has completed a symphony of human sensory enjoyment!

In conclusion, cinematic art has enjoyed the love of people all over the world in the 20th century. Its uniqueness and universality are worthy of praise! In the philosophy of art, we must seek the reasons for its achievements. The above analysis explains the reasons why the art of cinema leads people into a state of meditative concentration.

### Fish Dance and Fly

— Zhu Wen

Ancient people did not write without origin. Yu Kai’s poem “Swimming in the Painting Screen” says: "Bamboo moves and cicadas contend to scatter, and even fish fly temporarily." Zhang Yan’s poem “North Pavilion of Xiangzhou” says: “Duckweed scatters and fish dance, and the forest sings with birds." Cicadas scattering and birds singing are common phrases, but the use of "fly" and "dance" to describe fish seems rather unusual. However, the "Classic of Fish Farming" states: "If the fish is not guarded, it will fly away in the rain." The "Book of Han" also has the saying: "Emperor Xuan floated east on the Yellow River, and the divine fish danced in the river." Thus, the words "fly" and "dance" are not without origin.

### Ballet Lessons

— Bao Jia

Bao Jia (Hagar Degas Sesg-1017) is one of the Impressionist painters, whose works are mostly figures, and he is especially good at pastels. With gorgeous colors, light brushstrokes, and noble character, this work can be regarded as a representative. (Liu Shi)

### Casual Talk on Painting Inscriptions

— Li Baifeng

My friend, Huang Yao, nicknamed "Cow Nose," once asked me to introduce twenty colleagues to gather for a small drink when he first arrived in Guilin, with the condition that they must be "genuinely humorous." I excused myself due to my lack of talent, because there are countless painters, but few who understand painting, and those who gather together with the smell of money only praise each other, not knowing where "humor" lies.

Now that I have returned to Chun Shen, I am putting aside my desire to make a name for myself, because there are so many talented people in Shanghai, and I dare not pretend to be an expert. I would not want to hang a refined sign and try to be a famous artist, only to be ridiculed by Zheng Banqiao and others. Although I cannot paint, I like to pretend to be an expert. When I talk to my friend Lu Danlin about Chinese painting, I always feel that the prevailing trend is going against tradition, and people are only trying to make a name for themselves. Painters are often loud and flashy, focusing on superficiality, and I feel that even the glass factory in Beiping is not as good as the Shanghai art scene in terms of business acumen. (Danlin has already written about this, so I won't go into detail.)

As for the inscription on the painting, I often feel that even those who are not famous raise flags and boast about each other. Although inscription is not the most important aspect of painting, it can enhance or detract from the quality of the work. Therefore, the most important thing in inscription is calligraphy, followed by literary talent, and then the seal. If any of these three is missing, the inscription will easily become vulgar. If Li Sixun's landscape painting were inscribed with Huai Su's cursive script, the delicate picture would be ruined. Therefore, Zhao Songxue and Dong Qichang's running script should be used to inscribe Wang Shi's landscape paintings, and Mo Jie's poems and Hui Shu's seals should be used. As for [unclear characters] painting, the opposite is true. Therefore, Master Wu Changshuo's poetry, calligraphy, painting, and seals are all indispensable.

If the inscription for bamboo painting uses "Leaves drooping like a thousand swords, branches towering like ten thousand spears," it is not only worthy of scolding, but also as laughable as the butcher Wang selling plum blossoms. The worst thing in inscription is to show off cleverness. I once saw a painter in Shanghai painting fish and inscribing it with "Graceful as a startled swan, sinuous as a swimming dragon." The inscription was quite good, but unfortunately, he added a tail below, saying "Excerpted from the Rhapsody on the Goddess of the Luo River." Such playfulness with small cleverness reveals a sense of self-importance. Those who can appreciate this inscription must have read half of the "Wen Xuan." If you are worried that Wang A-da next door does not know the source, then pointing out the "Rhapsody on the Goddess of the Luo River" to Wang A-da will still not make him know what it is.

Mr. Wang Jingan divides words into upper and lower levels based on their artistic conception and advocates the separation and non-separation theories, which are also very suitable for discussing inscription. The former distinguishes between clarity and turbidity, and the latter between relevance and irrelevance. I once read an inscription on "Tender Bamboo Shoots":

"Tasting the [unclear character] by the stone, mouth low, admiring the verdant peaks under the moon."

The [unclear character] has become a dead bamboo, and the association of Wang Yan’s egrets with three-inch verdant hairpins is unthinkable. The character is low, like Dong Shi imitating Xi Shi, clutching her chest and becoming even uglier. If:

"Houses, smoke trees, sails falling into the empty river."

"A curtain of sparse rain invades the green steps, and several leaves of spring breeze blow through the fingers."

One can know its type without seeing the painting, and its quality is high. The former is landscape painting, and the latter is orchid and bamboo painting. The latter couplet, although somewhat mundane, is still a good work because it is relevant. Rain sets off the sound of bamboo, and the wind clouds smell of incense. The inscription and the painting are closely related, which means they are not separated.

I attended a banquet at the Youth Association and saw an art exhibition that was vulgar and unbearable. Among them, the copying of Wang Shi and Yun Nantian was like a child learning calligraphy. The inscription was "Famous Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition," which was self-deceiving. The most important thing in Chinese painting is the use of ink. If it is stagnant and unrefined, how can it become a family? No wonder those who are slightly fastidious rarely attract customers with art exhibitions throughout their lives.

I wrote this article because I believe that painters should not focus on being shocking. If they have enough ink in their chests, their works will naturally be extraordinary. Otherwise, the difference between a painter and a craftsman cannot be explained.

### The Significance of the Recent Hundred Years of Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

— Xie Zhiliu

The Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office will hold an exhibition of calligraphy and painting from the recent hundred years. The period of one hundred years is from the first year of Xianfeng in the late Qing Dynasty to the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China. Many people know the calligraphers and painters of these ninety-seven years in the Republic of China. Even in the late Qing Dynasty, many elderly people today are old acquaintances. Therefore, this exhibition will give people in society an exceptionally intimate impression.

Everyone knows that the calligraphy and painting of the Qing Dynasty were dominated by the Four Wangs and Yun. It seems that there was no calligraphy and painting other than them. But in fact, the Four Wangs and Yun did dominate this era, and no one could surpass their achievements. The sixty-one years of the late Qing Dynasty were not a period of development.

However, in the recent hundred years, there were indeed many intelligent and talented people, as well as loyal officials, filial sons, hermits, and monks, who were also able to occupy a place in calligraphy and painting. The so-called literati painting of the Yuan Dynasty became more and more popular later. In addition to pure calligraphers and painters, those who engaged in calligraphy and painting as a game and sustenance occupied other positions mentioned above. If we talk about purely old paintings, there will of course be other explanations. But from the perspective of cultural relics and history, we should not obliterate them all in the same way. Originally, even if we talk about calligraphy and painting of the Qing Dynasty, there are questionable points, not to mention these recent hundred years, which are not a period of development.

This exhibition will evoke feelings of grief for the deceased and nostalgia, will enable people to obtain evidence for criticizing this period, and will lead people to engage in the path of sorting things out. This is just the beginning. This beginning will not only make people admire and feel sad about these works. Strict and upright criticism should be the greatest significance and harvest of this exhibition.

### Casual Talk on Waving Fans

— Dingshan

The joy of painting on fans is unmatched by golden surfaces, which have a unique Wang Xie family style. But don't wipe it with powder, but gently wipe it with a fine cloth, so as not to hurt the golden surface. Otherwise, the ink will be dull and the brilliance will be completely lost.

Golden-faced fans are the most fun to play with. There were many golden faces in the Ming Dynasty, and I once gathered up to a hundred of them, but they were lost during the war. In recent years, I like to collect the Four Wangs and Yun, but there is a difficulty, because Yan Ke and Lian Zhou have many golden faces, and Lu He and Shi Gu Nantian have many white faces, but the fan surface of Mo Jing can be said to be unique, let alone gold and white.

I once spent three years to get a page of color-painted white fan surface by Yan Ke and Lian Zhou. Yan Ke made a lakeside spring scene, with weeping willows and peach blossoms, which is unparalleled in its ancient beauty. Lian Zhou made a page of color entirely in the style of Xiangguang, all of which were collaborative works. After seeking for three years, Mo Jing only got a page of bamboo and stone. There is a page in Jiang Shi's Miyun Lou, which is also a few strokes of slender bamboo. There is a page in Tieqin Tongjian Lou, which was made in his early years. Hu Fan Collection contains a page, which is landscape painting. The fan surface of Mo Jing that I have seen in my life can be said to be extremely rare.

The fans of the Ming Dynasty were all red gold faces, while the early Qing Dynasty used green gold, and by the Kangxi Dynasty, they all used white fans. Therefore, it is more difficult to collect white fan surfaces of the Four Wangs, Yan Ke, and Lian Zhou. If you collect golden faces, Lu Tai and Shi Gu are also not easy to find. All of them were made before the age of forty, without the writing of the elderly.

It is not suitable to make large trunks and thick leaves when painting bamboo on fan sections. Wen Shan and Nantian often make green bamboos, which are especially elegant. Because the tight head enters and exits the sleeves, if you hide a boat and carry a mountain, it will make people feel sweaty, and you can take great strength.

Landscape painting on fans should be ink painting, not green and green; it should be in the distance, not in the fortress. It must make the viewer feel far away, between the casual and wonderful products.

Although the painting of silk fans by Song Dynasty artists, such as Guo Xi and Hui Chong, are all small scenes of rivers and sky, they do not let Ma Yaofu and Xia Yuyu surpass them.

It is difficult to paint bamboo with few strokes, because it lies in the branching, not in the leaves. Zhonggui painted bamboo like this a lot. I once saw a picture collected by Zhang Congyu, which was only thirty-seven strokes, and it did not feel less. Xia Taichang's numerous branches and leaves, although many, are useless.

There has never been an expert in lotus painting, but Tang Jie and Yun Nantian both have excellent works. Pang Lai Old Collection contains a huge album of Yun Tianweng, which contains a painting of lotus flowers in color. The flowers are made of cinnabar and powder, and the leaves are made of turquoise and green. They are as gorgeous as the beauties of the pre-Qin period, not the costumes of the times. It is not appropriate to use heavy colors when painting fans. Lotus painting is unique in being able to be gorgeous without being vulgar. Liu Tuntian's words: "Strange flowers and herbs are deep red."

Recently, I have avoided living on the lake. Every morning, I row a small boat and carry red and green into the depths of the lotus flowers to take pictures of the flowers. The collectors of the fans greet me across the water in front of Su Xiao's tomb. When the painting is finished, they give it to me. Water chestnuts, lotus roots, melons, and fruits can all be exchanged, so there is no need to sell peonies in Luoyang for a thousand gold.

The fan bones are best made of water-grinding bamboo without carving. Xiang Fei is already vulgar, and sandalwood is a market. The husband by the sea often abandons them and takes this, waving it in the cities of the five capitals. Although there are good works, I have no way to see them.

### Lin Xinchuan Fan Surface Solo Exhibition

— Qian Juntao

Our art world can be divided into two major camps. The first camp is Chinese painting, and the second camp is Western painting. Western painting was very prosperous twenty years ago. Now, due to environmental reasons, it seems to have gradually declined, not as lively as it was twenty years ago. On the other hand, Chinese painting has always been lively and has not declined until now. But comparing today to the past, its "quality" seems to be much worse.

However, there are exceptions to the above-mentioned "quality" situation. In terms of Chinese painting, there are also outstanding talents in recent times. For example, Zhang Daqian's landscapes and Qi Baishi's flowers are exceptions. As for the rising group of young painters, there is one named Lin Xinchuan, whom we know well and who has a very promising future. He has a unique painting talent. I have seen the flower fan surface he made, and I think his brushstrokes are exceptionally vigorous and vigorous, the colors are simple and elegant, and the composition is precarious and novel. Roughly, the strengths of Xinluo, Qing Teng, Bai Yang, as well as Hui Shu, Qianlu, and Baishi have been absorbed by him, and these strengths can be melted into his own path to form a style, so he has his own unique picture. The hundreds of works displayed in front of us all radiate his fresh and magnificent charm. This exhibition is very appropriate as a milestone. If he works hard in the current situation until middle age, I think it will not be difficult to become a master. As for the inscription and the arrangement of the seals, I think some pieces can still be considered, so as not to fall into the clichés of predecessors, but this layer is still a small flaw, not worth mentioning.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 359

— Ye Jingfeng

"Cough... Aunt Ji?" Little Tiger whispered, almost inaudibly; afraid that Yaoqun was not yet awake and would be awakened by him.

"Hmm...? Yaoqun's voice was a little hoarse; it was because he woke up suddenly from a deep sleep: "Brother Tiger?" Immediately after hearing the rustling sound of the grass, Yaoqun had already walked out of the [unclear character].

"Yes!" Yaoqun saw me sitting there and was so surprised that he couldn't recognize me; "Mr. Yu...! Have you been here for a while? Really, why didn't you say something?" This last sentence was said to Little Tiger...

I think whoever saw [unclear character] at this time would not admit that she was the beautiful young lady who was active in the Beiping and Shantou areas ten days ago. At first, she was wearing a cheongsam and leather shoes, needless to say, whether she was dressed in casual clothes, emergency clothes, or non-Chinese and non-Western men's clothes, although she also put some paint on her face, she still had the charming and graceful posture of a young girl. At this time, she had completely changed her appearance. Even if I met her on the road, I would never recognize her.

The cleverness of her makeover is to completely eliminate the contours of the female figure; however, it doesn't look like [unclear character] makeup, which appears swollen and artificial. In this hot weather, it is probably impossible to do. Her eyes, lips, mouth, and nose, although not showing any signs of transformation, seemed to have been moved; the parts, size, height, and position were all different from the original. The skin also became rough and dry. The original neat and white teeth, when she opened her mouth and smiled at this time, seemed like she had never used a toothbrush in the countryside; the yellow was also inlaid with black stripes, and there seemed to be some broken places.

I certainly admit that her makeup skills are superb; because this is not stage makeup, which only needs to be covered up temporarily under the lights to be considered successful. Nor is it like Sherlock Holmes described in detective novels, who uses some wigs and fake beards to blind people temporarily. She is doing this for a long time, and she is also in the midst of a group of Japanese military agents, each of whom has a set of makeup skills and a pair of eyes that can see through disguise.

But Yaoqun did not admit that this makeover was skillful. She said that when she followed her master to practice, she had to transform herself into another original living person, and that was true skill: "For example, Pingzi, or the pseudo-Commander Jin, as long as I had seen them once, I should be able to transform into them exactly the same, even their words and smiles would be indistinguishable from the real ones, that would be considered makeup."

All in all, the crude young man in front of her, wearing an out-of-place military uniform, could not admit that she was Yaoqun's disguise, but could only say that she was another person.

"Mr. Yu, I'm really bored," Yaoqun told me as soon as she opened her mouth. "After meeting Captain Shen, the time was too short, and he couldn't explain clearly. I couldn't hear any news from the general team, it was completely isolated... I earnestly ask you to tell me something, and I will report to you the experiences of the past few days - in short, I am a little [unclear character]... [unclear character]!"

Idle Talk on the Shanghai Bund

### Wedemeyer's Mission

— Sea Breeze

General Wedemeyer, as a special envoy of President Truman, arrived in Nanjing on the 22nd. Besides the officially announced investigation into the actual situations in China and Korea, whether Special Envoy Wedemeyer has other missions remains difficult to speculate at this time.

However, one point that all parties have affirmed is that Wedemeyer's mission is vastly different from Marshall's. Marshall was ordered to "execute" peace talks, while Wedemeyer is collecting data for the US to reference in future policy decisions regarding China.

Before Wedemeyer's arrival, there were widespread rumors that he was carrying an aid plan for China, including both military and economic aspects. However, Marshall has officially denied this.

But the China issue can no longer be separated from world issues. When Marshall's aid plan for Europe was being highly touted, Wedemeyer's China-Korea investigation team was inseparable from the aid plan for Europe.

A dispatch from the Associated Press in Nanjing on the 23rd pointed this out.

Wedemeyer's trip is undeniably a major turning point for China's future revival. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 24th stated:

"Chairman Chiang's actions in recent days will have a significant impact on America's future position in China."

In other words, Special Envoy Wedemeyer's recent investigation in China will have a significant impact on China's future position.

To this end, the Chinese government has collected relevant documents and submitted them to Wedemeyer, including the following prominent points:

(1) Sino-Soviet relations—including the Beitashan and Lushun-Dalian issues.

(2) Economic aspects—economic reform plans and all construction and revival plans.

(3) Political aspects—explaining the necessity of general mobilization and the implementation plan for constitutional government. (In military terms, there will be more detailed explanations.)

Wedemeyer's stay in China is four weeks. If divided into groups to investigate the valley areas, it is indeed too short.

We hope that Wedemeyer's trip can obtain sufficient information and materials, and can practically assist China's current situation, which is now of utmost urgency.

Free Talk

### Between Husband and Wife

— Ming Sen

When a man and a woman get married, they must live together cooperatively. Even in the most ideal union, there are always some initial conflicts—in desires, attitudes, and interests. Resolving these conflicts is essential for a happy married life. If the conflicts continue unresolved, the man may seek another partner or solace, while the woman, if she does not want a divorce, will resort to "nagging" as a means of resolution.

Upon closer analysis, the root causes of nagging women are no more than the following four:

(1) Imbalance in sexual relations—According to Dr. Robert Latou Dickinson in his book "A Thousand Marriages: A Medical Study of Sexual Adjustment," complete marital unity depends on the unity of sexual relations. Dr. Paul Popenoe in "The Conservation of the Family," as well as Han Ninguerden and McGu Wen in their co-authored "What's Wrong with Marriage," all indicate that sexual imbalance is the root cause of discord in most couples.

Many women have no knowledge of sexuality when they marry, and they never surpass their initial experiences. Ordinary women who cannot get enough love and attentive care from their husbands are almost certain to become nagging wives. She often refuses to acknowledge sexual imbalance as the main cause of her dissatisfaction, but instead grumbles and complains about his "eating habits," his bad attitude, and so on.

Isabel can serve as a good example: she initially fell in love with a young violinist, but he refused to marry her for the sake of his own future; later, she married an older, prosperous garment manufacturer.

As soon as her new family was established, she immediately developed a kind of "cleanliness obsession." She spent all day cleaning and scrubbing everything in her house. She would not allow her husband to lie on any couch unless he first covered it with a protective cloth. She constantly watched visiting guests, fearing they would flick cigarette ash on the floor. After eleven years, her husband finally left—never to return.

The cause was entirely the imbalance in sexual relations. Isabel's husband was not like the violinist, not a "sophisticated" man; his attitude was very crude. For Isabel, the sexual experience with her husband was "vulgar" and "unclean." During those eleven years of marriage, she never had a proper love life—she nagged endlessly, constantly vigilant, and kept her house extremely clean as compensation.

(2) Romantic Dreams—In general, movies, popular novels, and popular songs give young women a deep romantic concept of love. According to E. D. Maurer in "The Ruin of the Family," "This romantic view of marriage has become a focal point of marital discord."

Walter Lippmann put it well in "A Preface to Morals": "A couple in love who do nothing but love each other are not really worth admiring; love without any attachments will soon become nothing. A couple in love not only love each other but also love many things together—such love will last. Apart from the other serious things in life, love is unlikely to bear fruit."

A woman who insists on romantic notions is always comparing her husband to the "ideal lover" she reads about in novels or sees in movies. Unfortunately, this happiness can only last until the day she proposes or gets married. When her own marital dream loses its rosy luster, she will be greatly disappointed, feel cheated, and unhesitatingly resort to nagging. (To be continued)

### News Clippings

Collector's Sorrow

Lu Wanquan, a resident of Jiangyin Zhoushan Town, was a butcher. During the Anti-Japanese War, he specialized in collecting various auxiliary coins and banknotes, accumulating them in rice bins, amounting to tons, a wide variety to behold. In recent years, prices have risen repeatedly and the value of currency has plummeted, causing Lu to die of depression. It is reported that the auxiliary coins he hoarded could have been exchanged for at least 1,200 dan of rice at the time.

Old Woman as Ba長

Yin Guantun in Fengrun County, Hebei, has been devastated by war, and all the men have fled. At the beginning of its recovery last year, the county government, finding no one to be responsible for the baojia system, appointed the village's elderly women, Cui Yangshi (65 years old) and He Nanshi (60 years old), as the chief and deputy bao heads, respectively, to handle village affairs. They have been in office for a year and a half and have achieved remarkable results. They are very adept at dealing with various agencies, and they are particularly diligent in collecting grain and taxes. However, both elderly women are illiterate. According to the two women themselves, their method of recording grain and tax collection is as follows: for every dou of grain collected, they draw a "+" on the paper; for half a dou, they draw a crescent moon; for every 10,000 yuan in taxes, they draw a small circle, and they have never made a mistake.

Such a Bureau Chief

Cai Bochao, the chief of the Police Bureau in She County, Anhui, has currently tied up the bureau's section chief, Zhu, and sent him to the county government for legal action. The reason for the arrest is that Zhu was "secretly working as a reporter for a certain newspaper in Tunxi." After interrogation, the county government considered that "working as a newspaper reporter is not a crime" and refused to accept the case. Zhu is now appealing to Cai for "infringement of freedom."

Also a Solution

The Qingdao New Transport Promotion Association, in order to improve the city's appearance and maintain cleanliness, stipulates that all households along the street must clean the streets in front of their doors from 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM every morning, or face penalties. It is also stipulated that anyone who spits on the road at any time will be fined or sentenced to hard labor and must also scrub the sputum clean.

### A Record of New York City

—The second largest city in the world, inhabited by people of seventy-five nationalities

In 1776, New York was still a small city, mostly inhabited by British and Dutch people; but today, New York has become the second largest city in the world. It is inhabited by people of seventy-five different nationalities, speaking all kinds of dialects.

New York City began to be inhabited in 1847, and the population slowly increased. By 1905, it had reached a population of one million, and now, it has exceeded seven million. Like a large boiler, this large city has become a common "denominator," because it does not belong to the English, the Dutch, the Russians, the Germans, or the Irish, but includes every "molecule."

The most interesting thing is that there are more Irish people living in New York City than living in their own capital—Dublin; many of them work in government offices, and they also hold positions in the police force. There are also more Italians in New York than in Rome, a total of 1,095,000 people. They poured into New York City in large numbers between 1900 and 1920 and are the largest group of foreigners in New York City; many of them are homesick and want to return to their homeland.

There are 12,000 Chinese people in New York City, but in reality, it is probably double that number; they are officers who moved in during World War I and mostly live in Chinatown. Only one in ten Chinese women there can get married; this means that the marriage conditions for Chinese men there are very poor. Most of them work in bars or restaurants and are accustomed to nightlife.

There are only 19,000 French people in New York, and they do not have a fixed community, because their organization is scattered. They use bars set up by their compatriots as gathering places. The poverty and chaos of their country have driven them to New York in hopes of some good luck; they are engaged in bars, import and export, cosmetics, and fashion industries, and many French people ultimately hope to return to their homeland.

Two-thirds of the Russians in New York came before the Russian Revolution, and there are now 57,000 of them, most of whom have been naturalized as Americans. They rarely call themselves White Russians and mostly dislike communism. They are engaged in construction, and a portion are merchants.

Germans in New York are very organized and often communicate with each other; every week, all German families gather together, wearing their national costumes, speaking their own language, dancing their national dances, and drinking large quantities of beer. Their national consciousness is terribly strong.

The Czechs in New York are somewhat similar to the Germans, they have their own schools, teaching elementary school students about their national folklore, history, songs, and dances of the old country in their native language. These are amateur schools, with the purpose of preventing children from forgetting their own country. They are very enthusiastic about celebrating their national day; they also faithfully and enthusiastically support four newspapers in their native language. Most of them are engaged in commerce.

The 412,000 Poles, who make up eight percent of the total population of New York City, are mostly skilled industrial workers.

There are many wealthy Jews in New York, almost a third of the city's population, and they are skilled workers in the city's garment industry. These Jews without a homeland are very united, and the many people's organizations they have organized are unmatched by any country. This is because their shared cultural heritage and ancient national customs give them a sense of community. Many older Jews still piously believe in Orthodox Judaism.

Greeks are mostly cooks in New York because they can make delicious food. There are 53,000 Greeks there. There are 11,000 Yugoslavs in New York, many of whom believe in communism, and they have portraits of Stalin and Tito hanging in their homes.

There are 123,000 Hungarians in New York, mostly engaged in commerce.

Other Norwegians number 54,000, and they occupy an important position in the business world. There are 11,000 Dutch people, and they were the first to come to New York City. The fewest are Indians, only 150.

The above is the general situation of the people of some important countries in New York City.

### Film Scene This Week

— Li Zhen

"The Chase"—A Good Play Worth Recommending

Undoubtedly, after "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," this is a good play that confronts reality and reflects reality. I would like to recommend it to every audience member who loves domestic films.

In this film, you can see the social microcosm of suffering China. The Anti-Japanese War has been won, but those who made fortunes from the national crisis and the victory are even more reckless. On the other hand, those national industrialists who are struggling hard are struggling in the wind and rain. The fate of the factory is precarious. Even the national industrialist Fang Zijiu has been forced into paralysis. It is still a microcosm of the suffering fate encountered by those Chinese industrialists.

The director's handling of the whole film is extremely sharp, and it is obviously a further step beyond "Record of the Holy City."

Although Huang Jiaying is on the screen for the first time, she is extremely capable of grasping the kind and innocent character of Dao. Wei Heling, Zhou Feng, and Han Tao have all achieved considerable success. Huang Jijiang's simple acting skills prove that he will have excellent achievements in film as well as on stage.

The cinematography and sound recording are both above average, but the set design is poor.

Sad "Dragon and Phoenix Bracelets"

This is adapted from a love story "Yu Li Gui" from the Mandarin Duck Butterfly School. Although it has a theme of opposing feudalism and anti-rites, the characters in the play all lack "ripeness" and "power," so what they leave behind is just some tear-jerking stories, sad and weak emotions.

The story is arranged to be quite lingering and sympathetic, grieving for several people, but Tu Guangqi's directing skills are poor, and many scenes lack poetic and artistic charm and are made quite vulgar. The descriptions of Zhou Bingwen and Fang Li's life after marriage are also rather rigid in the process.

Among the actors, Chen Yanyan has the best performance, especially in the second half, which is very impressive. Feng Zhe plays two roles, but his performance is mediocre. In comparison, Xu Daping is better than Zhou Bingwen.

Detective Film "Tears of Red"

"Tears of Red" is Betty Grable's change of style work. The story is a general American popular novel, from the murder of a woman to the solving of the case. The only thing commendable about this play is the writing skills of the screenwriter, which are still relatively witty and pleasing.

Betty Grable's performance as Qi'er is stable and that's it.

Wu Qing's "Double Heroes Blood"

A gambling den leader and a female student fall in love inexplicably. The story unfolds from here. What's especially boring is that the gambling den leader is also a veteran who specializes in "talking about love" with women, but in the script, he is described as so sacred. This is really the whimsical idea of that old film and drama writer.

If I don't tell you that this is a film directed by the famous director Mervyn LeRoy, you simply wouldn't believe that his work would be so mediocre.

Other

The slapstick film "Muddleheaded Hero," which imitates Harpo Marx's acting skills, is completely nonsensical, and "Swordsman Errant" is also much inferior to the previous film.
