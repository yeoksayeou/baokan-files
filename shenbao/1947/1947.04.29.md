### Price Increase Ratio Reaches 20,000 Times Pre-War; Civil Servants' Salaries Have Not Been Adjusted for Five Months

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Recently, price fluctuations have been severe, and the lives of civil servants and teachers have become increasingly difficult. According to the adjustment of civil servants' and teachers' salaries, the most recent one was in December of last year. The price index for April of this year, estimated based on the intermediate changes, has increased by 19.7 times compared to December of last year. The average increase in the prices of various commodities has increased nearly doubled compared to November of last year. However, in these five months, civil servants' and teachers' salaries have not changed and are still using the meager income from December to cope with the rising prices every day. Not only is it impossible to have enough food and clothing, but even the minimum living standards are on the verge of being unsustainable. Regarding the price index changes in May, if the average price index in the first half of the 26th year is 100, then it was 1,001,545 in December of the 35th year, 1,287,017 in January of the 36th year, 1,518,343 in February, 1,726,073 in March, and April has not yet ended. Based on the prices of the two ten-day periods, it is estimated to be around 1,900,000.

In January, there were slight changes in food prices. In February, the main changes were in clothing. In March, food and daily necessities, such as rice, flour, grain, salt, tea, meat, foreign soap, and grass paper, all showed an upward trend. In April, all prices were fluctuating, especially the prices of grain and yarn, which created astonishing records. The salaries of civil servants and teachers should be adjusted with the change in prices. This is the right of civil servants and teachers and the most reasonable request. Due to the decline in currency value and the high rise in prices, if the pre-war income was one yuan, today it should be 19,000 yuan. Based on this calculation, those who earned 100 yuan per month before the war should now earn 1.9 million yuan.

However, the adjustment for civil servants and teachers in December of last year, with a living allowance of 170,000 yuan in the Beijing-Shanghai area, was multiplied by a factor of 1,100. With the price index at that time being 1,001,544, the actual income per person per month, compared to the pre-war currency value, was 280,100 yuan for a base salary of 100 yuan, which is approximately 28 yuan pre-war.

For five months, civil servants' and teachers' salaries have not been adjusted, while prices have been rising steadily. The price increase rate in April was almost doubled compared to December of last year, which is more than 19,000 times pre-war. Civil servants and teachers are using the income from December of last year to cope with prices that are more than 19,000 times higher. Today, a low-ranking official with a base salary of 100 yuan has an income worth only 15 yuan pre-war. A high-ranking official with a salary of 800 yuan has an income of 55 yuan pre-war. With such meager treatment, unless there is illegal behavior, it is clear that they cannot continue to live.

On the other hand, civil servants' and teachers' salaries not only cannot keep up with prices, but are also far from being adjusted with the exchange rate. Today, the US exchange rate is 12,000 yuan of national currency per US dollar. Compared to the pre-war 100 yuan of national currency, which was equivalent to 30 US dollars, it has also increased by nearly 4,000 times. If civil servants' and teachers' salaries could be adjusted in the same proportion as the exchange rate, those with a base salary of 100 yuan should also earn 400,000 yuan today. The current income is only 280,000 yuan, a difference of 120,000 yuan. Those with a base salary of 800 yuan should receive 3.2 million yuan, which is a difference of 2,149,200 yuan compared to the current income of 1,050,800 yuan. Since February of this year, the government has tried to distribute real goods to stabilize the lives of civil servants and teachers. However, due to complicated procedures and the quantity being far from the actual needs, and it is still limited to Beijing and Shanghai, not many civil servants and teachers across the country are benefiting.

### Da Mei Evening News on Loans to China: Loans Must Be Used Appropriately

[Our Dispatch] This city's English-language Da Mei Evening News yesterday commented on its chief editor, Gold's, New York dispatch, and wrote a special editorial. The gist is as follows: Since the Chinese government began discussing reorganization, the responsible leaders have hoped to obtain loans from the United States as soon as possible, and some have even indicated that "loans are not a problem." However, in fact, reorganizing the government is only one of the prerequisites for obtaining loans. Other requirements include the performance of the reorganized government, the degree to which it gains the confidence of the people, and its ability to fulfill its promises.

The United States adopts this attitude both for its own benefit and for the long-term benefit of China. Because in the eyes of Americans, given the current political and economic instability in China, 500 million US dollars could be used up in a short period of time, disappearing like a stone into the sea without a trace. And it could create even worse situations! That is, if the loan is used to prolong the civil war, and used as an excuse to issue more currency, it will only further plunge China into political and economic chaos.

Gold's dispatch mentioned that a new realism exists in the attitude of the United States today, which is different from the past sentimentality. Americans deeply feel that this kind of realism is beneficial to both China and the United States, otherwise the cooperation between China and the United States will have no firm foundation, and the economic assistance from the United States will not be able to bring lasting benefits to China.

The United States hopes that China can respond to American realism with the same realism. If this can be done, the two countries can continue to be friendly nations once the US loan becomes a reality.

The first realistic attitude that China should adopt is to immediately recognize that the United States can no longer unconditionally and unlimitedly assist China in the posture of a big brother. The United States has absolutely no intention of infringing upon the sovereignty and rights of the Chinese government, but when this loan is established, it must be accompanied by specific supervision and control measures. Such measures may displease China, but they must realistically recognize that this is a major condition attached to the loan.

The first point is that China should have a realistic attitude that it cannot hope for a loan of more than 500 million US dollars, at least for the time being. Gold's dispatch pointed out that 500 million is the maximum, and even this amount may not be paid in one lump sum. Last week, a special dispatch from Ta Kung Pao in Nanjing stated that the government is conducting a large loan of 1 billion US dollars, and drafting a plan based on this figure. We deeply feel that this unrealistic attitude of the Chinese government, even if it is to test the American reaction, will inevitably lead to disappointment.

Some government leaders in Nanjing are already considering the miracle that this loan will create. They believe that this large loan will end the civil war, reduce inflation, lower prices, and solve China's many economic problems. But in fact, unless China itself strives to restore domestic peace and order, the loan will not be of much benefit to China.

Gold Reports on the US Position

[Special dispatch from Gold, Chief Editor of Da Mei Evening News, New York] The Chinese fantasy that the American Santa Claus will drop a gift bag of 500 million US dollars into the chimney of Nanjing after the reorganization of the National Government should be listed as nonsense. I (Gold refers to himself) have just returned from Washington, and the impression I gained in New York before, that the US attitude towards the overall situation in China is purely realistic, has now been confirmed. Regarding this level, a senior official of the US State Department put it most thoroughly, saying: "The friendly attitude of the United States towards China has not wavered, and the United States is very willing to provide assistance in any constructive situation. But the United States does not intend to blindly give before it has obtained guarantees that the money or materials are for proper purposes."

Regarding the 500 million US dollar loan, former US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, cited the regulations set by the US Export-Import Bank, that is, any loan must have a considerable hope of repayment, and said that even if he tried to approve this loan with his personal efforts, the loan committee could still cite this regulation to overturn his recommendation. The deadline for the 500 million US dollar loan designated to be lent to China will expire on June 30, but Gauss hopes that this deadline will be extended indefinitely, so that it can be used at any time when a practical plan is realized. But no matter what kind of plan, it must first go through thorough investigation to determine the required numbers, and at the same time, appropriate guarantees must be obtained for the allocation of uses. Therefore, the number of 500 million US dollars represents the maximum amount of loans required for a variety of plans, rather than a general amount for undisciplined use.

Judging from all responsible parties, it seems that they all hold a realistic attitude, and have changed their previous sentimental attitude. The improper handling of UNRRA and surplus materials has been openly admitted by both China and the United States. American people now feel that if the United States wants to aid China, it must obtain a guarantee that this aid should not be arbitrarily wasted or used only to enrich private pockets.

If it is said that my argument is too pessimistic, it is nonsense. In fact, most people think that I am too optimistic, because I often say that if China can accept the political unity plan proposed by Marshall, and at the same time stop the excessive issuance of currency to correct the unbalanced budget, then China will definitely be able to gradually recover.

Based on current reports about China, no one believes that there is hope for an early solution to this problem, and any further assistance, if done improperly, will only make the overall situation worse. The United States is currently agitated by the red terror, but this only applies to the regions where the Soviet Union is striving for control, and there is no such situation in China. Everyone believes that we must support President Chiang and the National Government, but this view cannot offset the disappointment that the National Government's policies have given us.

Private sources in the US State Department hinted that Chinese officials believe that the United States urgently needs to trade with China, which has greatly hindered trade agreements and other similar efforts. At the same time, American businessmen's hopes for profitable investment in China have been shattered. Some people believe that only by recovering the huge American interests in China can Chinese officials be convinced that the investment of Americans and other countries must be based on whether there is hope of repayment.

Americans look at some Chinese officials differently. Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen's achievements in Shanghai are highly praised. Chang Chia-ngau, President of the Central Bank, expressed his views in the United States during the war, and now he is eager to realize them. In addition, American people here also express great trust in Li Ming, Chen Guangfu and other business leaders.

### President Zhang Attends the Price Committee Meeting Today to Discuss Countermeasures for Price Fluctuations; The Ministry of Food Plans to Effectively Control Grain Merchants

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 28th] Amid widespread reports of crazy price increases in various places, the Price Committee of the National Economic Commission will hold a regular meeting at 3 pm on the 29th. Countermeasures for price fluctuations will be proposed for discussion at the meeting. The new President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, will attend the meeting and conduct detailed research with the heads of relevant ministries and commissions to seek ways to stabilize prices, with stabilizing rice prices as the top priority.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 28th] A responsible person from the Ministry of Food said: The sharp rise in grain prices in Nanjing and Shanghai is definitely not due to a shortage of grain, but is affected by the fluctuations of other prices. For example, Sichuan Province is a grain-producing area, but grain prices have also risen due to price fluctuations, which can be used as proof. Moreover, the Ministry of Food has sold a large amount of rice to stabilize grain prices in recent months, but grain prices are still rising, which shows that someone is manipulating them. The countermeasures of the Ministry of Food, in addition to asking relevant ministries and commissions to stabilize general prices to avoid mutual stimulation and rising prices, plan to effectively control grain merchants, prohibit non-grain merchants from operating grain, and improve grain transportation to open up sources. In addition, the distribution of public grain in Shanghai has approved a total of 36 grain stores, and the Ministry has sold 8,000 bags of grain. In addition, the grain administration meeting convened by the Ministry of Food is scheduled to be held from May 1. The heads of field grain offices in various places will attend to review business, report on work, and plan for the future.

[Our Dispatch from Beiping on the 28th] Prices in Beiping City continue to soar. In two days, white rice has risen by 800 yuan per catty. There are suddenly grain stores in the market, and transactions are extremely chaotic. The frenzy of cotton yarn has shown signs of fatigue. Qingdao Zhongfang has affected production due to lack of cotton. Tianjin still has enough for three months. Today's wholesale price records are as follows: fire rice 3,100 yuan per catty, No. 1 flour 105,000 yuan, 32-count Eight Horse yarn 822,000 yuan, Five Fortune 182,000 yuan, Jia Ge Da paper 215,000 yuan, Camel cigarettes 4,100 yuan.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Jinan on the 28th] General prices in Jinan City are still rising sharply. Recently, due to traffic congestion, the import of local products has been sharply reduced, and speculators have absorbed more and more, and prices have risen several times a day. The market is gradually becoming chaotic. On the 28th, the market price of millet was 1,060 yuan per catty, flour 110,000 yuan per bag, raw oil 6,500 yuan per catty, and coal 900,000 yuan per ton.

### The United States Decides to Propose a New Plan for the Distribution of Japan's Total Reparations; China Should Receive 45 Percent

[United Press Dispatch from Washington on the 27th] The Far Eastern Commission will determine the reparations claims against Japan at the closing session of the Commission's Reparations Subcommittee tomorrow. According to authoritative sources, after striving for it, the United States will now demand that Japan pay 30 percent of its total industrial equipment and other reparations property to the United States, and 45 percent to China. According to the State Department, the reparations materials obtained by the United States will be used to compensate Korea for the losses suffered during the forty years of Japanese occupation. In addition, 25 percent will be paid to the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, India, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, and Canada. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, according to authoritative sources, the biggest obstacle that failed to be resolved last year was due to the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union over the industrial equipment that the Soviet Union had moved away in the Northeast. The US insisted that this material should also be included in the final reparations items that the Soviet Union should receive, while the Soviet Union insisted that it was "war booty" and not reparations material. Now the new US plan no longer disputes this point, but still counts the material it moved away, so now in the distribution of reparations material within Japan, a very small part is allocated to the Soviet Union. Regarding Japan's liquid assets, there is a rumor that there is gold worth 200 million US dollars, and the United States still insists that it should not be used as reparations.

[Our Dispatch] Yang Yunzhu, the representative of our country to the Far Eastern Commission, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today and take the General Gordon ship to the United States.

### Notice of Distribution of Japanese Factories Can Be Issued

[United Press Dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th] According to today's news: The notice of distribution to various requesting countries of the 350 Japanese factories that will be included in the 30 percent temporary reparations plan is expected to be issued tomorrow. The drafter of this notice is the Industrial Group of the Economic and Scientific Department of the Allied Headquarters. The procedures for the dismantling, transportation, and final destination of the factories selected for reparations will be stipulated in the notice, but the actual list of factories will not be announced tomorrow, because it must be finally approved by the highest authorities. It is heard that the selected factories include the following areas: aircraft and aircraft engine factories, ordnance factories and testing factories, machine tool factories, ball and axle factories, steel factories, power plants, shipyards, sulfuric acid factories, caustic soda and gas factories, aluminum factories, artificial gasoline and artificial rubber factories, etc.

### Stettinius Calls for Improvement of Sino-US Friendship; Assistance to China Contributes Definitely to Peace

[Central News Agency Dispatch from New York on the 28th] Former US Secretary of State Stettinius said today at the American United Service to China Campaign meeting in Philadelphia: Actively improving Sino-US friendship is our important responsibility. Stettinius called for the meeting: "It is more important than ever for us to understand China clearly; it is also more important than ever for us to take wise actions towards China and the Chinese people. If we cannot fulfill this responsibility, then our children and their children will be disappointed." Stettinius, who is currently the President of the University of Virginia, mentioned the recent Gallup public opinion test, saying that this test has shown that the majority of the American people still advocate helping the Chinese people. "We read many confusing and sometimes discouraging news in the newspapers every day, so this public opinion represents clear thinking and understanding." To explain the friendship between the two sides, Stettinius cited an example, saying that during the war, farmers in a Chinese village in the rear of the Japanese army refused to reveal the hiding place of the American pilots who were forced to land, so the Japanese army killed one-fifth of the total population of the village. Stettinius called on all parties to actively support the United Service to China's education, health, and social welfare programs in China. He said: China urgently needs foreign aid to carry out its huge post-war reconstruction work. If we give this kind of aid, it is far better than others. Stettinius also quoted a letter from Marshall supporting the campaign, in which Marshall said: Americans who donate to the American United Service to China can not only provide much-needed assistance to the long-suffering and brave people, but also make a definite contribution to permanent peace (which is the hope of global civilization). Stettinius said: Since 1941, the American people have donated more than 45 million US dollars to various programs of the United Service to China.

Editorial
The New Test for the United Nations Organization

U.S. Secretary of State Marshall has returned to the United States from Moscow, and then we see the convening of a special session of the United Nations in New York. One international conference has just ended, and another international conference is immediately following. In terms of nature, the Moscow Conference cannot be compared with the special session of the United Nations General Assembly; the former is a gathering between countries, while the latter is a gathering of an international organization. Precisely because of the different nature, the failure of the Moscow Conference makes us even more concerned about the special general assembly convened by this international organization called the United Nations. It is called special because the regular session of the United Nations General Assembly was originally scheduled to be held this autumn, but this time it had to convene a special session due to specific issues. The so-called specific issues, in addition to the application of some countries to join, on the surface, seem to focus on discussing the Palestine issue. Although the Palestine issue is a serious international issue, it has been discussed in meetings for many years, but no results have been achieved. However, saying that this issue needs the United Nations General Assembly to discuss and resolve it seems to be an excessive exaggeration of its seriousness. According to general practice, if this issue is to be submitted to the international organization of the United Nations, it should first be discussed by the Security Council. However, now the United Nations is convening a special session for this reason, and its significance is truly thought-provoking.

We must first understand what kind of issue this Palestine issue is. Palestine is the so-called "Holy Land," the birthplace of Jesus Christ. Since the birth of Jesus, the native Jewish people of Palestine, who have not converted to Christianity and still worship the old religion worshipped by the Jewish people before the birth of Jesus, have lived a life of wandering and displacement, migrating to distant places, from Spain to Kaifeng in our country. Their original residence has been occupied by Arab people. For two thousand years, the Jewish people have no homeland. However, they have been squeezed out in various places, and some idealists have shouted out the call to restore the Jewish homeland. During World War I, Britain wanted to destroy Turkey's rule in the Near East and North Africa, so it used all means to contact the Arab people on the one hand, and on the other hand, called on the Jewish people to return to Palestine to build a country. The Jewish people's nation-building movement in Palestine has been developing under the protection and support of Britain. After the end of World War I, Britain therefore gained the mandate to rule over some areas in the Middle East, including Iraq, Transjordan, and Palestine. Britain's policy was originally based on checks and balances, helping the Arab people on the one hand, and wanting to help the Jewish people in Palestine on the other hand, calling on them to return to build a country. The reason why Palestine has problems is rooted in this. Since the exile of the Jewish people, Palestine has been completely Arabized; it is no longer the homeland of the Jewish people. Their return to rebuild their country will undoubtedly inevitably arouse the opposition of the Arab people. The Palestine issue, in essence, is therefore a matter of the Arab people and the Jewish people competing for the right to rule Palestine.

But the meaning of the Palestine issue is more than this. Since the nineteenth century, Palestine and the Near East have been a place where great powers compete: due to geographical relations, it has become a buffer zone. In the past, this was the intersection of British and German conflicts. Both World War I and World War II were due to Germany's eastward expansion. After World War I, the Near East and Palestine were assigned to British mandate rule, but after World War II, Britain's position in the Near East and Palestine was shaken. Because it felt its position in the Near East was shaking, Britain pulled in the United States. Regarding Palestine, there was originally a joint British-American committee. However, the work of this joint committee was about to begin, but the White House expressed its support for the Jewish people's desire to restore their country, which increased the anger of the Arab people and made the solution of the Palestine issue more difficult. After that, conflicts between Arabs and Jews arose from time to time, and bloody incidents occurred repeatedly. This situation cannot be allowed to continue to drag on. Recently, we have seen the convening of a special session of the United Nations to discuss this matter.

There are several layers of significance to the submission of the Palestine issue to the special session of the United Nations. First, this is a test of the United Nations organization. The reason why this issue was submitted to the General Assembly through the Security Council is that the use of the veto power in the Security Council makes it difficult to reach some kind of agreement. Since the establishment of the United Nations organization, this is the first time that the United Nations General Assembly has been able to review an important international issue; transferring this issue to the General Assembly for discussion shows the decline of the Security Council's prestige on the one hand, and tests the function of the General Assembly on the other hand. How the United Nations handles this issue will undoubtedly affect the fate of the United Nations international organization itself. Second, in this special session of the United Nations, we can see the attitude of the Soviet Union and its vassal states toward the Palestine issue. The submission of the Palestine issue to the United Nations General Assembly is to measure the Soviet Union's attitude toward Palestine and the Middle East. Third, Britain originally enjoyed the mandate to rule Palestine. Its submission of this issue to the United Nations General Assembly seems to be mobilizing international public opinion and turning it into a more favorable position.

However, as far as the Palestine issue itself is concerned, the solution to this issue is extremely difficult. The incompatibility between the Arab and Jewish peoples makes the solution of the Palestine issue extremely difficult. The Jewish people have lost their native status in Palestine; for two thousand years, Palestine has no longer been the Holy Land of the Jewish people, but has become the home of the Arab people. How to mediate the conflict between the Arab and Jewish peoples in Palestine is what we hope for the efforts of enlightened politicians. Our stake in Palestine is very light, so we are in a more advantageous position: how to use this advantageous position to mediate the Palestine issue is what we especially hope for the wise efforts of our delegation.

White House Holds Important Secret Meeting: Marshall Presents Report; US Attitude Firm, USSR Gradually Softening; Secretary Marshall Broadcasts Explanation of Foreign Ministers' Conference
〔United Press International, Washington, 28th〕Secretary of State Marshall told President Truman and several senior congressional leaders last night that in the Moscow Conference, he emphasized the US's unyielding and non-appeasement policy towards unresolved treaties. In the one-hour and fifty-minute White House meeting, Marshall explained to the President and Democratic and Republican leaders of both houses of Congress his views on the Moscow Conference, which ended without agreement, in his nationwide broadcast tonight.

〔Associated Press, Washington, 28th〕According to today's news, US Secretary of State Marshall has told President Truman and congressional leaders that the US's unwillingness to compromise on fundamental issues in the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference has had a significant impact on the Soviet representatives. After Mr. Marshall returned to the US, he held a two-hour meeting at the White House last night. According to people present at the meeting, Mr. Marshall reported that the US's position on reparations and other items has become increasingly firm, while the Soviet side's position has gradually wavered, and the Soviet representatives' confidence has also slightly decreased. Mr. Marshall believes that the Moscow Conference has made some progress in clarifying various issues, and its results may be seen at the four foreign ministers' meeting in London in November. For example, the Soviet Union's demand for reparations from Germany and Austria seems to require fundamental changes in order to gain the US's tacit approval. Mr. Marshall asked the participants to exercise patience in dealing with the Soviet Union in the coming months, hoping that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the US would become more moderate when the four foreign ministers meet again. Therefore, Mr. Marshall replied to inquiries that he believed it was too early to say whether the disputes over the main points of the peace treaty should be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. The President's summoning of congressional leaders and the Secretary of State to the White House for consultations shows that the government has signs of continuing to propose preventing communism in Europe and Asia. Since the President proposed the procedure for providing aid to Greece and Turkey, this is the first time he has convened a meeting at the White House. The official statement said that the purpose of the meeting was to allow congressional leaders and the President to hear the results of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, which must be kept secret, so reporters were not allowed to interview the news. It is generally expected that news and opinions have been frankly exchanged during the meeting.

〔United States Information Service, Shanghai, 28th〕Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to broadcast a speech in the English special program on the Voice of America from 7:15 to 7:45 tomorrow night (Shanghai summer time), reviewing the recent Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The frequencies of the station are as follows: 9490, 6060, 11790, 9650 kilocycles.

US to Further Implement the Truman Doctrine: European Countries Will Demand Assistance
〔Associated Press, Washington, 27th〕President Truman summoned key members of Congress concerned with budget and foreign policy, and Secretary of State Marshall, to a meeting at the White House tonight, symbolizing the authorities' proposal of further measures to prevent communism in Europe and Asia. The official announcement stated that the purpose of the meeting was to review the results of the Moscow Conference, and Marshall would broadcast to the nation tomorrow night, reporting on the progress of the conference. However, the actual scope of discussion may be broader. Congressional leaders want to know the full picture of foreign policy. This review has been repeatedly raised during the debate on the $400 million aid bill to Greece and Turkey, in order to understand how much it will cost the US to implement the "Truman Doctrine" internationally. According to government spokespersons, Congress has learned that the government will request a huge loan or grant to Korea. At the same time, the failure to conclude a peace treaty with Austria throughout the European continent, the failure to achieve German economic unification, coupled with the precariousness of the British economy, seem likely to increase demands on the US. Unofficial reports from the Middle East also suggest that more financial assistance will be sought from the US.

〔United Press International, Washington, 27th〕People here say that the important matters of concern to Secretary of State Marshall after returning to Washington include the following two points: (1) Take action as soon as possible on the $350 million relief bill to aid China, Austria, Hungary, Italy, and Poland (the House of Representatives concluded the debate on this bill last Wednesday, but several amendments will be proposed on Monday). (2) The Senate should approve the peace treaties with Italy and the Balkans (some senators now advocate waiting until the German-Austrian peace treaty is drafted and agreed upon by the four countries before taking action on the above-mentioned treaties).

Wells Praises Marshall's Attitude
〔Associated Press, Washington, 27th〕Former Undersecretary of State Wells said in a broadcast today that there are several things in the results of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference that are truly encouraging. The current tension may be eased, but not intensified. Secretary of State Marshall has consistently adhered to the international principles followed by the US since the establishment of the Atlantic Charter at the conference. The US government's attitude should satisfy every American. This firm policy has a greater chance of success in the end than the compromising policy pursued by former Secretary of State Byrnes. Because the US has compromised with the Soviet Union in the past, the Soviet Union has been able to establish communist dictatorships in Bulgaria and Romania. If the US had adopted the current policy a year ago, the problems encountered by the US might have been reduced, and the severity would not have been as great as it is today.

UN Special Session Opens: Behind-the-Scenes Activities of Britain, Arab, and Jewish Representatives; Little Hope for Resolution of Palestine Issue
〔Agence France-Presse, Success Lake, 28th〕The UN Special Session is scheduled to open at 8:00 PM today (Shanghai time 5:00 AM on the 29th) to discuss the Palestine issue. Siam will also attend as the 55th member state. Siam will be the first enemy vassal state to be allowed to join the UN organization.

〔Associated Press, New York, 28th〕The Jewish Congress suddenly announced that it would not send representatives to the UN General Assembly. Therefore, twenty seats in the audience were empty at the beginning of today's meeting.

〔Associated Press, Success Lake, 27th〕The UN Special Session will open tomorrow morning to discuss the Palestine issue. The Arab, Jewish, and British sides have each selected the most capable representatives to engage in planning and negotiation. The British representative is the most experienced diplomat, Buyergan, with Colonial Deputy Minister Tom Mess and Assistant Martin as his assistants. The representatives of the five Arab countries are as follows: Egyptian Ambassador 駢芙 Hassen; Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamalei; Saudi Arabian Crown Prince and Foreign Minister Faisal; Syrian Speaker of Parliament Golei; Lebanese Ambassador to the US Malik. The session is scheduled for half a month, with a cost of about one million US dollars. The Arab League's proposal to immediately declare Palestine an independent country will certainly cause debate. Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Faisal arrived last and immediately convened the foreign ministers of the other four Arab countries at his residence to discuss the final strategy. Britain and the US insist that the agenda of this meeting be limited to discussing the organization of the investigation committee. The Soviet Union has never expressed its opinion in advance.

Scope of Discussion Should Be Limited
〔Agence France-Presse, Success Lake, 27th〕The UN Special Meeting was convened to discuss the Palestine issue. As the opening is approaching, the general impression of UN officials is that most of the delegations hope to limit the scope of the meeting to discussing the establishment of a special committee only, as requested by Britain, and to avoid a general discussion of the Palestine issue, as hoped by the Arab countries. Although all countries maintain a cautious and reserved attitude towards their future attitude, some delegations do not hesitate to say that it is extremely important for Britain to terminate its mandate over Palestine and for Palestine to establish an independent country. If a decision is made before the UN organization obtains all the information about the situation in Palestine, the timing does not seem ripe. Only by establishing a fact-finding committee can such information be collected. In fact, the UN General Assembly must elect a chairman and reach an agreement on the agenda before it can truly begin to discuss the Palestine issue. The five powers and the UN Secretariat have held negotiations in the past two days, and the result seems to be that they have agreed that the chairman of the General Assembly should be the head of the Brazilian delegation, Aranha, to succeed Prime Minister Spaak of Belgium. As for the chairmen of the six standing committees, they will be taken by representatives from six countries, namely Canada, Sweden, Egypt, Czech Republic, Mexico, and Poland. Except for Poland, the above six countries will all be chairing a standing committee for the first time. Once the preliminary work is resolved, the General Assembly will begin to discuss. According to informed sources, the discussion that the General Assembly should conduct will not only involve procedural issues (i.e., the appointment of the special committee), but also the fate of Palestine. The British representative will make a statement to the General Assembly, which is undoubtedly. The Arab countries will severely criticize the British administration of Palestine, and the Jewish side will also criticize the British immigration policy behind the scenes.

Attitudes of Various Representatives
The current question is "Will Britain retain its mandate over Palestine?" If Britain does not intend to continue to bear the responsibility of the mandate, should the mandate over Palestine be handed over to the UN organization in accordance with the conclusions reached by the British and American fact-finding committee? The Jewish people have been demanding the establishment of an independent Jewish state in Palestine and opposing trusteeship by the UN organization for a long time. On the Arab side, they hope to establish an independent Palestinian state and place the Jewish people in a minority position. They also demand that the immigration of Jewish people into Palestine should be completely stopped in accordance with the British White Paper issued in 1939.

US and Soviet Union Play a Pivotal Role
As for the attitudes of other countries, they have not been determined so far. Up to now, only the United States has expressed its resolute opposition to thoroughly discussing the Palestine issue. It is expected that the US representative, Austin, will do his best to advocate the establishment of a fact-finding committee. As for the Soviet Union, it believes that Palestine is a former League of Nations mandate territory. The Soviet Union has already stated its attitude towards these mandate territories in the Trusteeship Council, that is, it advocates that these territories should be completely independent. Based on this, it is feared that the only thing that the UN General Assembly can resolve at this meeting is the composition of the fact-finding committee and the status of Jewish organizations in the General Assembly. According to informed sources, the US and the Soviet Union will have a pivotal influence on this matter. The US will favor the demands of the Jewish people because of the great power of the Jewish people in its country, but because the US has new responsibilities in the Mediterranean, it is feared that it will also conduct a close study of the claims of the Arab side. As for the Soviet Union, it will favor the Arab countries and advocate that Britain should stop the mandate over Palestine so that British troops can withdraw from the Middle East. In short, it is unlikely that the Palestine issue will be resolved quickly.

Terrorist Violence in Holy Land Reaches Climax
British Military Commander Nearly Meets with Disaster
〔Central News Agency, London, 27th Special Telegram〕On the eve of the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Palestine issue, terrorist violence in the area seems to have reached its climax. British troops have been reinforced from Egypt and are waiting for any emergencies.

〔Reuters, Jerusalem, 28th〕British military commander in Palestine, General Macclennan, narrowly escaped disaster today. Three minutes after he passed by in a car under the protection of an armed jeep, a terrorist threw a grenade at him. The police have now cordoned off the area and are searching.

Leaders of Major Japanese Parties to Confer on Cabinet Formation: Communist Party to Be Excluded from Coalition Cabinet
〔Asia East News Agency, Tokyo, 28th〕Although the Socialist Party has become the largest party in Japan, it avoids talking about the issue of forming a cabinet. Within the party, it must wait until the Central Committee of the party decides everything on May 3. Externally, the secretaries-general of the Socialist, Democratic, Liberal, and National Cooperative Parties must convene a joint meeting, and then the leaders of the Socialist, Democratic, and Liberal Parties will formally discuss the matter. At that time, the political situation will be clear.

〔Asia East News Agency, Tokyo, 28th〕Democrat Party Supreme Committee member ノ田均 visited Chairman 齋籘委 on the 27th to exchange views on the current situation. The two agreed that only the organization of a coalition cabinet of the Socialist, Liberal, and Democratic Parties could stabilize the current political situation. 蔗田 also believed that the Socialist Party should also cooperate with a wise attitude and hold a meeting of the leaders of the three parties to discuss national affairs. In addition, 蔗田 advocated absolutely avoiding the combination of the Democratic and Liberal Parties.

Selection of New Prime Minister to Cause Controversy
〔United Press International, Tokyo, 28th〕Leaders of various Japanese political parties agreed today that the new cabinet must be a coalition cabinet, but judging from all indications, the major parties will have fierce competition in electing a new prime minister. The Socialist Party will insist that the chairman of the party, Katayama Tetsuo, serve as prime minister. Liberal Party Secretary-General Ohno 頃実 said, "Although the Socialist Party has become the largest party in the parliament, it does not mean that the new prime minister must be selected from that party. The combined power of the Liberal and Democratic Parties can overwhelm the advantage." This implies that after the merger of the two parties, there is a possibility of being elected as the new prime minister. The new prime minister in Ohno's mind is probably referring to Yoshida undoubtedly.

Difficult to Avoid War in the Next 25 Years: France Holds Public Opinion Poll
〔Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th〕The French Public Opinion Research Institute announced today that according to the latest public opinion poll, it can be known that the American people have gradually believed that the United States will be dragged into the whirlpool of the war in the future. The proportion of Americans who believe that war is inevitable was only 38% in the March 1945 survey, but increased to 65% in the March survey last year, and has increased to 73% this year. In addition, seven out of ten people believe that war will break out in the next 25 years, and there is almost no difference in opinions on this matter, regardless of whether they are Republicans or Democrats, men or women.

Nationalism Rises Daily: Colonial Issues Become More Serious; American Historian Warns in Time
〔Associated Press, Washington, 27th〕The Diplomatic Policy Discussion Group released a report drafted by the group's historian, Mackay, today, warning that "colonies everywhere will be the root cause of war until the colonial people have the right to decide their political system themselves." Colonial countries must use a portion of the wealth taken from the colonies for the colonies to prevent the colonial people from turning to the Soviet Union. Many colonial people are deeply impressed by the Soviet Union's achievements. Although the three countries of Britain, France, and the Netherlands have stipulated detailed reform plans for their colonies, creating an impression of "planned stability for the future," an extremely unstable situation still exists in many places. Vietnam and Indonesia are the most prominent. Nationalism there is extremely strong, the natives are armed, and the bloodshed has made the feelings bad and there is no way to compromise. The strong nationalism of the Arabs in French North Africa, supported by the moral support of other Arab countries, is enough to overthrow France's plans to manage Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. From Tunis to Gasa Blanca, the situation is still tense. How the future will change depends on the sincerity of each colonial country in promoting the reform plan and the achievements of the United Nations Social and Economic Council in dealing with this issue internationally.

British Labor Party Member Ridicules Wallace
〔Associated Press, London, 27th〕British Labor Party member 奥白林 today attacked the recent remarks of former US Vice President Wallace in England, saying that Wallace came here and used our country as a platform to make remarks attacking his own government, which is not beneficial to his own country or Britain. We do not want to make British territory a battlefield for other countries' disputes. It is best for Wallace to publish any remarks about his country in the United States. The British are tired of listening to Wallace's set of remarks and believe that he cannot represent the US labor unions or the American people.

Indian Constituent Assembly Intensifies Work: Nehru Suddenly Expresses Pessimism, Saying British Withdrawal Will Divide India
〔Associated Press, New Delhi, 28th〕Indian Interim Government Chairman Nehru told the Constituent Assembly today that after the British withdraw next year, the power of the Muslim League in various provinces may force India to split, and the goal pursued by the Indian people for many years may disappear as a result. Assembly Chairman 普拉沙 said that the charter formulated by the Assembly may not include all the provinces of India. However, he strongly stated that no provinces will be allowed to be divided. When Pu氏 gave his speech, a small group of Congress supporters demonstrated outside, holding banners, demanding that Bengal and Bonzhep in various provinces be divided into Indian-controlled areas. Pu氏 said that the British decision to withdraw from India has increased the tension of our work. He designated that the constitutional matter must be completed by the end of October.

It is said that the US and the US believe that a joint committee of the two countries will be convened in order to quickly resolve the Korean issue, but the Hodge Headquarters does not intend to change its policy towards South Korea, and will continue its original intention of handing over Korean administrative power to the Korean people when the time is ripe.

Appendix (2) Second Quarter Quota for Goods Officially Announced by the RMC Yesterday Actual Total Similar to First Quarter
[Our report] The Executive Committee of the Rolling-in Provisional Management Committee, regarding the amended provisional regulations for import and export, the appendix for the second quarter (May to July) quota for Category II goods, has been submitted to the National Economic Council for approval and officially announced.
The actual total is similar to that of the first quarter, only the cotton item is reduced because the government has designated other funds for it. Metals, paper and pulp, wool, rubber, lubricating oil, Chilean nitrate, and other fertilizers have all been appropriately increased. The committee claimed that it had carefully considered the domestic minimum needs when setting the quota, especially paying attention to industrial raw materials. However, under the current national economic situation, the amount of foreign exchange expenditure that can be borne is limited. It is clear that the quota number will still feel insufficient compared with the needs of production enterprises. In fact, this kind of difficult situation is not unique to China. Only when the trade situation gradually improves and the needs of all parties can be reasonably adjusted, the government should take this as the goal of its efforts, and it is hoped that domestic people will consider the difficulty of the country's progress and give their understanding.
(Name of Goods) (Second Quarter Quota)
(1) Gasoline, Diesel, Kerosene US$12,075,000
(2) Cotton 20,000,000 yuan
(3) Rice, Wheat, Wheat Flour 7,000,000 yuan
(4) Tobacco Leaves 8,000,000 yuan
(5) Hemp and Hemp Bags 1,250,000 yuan
(6) White Coal 500,000 yuan
(7) Metal Products 4,500,000 yuan
(8) Chemicals 2,600,000 yuan
(9) Paper and Pulp 4,500,000 yuan
(10) Timber 2,000,000 yuan
(11) Wool and Velvet Machine 2,000,000 yuan
(12) Artificial Ingots and Dyes, Sulfurized Elements (Mainly for Raw Materials) 2,275,000 yuan
(13) Rubber and Products 2,000,000 yuan

(16) Chilean Nitrate and Other Fertilizers 500,000 yuan

Market Rice is Not Lacking Sales Above the Limited Price are Not Allowed Mayor Wu Convened Rice Merchants for Talks Yesterday
In order to stabilize rice prices in the city, Mayor Wu, in addition to selling a large amount of rice in Shanghai, also went to Wuxi to investigate the actual situation in the producing areas for overall planning. After returning to Shanghai the night before, he convened rice merchants in the city at the City Hall at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss ways to suppress rice prices and report the results of his investigation in Wuxi.
Mayor Wu said that the inventory in the rice producing areas is extremely abundant. Wuxi alone has 600,000 shi of existing grain. In addition to selling white japonica rice every day as needed, Siam rice will also be sold starting today (29th). Therefore, the supply and demand of rice should not be a problem, and there should be no further price increases. However, the rice merchants stated that the total amount of current costs and reasonable profits reached 180,000 yuan, so they intended to request that the limited price of rice be raised to 180,000 yuan. After careful consideration, Wu did not agree and expressed that he could not accept it, but he promised to request the central price meeting to further lower rice prices in the producing areas to compensate. At 6:00 p.m., Mayor Wu told reporters again that the rice sold in the city every day is more than 11,000 dan, which has become a situation of oversupply. There should be no difficulty in buying rice anymore, and rice shops should not be without rice to sell. If there is the above situation, if it is not that unscrupulous merchants deliberately create a black market, they will pour the allocated rice back into the producing areas. Therefore, relevant agencies have been dispatched to thoroughly investigate and review the sales books. Once it is verified that there is black market trading or diversion out of the urban area, they will be severely punished. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens throughout the city will report any shops or merchants who violate the order at any time to facilitate the implementation of government orders and ensure people's livelihood.
[Another report] The Social Affairs Bureau sold 9,000 bags of rice yesterday, 4,500 bags each of white japonica and red indica rice (according to the original allocation of 3,000 bags each of white japonica, red indica, and Saigon rice). Siam rice will be added to the allocation today. 303 dan arrived at Nanshi Market yesterday, and 100 dan at Beishi Market. Market transactions are still suspended, but many rice shops still have no rice to sell. However, according to reporters, there are more than 2,200 rice shops in the city. Each rice shop must be allocated rice once a day. The smallest rice shop (in terms of turnover) can be allocated 15 bags (18 shi) each time. Better performing ones can be allocated 100 bags each time, and the total number of rice bags issued from the main warehouse every day exceeds 10,000 bags. According to the 9,000 bags (i.e., 11,000 dan) thrown out by the Social Affairs Bureau every day, the daily demand in the city can be exceeded by 10,000 dan, which does not seem to be the case. The City Government Investigation Office, the Police Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau have all sent personnel to conduct random inspections of the retail sales of each rice shop to prevent rice merchants from engaging in fraud. In addition, the price of cooking oil rose slightly yesterday. Raw oil rose by 20,000 yuan, Lilang flour rose by 3,000 yuan, Ben flour (warship) rose by 4,000 yuan, and soybeans also rose by more than 10,000 yuan.
Another report: Wheat bran continued to rise by 1,200 yuan, and soybean cake showed a firm trend. Soybeans were in a firm shape. However, Hancow Zha beans were scarce and expensive, soaring by 6,700 yuan. Broad beans were in short supply, jumping by 20,000 yuan. Red beans rose steadily. Raw kernels were active in foreign firms, rising slowly, adding more than 10,000 yuan.
Sesame Guang Foreign firms continued, making steady progress, rising another 10,000 yuan. Hong grain also rose by 2,300 yuan, corn step by step rose 2,300 yuan, Guo beans high and pretty next flat.

### Our Country Exports Salt to Japan Without Affecting Economic Situation
[Our report] People in the know told reporters: The salt we export to Japan in barter trade is actually our country's surplus product. Long before the war, our country was already trying to find a world market for salt, which is beneficial to both national economy and people's livelihood and national foreign exchange income. Moreover, the salt needed by Japan can also be easily obtained from Egypt, Arabia, and other areas in the Yangtze River and the sea. It is heard that barter agreements will soon be established with these places.
It is said that Japan needs 1.2 million tons of salt annually. From January to April of this year, our salt exports to Japan were only more than 100,000 tons. Last year, the total amount exported to Japan was only more than 300,000 tons. Therefore, the county believes that: (1) If our country does not export salt to Japan, Japan will not suffer a salt shortage because of it. (2) Our country's export of salt is actually seeking a trade outlet, especially since it is currently facing competition from other countries. (3) The industrial county needed in our country is about 200,000 tons per year, and the supply is definitely not in short supply. Therefore, our salt exports to Japan will not affect the domestic economic situation.

[Our report] The first meeting of the Silk Production and Sales Plan Guidance Committee was held at the International Hotel on the 14th floor from 11:00 a.m. yesterday until 3:30 p.m. Those present yesterday included: Chu Fucheng, He Beiheng, Fan Chongshi, Leng Dao, Pi Zuozu, Ge Jingzhong, Shen Xirui, Ma Baozhi, Dong Zanyao, Ma Lianfang, Xia Daoxiang, Zhang Yuhua, Wang Zishuang, Tang Xixiang, Li Shuming, Yan Zehzi, Zhou Jihui, Diao Minji, Tan Xihong, etc. Xu Baiyuan from the Ministry of Finance also attended to provide guidance. Chairman Tan Xihong first reported on the preparation process of the association, and then began to discuss the motions. The main points are recorded as follows:
(1) Review and approve the qualifications of cocoon collecting and silk reeling manufacturers, and propose two conditions: (A) Based on last year's loan credit, they are divided into four categories: (Zi) Those who pay silk on time can increase their loans this year, but the equipment is still the standard. (Chou) Those who did not pay silk last year or only paid a small part and repaid in cash can maintain the original loan amount at most. (Yin) Those who delayed until recently this year to repay in cash should have their loans reduced. (Mao) Those who have not repaid will not be allowed to apply for a loan. (B) The equipment situation of each factory.
(2) This year's cocoon collection price: It is hoped that the prices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will be unified, and the standard of 4 dan of medium rice combined with 1 dan of fresh cocoons in the outline of the plan passed by the Executive Yuan will still be maintained. The construction departments of the two provinces, China Silk Company, and China Farmers Bank will investigate the average price of medium rice in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wuxing, Shengxian, Zhuji, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Dangzhou from May 1st to 5th every day, and announce the first phase of purchase prices on May 10th. The second phase of purchase prices will be calculated based on the average price of medium rice from May 15th to 20th every day. However, if it is not much different from the first phase price, it will not be adjusted.
(3) The cocoon collection method will still be based on the past decision to implement the regional joint cocoon collection method.
(4) It is determined that the Guidance Committee is a deliberative and liaison organization and is not responsible for execution. This year's cocoon collection matters will still be managed by the management office established by China Silk Company and China Farmers Bank to supervise the cocoon industry. The management office will be dissolved after the cocoon baking is completed.
(5) Loan matters will be handled by China Farmers Bank. Loans will be handled in three phases: the first phase is to purchase fresh cocoons, the second phase is for manufacturers to use dry cocoons as collateral for silk reeling loans, and the third phase is for raw silk to be concentrated in Shanghai for collateral loans pending shipment. From the second phase onwards, the Bank of China will be directly responsible for supervision. Commercial banks and firms may also participate in loans, and the methods will be stipulated by the China Farmers Bank.

Velvet Fine and Sturdy Dark and Tired
The market for fine wool, smooth quality flannel, and Xuanwei etc. has been hovering at its peak recently.

Hong Kong Tightens Foreign Exchange Control
Holding U.S. Dollars Without Special Permission From the Authorities is Prohibited and Smuggling Them Out of the Country in Any Way is Prohibited
[Reuters, Hong Kong, 28th] An official statement regarding the approval of U.S. dollar exchange rates pointed out the need to maintain the amount of U.S. dollars in Hong Kong and tighten foreign exchange control. The government stated that the Foreign Exchange Control Ordinance of 1941 is still valid, and those who transfer U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and Philippine pesos out of Hong Kong without permission will still be prosecuted. Some merchants pointed to the Qing government, intending to hinder import trade and make the general public believe that the government will reject foreign exchange applications for imports other than necessities such as rice. According to reliable sources, although it will be more difficult to apply for foreign exchange for the import of fountain pens, glass stockings, expensive watches, and other luxury goods, the government does not intend to stop approving all foreign exchange required for imports other than necessities. It is learned that the Hong Kong government's Minister of Supply and other officials responsible for trade and currency control will classify non-essential imports into several categories, and then approve foreign exchange according to their grade based on the supply of U.S. dollars. The government is well aware that the U.S. dollars obtained by merchants are not handed over to the government, but sold on the black market. Previously, most of the overseas remittances were Hong Kong bank drafts, but now they are all New York bank drafts. These New York bank drafts are sold on the Hong Kong black market. These bank drafts are sent back to the United States by importers and can be exchanged in the United States. (The official price of U.S. dollars here is four Hong Kong dollars to one U.S. dollar, while the black market price is about four Hong Kong dollars and sixty cents to one U.S. dollar.) The government also knows that many wealthy Chinese merchants ship tung oil and other items to the United States. After selling them in the United States and obtaining U.S. dollars, they do not hand them over to the Hong Kong government for distribution, but sell them on the black market. The government also ordered that British people must not hold U.S. dollars without the permission of the financial authorities. As for the Chinese people, they can hold them, but they must not smuggle them out of Hong Kong, whether by mail or other means.

Northwest Artery Qingxin Qinghai-Tibet Highway Construction Xiu Zhaoma Tang Ying

Qinghai, 18th by airmail
Qinghai is a corner of my country's northwest, but its position has become more and more important in recent years. Especially today when Xinjiang is tight and Tibet is shaking, this place has almost become the throat connecting the mainland and the border areas. When the Soviet Union plans to complete the Tianshan Highway and the United Kingdom explores Asia Minor, the venue for great power competition has moved westward, and the consolidation of my country's western border has become an urgent task. At the same time, if we want the border and the mainland to form a consistent vein, convenient transportation is the most important task. However, let’s take a look at the transportation situation in the northwest, which is really pathetic and laughable. Not only is there little contact with the central government, but there is also no way to communicate with Xinjiang. If something happens on the border, the danger is really deep under this situation. In the past, in the National Father's industrial plan, great importance was attached to the completion of the Northwest trunk line, for this reason. However, the progress of this work requires mobilizing a large amount of manpower and financial resources, and requires sophisticated planning and patient hard work. It is not easy, nor can it be done with just money. Therefore, this responsibility has been delayed. As a result, this great hard labor was borne by the people of Qinghai between 1944, 1945, 1946, and 1947. Between 1944 and 1945, with more than two years of time, the compatriots of the entire province worked hard to build the Qinghai-Tibet Highway from Xining to Yushu, which is 1,000 kilometers long. This is the Lanzhou-Lhasa line in the industrial plan.

Bill Cook Appears

After the completion of this highway, the person in charge of the Qinghai Provincial Government and the staff of the Northwest Highway Bureau held the first opening ceremony in the early autumn of 1945. When the pitch-black Bill Cook galloped across the Qinghai-Tibet Highway built with the blood and sweat of millions of people, it was particularly majestic. It was simply like a wild cat produced in the grassland, running as fast as light smoke. It passed through the undulating wheat fields, crossed the boundless grasslands, and drove out of the sandy beaches along the reverse flow direction of the Shang River. Because Bill Cook’s appearance was the first time on this strange virgin land, no wonder the sound of the whistle called out the young girls in the Mongolian yurts and the old and slow Mongolian wives, watching this strange thing, and marveling in their tongues. When the first traffic reached Yushu at the end of the Qinghai-Tibet Road safely, special extra editions with bright colors appeared immediately in all parts of the province. Every Qinghai compatriot reported this great news of success with joy and jumped three feet high, because the reason why the Qinghai-Tibet Road took years of work was precisely to hope for this good news today. The success of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway made everyone breathe a sigh of relief, but the facts told us that the first traffic was not only unprecedented, but also feared to be the last. Originally, the Qinghai-Tibet Road would never hear the sound of motors again. As a result, wind and rain blow, cattle and sheep trample, mountain floods destroy, and the roadbed collapses. Therefore, many highways filled with blood and sweat by Qinghai compatriots were gradually buried in wasteland and weeds. Until today, it is said that some places have indeed not found the original road line. But we know that the Qinghai-Tibet Highway is an artery related to the military, political, and economic affairs of the Northwest. So, can we let it fend for itself? Therefore, the Qinghai authorities paid attention to the repair and protection of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway when preparing to continue to build new highways this year. According to the news from the current provincial government, we know that the Qinghai-Tibet Qingxin Highway Engineering Office has planned a plan to repair the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which is to build two iron bridges with larger plays near Xiaoxia and Laoya Gorge, or brick piers, or piers, but only these two bridges, their manpower, financial resources, and materials require a long time of preparation, so whether they can be realized this year is still a question. Secondly, the road surface west of Daotang River has largely deteriorated. If traffic is opened, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no places, so the Qinghai authorities, under extremely difficult circumstances, plan to hire 600 to 700 civilian workers and 17,000 to 8,000 pack horses to destroy the area along the line. Make all realistic and thorough repairs. In fact, although it is said in name that the Qinghai-Tibet Highway has been repaired, the central government has never used it. In addition, the wind in the border is strong and rain and snow are frequent, even the strongest roadbed will deteriorate over time. Therefore, although it is said to be repaired, the time and effort used; I am afraid that there is not much difference from rebuilding. However, for the sake of our entire national defense security and to connect the inland and the border's political culture, this highway is always in the most important position. Moreover, the success of this highway is the result of the Qinghai two million compatriots doing their best, and it is the painstaking crystallization of the Qinghai authorities. Now, for the sake of cherishing their blood and sweat and hard work, and for the sake of future effects, the people of Qinghai and their authorities have shouldered the responsibility of repairing again, so that this great artery of the country will one day be active.

Ten Total Sections of Engineering

Not long after the completion of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the people of Qinghai shouldered a task several times more difficult than the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which was to complete the Qinghai-Xin Highway within 1946 and 1947. This plan was handed over to the Qinghai authorities by Chairman Jiang, and it is also the Lanzhou-Ruo Meilin in the National Father's industrial plan. After the Qinghai authorities were ordered, they immediately mobilized soldiers and civilians in 1946 to start implementing the task.

The Qinghai-Xin Highway is the most important national defense avenue. It starts from Daotang River, winds around the south bank of Qinghai Lake through Dulan, heads towards the Kunlun Mountains branch, passes through the Qaidam Basin, and then from Tielimuke, crosses the Arjin Mountains, crosses the desert, crosses the Tianshan Mountains, and connects with Ruoqiang in southern Xinjiang. The entire road is 2,000 kilometers long. The Qinghai-Xin Highway Engineering Office was established in Xining on April 1, 1946. The director was concurrently held by Ma Bufang, Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Government. There were two deputy directors, Ma Dui, Director of the Construction Department of the Qinghai Provincial Government, and Yu Shushi, an engineer from the Northwest Highway Engineering Administration Bureau. Later, Yu resigned, and Hua Qizu was appointed. Below, there were groups and departments specifically responsible. Later, the Northwest Highway sent technical personnel, Hua Zhenmin and others, 120 people, to assist in road construction, and went to survey on April 15. In order to shorten the period, it was decided to build as they measured, so the Qinghai military engineers also set off together on May 15. These military engineers were the security teams under the jurisdiction of the Qinghai Provincial Government. They were strong and well-disciplined. Moreover, because they cooperated extremely well with the people, they were very popular with the people, like a family. This road construction project was divided into ten total sections and twenty sub-sections. Each total section had one total section chief, many doctors, one radio station, and many surveyors. Each sub-section had one sub-section chief, three supervisors, and the civilian workers were led by the Baojia chiefs. In 1946, a total of 6,283 civilian workers were hired, mostly from the Mongolian and Tibetan compatriots along the highway and the people of Huangyuan and Yingyuan. In addition, there were 1,000 security team members to assist. Before setting out for work, the local provincial government and the engineering office put a lot of effort and brain sweat into this work, because the project was extremely vast and the places were mostly unfamiliar. In addition to giving animals, cattle, and horses a prescribed amount of money every
