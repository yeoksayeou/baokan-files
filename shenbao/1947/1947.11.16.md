Strong units are advancing south from Fengxian County, engaging in a pincer movement against Jing'anji, a crucial stronghold at the intersection of the Fengxian-Xuzhou and Peixian-Xuzhou highways. The bandits are showing signs of fleeing westward.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 15th] The prelude to the Xuzhou defense battle has begun. This morning, defending troops engaged in fierce fighting with the attacking bandits at Sanbao Station (15 kilometers south of the city), Tengjiazhai (3 kilometers northeast of Sanbao), Tengzhuang (southeast of Sanbao), and Hongxishan (west of Sanbao). The bandits were repelled in the afternoon. The 11th Column of bandits, which infiltrated Liuxinzhuang and the Huangji-Zhengji area, 9 kilometers northwest of the city on the 14th, began to collapse towards the western shore of Weishan Lake this morning after being intercepted by defending troops. Fengxian and Peixian counties are firmly held by the National Army. Xuzhou has a strong military presence, and the city remains as calm as usual.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] The threat posed by the communist bandits to the northwestern periphery of Xuzhou has been eliminated through the National Army's air force cover and the advance of tank units. However, Yao Lou and Twenty-Eight Mile Post on the southwest, as well as Gaojiaying, Erbao, Sanbao, and Caocun along the Jinpu Railway Line, were once again disturbed by the bandit's 16th and 2nd Columns on the morning of the 15th, and are being attacked by the National Army from the north and south. The Air Force dispatched frequent sorties today to assist the army in that area. [Another Dispatch] Over the past three days, the National Army, in close coordination with the Air Force, annihilated more than 3,000 bandits from Guo Yingqiu's unit near Haozhai, 30 li west of Xuzhou, capturing over a hundred. Furthermore, a certain unit of the National Army's Fifth Army decisively routed a bandit regiment at Shitun, more than 10 li north of Jiuli Mountain in Xuzhou, on the 15th, with the remnants fleeing in disarray to the northwest.

[Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 15th] There are no longer any regular communist bandit troops in southwestern Shandong Province. All counties are calm, except for a bandit brigade and two detachments stationed in Liangshan and the Yezihe area northwest of Wenshang.

Elite units of the National Army are rushing to encircle and suppress them.

### Communist Bandits in the Jilin-Changchun Area of Northeast China Retreat to Their Old Nest on the Pingmei Road, High Command Commends the Soldiers Defending Jilin

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 15th] Over the past few days, communist bandits in the Jilin-Changchun area have been retreating to their old nest in the Xifeng-Xi'an area along the Pingmei Road and appear to be concentrating. It is estimated that the 11th Bandit Column has reached the southwest of Xifeng, and another 2,000 bandits have reached the west of Xifeng. The main force of the 2nd and 3rd Columns is also in this area. More than 6,000 bandit stretcher bearers are also moving from Yitong to Xi'an. The Eastern Mongolian Independent 1st and 2nd Divisions are moving south. Judging from the bandits' movements, they seem to be planning a final struggle in southern Liaoning. The 8th Bandit Column is eyeing Jinzhou, and Huludao is about to be closed. The National Army has withdrawn from Yingkou Port because it is about to freeze. The bandits have not forgotten these two ports.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 14th] "The heroic soldiers of Jilin bravely repelled the superior and stubborn bandits, demonstrating our supreme revolutionary spirit, which is truly commendable. I hope that all officers and soldiers will remain vigilant at all times and not be taken advantage of by the bandits. This is my hope."

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The communist bandits' so-called sixth offensive in Northeast China has now reached the stage of exhaustion. According to an analysis of the situation in Northeast China by a certain military observer here: The bandit army in western Liaoning is no longer capable of rising again. There are no traces of bandits in the areas on both sides of the Beining Line. The Pingjin Line will be open to traffic soon. After the National Army recovered Dashiqiao in Yingkou, the situation in southern Liaoning is becoming increasingly unified. The bandit army, which besieged Yongji for more than 20 days, withdrew from the periphery of Yongji due to its inability to overcome the strong defense and heavy losses. The 1st and 3rd Columns of bandits, gathered on the outskirts of Changchun, are now in the Yitong-Xi'an area. The main force of the 2nd Column has fled from the vicinity of Shuangyang to the Taojiatun-Fanjiatun area along the Zhongchang Line. The 4th Column has crossed the railway and fled west. The 6th Column is in Dehui and the 10th Column is in Jiutai, and another bandit force is entrenched in the Nongan-Huaide area. The bandit army has now changed from attacking Yongji to besieging Changchun. The able bandits are avoiding direct contact with the National Army everywhere, only occasionally sending small groups to roam around. The National Army has long seen through their tricks and is also adopting a steady and solid approach, closely monitoring the bandits. He also said that Northeast China has been experiencing severe cold for days, and the ground is slippery with snow, so there will be no major battles in the short term.

### Glorious Victory in Yulin, Besieged Bandits Starving and Freezing, Increasing Numbers Surrendering, Yuanshi City South of Shijiazhuang Stands Firm

[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 15th] The Yulin defense battle, for which both sides made great efforts, has in fact come to an end. There are no more bandit troops within 5 li around the city. The defending troops, with inferior equipment and less than 10,000 combat troops, resisted the communist bandits' ten brigades for twenty days, creating another glorious victory, which is truly a miracle.

[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 15th] Military News: The Air Force flew in batches from Xi'an and Taiyuan to assist in the battle in the southwestern region of Jianlin on the 15th. Furthermore, the bandits surrounded in that area are suffering from both the National Army's heavy blows and the pressure of hunger and cold. As a result, many are surrendering, all wearing thin clothes, in a pitiful state.

[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 15th] The front line telegraphed at noon on the 15th: The great battle in the area 50 or 60 li southwest of Yulin is in full swing. Five of the seven brigades led by Peng Dehuai have been surrounded by the National Army and will be annihilated. The two brigades that broke through and fled are also being pursued and annihilated.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 15th] After the fall of Shijiazhuang, Yuanshi still stood firm as of yesterday. The defending troops took advantage of the communist bandits' attack on Shijiazhuang and launched a large-scale raid, obtaining a great deal of food and seeds.

### US-China Relief Agreement Completes Legislative Procedures, Legislative Yuan Plenary Session Passes Nine Important Cases

First, condolences were offered for the recent death of Legislator Wu Wentian. Then, the following important cases were discussed and passed: Case on selecting people from various parties to jointly participate in the provincial, municipal, and county senates and temporary senates; Amended draft of the Feast and Entertainment Tax Law; Draft of the Housing Lease Ordinance; Amended draft of the War Criminals Trial Ordinance, which was not amended according to the review opinions; Amended draft of the Central Meteorological Bureau Organization Ordinance; Amended draft of the National Funeral Law and Public Funeral Ordinance; Special Criminal Cases Litigation Ordinance, and the duration of the Supplementary Ordinance for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery and the Supplementary Ordinance for Handling Criminal Litigation After Recovery were each extended for one year; China-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement; US-China Relief Agreement.

### Selecting Members of Both Parties to Participate in Local Councils

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The issue of members of the Minzhu and Qingnian parties participating in local public opinion organizations was raised again at the Legislative Yuan plenary session on the 15th. After about an hour of discussion, it was passed in accordance with the resolution made during the review. During the discussion, Kuomintang legislator Di Ya expressed his sincere opinion, saying: "The provision that the Minzhu and Qingnian parties participate in the county senates by selecting personnel to account for one-fifth should be seriously considered before a decision is made. The reason is that the number of counties in the country is relatively large, and the Minzhu and Qingnian parties do not currently have members in every county. If members are temporarily recruited to meet this need, it may repeat the mistakes of the Kuomintang in setting up county party headquarters everywhere in the past. Not only will the party's foundation be weak, but it will also attract criticism." The full text of the resolution is as follows: "In accordance with Article 72 of the National Government's policy guidelines, before the re-election of the current senators of the provincial senates and the municipal senates under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, the National Government may select up to one-fifth of the original number from outside the existing number of senators to be provincial senators or municipal senators under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. Before the re-election of the current senators of the county senates and the municipal senates under the jurisdiction of the provinces, up to one-fifth of the original number may be selected from outside the existing number of senators to be county senators or municipal senators under the jurisdiction of the provinces. The selection methods shall be determined by the National Government by order."

### China-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement May Be Signed This Month

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The China-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement may be signed this month. Dai Xiujun, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, reported on the review process on the 15th, pointing out that the articles and annex format of the China-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement are roughly the same as those of the China-US and China-UK Air Transport Agreements, but its content is simpler. The main points are as follows: The agreement is valid for four years, and either party may terminate it by notifying the other party with a one-year period. Air routes: three routes for each party. The Dutch direct route goes from the Netherlands through Europe, North Africa, India, Burma, Siam, and Vietnam to China, and then follows the Pacific air route to the United States. There are also two Nanyang air routes, one: from the Dutch East Indies through Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam to China, and the other: from the Dutch East Indies through the Philippines to China. In addition to the Nanyang route being the same as the Dutch return route, the direct route from China goes through Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, India, North Africa, Europe to the Netherlands, and then to Scandinavia or the United Kingdom and the United States. The Dutch party agrees not to carry passengers and cargo between Hong Kong and Shanghai in either direction, on the condition that any third country other than the United Kingdom also does not carry them. Before the official signing of this agreement, air transport operations on the Nanyang air routes of both parties may be started first. (Draft of the China-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement.

### Housing Lease Ordinance Reduces Excessive Privileges

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, there was a severe housing shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai, and housing disputes occurred frequently. To this end, the Legislative Yuan specially drafted a Housing Lease Ordinance, which was revised and revised repeatedly, and after adopting the opinions of municipal public opinion organizations in Nanjing, Shanghai and other places, it was submitted to the Legislative Yuan plenary session on the 15th and has been passed, and is expected to be implemented soon. After this case was submitted on the 15th, Chen Guyuan, convener of the Civil Law Committee, explained the drafting process and the spirit of the law. According to reports: This case was submitted for the fourth time. Previously, it had been drafted several times based on the Nanjing Municipal Housing Lease Management Regulations and other regulations, and experts from the Shanghai Law Association were once convened to listen to their opinions. Later, the Nanjing and Shanghai municipal governments, local courts, chambers of commerce, and business federations all submitted opinions, and the Shanghai Municipal Senate also conducted detailed discussions. Therefore, this ordinance was formed by adopting the opinions of the public. Its spirit is mainly to formulate a fair and more feasible ordinance under the principles of impartiality and not being bound by facts, to protect tenants, support landlords, and eliminate second landlords. The legitimate interests of all three parties will be protected as much as possible, and all excessive privileges will be reduced as much as possible. According to the original proposal, a tenant who sublets a part of the house should first obtain the written consent of the landlord. Now it has been changed to "A tenant may not sublet the entire house to others. If the lease agreement contains provisions against subletting a part of the house, the written consent of the landlord should be obtained first, or the sublease agreement should be submitted to the landlord for signature." This is much fairer. Article 21 also stipulates that "Provincial and municipal governments may formulate supplementary measures to meet the needs and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval." With this provision, local courts can handle disputes based on the supplementary measures formulated by the local governments, unlike in the past when supplementary measures were only used for reference and had no legal binding force. In addition, this ordinance also contains reasonable provisions for the situation where a tenant sublets the entire house to others before the implementation of the ordinance.

Vandenberg was not aware of the details of the Marshall's $300 million aid to China plan. Vandenberg told reporters after listening to the temporary aid to Europe plan at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that it would be appropriate if China were included in this plan.

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] The Executive Yuan Information Bureau said that the government's attitude towards US Secretary of State Marshall's proposal for a $300 million loan to China has been fully revealed in the statement issued by Dong XianGuang on the 11th. When asked whether Sun Ke's remarks on the 14th reflected the government's views, the Information Bureau gave this reply.

### US Advisory Group to Take Over Infantry Division Training Center

The actual start date of the training has not yet been determined, but many infantry divisions have been transferred to Taiwan. This is the first batch of infantry trained by Americans since the end of the war. The Advisory Group's Public Relations Office gave the following written answer to reporters' questions:

"The US Military Advisory Group will take over the Infantry Division Training Center. This organization was originally affiliated with the Chinese Army Headquarters. The center has been established in Taiwan and is under the responsibility of General Sun Liren. The Advisory Group has never been involved. It is now preparing to assume this new task.

### Northern Voices

— Fang Kang

Today's China is riddled with sores, but without a doubt, "North China" is receiving the concern of the entire nation. In the recent month or two, due to the successive visits of President Chiang, President Zhang, and senior military and political officials for observation, this concern has become even more pronounced.

The reasons for the national concern for North China are easy to point out: first, this region was the first to fall and has suffered the longest; second, although Central and even Southern China may be preparing for battle, the smell of gunpowder is very faint or even undetectable, while North China is still experiencing fierce warfare; third, North China is afflicted by poverty and hardship, far behind Jiangzhe and even less developed than Hunan and Guangdong, which is even more heartbreaking during this cold winter; fourth, the current turmoil already has an international dimension, and even though North China is not a border region, it is closely linked to border regions, which cannot but cause national anxiety.

Based on the above five reasons, we, the people living in North China, should report the true situation and real needs of North China to the national readers and appeal to them.

The most urgent areas for improvement in North China today are politics and economy. Let us first talk about politics.

After the victory, there was an excellent phenomenon in the political situation of North China, namely, the absolute absence of localization and specialization. Indeed, the victory of the War of Resistance gave the central government an excellent opportunity to completely eliminate all residual special forces. North China was originally the Beijing area of the former Qing Dynasty, or adjacent to the capital region, and corrupt forces were deeply entrenched, spreading continuously from Yuan Shikai's ascension to the throne to Zhang Xun's restoration and even the era of the Beijing government. The victory of the War of Resistance was truly a once-in-a-millennium opportunity for purification, but more than two years have passed since the victory, and many aspects of the political situation in North China still need improvement.

Here, we would like to briefly point out two points:

First, the political problem in North China exists in both large cities and small counties.

Second, the urgent need in North China is "sufficient food."

Let's talk about the first point first. The first point should be discussed separately. For example, the "Pingjinji Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group," which is currently working hard, can only target larger cities, especially Tianjin and Beiping. The establishment of this temporary agency shows that there is a problem with the politics of North China; however, limited by funding, manpower, and the working period (scheduled to end at the end of this year), so far, the Tianjin Yishi Daily has had two very clever headlines about their news: one said they were preparing to fight a "small tiger," and the other said they caught a "small mouse." In smaller cities like Tangshan, the supervision group can only make a brief visit, so the people feel they don't have time to speak. However, whether in large cities or small cities, the political problem seems to only be "corruption" and the passive "mucking out," and we have not heard about how to actively strengthen administrative efficiency. Perhaps in certain areas, a certain mayor or a certain bureau chief is working hard, but given the importance of North China, if the efficiency of several administrative centers is not improved, even if corruption is completely eliminated, if there are no achievements in the active aspect, in today's time of war, I am afraid that not only will the chaos not be quelled, but it will expand the source of chaos and foster chaotic seedlings.

But since we are talking about suppressing chaos today, we should understand that the great chaos today is not in the cities, but in the countryside. Therefore, the only secret to saving North China, rescuing the people of North China, and competing with the Communist Party for the people is to improve the politics of each small county and below. This is something the central government cannot possibly take care of, it is also neglected by the provincial government, it is beyond the power of the "supervision group," and it is especially not considered by many military officers in the midst of military affairs, but as a result, some people in North China even sigh that it is better to live in the bandit areas. This is really heartbreaking!

Today, we have pointed out the symptoms, but we should also talk about the sources of the disease. The sources are often very complex. The bad habits left over from the enemy-puppet era are one; the propaganda of the Communist Party that undermines ethical morality is two; insufficient food and clothing and ignorance of propriety are three; for the sake of expediency, some local governments even use local bad elements, four; with these four reasons, ninety-five percent of the villages in North China are in dire straits. Once the sources of the disease are clear, we can prescribe the right medicine. We believe that for the first two sources of disease, we should actively establish a good atmosphere, especially starting from rectifying military discipline; special attention should be paid to the youth education in the recovered areas; political workers in the army should especially focus on the standards of character; the third point is especially urgent, and even if there is sufficient food and clothing, it can still be a source of chaos, and sometimes it may even be worse. As for the fourth point, it completely conforms to what the ancients said about "nurturing a hidden danger," and we must make up our minds to perform a surgical removal.

Now, let's talk about the point that I think is most important -- people's food. Let us not talk about the provinces that North China should include, nor let us talk about the vast rural areas, let us just take the two cities of Beiping and Tianjin as an example: the population totals more than 3.5 million people, and if each person needs 40 catties of grain per month, then each month requires about 70,000 tons of grain; if we calculate 200,000 troops nearby, they need about 4,000 tons per month. Such a huge figure is definitely not something that local production can keep up with, so in the past two months, newspapers in North China have been calling out loudly for "grain from the south to be transported north"; we have indeed heard the good news that a certain ship has carried many tons of flour, and we have personally seen huge trucks and cars full of flour on the streets of the ancient capital, speeding past, but in the past few days, grain prices have been soaring again; the reasons are numerous, in addition to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the Northeast was originally one of the main sources of grain in North China, and more coarse grains came from the Northeast, but the transportation station was destroyed and even completely impassable; moreover, this year the Northeast was flooded by the Liao River, causing disasters in more than 28.9 million mu of land and affecting as many as 15 or 6 million people, so the food supply in the Beiping and Tianjin area has also been greatly affected. The Kuomintang-controlled area does not have much farmland, and the Communist areas are tightening their blockade. Moreover, this year, because the rains were too late, the wheat harvest was reduced, and the yield in North China was sharply reduced; and one of the Communist Party's strategies is to seize grain when attacking and burn grain when retreating. With the above-mentioned causes, the severity of the food shortage in North China can be imagined.

The government cares about North China, and compatriots care about North China. When readers in Central China read my article, the people of North China have reached the point of being starved and cold. Officials or civilians who have been to North China for "sightseeing," do not be dazzled by the magnificence of the Six Nations Hotel in Beiping, do not dream of the beautiful scenery of Longevity Hill, you should know that in places beyond your sight, there are countless people struggling on the lifeline.

### Zhou Yide Strongly Urges Aid to China

(Continued from page one) When Zhou Yide appeared before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he said: A certain "red cell organization" in the U.S. State Department has always tried to obstruct assistance to the central government of China. "Under the guise of a non-intervention policy, we have intervened in the central government of China." He called for military and economic assistance to China and demanded that the United States immediately turn to what he called a century-old policy of U.S. aid to the Chinese government. He said: "We must win the ideological war in Asia, otherwise, we will also fail in Europe." These two continents cannot be separated in this respect. He said: The health of the Chinese people is currently very good due to the good harvest and the relief provided by the United Nations, but the economic situation is extremely bad, and inflation is "virtually out of control." He said: The Chinese people are indeed working hard to revitalize the country. He said: About 20 American writers and commentators have begun to spread comments at almost the same time, saying that the Chinese government is corrupt and incompetent. As for himself, he cannot clear the Chinese government of wrongdoing, but its shortcomings are overstated, and its strengths are overlooked. Zhou Yide said: The biggest and only mistake in the history of American diplomacy was to confuse the extremely important interests of the United States with China's internal rectification movement. The previous trip of Marshall to China for mediation was doomed to fail before he left the United States, because the order stipulated that the United States would provide aid to China after the Chinese government restored peace and order. He pointed out that this was tantamount to openly inviting the Communist Party to obstruct China's peace and order. Unless steps are taken to resolve the internal situation in China, the U.S. plan for the world will be doomed to fail, and this can only be achieved by providing military assistance to China in the form of military training and by providing China with material and economic assistance in the form of donations and supplies of necessities. He said: The stability of the entire Asia depends on the stability of China, because Korea is economically far worse than it was under Japanese occupation and is "undoubtedly" at the beck and call of Moscow.

### Ten Thousand People Enthusiastically Paraded at the Nanjing Conference to Suppress Chaos and Eliminate Traitors

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Capital's circles held a rally to suppress chaos and eliminate traitors at the National Assembly Hall Square at 9:00 a.m. today. More than 100 organizations, totaling 100,000 people, participated, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Dong Yuhua delivered an opening speech, briefly outlining the meaning of suppressing chaos and eliminating traitors, and said that the people of the capital should be a model for all parts of the country when supporting the government's mobilization to suppress chaos. Then, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, Mu Huaxuan, the cultural circles, Ren Zhuoxuan, the trade unions, Li Tingzhen, the farmers' associations, Jin Jiapei, the women's representatives, Ni Liang, and the student representatives, Shu Guangdi, delivered speeches, criticizing the communist bandits' actions of sending troops to create chaos, destroying national peace, and colluding with foreign forces. They hoped that the people of the capital would lead the people of the country to rise up together and participate in the work of suppressing chaos with action. Afterwards, the meeting passed a declaration, a telegram of respect to President Chiang, a telegram of condolences to the soldiers suppressing chaos, and a letter to the compatriots across the country. After the meeting, a parade was held, which was the most grand and enthusiastic since the restoration.

### Nantong Commodity Prices Fluctuate, Rice and Noodles Rise by 30%

[Our Nantong Dispatch on the 15th] From the afternoon of the 14th, commodity prices have been fluctuating constantly.

### Optimistic about the Future of Trade with the United States, Our Commercial Counselor in the United States Speaks

[Central News Agency, Washington Communication] In recent months, Chinese importers and exporters have felt difficulties in foreign trade. According to Mr. Liu Dajun, our commercial counselor in the United States, during the war, the U.S. government had strict controls over the production and distribution of various aspects of industry and commerce. At the same time, overseas commercial transportation was cut off, so the U.S. business community could not start trade with China. After the victory, the U.S. business community actively restored and engaged in import and export business. Especially in the past seven or eight months, many U.S. companies have asked our office to introduce Chinese businessmen so that they can discuss business. There are several cases of this every day. Although many of them want to sell goods to China, there are also many who want to purchase Chinese goods. In addition to tung oil, raw silk, tea, pig bristles, and other major Chinese export goods, they also want to purchase many other categories, even such things as bamboo mats, musk, and sand-woven gloves. Our office has introduced them according to the directory of Chinese business firms. At the same time, Chinese importers and exporters cannot directly introduce themselves to U.S. merchants. At present, China's export commodities often fail to meet U.S. standards and are rejected after being shipped to the United States. Chinese exporters should pay attention to this point. Although Chinese importers and exporters are temporarily experiencing difficulties, if they can strive for progress, the future is still very optimistic.

### Zhejiang Tea Production This Year Is Poor

### Various Customs Offices Seize Over 17,000 Cases of Smuggling

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Smuggling in South China and other coastal areas has long become a serious problem.

### Most of the Bandit Troubles in Guizhou Province Are Pacified

[Our Guilin Dispatch on the 15th] After several months of suppression, most of the bandit troubles in the province have been pacified. Currently, there are only more than 2,000 remaining bandits in Guixian, Wuyi, and Hengxian areas in the province, which need to be actively eliminated. The most urgently needed thing at present is the inconvenience of transportation. The monthly cost of transporting soldiers exceeds 1.5 billion yuan. In order to make up for this deficiency, the province has borrowed from merchants in major cities, obtaining a total of 25 billion yuan to be used as security expenses, hoping to pacify the bandit troubles in a short period of time.

(Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 7 of this Article, such operating permits shall be granted promptly.) Furthermore, such commencement shall be subject to the approval of the competent military authorities in areas of war or military occupation, or in areas affected by them.

### Dulles Clarifies U.S. Policy Towards Germany – Emphasizes Revival of Ruhr Region – No Agreement Yet on Agenda for Foreign Ministers’ Conference

[Our Dispatch] London, 15th (Broadcast): In today’s meeting of representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers, the Soviet representative insisted on exclusively discussing the German peace treaty, while the British, American, and French representatives advocated discussing the Austrian peace treaty first, resulting in a deadlock. If this deadlock cannot be broken, the procedural issue will be submitted to the Four Foreign Ministers for discussion themselves.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers have today agreed to include the modalities and scope of the temporary political organization of Germany, as well as the report of the Austrian Treaty Committee, on the agenda of the next Foreign Ministers’ Conference. The Foreign Ministers’ representatives also discussed the British Foreign Secretary Bevin’s suggestion to the other three Foreign Ministers that when a particular agenda item has obviously made no progress, it should not be continuously discussed. When the Foreign Ministers’ representatives discussed whether to include this suggestion on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers’ Conference, the Soviet representative Smirnov stated that the Foreign Ministers’ representatives could only discuss the agenda and had no right to propose procedural suggestions. Discussion ended without resolution due to his opposition.

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Dulles stated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that if Molotov continues to oppose the American proposal for a forty-year four-power treaty to prevent German re-aggression in the Foreign Ministers’ Conference, then Britain, America, and France should conclude such a treaty on a three-power basis. He also advocated implementing some outstanding form of international economic supervision in West Germany and stated that if the U.S. government trusts the growing economic unity of West Germany, it should start with the Ruhr region, as this is an extremely important area economically, and the U.S. government’s power can extend there. The U.S. is now in Germany, so the U.S. is not only an American power but also a West European power.

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] Republican foreign policy expert Dulles will accompany Secretary of State Marshall to London to attend the Four Foreign Ministers’ Conference as the chief Republican representative. The entire U.S. delegation will consist of about eighty people, including two experts on Soviet relations, namely State Department Counselor Bohlen and Marshall Plan Committee Chairman Kennan. Many of the expert advisors who participated in the previous Moscow Foreign Ministers’ Conference will also be traveling. Bohlen was the Russian interpreter for President Roosevelt when he met with Marshal Stalin and has participated in various international conferences on European peace treaties after the war. Other important U.S. personnel who will attend the London Foreign Ministers’ Conference include U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas, U.S. Military Governor of Germany General Clay, U.S. Representative to the Austrian Allied Council Keyes, and Flif and Tauky, who represent the United States at the Foreign Ministers’ Representatives Conference. The strength of the lineup is unprecedented at previous Foreign Ministers’ Conferences.

### UN General Assembly Passes Korean Independence Resolution – Establishes Nine-Nation Commission – Soviet Request for Troop Withdrawal Rejected

[Our Dispatch] New York, 15th (Broadcast): According to sources close to UN Secretary-General Lie, the staff members of the nine-nation commission dispatched to Korea by the United Nations will be led by Deputy Secretary-General Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese representative.

[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly today passed a resolution to establish a UN commission to oversee the completion of Korean independence by a vote of forty-three to zero. The three Nordic countries and three Arab countries abstained, and the six countries of the Soviet bloc refused to participate in the vote. The General Assembly also rejected the Soviet proposal calling for the simultaneous and complete withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from Korea by January of next year by a vote of thirty-four to seven. Fifteen countries abstained during the vote on this proposal, and only the six countries of the Soviet bloc and Egypt voted in favor.

The General Assembly also designated China, India, Chile, Australia, Canada, France, the Philippines, and El Salvador to form the commission. Ukraine is also a member of the commission, but its representative has declared its refusal to participate. The resolution passed by the General Assembly today also stipulates the procedure for Korean independence, including: holding elections no later than March 31st of next year; convening a National Assembly as soon as possible after the elections to organize a national government; the national government self-organizing a national army and disbanding all military units not belonging to the national army; and negotiating with the U.S. and Soviet occupying authorities to complete the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from Korea within ninety days after the establishment of the national government, as far as possible.

[United Press, Flushing, 14th] Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu stated in a speech at the General Assembly that China’s sole purpose is to assist in the unification and independence of Korea, as this would be sufficient to "remove all concerns of China in that region." China is also willing to sign any agreement to guarantee the territorial integrity of Korea, but this agreement has not yet been proposed because China believes that the UN Charter also has the same effect.

### South Korean Provisional Government – To Be Dissolved Upon Establishment of Unified Government

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 15th] The South Korean Provisional Government previously convened a political affairs conference to discuss countermeasures for the current situation and passed several important decisions. It held another provisional political affairs conference on the 12th of this month, revised the original plan, and submitted it to the U.S. Military Governor in Korea for review by the military commander, and then requested the U.S. State Department to ratify it. The most important amendment was to change Article 3 of Section 2 of the original plan to: "The Provisional Government shall transfer all political power to the fully unified Korean government immediately after its establishment."

[Associated Press, Seoul, 15th] The U.S. occupation authorities today announced that since the General Assembly has now passed a resolution to assist Korean independence and self-government, the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission and the Moscow Agreement have come to an end. However, since the Soviet Union has refused to participate in the exercise of its functions in Korea by the UN Supervisory Group, the U.S. military occupation zone in South Korea is bound to become another country, allowing North Korea to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence. When the UN Supervisory Group comes to work, the South Korean authorities will fully cooperate with it, but whether it will be able to enter North Korea is very doubtful. If South Korea holds elections alone, the right wing is bound to obtain an absolute majority. The number of pro-Communist factions is limited, and they may refuse to participate in the elections. Another group of observers believes that the Soviet Union may unexpectedly withdraw its troops suddenly, rendering the General Assembly’s resolution ineffective and forcing the U.S. military to withdraw as well. However, the Soviet Union has no guarantee that the North Korean Communist Party is strong enough to control all of Korea.

### General Assembly Discusses – Location of Next Session

### French Parliament Passes Bill – French Franc as Currency of Saar

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The French National Assembly today, after heated debate, passed a bill by a vote of 416 to 184, authorizing the government to use the French franc as the currency of the Saar region. Communist deputies voted against it. Some officials from the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine are deeply concerned about the inclusion of the Saar region into the French economic system, as it will have repercussions for these two adjacent provinces, and therefore abstained during the vote. During the debate, Communist deputy LeGras criticized the agreement reached by Britain, the United States, and France on the export of German coal, calling it a shameful act. Foreign Minister Bidault, greatly angered, rose to protest, declaring that he would not allow any deputy to call an agreement signed by the government and beneficial to the country shameful. When explaining the Saar issue, Bidault expressed the hope that, with the friendly cooperation of all the Allied nations, a unanimous agreement on the Saar could be reached at the London Foreign Ministers’ Conference. He also said that, in any case, the Saar issue would be resolved, and the use of the French franc in the Saar would not affect the international agreement on the distribution of Saar coal production.

### U.S. President's Temporary Foreign Aid Bill – Congress to Discuss as Priority – Taft Advocates Submission to Senate Within Ten Days

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 14th] Senator Taft declared that the temporary foreign aid bill should be discussed first at the special session of Congress. The bill should be prepared and submitted to the Senate by November 24th.

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] President Truman may submit a message to the special session of Congress next Monday, requesting authorization to aid other countries in preventing inflation as part of the U.S. overall plan for aid to Europe. White House experts are currently rushing to create an outline.

Dulles Opposes U.S. Loans to Britain

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Republican foreign policy expert Dulles presented his views to the Congressional Foreign Relations Committee, which is reviewing the foreign aid bill, expressing full support for the U.S.’s emergency aid plan for Europe and advocating the adoption of a practical and appropriate long-term plan for the revival of Europe. However, he cited the U.S. loan to Britain as an undesirable example, because "this loan to Britain creates nothing and solves nothing." Dulles believes that the U.S. should determine a clear policy path after completing its long-term plan. The U.S. does not favor the concept of a United States of Europe because this is a dictatorial approach, but the U.S. must declare the policies for which its aid plan is prepared. If any part of the aid plan has circumstances that prevent the implementation of that policy, that part of the plan may be suspended.

### U.S. Economic Recession Inevitable If No Foreign Loans – Observation by UN Neutral Economic Experts

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 14th] United Nations economists predicted on the 14th that the United States would experience an economic recession next year if it could not implement new foreign loans. This prediction was revealed in an 86-page report prepared by the UN neutral economic experts at the request of the UN Economic and Employment Commission on the issue of world inflation. The report emphasized that Europe's gold and dollar supply has practically dried up, and without new loans, it would be forced to stop buying American goods. If U.S. exports were to decline sharply, it would inevitably lead to unemployment in the U.S., which would then spread to Latin America.

### Communists Could Conquer All of Europe in Two Weeks – March Next Year Is the Most Dangerous Period

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Connecticut Republican Congressman Lodge told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that if the Soviet Union decides to abandon constitutional methods of forcing European countries into submission, it could conquer all of Europe, including Spain and Portugal, by force within two weeks.

Lodge said that, according to his observations in Italy this summer, he believes that the Communist Party has a three-step plan to conquer Europe: the first step is to use constitutional methods; the second step is to use force, as is currently happening in Marseille and Naples; and the third step is war. He believes that foreign aid is not enough to prevent the threat of the Communist Party seizing all of Europe, but it is a practical step to avoid this phenomenon. He predicted that the Communist Party would launch a coup in Italy in March of next year and launch a general strike in France. If the coup in Italy is successful, then Greece, the Middle East, and Turkey will all fall into the hands of the Communist Party. The Italian Communist Party is very powerful and can deal with the Italian police in three days. The most dangerous center in Italy is the industrial area in the Po River Valley in northern Italy, where the Communist Party’s power is extremely strong. Once Italy is lost, Greece will lose its lateral barrier and will also be doomed.

### National Assembly Election Mock Voting Held Yesterday, Order Not Yet Perfect, Improvements Needed, Estimated Voter Turnout for General Election Could Reach Over 60% of Voters

[Our Own Report] The election of National Assembly representatives in this city is about to be held, and the heads of the polling stations in the city's thirty-two districts have been appointed by the municipal government. The election office and the Bureau of Civil Affairs, in order to enable the responsible persons in each district to understand the election laws and procedures, specially convened the heads of the civil affairs sections of the district offices and the heads of the polling stations at 10:00 am yesterday morning in the Municipal Council Hall on the third floor to hold an election exercise meeting. Director Zhang Xiaosong gave a speech explaining the importance of this election in laying the foundation for democratic politics and warned the staff to take the matter seriously and prevent any malpractices. Then, Section Chief Chen Boliang and others explained the election laws in detail, answered various questions, and issued each person an election manual for reference.

### Joint Meeting Tomorrow Morning to Discuss Technical Issues

[Our Own Report] The city election office has decided to convene a joint meeting at 9:00 am tomorrow morning at the Municipal Council Hall. Chief Supervisor Zhang Xiaosong, all supervisors, and the district chiefs will attend. As the general election is approaching, various technical issues need to be resolved urgently.

In order for the staff to gain experience, the election office held a mock voting exercise at the Triangle Vegetable Market in Hongkou yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm. Chen Minshu, the section chief of the regional election section of the election office, served as the director and directed the process on site. Citizens participating in the voting were played by more than two hundred people, including the heads and staff of the election polling stations in each district. The Central Film Studio also sent staff to film the exercise. Voting began at 3:00 pm. Voters entered in a line from the entrance, obtained ballots at the ballot distribution points of each bao, then filled them out at the ballot writing points, and then walked to the ballot boxes to cast their votes. At the entrance, the implementation regulations of the recall in the voting rules were posted, stating that anyone who impersonates another person during voting, holds more than two voting rights registered, enters the venue with weapons, or engages in other improper conduct may be subject to recall.

Qian Dajun Receives the Most Votes

The venue also had a list of regional candidates for the National Assembly representatives, including two main sections: the list of party nominations and the list of legally registered candidates. The former had eight candidates, and the latter had a total of thirty-nine. The entire exercise was very fast and was completed in twenty minutes. The results of the exercise were as follows: Qian Dajun received the most votes, with thirty-six votes, followed by Fang Zhi with twenty-three votes, Qian Gongzhan with eighteen votes, Chen Guofu with ten votes, Du Yuesheng and Qian Xinzhi with five votes each, and the rest received two or three votes each. Afterwards, Section Chief Chen Minshu expressed the following review opinions to reporters: 1. The preparation for this exercise was insufficient. 2. Voters could not line up according to the order of the bao when entering the venue, which caused congestion. In the future, during the official voting, it is hoped that voters can line up according to the order of the bao in order to improve the situation.

Voters Should Enter in Single File

3. The police officers did not perform their duties diligently enough. It is hoped that they can perform their duties diligently during the general election voting, and those without voter certificates should absolutely not be allowed to enter the venue. 4. The ballot distributors of each bao must be responsible for verifying voter certificates, stamping them, and distributing ballots at the same time. If voters crowd forward, they will be too busy to cope. In the future, during the real voting, voters should enter in single file. 5. Voters should leave the venue immediately after voting, otherwise it will disrupt order. 6. No women participated in today's exercise. It is hoped that female compatriots will participate more in the official voting in the future.

High Voter Turnout Expected

As for the number of voters who may participate in this city, Section Chief Chen said, "When the city councilors were elected last year, the voting time was one day, and the number of voters was about one-third of the number of voters. This time, the general election voting time is set for three days. If voters are not enthusiastic on the first day, the candidates will definitely mobilize with all their strength to remedy the situation. I estimate that the number of voters will be more than 60% of the number of voters." Also, in the voting process, each bao has an average of 2,000 voters, and everything must be done within two days, so the issue of order is extremely important, which depends on the efforts of the security personnel.

### Council Appoints Supervisory Personnel

[Our Own Report] The supervisory personnel of the polling stations for regional and group constituencies of the National Assembly should be appointed by public opinion organs according to regulations.

### Speaker Visits Yangshupu District, Delivers Campaign Speech Expounding the Essentials of Constitutionalism

[Our Own Report] Municipal Council Speaker Pan, in order to understand the current living conditions of citizens in various districts of this city, started his second on-site visit to various districts yesterday. At 2:00 pm yesterday, he first visited Yangshupu District (i.e., the Twentieth District). The district has a total of twenty-one bao, and except for one bao that is far away on Fuxing Island, the speaker personally went to the other twenty bao. The heads of each bao made suggestions, requesting that they be forwarded to the municipal government to improve governance, and the speaker accepted them all and agreed to consider and forward them. Those that could not be presented verbally were instructed to provide them in writing. He then went to the newly completed district office in the district to give a campaign speech. More than a thousand people, including all the bao heads, jia heads, district representatives, and district residents of the Twentieth District, went to listen to the speech and felt excited.

The speaker delivered a speech explaining the significance of electing National Assembly representatives, proposing three points, stating: "On December 25th this year, the government will convene the National Assembly to implement the constitution. The people will be the masters of the country, and all officials and civil servants will become servants of the people. However, there should also be methods for the people to be masters. The first is to manage 'people' (including officials, civil servants, and people's representatives, etc.). The second is to manage the many laws and regulations of the country. With these two kinds of power, we are not afraid that the country will not be well managed. The power to manage people is the power to elect and recall. The power to manage laws is the power to initiate and refer. Currently, because the government is just beginning to implement constitutional government, we only need to exercise the right to vote. There are three points to report about this: First, the National Assembly representatives are directly elected by the people, starting on the 21st of this month and ending at noon on the 23rd. In another month, legislators will be elected. Anyone who is 20 years old or older, regardless of gender, has the right to cast a vote. The relationship between the elected representative and each person is very important, so please consider carefully. Second, I hope that the citizens of this district will not give up their right to vote. The gains and losses of managing the local and national affairs in the future depend on this one vote of yours. Third: This time, the central government has stipulated that there are ten regional representatives in Shanghai, of which two are nominated by the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party. I have been designated by the central government as one of the eight candidates for the Kuomintang. I was elected as a city councilor and was produced by Yangshupu District. Last time, I was not abandoned by you and was elected as a city councilor, and then I was elected as the speaker. In the past year or so, although I have not been able to make every thing successful, I believe that I have done my best to do it, and it has had some effect. If I can be elected as a National Assembly representative this time, I will still make suggestions to the central government on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, and always take care of the welfare of the citizens and try to alleviate their suffering. I will do my best to realize what the citizens of Yangshupu District hope for. Finally, as an aside, the winter relief fundraising has begun, and I hope that the citizens of Yangshupu District will help as much as they can within their ability. At the same time, there are also the most refugees in this district, and they are often frightened by the demolition of shantytowns. I have decided to discuss with the competent authorities to postpone the demolition in order to alleviate the difficulties of the people."

After the speaker's speech, District Chief Wang, Deputy Director Zhang, and Tao, the chairman of the District Representative Council, successively delivered speeches, elaborating on the speaker's past contributions and achievements to Yangshupu District, and expressing their support. Speaker Pan will visit the Hongkou District Office from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and the North Sichuan Road District Office from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm today.

Chen Guofu Gives Up National Assembly Election Campaign

Chen is a veteran of the party and the country, and he was previously unanimously supported by all circles in this city to run for the election. After learning the news that Chen had given up the election campaign, they were extremely admired for Chen's humility. The original letter from Chen to the City Party Department is recorded as follows: "Yun Qi: I, Guofu, have recently been ill and declare that I am giving up the election campaign for National Assembly representative. I respectfully hope that you will appreciate this and forward it to the central government. Yours sincerely, Chen Guofu, December 12th, to the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang."

### Fraudulent Marriage Case: Ju Guangzao's Initial Trial; Denies Abducting Gu Guohua's Wife, Claims Gold Loan Was Only as a Guarantor

[Our Newspaper] Ju Guangzao, who, under the guise of doing business, seduced women from good families and defrauded them of their property, was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for interfering with marriage and fraud. Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, the Second Criminal Court of the District Court, presided over by Judge Zhong, began the trial. Yang Dingxiuyun testified first: "Thirty-six years old, from Wuxi, residing at 521 Fuxing Middle Road, a friend of Liu Shen Liying for over ten years. I know Ju Guangzao through Liu's introduction. At the end of last year, Ju said he urgently needed 'funds' and was willing to use land deeds as collateral for a loan.

With me as guarantor,

I asked Chen Luzhangying to lend him fifty taels of pure gold. It was delivered to Ju on December 30th. Because Ju couldn't produce the land deeds, he mortgaged three and three-tenths mu of land on Haifang Road under my name. The intermediary was Liu Shen Liying, who stated that it would be returned in two months. After the due date, Ju delayed payment. In March of this year, I managed to scrape together twenty taels to repay part of Chen's loan. Ju's land deeds were given to me as collateral. Afterwards, I repeatedly asked him

to return the gold,

twenty taels. He always claimed he had no money. Until August, he suddenly said, 'My friend Hu Gujianyi has returned from Taiwan. Last time he asked me to borrow gold, now he has spoken to Mrs. Wei, the wife of Chairman Wei of Taiwan Province, and Mrs. Wei is willing to lend him three thousand US dollars to repay it, but she needs collateral. Please give me the land deeds you have so I can exchange them for US dollars.' I believed him without a doubt and returned the land deeds. Who knew that when he was on trial, Guangzao (reported by this newspaper)

would disappear,

and the US dollars have not been seen to this day." Following her, Shen Liying testified about the gold loan, which was the same as what Yang Dingxiuyun stated. Xu Zhaoqi, who knew the details of the loan, testified about what he saw regarding the loan, and said, "Ju Guangzao and Liu Shen Liying are cohabiting and have been for three years. Their second landlord also knows this." Furthermore, according to Gu Chengshi, the mother of Gu Guohua, Ju abducted her daughter-in-law Gu Su Tongjie and took away many gold ornaments. Finally, Ju Guangzao was brought in. Ju was quite tall, with a ruddy complexion, resembling a large merchant. He confessed, "I am from Fengxian, forty-three years old, and I don't know who Su Tongjie is. At the end of last year, I borrowed five gold bars from Yang Dingxiuyun on behalf of my friend Gu Jianyi. By April of this year,

I had returned two bars. The remaining three bars, along with the interest of one tael, five mace, and four fen, were deposited with the District Prosecutor's Office, totaling 15,139,200 yuan in national currency. Gu Jianyi is a real person and lives at the Maohe Rice Mill in Beiliuzao Town, Nanhui. Therefore, in this loan, I was only in the position of guarantor." At this point, the plaintiff Gu Guohua's lawyer presented a supplementary civil lawsuit for compensation, stating that the plaintiff and Su Tongjie were husband and wife. On March 19, 1944, Ju seduced the plaintiff's wife, absconded with her jewelry and cash, and lived with her as lovers. At that time, Su was seven months pregnant. Later she gave birth and named the child Da Liang, falsely claiming he was Ju's son. Now, he requests the court to grant a divorce and order him to compensate for the cost of the wedding banquet and mental distress, amounting to 300 million, and return the stolen property. Yang Dingxiuyun's lawyer also requested the court to order the recovery of thirty taels of pure gold and stated that Ju's statement that the gold bars were borrowed by Gu Jianyi was a blatant lie because they had sent a letter to the township head of Nanhui to investigate, and there was no such person as Gu Jianyi. At this point, the court ordered Ju Guangzao to post a 300 million yuan bail and adjourned the court, setting a date for a retrial.

### Misfortune of a Xiang Sheng Taxi Driver: Summoned to Drive, Robbed of Valuables

[Our Newspaper] At 10:55 PM the night before last, Xiang Sheng Taxi Company received a phone call from the Wuweizhai restaurant in the Great World amusement park, stating that a customer needed a taxi. The company dispatched driver Shen A'san in car number 20817. The customer was approximately 25 years old, wearing a black overcoat and a yellow uniform underneath, speaking with a local accent. After getting in the car, he immediately ordered the driver to go to Disiham Road, Tangen Road. Upon arriving at the destination, the customer suddenly pulled out a gun and asked if he had any cash on him. Shen was forced to hand over all the cash he had, amounting to 600,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, after receiving the money, the customer ordered Shen to drive to East Jiaxing Road. After crossing the bridge, he pointed the gun and forced Shen to stop the car, took off his watch, and ordered him to drive forward again. Upon reaching West Jiaxing Road, he stripped Shen of his woolen sweater and woolen vest. At this point, the customer wanted to force him out of the car. After Shen begged him to keep the car, the customer ordered him to drive to the intersection of Hong Kong Road and Huqiu Road, where he jumped out and fled with the stolen goods. The whole ordeal lasted about two hours. Afterwards, Shen reported the incident to the company, who then reported it to the North Sichuan Road Police Precinct, requesting an investigation.

### "Flying Thief" Discovered in Wuxi; Stealing Skills Resemble "Yanzi Li San" of Beiping; Surprised by Beauty in the Black Night, Slapped in Anger

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 14th Dispatch] Recently, several major theft cases have suddenly occurred in the urban and rural areas of this county. Their method of theft is to often use electric poles to climb onto roofs and can jump freely between high-rise buildings. Last time, the police patrol team discovered the traces of these criminals on the roof of a resident's house in Qianxixi. They were about to encircle and arrest them, but they disappeared in an instant. Their theft can be called a "flying thief," similar to "Yanzi Li San" of Beiping. They also carry short guns when stealing, threatening the victims. The house of Hua Yifeng in Yucaie Lane, Shilangzhong Lane in the city, was suddenly visited by a thief at around 12:00 AM on the 7th of this month. He climbed up the electric pole in front of the house, first onto the roof of the neighbor Liu's house, and then sneaked into Hua's house along the wall. He pried open the bedroom door of Hua Zibinglun and stole a new Western-style suit and two handbags. He then searched in the back room of Hua's mother, but Hua's mother discovered him and turned on the light. The thief suddenly took out a pistol, forbade her from making a sound, and forced her to tell him where the gold was hidden. Then he searched and stole at will. Before leaving, he even drank a cup of boiled water. Afterwards, the Hua family checked their losses, which amounted to about tens of millions of yuan. At around 1:00 AM on the 12th, the thief came again to the house of a Gu family at 15 HuaiShu Lane, Xinsheng Road. Then he sneaked into the house of Ni Li's family at No. 14. All the residents in that house were women. Li's eldest daughter, Yuehua, was a beautiful young woman. The thief was surprised by her beauty. He wanted to commit indecency. The woman woke up from a dream and shouted for help. The thief, in anger, slapped Yuehua twice in the face and then fled. After leaving, he went to the Western-style house of a Zhao family at No. 18 in the same lane and stole a large amount of cash and gold. The security authorities are now dispatching personnel to investigate and arrest these thieves.

### Zhejiang's Autumn Harvest After Drought

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 13th Dispatch] According to pre-war statistics, Zhejiang Province can produce more than 84 million dan of rice every year, ranking sixth among the provinces in the country. Jiangnan is currently in the autumn harvest, and we naturally have endless concerns about this year's harvest in the country's sixth largest granary.

Early Rice and Late Rice Zhejiang has early and late rice varieties, and between the early and late rice, there are also earlier dry rice and later late rice, which completely depend on the season and the land. In Jiangnan (commonly known as Zhejiang West), spring flowers must be planted in the fields in spring, and spring silkworms must be raised. It is not until the spring flowers are harvested and the spring silkworms have spun their cocoons, usually in April or May, that they cultivate and plant rice. In southern or central Zhejiang, they do not plant spring flowers, and some places do not raise silkworms, so they cultivate and sow seeds early in the spring. In the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, relying on the mountains on one side and the sea on the other, they can only cultivate with the help of heaven. Because there are terraced fields on the mountains, small rains cannot reach the plains, and the mountain streams are blocked by the terraced fields. The water in the sea is salty and cannot be used for rice cultivation. Therefore, only with continuous rain in the spring and summer can they obtain a full harvest.

Fuyang and Quzhou Receive 90% of the Harvest This year's weather in Zhejiang was very dry, but because of the above-mentioned reasons, there were both good harvests and poor harvests, and some harvests were not enough to pay the taxes. The banks of the Fuchun River, Guanzhou River, and Quzhou River, however, had a bumper harvest this year. In all counties of Tonglu, Guanzhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, Longyou, Tangxi, and Yunhe, the harvest was mostly above 90%. The reason is that in many of these counties, some do not plant spring flowers, some do not raise spring silkworms, and some rely on the irrigation of the Lan, Heng, and Fu three rivers. They had already harvested the dry rice during the dry midsummer.

Poor Harvest in Coastal Areas Coastal areas such as Zhenhai, Ningbo, Cixi, Dinghai, Wenling, Xiangshan, Leqing, Yuhuan, and Yongjia, although some do not plant spring flowers or raise spring silkworms, because of the relationship between the mountains and the sea, and because of the dry weather, there was no way to irrigate, so most of them had a poor harvest. A few days ago, a friend came from Xiangshan and said that some villages had almost no harvest at all. In such counties with poor harvests, it is of course difficult to pay taxes with the harvested grain. However, the townships and counties only know how to send telegrams saying that the drought is causing disasters, and they have not clearly investigated the specific facts and reported them. It is still necessary for the provincial level to send personnel to investigate, and then make a table to report it. As time drags on, this year's taxes will be due, and the tax reduction will be in the next year. How will this year's suffering be alleviated?

70% to 80% Harvest in the Jiahu Area This year, the Jiangnan area naturally also felt the drought, especially the Jiangnan farmers, who mostly plant spring flowers and raise spring silkworms. When they finish the above two tasks and go to cultivate rice fields, it is the time when the scorching sun is wreaking havoc and the rivers are drying up. Fortunately, there are many rivers and marshes in Jiangnan, and the farmers have done their best to rescue them. Many places have been saved. This year, the Jiahu area can harvest more than 70% and less than 80%. As for Hangzhou and Haining, they were originally very dry, but later, because the West Lake water was released, and the Qiantang River water was released before the Qiantang River tide, many were also saved. The reporter has roamed the great plains of Jiangnan and saw a look of joy on the faces of the farmers.

Ten Miles of Red Leaves in Haining When I went to Haining, I saw many farmers wearing some new clothes. Loads of white cotton were carried to the market, and fine nets of sugar cane were ready to be sold to fruit merchants. The temple on Xiaojian Mountain was thriving with incense. On the road, we could see groups of women, carrying incense baskets, wearing new clothes, and holding prayer beads, chanting with whispers. On the way to Haining, we saw red leaves on both sides of the road for ten miles, which was a spectacular sight. It is said that this year's cypress tree fruits are particularly good, so the red leaves are also particularly lush, which also proves a sign that Haining's rural areas are on the road to recovery.

Relying on Foreign Rice for Relief? I once asked the person in charge of the Zhejiang Provincial Land and Food Department how the harvest was this year. His answer was that it was probably 80% of last year's harvest. Obviously, this year is worse than last year.

Now, some people think: Anyway, foreign rice is coming, so it doesn't matter if our harvest is a little worse. I think this kind of dependence is not desirable. If we really rely on foreign rice for relief forever, we will not be a country. After this year's poor harvest, we should find a way to achieve a full harvest next year. How to achieve a full harvest? This requires the current government authorities and some agricultural experts to study a detailed plan. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### Investigation of Huizhou Lumber Merchants Tapping Resources for Railway Ties

[Our Tunxi, 13th dispatch] Southern Anhui's Xiuning and Wuyuan counties are mountainous with abundant forests. In the past two years, the fir wood from Jiangsu and Zhejiang ports has relied entirely on Huizhou for supply and sales. The number of pine trees in the producing areas suitable for railway ties is particularly large. Huizhou lumber merchants stationed in Tunxi, in order to develop local resources since the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is near the Xiuning lumber producing area, have sent Chen Maoqing and two others to the Xiuning and Wuyuan lumber producing areas to investigate the quantity of railway ties, so as to obtain accurate estimates, in order to negotiate with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway authorities to purchase them from Huizhou.

### With Wind but No Dance, the Entire Venue Loses its Color; The Drum Corps' Sound Becomes a Memory, an Extremely Cool Sight

[Our dispatch] In the university group 1,500-meter final, Wang Zhonglin of the Municipal Sports College ran first, but unfortunately collapsed after reaching the finish line. After emergency treatment, he continued to vomit clear water. According to the doctor, this was due to excessive exercise and the symptoms of cerebral congestion.

During the preliminary round of the girls' 80-meter hurdles, several hurdles on the track were kicked over and scattered. One athlete kicked over four hurdles in the short 80-meter distance. Later, exhausted, she simply stopped jumping, pushed the hurdles over with her hands, and crossed over them, successfully reaching the finish line.

Someone in the field discovered that there were not many participants in the public group competition and had the idea of ​​speculating. They discussed that if there was a public group event where everyone was absent, they would immediately register temporarily, even if they walked slowly on the track, they could reach the finish line and win the championship and runner-up with ease.

Starting yesterday, there was no more national gymnastics performance in the field. All that could be seen was the autumn wind sweeping the ground, and the sight was extremely cool, giving a sense of loneliness. Moreover, the sound of the drum corps outside the venue has become a memory, with only dozens of large flags from various schools whistling in the wind.

In the university men's javelin final, everyone's scores were initially very close and a stalemate ensued. In the end, Sun Huchao of the Municipal Sports College threw his arm out and broke through 41 meters, taking first place.

During the university 1,500-meter final, the most eye-catching athlete was John Peng Sanmao, who had blue eyes and blond hair, resembling a foreign athlete. However, his performance was mediocre, finishing second to last.

### Lianhua Team Wins 6-4 in a Close Match Against the Railway Team; Today's Second Match Against Qingbai

The Malayan Lianhua Football Team played its first match in Shanghai against the local Railway Team at Yiyuan Stadium at 3 PM yesterday. Approximately 7,000 people, who had heard of their fame, came to watch, and 2,956 tickets priced at 25,000 yuan and 117 tickets priced at 50,000 yuan were sold. The usually deserted Yiyuan Stadium felt quite lively. As a result of the match, the visiting team took the lead 3-0 in the first half. The Railway Team launched a fierce counterattack in the second half, scoring four goals. In the end, the Malayan Lianhua Team won 6-4 against the Railway Team. The starting lineups for both sides yesterday were as follows:

Lianhua: Zhu Zhicheng, Chen Jiawan, Yang Jiasong, Huang Guodong, Li Yiyao, Wu Jincheng, Ye Qingrong, Xie Wenliang, Xia Tixian, Hu Wenxiang, Mei Runhua. Railway: Liao Xiong, Yue Renxiao, Xu Yuan, Huang Chunlin, Wu Jiabang, Cao Liming, Xiao Ziwen, Wu Binghao, Zhang, Lu Qingxiang, Lin Dianyi.

The visiting team's second match in Shanghai will be against the Qingbai Team starting at 3 PM today. The venue is still Yiyuan Stadium, and tickets are still priced at 25,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan. Presale tickets will be available at the Gymnasium starting at 12:30 PM. The entrance and exit of the stadium will be the same as yesterday. After the Lianhua Team narrowly defeated the Railway Team 6-4 yesterday, their skilled ball skills were fully demonstrated. However, apart from the center defender Li Yi, who was the most outstanding, the two halfbacks of the entire team were more scattered, and the goalkeeper's technique was not fully demonstrated. The five forwards attacked in a "W" formation, using the two inside forwards to dribble the ball back and the two wingers to surround the attack, which was unmatched by the Shanghai teams. Their individual ball skills were generally characterized by abundant endurance as their only excellent performance. Meeting the Qingbai Team today in order to maintain the reputation of the expeditionary force, the distribution of the lineup was discussed and announced last night, deciding to field the same lineup as yesterday's match. It is predicted that after yesterday's match, they will have an even more outstanding performance.

The Qingbai Team was the champion of the previous Shanghai First Division League. Their generals are all top-notch players. However, the three knights, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, and Fei Chunhua, remained in Hong Kong. They were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai yesterday, but they did not arrive. It remains uncertain whether they will arrive today, making the selection of players for today's match quite difficult. Moreover, Yan Shixin was injured in Hong Kong on the way back from the Hualian Team's expedition to Nanyang and has not yet recovered. He will not be able to play today. After careful arrangements by captain Xu Wenkui yesterday, it was announced that in addition to the existing good players, young players from Qingbai will be mixed and matched, so the strength is also considered strong. When they meet the visiting team, in order to demonstrate the power of the Shanghai League champion, they will definitely have an enthusiastic performance. According to a notice from the Qingbai Team, the players are required to gather at the Paramount Hotel before 1:30 PM today so that they can depart together. The Qingbai Team's lineup for today's match is as follows:

Qingbai: Qin Bigao, Wu Kaimin, Wu Qixiang, Zhang Renyi, Qu Yong, Xie Qichuan, Xue Ran, Ha Zengming, Jin Sheng, Luo Shoufu, Li Yichen, Gao Xiuqing, Gu Yi, Jiang Ge Qing.

### Crackdown on Bounced Checks Has Achieved Considerable Results - Check Redemption Will Be Modified - Banks Will Select Customers Allowed to Redeem on the Same Day - The Ministry of Finance May Agree in Principle to This Recommendation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issue of cracking down on bounced checks, according to Director Li Lixia of the National Bank's Audit Department, the number of returned checks has decreased significantly recently. In the past, the amount of bounced checks often accounted for 5-6% of the total amount, but it has now been reduced to below 1%, which is a considerable achievement. It is impossible to completely eliminate bounced checks. The National Bank has drafted measures to crack down on bounced checks and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The content includes rectifying the existing customers of various banks, being particularly cautious when opening accounts, requiring introduction and guarantee by someone, and although the use of firm names or secret marks is still permitted, true names and detailed addresses must be retained for investigation. The reasons for bounced checks have also been clearly stipulated. For example, "contact with the drawer" etc. cannot be regarded as a reason to prevent banks from taking advantage of loopholes. At the same time, because same-day redemption of checks is not allowed, it conflicts with Shanghai customs and is indeed difficult in practice, which often leads to bounced checks. The National Bank has recently suggested to the Ministry of Finance a modified approach, whereby each bank will automatically select customers, some of whom will be allowed same-day redemption, and others who will be required to wait until the next day. Those allowed same-day redemption will have their customer list copied and stored in the Audit Department, and in the future, the bank will not be allowed to bounce checks of this type of customer on the same day on any pretext. Director Li also said that the Ministry of Finance is likely to agree to this recommendation in principle.

In the cotton yarn market, due to the excessive increase in prices the previous day, many speculators frequently sold. Furthermore, although the price allocation of the Textile Construction Company was increased, a large number of allocations were opened, and the capital of fellow traders was tight. Buyers were hesitant, and the market prices declined. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn returned to the 40 million yuan mark. The off-market price was shouting 39.5 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns also fell uniformly by 7-800,000 to more than 1 million yuan.

In the cotton cloth market, trading was slack when the market opened in the morning, and prices immediately declined sharply. After 9:30 AM, the inspection authorities arrived at the market to monitor, and people's hearts were even more panicked. Speculators competed to sell, and the market prices declined. By the end, various fine cloths such as 12-pound Longtou cloth fell by 23,000 to 45,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Serge and diagonal cloth had more supply than demand, and also fell by 15,000 to 45,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths were also more weak than firm.

Further News: The Textile Construction Company opened sales of cotton cloth as usual, totaling 38 types. The price of 20-count and 21-count unbranded fine cloth was 880,000 yuan, limited to cloth number applications. Blue Chicken B-brand fine cloth was 890,000 yuan, limited to dye factory applications, but there were very few applicants.

### Rice Prices Rise First and Then Fall Back - Oil Market Sees Mixed Ups and Downs

Yesterday, a total of more than 13,800 shi of rice and grains arrived in the northern and southern markets. Each item wanted to rise but lacked strength, and all showed a trend of rising first and then falling back. Indica rice and Japonica rice opened very strong, but weakened at noon. As a result, they rose slightly by 3-5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Bai Yinyuan rice still had little ups and downs.

The same was true for flour, which was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, rising by 3-4,000 yuan. However, sales at the close were still sluggish. Chongqing and Hankou flour continued to arrive in Shanghai, and the source from Changzhou and Wuxi was not weak. The supply source was everywhere, and the trend was mediocre.

Broad beans rose slightly by 3-5,000 yuan. Red sorghum sales were not smooth, falling by 3-5,000 yuan. Corn was moving but not prosperous in the north, and the market was bright but stagnant.

There were slight transactions from the Ningbo merchants, forming a situation where arrivals and sales were both enemies. The factory's supply source was abundant, and it did not rise.

### Adjustment Requested for Taiwan Sugar Allocation Price

### Many Opportunities to Develop Export Trade to the United States - Liu Dajun Talks About the United States' Need for Local Products - Export Goods Should Meet US Standards

[Our Newspaper's US Correspondent] In recent months, importers and exporters in our country have felt the difficulty of foreign trade. This reporter happened to be in Washington, D.C., and interviewed Mr. Liu Dajun, our country's commercial counselor stationed in the United States. According to him, during the war, the US government had strict controls over the production and distribution of all aspects of industry and commerce. At the same time, overseas commercial transportation was cut off, so the US business community could not start trade with China. After the victory, the US business community actively restored and engaged in import and export business. Especially in the recent seven or eight months, many US businesses have asked this office to introduce Chinese merchants to contact import business, and there must be several cases every day. Among them, although many want to sell goods to our country, there are also many who want to purchase goods from our country. The items they intend to purchase, in addition to tung oil, raw silk, tea, and hog bristles, which are the main export items of our country, also include many other miscellaneous items. Even items such as bamboo poles, musk, and yarn-woven gloves want to find ways to purchase from our country. This office all introduces them based on the directory of Chinese commercial firms. At the same time, when importers and exporters in our country cannot directly contact US businesses to engage in buying and selling, they also send letters to this office for introduction. However, currently, the export commodities of our country often have disputes after arriving in the United States because they do not meet US standards, and there are not a few examples of those who have suffered losses because of this. Regarding this point, exporters in our country should pay close attention to it. Although importers and exporters in our country temporarily feel difficulties at present, if they can seek progress, the future will still be optimistic.

### Unified Bonds Rise Slightly - Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise

Public bonds continued to rise slightly yesterday. Unified C bonds opened at 21,400 yuan in the morning, with a high price of 21,900 yuan and a low price of 20,800 yuan. Near noon, they were forced to close at a high price again, with only 4 million transactions.

### Major Players Frequently Cut Sales - Chinese Stocks Close at Low Prices

Yesterday, the general trend of Chinese stocks, Yongxing Spinning, was gone. Although there were struggles in the middle, the hearts of the people were completely lost, and it was difficult to last. It presented the highest opening and the lowest closing, and a big black line was the most tragic. The frequent sales of major players in the industry prevented the buying momentum of the young and strong factions and the Sichuan Road money changers from being effective. There were too many floating shorts, and there was a sign of disintegration near the close.

It was still stable at the earliest. Yongxing Spinning opened at a price of 308 yuan and 312 yuan, and then declined immediately, falling to an immediate delivery of 298 yuan and a forward delivery of 303 yuan. The off-market interest rate opened low to 1.5 jiao and 1.95 jiao. The capital was extremely rampant, and it was pulled up twice to an immediate delivery of 305 yuan and a forward delivery of 308 yuan. It was finally hindered by those who supplied it from time to time. Near noon, people's hearts were tired, and retail buyers were forced to sell due to time constraints. Yongxing Spinning fell to a low price of 296 yuan for immediate delivery and 300 yuan for forward delivery. Only Xinhua was still stable, Mei Ya fell less, and Zhabei was also peaceful. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Xinhua, Yonggong, Rongfeng, and Zhabei were still flat for immediate delivery stocks, China Cement rose slightly, Datong fell by 5%, and other stocks all suffered small setbacks. The prices of forward delivery stocks all fell slightly. Except for bank stocks, which rose by another 50% off-market, the rest saw both rises and falls.

### Capital Is Stable

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the capital market was quite stable. The Central Bank withdrew 15.8 billion, and the four banks and two bureaus withdrew a total of 1.8 billion.

The hidden interest rate remained at 1.8 jiao, and the interest rate on Chinese stocks was 1.95 jiao.

### Siamese Coup Affects Finance - Bangkok Great City Bank Goes Bankrupt

[Hong Kong Air Mail] According to visitors who just returned to Hong Kong from Siam, after the Siamese coup, the market did not fluctuate except for slight fluctuations in gold prices. However, on the day of the coup (9th), the new government authorities, touting the liquidation of "wealthy family capital" as a slogan, announced that all checks issued by overseas Chinese Chen Hanchu (also known as Nai Lei) and others were to be stopped. It was found that Mr. Chen was the manager of the Bangkok Great City Bank. Since the new government announced the suspension of check use, a run on the bank occurred on the same day (9th). Because the bank could still cope that day, it was able to get through safely. However, the run situation became more crowded the next day (10th), and the bank could not cope, and it went bankrupt. The Asian Bank had the same situation as the Great City Bank. Fortunately, the new government canceled the order prohibiting the use of checks signed by the ten people on the previous day (11th), and it did not go bankrupt.

### Goods Shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai - Presentation of Export Manifest

The Jianghai Customs recently issued an announcement stating: For goods shipped from Hong Kong to China from November 15th of this year, in addition to the ordinary import manifest or transit manifest, a copy of the export manifest certified by the Hong Kong authorities should be presented. If there are goods that are not listed on the export manifest, even if they are listed on the import manifest or transit manifest, they will be treated as "goods not listed on the manifest."

Paper Prices Are Stable

The paper market has stabilized since the Supervision Committee and the Guild thoroughly investigated hoarding. The Paper Industry Guild, in order to correct the tea house market transactions and prevent illegal colleagues from disrupting market prices, specifically stipulates that the purchase and sale of white paper in the market must be in accordance with the limited price of 850,000 yuan per ream, and must not exceed the limit. Therefore, after the tea house market was restored in the previous week, the prices of various papers were very stable.

Dark-Colored Woolen Fabrics Are Active

The woolen fabric market remained stable yesterday. In fact, the selling price could not fall, and the rise was weak. Both buyers and sellers had a take-it-or-leave-it attitude towards transactions. Except for those with real strength and those with sales needs, most of them held a more static than active attitude. However, dark-colored fancy wools, serge, and other trends are quite active.

### Commercial Brief News

Because the source of Jiangxi porcelain is scarce, the selling price has been adjusted again and again. Now, due to the difficulty of navigation on the Yangtze River, the selling price has been increased again.

Yesterday, the cigarette market was full of selling voices. Ten British and Old Knife brands plummeted by 600,000 to 300,000 compared with the previous day, and all other cigarettes also weakened. Only fifty canned cigarettes showed a unique rise of 3-4,000 yuan.

For daily necessities, soap, the gatekeepers were strong buyers, and the solid-based Arrow and Knife soaps rose by 5,000 yuan alone, while the rest weakened.

### Casual Chat on "Mr."

— Liu Yun

A few years ago, in a vocational school in western Hunan, there was a female worker named Yang Sao, who always omitted one word when addressing the teacher Zhou, directly calling him Zhou Xian(sheng). Hearing this was very harsh and felt disrespectful. Little did she know that the title of "Mr." could be referred to by just one character, as it has been since ancient times. Without reading more history and knowing more about past actions, it is truly impossible to know people and discuss the world, and it is inevitable to be criticized for being ignorant and making a mountain out of a molehill. According to Zhao Xian's Notes on the Twenty-Four Histories: "In ancient times, the word 'Mr.' could be referred to as 'Xian' or 'Sheng'. Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian - Biography of Chao Cuo: Cuo initially studied under Zhang Hui Xian. The History of the Han Dynasty says: He initially studied under Zhang Hui Sheng. One calls him 'Xian', one calls him 'Sheng'. Yan's commentary says: Both are 'Mr.'. Also, Biography of Chao Cuo: School Commandant Deng Gong and all the officials called him Deng Xian. Yan's commentary also said: Deng is 'Mr.'. Biography of Mai Yu: Yu asked for his bones due to old age. Emperor Yuan issued an edict saying: I, Sheng, have the integrity of Boyi and the straightness of Shiyu. Shi Gu's commentary says: 'Sheng' refers to 'Mr.'. Mei Fu wrote a letter saying: Uncle Sun Xian was not disloyal. Shi Gu also commented: 'Xian' refers to 'Guangsheng'. This shows that in ancient times, 'Mr.' could be referred to as 'Xian' or 'Sheng', and it was not necessary to use both characters."

Yang Sao is just a maidservant. She initially did not know that "Mr." could be referred to as "Xian" or "Sheng", but she happened to coincide with ancient customs. If we, who call ourselves scholars, rashly laugh at her, we will inevitably be laughed at by those who study ancient times and understand knowledge. When criticizing and judging, shouldn't we be cautious? However, "Mr." today cannot be referred to as "Xian" or "Sheng".

### The Wonderful Use of Facial Makeup

— Wang Pingling

According to theater critics, the wonderful use of facial makeup in old dramas lies in emphasizing the plot and expressing the characters' personalities. For example, a tiger is painted on the forehead of a brave general, a turtle is drawn on the nose of a clown, loyal ministers have red faces, treacherous officials have white faces, and the facial makeup of heroic outlaws is colorful. In this way, the audience can clearly see the loyalty, treachery, good, and evil of the characters in the play, which also facilitates the actors' expressions and makes the plot easier to deepen.

Another wonderful use of facial makeup is to let the actors know that when they are painting their faces in the dressing room, they are preparing to go on stage to perform. They should abandon their own personalities and adopt the personalities of the characters in the play. They should use the colors of red, yellow, blue, white, and black to conceal their true faces and fully express the plot of the drama. When performing, the brave general with a tiger painted on his face, in order to make the performance realistic, can fight and scold the colorful heroic outlaws, fighting to the death and turning the world upside down, fighting for three hundred rounds without a winner or loser. The charming and beautiful actress with a powdered face can flirt with the young master, hook the arms of the young playboy, and exchange glances in the back garden. The clown with a turtle painted on his nose, seeing this, can crawl back and forth between the actress's legs, sniffing to see what it smells like... Anyway, all of these actions are crystal clear in the minds of the actors and in the eyes of the audience: "We are acting, you are watching."

But when the play is over, or when this scene has come to an end, everyone wipes off their facial makeup and reveals their true faces, and walks off the stage peacefully. Everyone is originally a colleague in the same troupe. In a play, the protagonist is certainly important, but even those who wave flags and shout and play minor roles cannot be underestimated. Therefore, everyone can respect and value each other and maintain a friendly atmosphere. The red-faced and colorful-faced actors who were fighting and scolding on the stage just now are now still talking and laughing, and reconciling. Because the play is over, everyone has wiped off the colors on their faces and walked off the stage. Even the actress who was flirting with the young master on the stage has also wiped off the makeup on her face and acts as if nothing happened. She also has self-awareness, knowing that she was not showing off her charm just now, but expressing the plot in the drama.

Engaging in politics is also acting. The characters on the political stage are the same as the actors on the stage. To make politics good—that is, to make the play on the political stage look decent—when going on stage, one inevitably has to put on various facial makeup, such as tigers and turtles, to make the performance realistic, or to make a real performance appear fake. However, when getting off the stage and wiping off the tigers and turtles on their faces, they must respect and value each other, be peaceful, and maintain sincere friendship. If the actors on the stage do not recognize the difference between on stage and off stage, and always wear red, yellow, blue, white, and black facial makeup, whether on stage or off stage, and never wipe off the tigers and turtles on their faces, fighting on stage and fighting off stage, scolding on stage and scolding off stage, then they will never be able to coordinate, and regardless of whether the play is fake or real, they will never be able to perform well.

The characteristic of modern democratic politics is that, when going on stage, one can see from the facial makeup of each actor what party you belong to and what faction I belong to. When getting off stage, everyone can automatically wipe off the tigers and turtles on their faces, and everyone acknowledges that they are colleagues in the same troupe. The fighting and scolding on stage is not to fight for emotional reasons or to seize power, but to put on a good play and win the sympathy and support of the audience.

### Partridge Sky

— Hu Lu

The person in charge of the paper statistics office of the police station said: The number of suicide cases in Shanghai in October exceeded the record for each month of this year. Those who committed suicide by taking Lysol accounted for seven-tenths, and the Xiao Dan Gui case was the most sensational.

Suicides increase, Gui stands alone fragrant, taking Lysol to break the liver and intestines; the statistics are shocking, exceeding the previous month, all because people fear suffering!

Life is not easy, is death better? Ten Yama kings with ferocious faces! Pitiful ghosts in the City of the Wrongly Dead, weep and long for home every night on stage!

### Talking about Shuangqing

— Wu Jianming

Yesterday, I saw Mr. Baili's article "Superimposed Characters and Rambling Photography," in which he mentioned the rural woman Shuangqing, who filled "Remembering the Flute on Phoenix Terrace" with superimposed characters throughout the text, which was vivid and well-organized. It is a pity that her surname was not allowed to be mentioned. According to Shuangqing's surname is He, her given name is Qiubi, and she was a native of Danyang in the Qing Dynasty. She was intelligent and talented from a young age. During the Yongzheng period, she was the wife of a farmer named Zhou in Jinsha Xiaoshan. Unfortunately, she met an unvirtuous man, died with regret, and wrote "Poems and Lyrics of Xueya Pavilion." "Baiyuzhai Ci Hua" says: "Shuangqing had extraordinary talent and unparalleled beauty. She was a farmer's wife. Her mother-in-law was mean and her husband was violent. She died from overwork. She did not want to leave any ink marks in her lifetime's poems and lyrics. She always wrote with chalk on reed leaves, because chalk is easy to fall off and leaves are easy to rot." Huang Yunfu said, "Shuangqing's lyrics are like those of little children, murmuring and chattering, telling about everyday life, seeing and hearing, thinking and thinking, writing in detail, and being thorough in everything. The author does not consider it poetry, and the reader also considers it poetry, but the emotions are real and the intentions are sincere. Isn't this natural? Isn't this a miracle? However, the poverty she encountered was unprecedented among talented women in ancient times. Every time I recite it, I don't know where my tears come from." What I have seen also includes "Bo Xing," "Touching Fish," and "Regretting the Slow Pace of Yellow Flowers," all of which are sad and moving. She is truly a talented woman of her generation.

### Jottings by Lamplight: Liu Yuanchuan and His Retainers

— Feng Ren

"When Lin'an was about to fall, Wen Tianxiang said to his staff: 'The situation has come to this, what should we do?' A retainer said: 'A ball of blood.' Wen said: 'Why?' The retainer said: 'When you die, we will all die with you.' Wen smiled and said: 'Do you know Liu Yuanchuan of the past? He was intimate with a prostitute, and their love was deep. They expected to grow old together. The prostitute refused guests and devoted herself to Liu. Liu passed the imperial examination and was appointed an official. The prostitute wanted to go with him to take office, but Liu was worried about it. So he lied and said: 'I am willing to die with you and will never go alone.' Then he placed poison in wine and ordered the prostitute to drink it first. He drank half of it himself, but he didn't drink any more. The prostitute died, and Liu left alone. Today, are you all going to imitate Liu Yuanchuan?' The retainers all laughed loudly."

Although we did not see how Wen Tianxiang's staff laughed, that expression is not difficult to imagine. The master's smile and the guests' laughter formed a wonderful contrast, which contained a lot of human warmth! Unexpectedly, Wen Tianxiang would be so humorous, and a few jokes would hook out the hearts of his retainers. So, everyone "knew what was in each other's minds" and could only laugh it off and disperse. This laughter was like self-deprecation and like applause. The technique was good, but that awkwardness could not be concealed.

### Birds Flying in Water

— Lin Mei

All birds mostly fly in the sky. Only a few birds wade in the water, and some swim in the water. To find birds that can fly in the water, no one has ever seen them. However, there are many strange things in the world. Just as there is a kind of flying fish that can fly out of the water, it is only natural that birds flying in the sky can also fly in the water. This kind of bird that flies in the water is called a "river bird" because its nest is built behind waterfalls, so people don't easily see it, and thus don't know that there is a kind of bird that flies in the water.

The river bird's habitat is mostly near waterfalls. It uses moss to build a round nest, which is usually located behind the waterfall below the mountain rock. This place is inaccessible to ordinary birds. Its nest has a small opening on one side. When it flies back, it often passes through the waterfall.

The larvae flowing down in the rapid current are their food. Some of these larvae live under the rocks in the stream, and some rush along in the rapid water. River birds often dive into the water to find food. If they find a small worm rushing past in the rapid current, they will follow behind the worm, flapping their wings, and chase after it in the water. Their feet do not have webs like ducks, so they cannot swim in the water. They fly in the water just like they do in the air.

The world is so big, there are really all kinds of wonders. People who study zoology know that there are such birds, but after all, there are not many people who study zoology, so many people either don't believe it or feel strange about it.

### Leaders of Two Dynasties

— Wang Baili

After Qian Shouzhai married Liu Rushi, he loved her like a goddess. He built a separate mansion for her to live in, and named her room "I Heard," taking the meaning of "Thus Have I Heard" from the Diamond Sutra. One day, he took her to visit Tiger Hill. Muzhai was wearing a small-collared and large-sleeved garment. He met a scholar who bowed to him and asked what kind of clothing this was. Muzhai said, "The small collar is the official dress of the new dynasty, and the large sleeves are to show that I have not forgotten the previous dynasty." The scholar pretended to change his expression and said, "You serve the new dynasty, but you still do not forget the old country. Your intentions are good. You can truly be called a leader of two dynasties!" Muzhai was very embarrassed.

According to Qian Qianyi, as the Minister of Rites, in an emergency, he did not flee with Hongguang, but surrendered to the enemy in Nanjing together with Grand Scholar Wang Duo and Governor Yue Qijie. He served the enemy with a servile face. Even now, he still says that he has not forgotten the previous dynasty. He is shamelessly old and refuses to die. If history allows, he can be compared with Feng Dao, the veteran of five dynasties. However, although Feng Dao served nine emperors, judging from his claim that he was a "foolish old man with no virtue or talent" (according to Feng Dao served the Khitans and朝耶律德光.德光asked: "What kind of old man are you?" He replied: "An old man with no virtue or talent, a foolish old man."德光was happy and appointed him as Grand Tutor), he still had some self-awareness. Therefore, he just muddled along as an official and ate his meals throughout his life. He did not dare to show off. Compared to Qian Qianyi, who willingly served the enemy and still wanted to fish for fame and call himself refined, he was slightly better.

### Bernays Reveals: Secrets of the Big Four Diplomacy

— Shan

Also, judging from the official documents from Sato, the Japanese ambassador to Moscow, to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he was a pragmatic and capable diplomat. He informed the Japanese government that the documents he received were too vague in nature and that the Soviet government would not consider them. Assuming that they were only based on beautiful words and had no substance, they would not be persuaded. It would be futile to waste time trying to probe the Soviet government's intentions unless Japan was prepared to surrender. Since the Soviet Union insisted on the unconditional surrender of Germany in the past, she would of course comply with the unconditional surrender of Japan proposed by Britain and the United States. Sato said that he knew that his views were contrary to the emperor's wishes, but even if he "deserved to die ten thousand times," "I still want to save millions of lives that would die in vain." He further emphasized, "Japan has no other choice but to surrender unconditionally."

If the Japanese government could really listen to Sato's words and surrender unconditionally, it would not have been necessary to drop the atomic bomb. However, the warlords were still dreaming of peace negotiations and ignored Sato's faithful advice. On July 21, the Japanese government instructed its diplomatic representative in Moscow: "Under no circumstances can we accept unconditional surrender. Even if the war is prolonged and more blood is shed, under the enemy's demand for unconditional surrender, we will follow the emperor's orders and fight the enemy to the last soldier."

The Japanese government no longer contacted the Soviet Union through Switzerland or Sweden, but directly, in order to notify the Soviet Union that they were prepared to fully accept all of the Soviet Union's demands in the Far East. They hoped that by agreeing to the Soviet Union's demands, they could get help in the peace talks. They also hoped to use such discussions to find out whether the Soviet Union would participate in the war.

It was not until after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima that the Japanese cabinet decided to surrender. According to the records of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on August 10, the Soviet ambassador to Tokyo informed Tojo that the Soviet Union had signed the Potsdam Declaration and was at war with Japan. Tojo then gave the Soviet ambassador a copy of the document requesting that Switzerland forward it to the United States, stating that Japan was willing to accept the surrender except for maintaining the Japanese emperor's rule.

Japan's surrender was faster than we had expected, but we were prepared for it. The State Department, the Army, and the Navy jointly formed a committee to prepare for the general orders for handling the surrender and occupation. A thorny issue arose, which was who should accept Japan's surrender? The great powers all agreed that General MacArthur was qualified to represent them and the United States to accept the surrender. But the Navy objected to this. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal summarized their views as: the Navy was the backbone of the Pacific war, and the naval officers and soldiers had been fighting from Pearl Harbor to Tokyo, island by island; they had destroyed the Japanese Navy. Therefore, MacArthur could sign the surrender document for the United Nations, and Admiral Nimitz should sign on behalf of the United States. I agreed with Forrestal's theory that the Navy should also participate in the event and promised to find a way to do everything. That night, Forrestal suggested by telephone that the ceremony to accept Japan's surrender be held on the battleship "Missouri." I deeply understood that this was the Navy's so-called "Army trick." If he had just said "a battleship," there would have been more debate on the issue. But since he mentioned Missouri, I knew the matter was resolved. When the president received this suggestion, naturally, he thought it was the best idea. In this way, a matter of contention between the Army and the Navy was finally resolved smoothly!

### Surplus Military Rice to Aid Refugees

To whom it may concern: All the volunteer soldiers of our team have accumulated more than 500 catties of surplus military rice under the food allowance for more than a month in the team. After a full resolution, it was decided to transfer the donation to aid disaster victims in order to show our sympathy. In particular, we would like to ask your newspaper to transfer the donation to the refugee relief organization.

Coat to be Claimed Mr. Editor: I came to Shanghai from Beijing by express train on the 11th and arrived at the station at 4:30 in the afternoon. When I got off the train, I found a coat left in the carriage. I took it down, raised it high, and shouted all the way to the exit of the station, but no one came to claim it. So I took it back and temporarily stored it at Demin Yixiao Private School, Room 305, 3rd Floor, 209 Shandong Road. Please publish it in your newspaper and hope that the owner will come to claim it as soon as possible! The Teaching Affairs Office of Demin Yixiao Private School

### One of the Social Service Works of Zhongbao: Qingxia Relief Fund for the Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick

The 17th application deadline is the 17th - donations are welcome

Time flies so fast. The Qingxia Relief Fund has been around for 16 months from the beginning of July last year until now. In this year or so, we have issued 16 relief funds one after another. Assuming that each time we have helped 10 people, that is to say, we have helped 160 suffering compatriots.

Although our strength is so weak, we always want to use donations from all walks of life to give sympathy and comfort to poor compatriots who are suffering. At the same time, it can also make them feel that they have not been completely forgotten in this cold and ruthless society, which may make them feel the meaning of life again and encourage new courage. Thanks to the continuous donations from sponsors and sympathizers, our relief work can continue to continue, but because of currency changes and the increasing number of applicants, we have felt many difficulties. To overcome these difficulties, we need more support from enthusiastic sponsors and sympathizers.

It's getting cold, and suffering compatriots are eagerly waiting for help. Dear readers, please help as soon as possible (please send donations to the Social Service Department of Shenbao).

(The deadline for the 17th application is set for the 17th. From the 18th, the 18th application will begin. All poor compatriots can write an application letter, ask the head of the bao or jia to certify it, find a guarantor, and send it to this column for review. If they are qualified, they will be given appropriate assistance.)
