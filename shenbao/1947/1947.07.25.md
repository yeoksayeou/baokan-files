### Increasing Food Production and Controlling Finance: The National Economic Commission Approves Measures; Foreign Investment in China is Welcomed in Principle

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Regarding the attitude of our government towards foreign investment in China, this was one of the main topics at the ninth meeting of the National Economic Commission on the 24th. There was a detailed discussion on this matter at the meeting, and in principle, foreign investment was welcomed, and detailed decisions were made. The raising of this issue stemmed from the American business community's "inquiry regarding the industrial and financial policies of the Chinese government towards American investment in China." For this reason, our government convened relevant agencies for discussions. It is reported that the principles regarding industrial policy are as follows: (1) All industries, except those that should be operated by Chinese people as stipulated in Article 2 and Chinese laws, are welcomed for direct investment by American businesses. (2) The following industries should, in principle, be state-owned: A. Military industries, B. Businesses with monopolies, C. Iron industries with limited reserves and related to national defense. (3) All industries, except those stipulated in Article 2, can be operated separately by the government and the people. Current Chinese laws do not grant state-owned enterprises superior rights such as preferential access to foreign exchange purchases, raw material allocation, loans, and import permit quotas. (4) Businesses operated by the government, except those stipulated in Items A and part of Item B of the second article, can be jointly operated by government and businesses. All industries, except those stipulated as state-owned and those that Chinese laws require to be operated by Chinese people, are welcomed for foreign operation.

Regarding financial policies, it is reported that the general decisions are as follows: (1) The donations and taxes levied on foreign businesses operating in China will be the same as those for Chinese people. The Chinese government will not issue new tax regulations that would hinder the earning of reasonable profits. (2) Profits earned by American investments in industry in China can, in principle, be remitted back to the United States. During the current period of foreign exchange control in China, convenience will be provided in accordance with our country's foreign exchange management regulations. (3) Regarding foreign-owned enterprises operating in China, local governments will levy statutory local taxes and levies in the same way as for domestic nationals, and there will be no other special regulations that would hinder the sound foundation of the enterprise, either now or in the future. Another important issue discussed at the meeting was the draft plan for increasing food production submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The purpose of the plan is to achieve 100% food self-sufficiency within three years. The proposal was approved as originally drafted (the main points of the proposal were reported in this newspaper on the 19th), but with five attached review comments, hoping that the Ministry of Water Resources could allocate funds from the 36th Year Water Conservancy Production Fund. In addition, the urban economic control plan and implementation measures were also approved. The main contents of the plan are as follows: Food control will be temporarily handled according to the current implementation measures of the Ministry of Food. The scope of expanded distribution will be determined after relief food arrives. In addition, there are also regulations on cotton yarn control, fuel finance, and oil, salt, and sugar, etc. Today's meeting was chaired by Chen Lifu, and the participating committee members included Xu Kan, Wang Yunwu, Zhang Jia'ao, Wang Xiaoyu, Zuo Shunsheng, He Haoruo, Weng Wenhao, Chen Qitian, Xiao Zheng, Gu Zhenggang, and more than 20 others.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] When the National Economic Commission discussed the issue of foreign investment, the members debated fiercely regarding the point of whether profits earned by foreign investment in industry in China could be remitted. It is reported that it was decided that a portion could be remitted at discretion. The proposal, with the exception of this clause, was approved as originally drafted and sent to the Executive Yuan meeting. In addition, the debate over the issue of opening trade with Japan was also fierce at the meeting, and no conclusion was reached. It was decided to appoint Zhang Jia'ao, Pan Xulun, and others to form a small committee to review it again next Monday.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] It is reported that the government will issue a statement in the short term regarding the opening of trade with Japan, detailing the advantages and disadvantages of opening up.

However, Watson emphasized: "General Wedemeyer's first week in China is solely for contacting all parties to prepare for the investigation and research in the coming weeks."

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] It is reported that General Wedemeyer has been suffering from severe headaches since arriving in Nanjing, but he is continuing to work, only slightly reducing the scheduled work for today.

Famous Australian Reporter Reizert Arrives in Nanjing

[Our Report] Former American Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, Pauley, at the invitation of Life magazine, is traveling to the Far East and arrived at Jiangwan Airport at 2:11 PM yesterday on an American Air Transport Command plane. Pauley is temporarily staying at the residence of the American Consul General Davis.

Pauley was a famous American reporter in his early years and participated in the coverage of the Paris Peace Conference in 1918. During the Russian Revolution, Pauley was entrusted by the Allied countries to go to the Soviet Union in a private capacity to serve as an observer. At that time, the White Army was very powerful, and people from the Allied countries believed that the Communist Party would inevitably fail, but Pauley had a unique insight and believed that the revolution led by Lenin would eventually succeed. After President Roosevelt came to power, the United States and the Soviet Union resumed diplomatic relations, and Pauley was appointed as the ambassador to the Soviet Union. Because he had witnessed the Soviet revolution, he had a deep understanding of it and expressed sympathy for the Soviet Union's government and people. Pauley was transferred to France as ambassador before World War II and remained there until France was defeated. After this war, due to the Soviet Union's expansionist policy, Pauley's early sympathy for the Soviet Union greatly diminished. In his book "The Earth," he strongly advocated adopting a tough policy toward the Soviet Union.

### National Army North of Nanma Convenes; Remnant Bandits Flee in Four Directions; Luxi's Danxian, Jiaxiang, and Other Areas Recovered

[Special Dispatch from Yanzhou, This Newspaper, 24th] The entire situation in southwestern Shandong has changed significantly, and the National Army has achieved a decisive victory. Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's remnant forces have been fleeing in disarray in four directions for days. Among them, the remnants of the Seventh Column, which attacked the outer defenses of Yanzhou, split into several small groups and fled back to the Yishan mountain area, attempting to join the three columns originally based in the mountains to attack Nanma, a transportation hub in the mountains. Unexpectedly, on the 15th, they were again surrounded and attacked by two National Army forces advancing from Linqu in the south and Nanma in the east. By noon on the 24th, the bandits suffered more than 30,000 casualties and finally collapsed, fleeing towards Songshan and Lushan. Wang's troops, advancing south from Linqu, successfully converged with Wang Jingjiu's troops north of Nanma at Qiaotou. The remaining three columns of bandit troops, numbering approximately 30,000, who attacked Zouteng, broke through the National Army's encirclement at Phoenix Mountain (approximately 10 kilometers east of Zou County) on the evening of the 23rd and fled towards the area between Zaozhuang and Feixian. The National Army is continuing its pursuit and suppression. The remnants of the three columns of bandits who attacked the outskirts of Jining and Yanzhou have been surrounded by the National Army in areas north and east of Wenshang since the 23rd. Another part fled north through Dongping, and a major fire broke out in Dongping city on the night of the 22nd, with flames reaching the sky, and it did not extinguish overnight. As for the fourth route, Liu Bocheng's five columns, except for the First and Third Columns, which are still surrounded by the National Army at Yangshanj, and the Second and Sixth Columns, which are surrounded at Dayiji, attempting to break through and flee north, the Seventh Column on the 22nd fled to Jiekou, and since the night of the 23rd, part of it has already crossed the Yellow River and fled back towards Hanxian. According to a comprehensive assessment by a well-informed military observer, this major battle in southwestern Shandong, since Liu Bocheng's troops crossed the Bo River on June 30th and Chen's main force fled west, has lasted for more than three weeks. The concentration of forces on both sides, the breadth of the battlefield, the intensity of the fighting, and the duration are unprecedented since the outbreak of war in Shandong. Among them, the battles at Yangshanji, Jining, and Ten County were the fiercest. In the past three weeks, the total casualties of the bandits have exceeded at least 100,000, accounting for more than two-fifths of the total invading force. After suffering this heavy blow, the Communist bandits, in addition to crossing the Yellow River to the north and fleeing to Jiaodong in the east, will be powerless in the Shandong region south of the Jiaoji Railway and the Yellow River in the short term. Observing Chen Yi's recent frantic efforts to piece together ten independent brigades from various local teams in Jiaodong, attempting to make a comeback, one can imagine the scale of the loss of his troops.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 24th] The National Army crossing the Wen River is continuing to eliminate the remnants of Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi's forces, who are attempting to flee north. In the past two days, the Communist bandits have suffered losses of up to two regiments. After the National Army in Linqu and Nanma successfully converged, the gains from this sweep were also significant.

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 24th] In the great victory of the National Army in southwestern Shandong, it is reported that 5,000 local bandit troops from Zhangbaotun, about 30 kilometers north of Sangzidian on the north bank of the Yellow River, and 2,000 bandit troops from Pandian, Pingdong, attacked Qihe at 5 p.m. on the 23rd, attempting to cover the remnants of Liu Bocheng's bandits fleeing north across the Yellow River from the Luxi Kou area. The National Army repelled them by noon on the 24th.

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 24th] The remnants of the Communist bandits who broke through from the south and fled north have already reached the Yi area. Transportation between Linqu and Yishui has been restored, and the Yishu mountain area has now fully entered the pacification stage. The National Army in Luxi recovered Danxian at noon on the 23rd. The sieges of Jining, Yangshanji, and Wenshang were lifted simultaneously on the morning of the 23rd. Longguji was recovered at noon on the 24th. The National Army in Juye and Shan County has cut off the bandits' retreat and is advancing towards Shatuji and Li in the middle. In addition, the National Army advancing in two routes in Jining stationed in Xiang on the afternoon of the 24th, and another National Army force pressed the outskirts of Chengwu County.

### Rift Deepens Between the US and Soviet Union; The Soviet Union Proposes a Counterproposal on the Japanese Peace Treaty Issue; Proposal to Hold a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting First

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 24th] After the Soviet Union rejected the US invitation to a preliminary meeting on the Japanese peace treaty, our Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that our country does not intend to issue any statement at this time. However, regarding whether the meeting will be convened and the date of the meeting, informal discussions are underway in Washington.

[United Press, London, 23rd] Moscow broadcast on the 23rd that in response to the US note to the Soviet Union on July 11th, proposing to convene a preliminary meeting of eleven countries on August 19th to discuss the Japanese peace treaty, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has replied, pointing out that this action was a unilateral action by the United States because it was not approved by China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom.

The Soviet note suggested that the ambassadors of China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom to the United States, as well as the US authorities, determine a date that could be accepted by the governments concerned to convene a four-foreign-minister meeting to consider the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Japan.

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] It was learned today that after the United States and the Soviet Union once again disagreed on the issue of drafting a Japanese peace treaty, the few remaining signs of unity among the major powers are in danger of being destroyed, and the peace treaty work may be delayed indefinitely. Until this week, hopes were high that Washington and Moscow would find ways to draft a Japanese peace treaty to avoid various frictions that would hinder the European peace treaty, but the Soviet Union's rejection of the US proposal yesterday has greatly reduced, if not completely eliminated, that hope. Some officials believe that the main issue for the United States and the governments concerned with concluding a Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible is whether to proceed alone, ignoring the Soviet Union. This is a legal issue. As early as the United Nations Declaration in January 1942, when the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union declared war on the Axis powers, all countries would guarantee each other "never to conclude a separate armistice or peace treaty with the enemy." However, the Soviet Union did not declare war on Japan at that time, so the question is whether that guarantee has the legal capacity to bind the current situation. Although officials have not formally commented on the Soviet Union's condemnation of the US government for deliberately undermining the rules for drafting the peace treaty, they have directly rejected the Soviet Union's claim, believing that the procedures for the Japanese peace treaty work have never been stipulated, and that according to the Potsdam Agreement, the foreign ministers' meetings of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union do not have jurisdiction over the Japanese peace treaty. At the same time, Secretary of State Marshall declared to reporters: Regarding the Japanese peace treaty, the future position of the United States will depend on the Soviet Union's response and the replies of other countries.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th] There is no surprise here that the Soviet Union refused to participate in the eleven-nation Japanese peace conference on August 19th. However, the Japanese people's hopes for a smooth resolution of the peace treaty have inevitably been frustrated. MacArthur's headquarters and Allied diplomats unanimously agreed that the peace treaty negotiations should include all countries that contributed to the Pacific War.

### Japanese Reparations Goods; Ready for Packaging and Shipment; Now Mostly Concentrated in Tokyo and Yokohama

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] An official from the Allied General Headquarters told a reporter from the Central News Agency that some Japanese reparations goods are now ready, and packaging and shipment can begin as soon as the Allied General Headquarters approves. It is reported that among the machinery under the jurisdiction of the Allied General Headquarters in Tokyo that is reserved for reparations, 37% is still engaged in manufacturing items needed by the occupation forces or urgently needed by the Japanese people, such as fertilizers, mining machines, agricultural tools, and fishing boat engines. Factories manufacturing weapons are very few. This machinery is currently in the custody of the Japanese government. Allied General Headquarters officials said that the cost of this custody is very high, and they declined to estimate how long it would take to distribute Japanese reparations goods. (Note: When distributing reparations goods, the Japanese government is responsible for packaging, transporting, and pricing the machinery to the port of embarkation.) According to Allied General Headquarters officials, 30% of the workers responsible for custody are skilled workers, and their work is very good. Allied General Headquarters officials also said that incidents of concealing or transporting reparations goods have rarely occurred. All Japanese equipment hidden in various places at the end of the war has been found and is now under guard. Goods for reparations are now mostly concentrated in Tokyo and Yokohama.

### Ambassador Wu Zexiang Talks About Sino-Chilean Friendly Relations

Overseas Chinese Receive the Best Treatment in Chile

[City News] My country's Ambassador to Chile, Mr. Wu Zexiang, recently told reporters that among the countries in the Americas, Chile is one of the countries that treats our overseas Chinese the most favorably. The rights enjoyed by overseas Chinese are exactly the same as those of the people of that country. Regarding the Sino-Chilean Treaty of Friendship and Commerce, it is currently under negotiation and is expected to be signed and established soon. Mr. Wu said: The trade between China and Chile in the past was only two to three hundred thousand US dollars per year. This year, my country's imports from Chile alone have reached four million US dollars. This amount is the price of 90,000 tons of nitrate and some tons of copper purchased by our government from Chile. As for the goods that Chile needs from our country, they are soybeans, peanuts, silk, tea, tung oil, etc. However, it is currently difficult for our country to supply them, which depends on the efforts of all parties. Mr. Wu will leave Shanghai in a week to return to his post.

### Shanxi Drought is Severe; The Assembly Requests Urgent Disaster Relief from the Central Government

[Special Dispatch from Taiyuan, 23rd] The drought in Shanxi is severe, and people are worried and fearful. There was little snow last winter, and only about two inches of rain fell this spring and summer. The two wheat harvests were halved. More wheat was planted in the south of the province, and the lives of the people in the north of the province depend entirely on the autumn harvest. Some of the planted seeds have not sprouted, and many have not been able to plant due to the dry land. Therefore, there is still a lot of barren land. There is a saying in the countryside: "Wheat in the first ten days of the hottest period of the year and vegetables in the second." There are high hopes for sorghum seedlings. It is now the twentieth day and there is no hope for planting the nineteen types of wheat. Most of the sorghum is less than a foot tall. Under the scorching sun, there is a tendency to wither.

Request to Postpone Public Trial Granted

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] After the case of traitor Rugeng was remanded for retrial, the Capital High Court interrogated him again at 10:00 AM on the 24th. Presiding Judge Jin Shiding questioned him one by one about his despicable actions during the period of the puppet organization in eastern Hebei and his participation in the Wang Jingwei puppet regime. Yin Ni argued glibly, claiming that he was ordered by General Song Zheyuan to buffer the situation in North China, or that he was forced to do so against his will. He vehemently denied the point in his book "Outline of Governance and Strategy for Harnessing the Yellow River," which stated that "harnessing the Yellow River and managing transportation are to assist a Greater East Asia War." When the court announced that a public trial with debate would be held on the 25th, Yin Ni firmly requested to wait for another favorable piece of evidence (sent by an old monk from Peiping, proving that he had not committed any treasonous acts during his participation in the Wang Jingwei regime from the end of July 1937 to 1943) before holding the public trial. The court approved the request, announced a postponement for further review, and Yin Ni was returned to custody.

### Editorial: Commentary on the Soviet Counterproposal

In order to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, the United States proposed to the relevant countries in the Far East to convene a preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty on August 19. The governments of eleven countries, including China, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, have received invitations from the U.S. government. The United Kingdom, in addition to advocating for a change of date, also requested the expansion of the scope of the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty. Although there are no problems in principle for China and France, they have not yet formally submitted replies to the U.S. As of now, the attitude of the Soviet Union remains the most concerned by general observers. Now, the Soviet Union's reply has finally been announced to the world by the Moscow Radio Station. In addition to formally rejecting the U.S. proposal, the Soviet Union has also put forward a counterproposal, advocating that a meeting of the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union should be convened first to draft the peace treaty with Japan, and then submit the draft peace treaty to the Far Eastern Commission for discussion. The date of the foreign ministers' meeting will be determined by the U.S. authorities in consultation with the ambassadors of China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.

Although the U.S. proposal and the Soviet counterproposal run counter to each other, after objective research, we find that the fundamental differences between the two countries lie only in two points: (1) The intention of the U.S. in initiating the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty is to hold a meeting outside the scope of the Far Eastern Commission. Any resolution can be passed as long as it obtains a two-thirds majority, thereby avoiding the Soviet Union's exercise of veto power. However, the Soviet Union insists that the preliminary conference should be held within the scope of the Far Eastern Commission, thereby preserving its prerogative to exercise veto power. (2) The U.S. hopes that all the relevant countries in the Far East, regardless of their size or strength, can jointly participate in the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan. However, the Soviet Union argues that the four major powers, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, should hold a foreign ministers' meeting first, after consulting with the smaller countries, to draft the peace treaty, and then submit it to the Far Eastern Commission for discussion, which is exactly the same procedure as the drafting of the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Finland.

Standing from a third-party perspective, we believe that the differences between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are not worth emphasizing. As long as both the U.S. and the Soviet Union have the sincerity to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, no matter what method or procedure is adopted, there is no problem, and all roads can lead to Rome. For example, the Soviet Union advocates that the foreign ministers of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union should hold a meeting first to draft the peace treaty with Japan, and then submit it to the Far Eastern Commission for deliberation. On the surface, the Soviet Union's counterproposal is not only well-founded, but also based on legal principles. In addition, the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland can be cited as precedents. However, from another perspective, the Soviet Union also seems to be too拘泥 to international treaties. We must point out that the Potsdam Declaration only stipulated that the peace treaties with Germany, Italy, Austria, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland should be drafted by the Council of Foreign Ministers. However, there are no explicit mandatory provisions for the peace treaty with Japan. Therefore, the Soviet Union's request to convene a foreign ministers' meeting first to draft the peace treaty with Japan cannot be considered to have a basis in international treaties. As for the Far Eastern Commission, it was established in accordance with the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference Declaration of December 1945. However, after reviewing the full text of the declaration, we did not find any provision that the Far Eastern Commission is responsible for drafting peace treaties. Therefore, the Soviet Union's insistence that the preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan must be held within the scope of the Far Eastern Commission cannot be considered to have a sufficient reason.

If we further review the work of the Far Eastern Commission for the past year and six months since its establishment, we cannot help but point out that the achievements of the Far Eastern Commission are very disappointing. Apart from formulating a basic policy towards Japan, there have been no great achievements. Especially because China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union have the prerogative to exercise veto power in the Far Eastern Commission, every issue often cannot obtain a reasonable solution as long as one of the four countries expresses dissent, threatening to exercise veto power. The delay of the Japanese issue to this day and the failure of the Far Eastern Commission to carry out its work smoothly, the veto power is indeed a major obstacle. The U.S. State Department, seeing the difficulty in concluding peace treaties with Germany and Austria, and in order to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, decided to seek another path, convening a preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan outside the scope of the Far Eastern Commission. Therefore, no matter from which angle we observe, the U.S.'s motive for proposing to convene a preliminary conference is not without considerable reason. Especially for us in China, who urgently want the issue of Japanese reparations to be resolved as soon as possible, as long as it is conducive to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, we are, in principle, in favor of it, regardless of the method. Moreover, the U.S. government has been considering this proposal for a long time. According to reports from various news agencies, Secretary of State Marshall began to consider the method of drafting the peace treaty with Japan after returning from Moscow. General MacArthur in Tokyo has also repeatedly requested the Allied countries to speed up the work of concluding a peace treaty with Japan. Therefore, the presentation of this proposal should be the result of careful deliberation by the U.S. State Department.

The relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union after the war has not only been deteriorating, but also running in opposite directions, moving further and further apart. Whether it is on the secret of atomic energy or on the issue of veto power in international organizations, the U.S. and the Soviet Union often go to extremes, and disputes cannot be settled. Because of the inability of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement, there is no hope of concluding peace treaties with Germany and Austria for a while. The entire Europe is split under the opposition of the "Marshall Plan" and the "Molotov Plan." Now, the U.S. wants to solve the Far East problem first, to conclude a peace treaty with Japan before Germany, but it is again blocked by the issue of veto power, resulting in a stalemate that cannot be broken. If this tragic trend is not reversed as soon as possible, it will only benefit the defeated countries. We have already seen the grinning faces of the defeated countries, and they are already ready to move again. The separation of the U.S. and the Soviet Union after the war, in Europe, has made the traces of division more and more obvious; in the Far East, it will also create a tragic situation. Therefore, facing the crisis in the Far East, we have to appeal to the politicians and diplomats of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, please use political wisdom to break the current stalemate in the Far East, so as to establish a long-term plan for peace in the Far East; otherwise, the Far East will become the powder keg of the Third World War, and it is very likely to become a source of disaster for all mankind again. Therefore, we hope that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will not haggle over the procedures for drafting the peace treaty with Japan, but will broaden their horizons, prevent problems before they happen, and first eliminate the latent crisis in the Far East!

### Dutch Prime Minister Formally States: No Acceptance of International Mediation; Dutch Troops Launch Fierce Attacks, Unstoppable

[Reuters, The Hague, 24th] Dutch Prime Minister Beel told the Parliament that the Indonesian conflict is entirely an internal affair of the Netherlands, and the sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies belongs to the Netherlands. The Dutch government is not prepared to accept international mediation of the internal conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia. He believes that military action will soon be concluded. It is regrettable that Britain and the United States have some misunderstandings about the Netherlands' actions. However, the Netherlands has decided to continue its actions based on its own policy.

[Reuters, Batavia, 24th] Only three days after the Dutch army launched its offensive, neutral observers have already acknowledged that the military defeat of Indonesia is only a matter of a week.

[Reuters, Palembang, Sumatra, 24th] The Deputy Governor of South Sumatra, Isa, announced today that he is willing to cooperate with the Dutch. After meeting with other Republican leaders in Sumatra, Isa was allowed to continue his duties, with the welfare of the people as the premise, pending orders from the Javanese Indonesian government.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Diplomatic observers believe that after Foreign Secretary Bevin clarified his attitude towards the Indonesian situation in the House of Commons, the hope for early mediation of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute by a third party has become increasingly dim. A report from Washington states that authorities in Washington expect the war in Indonesia may continue for several weeks. Only after the Dutch army occupies major cities and the Republican army withdraws to rural areas will a third party have an opportunity to intervene and mediate.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Foreign Secretary Bevin said in the House of Commons today, "I was very sorry to learn that the Dutch government had decided to use force." Bevin stated that he is carefully considering whether to bring the matter to the United Nations, because some of the recent issues handled by the Security Council have failed to achieve a peaceful resolution, but have instead caused various difficulties. Therefore, although Britain has not decided not to appeal to the Security Council, it has to be guided by past experiences. Bevin said that Sjahrir is no longer the Prime Minister of Indonesia, and there is not much point in meeting with him. The British government is currently studying other more appropriate methods, so it is not convenient at this stage to announce what kind of decision the British government will take.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 24th] Lieutenant General Spoor, Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch East Indies Army, announced at a press conference on the 24th that the port of Cirebon in northern Java had been recaptured by the Dutch army on the 23rd. The port's facilities were intact and undamaged, and had not been destroyed by the Indonesian army. Eastern Java has been completely occupied by the Dutch army. However, he declined to comment on the situation in central and western Java.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 24th] The Indonesian Gazette reported that, according to unconfirmed reports, the Dutch army has occupied Malang, where Indonesia's huge airfield is located. However, the Indonesian army has retaken Lawang, the corridor on the Surabaya-Malang road, completely cutting off the Dutch army in Surabaya and Malang.

[United Press, Batavia, 24th] Indonesia is implementing a systematic scorched-earth policy today, setting fire to 400 cities and towns. Salatiga, an important target south of Semarang, was set on fire by the Indonesian army when the Dutch army entered. Lawang, 12 miles north of Malang in east-central Java, Sumedang, 20 miles east of Bandung in western Java, and West Sarunka were also set on fire by the retreating Indonesian army. According to an official Dutch telegram from Sumatra, the Indonesian People's Army burned down more than 100 houses when they withdrew from Anximia, south of Medan.

### Our Country Submits Memorandum to the Netherlands, Urges Protection of Overseas Chinese Safety

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] Foreign Minister Wang specially met with the Dutch Chargé d'Affaires in China, Yang Sushan, on the morning of the 24th to deliver a memorandum on the protection of overseas Chinese. In addition to expressing regret over the Dutch-Indonesian war, he seriously requested the Dutch government to take practical measures to protect the safety of the lives and property of our overseas Chinese, so as to prevent Chinese from suffering losses.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] Our government is extremely concerned about the situation in Indonesia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Chiang Chia-tung, the Consul General stationed in Batavia, to do his best to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute, so as to avoid the outbreak of war. However, due to the wide divergence of opinions between the two sides, conflict finally broke out on July 21. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Consul General Chiang again, instructing him to continue his efforts on the ground to prevent the situation from deteriorating, so as to maintain the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese.

### Overseas Chinese in Sukabumi Robbed

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 23rd] Our Consul General in Batavia, Chiang Chia-tung, is scheduled to go to Karawang, 80 kilometers from Batavia, which has just been occupied by the Dutch army, accompanied by the Secretary-General of the Chinese General Association.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 23rd] It is reported that, due to the scorched-earth policy implemented by the Indonesian army, more than 3,000 overseas Chinese in Sukabumi, which has just been occupied by the Dutch army, have lost their homes, but fortunately there have been no deaths or injuries.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th] The Chinese Consulate General has received reports that the property of overseas Chinese in Cibadak, 12 kilometers west of Sukabumi, has been subjected to large-scale robbery and arson by Indonesians. Deputy Consul Niu Shulin has gone to the area to handle post-disaster relief.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 23rd] The Indonesian soldiers in Ambarawa and Salatiga in central Java have been extremely hostile to overseas Chinese since the Japanese surrender. In Salatiga, the daughter of a wealthy overseas Chinese was forced to marry an Indonesian military officer. Another overseas Chinese was expelled from his home for refusing such a request.

### Marshall Explains the Source of U.S. Equipment for the Dutch Army

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Regarding the Indonesian issue, Marshall explained that the first regiment of the Dutch Navy, including 4,800 soldiers trained in the U.S., were originally trained for the war against Japan. He explained that some of the arms were left in the East Indies by the British, and the U.S. could not recover these weapons, or the U.S. considered them unusable. He mentioned 54 B-25 bombers, 38 P-51 fighters, 26 P-40 fighters, 159 machine guns, and some hand grenades and firearms, most of which may no longer be usable. Since the victory over Japan, the U.S. has not allowed weapons to be imported from the U.S. into Indonesia, and does not allow U.S. ships to provide transportation for this purpose. Marshall believes that all Japanese people have now left Java.

### Marshall's Advisory Group Suggests the U.S. Mediate the Dutch-Indonesian War

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] Several of Secretary of State Marshall's advisors are urging him to ask the U.S. to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian "war" because it is a threat to world economic recovery. This proposal would indirectly link the Indonesian situation to the Marshall Plan. The advisors have not yet agreed on what kind of proposal to submit to Secretary Marshall. Advisors who deal with Europe tend to sympathize with the Netherlands, while advisors who handle Far East affairs have less sympathy for the Netherlands.

### U.S. Congress to Convene Special Session This Autumn

[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 24th Broadcast: Republican Senator Taft announced today that, given the increasingly tense international situation, the U.S. Congress will convene a special session this autumn. However, Taft declined to comment on the current international situation.

### Ma Marshall Discusses Diplomatic Issues, Still Hopes for Soviet Participation in Four-Power Treaty Against German Aggression

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] Secretary of State Marshall discussed the following matters at a press conference today: Regarding the forty-year treaty proposed by the United States to prevent German re-aggression, Marshall said that the US proposal is still "open." He feels that Soviet participation is necessary to complete this agreement.

Marshall denied that the United States had re-proposed the matter to France when it protested the Anglo-American plan to raise Germany's industrial level. Marshall declined to comment on whether an agreement had been reached with France regarding German production. He also declined to comment on reports that Britain and the United States had temporarily agreed not to discuss Germany's industrial level. He also denied that France would participate in the Anglo-American Ruhr coal negotiations in Washington, and said he did not know when these negotiations would be held. Regarding Anglo-American trade, Marshall stated that the US government had not yet finally agreed that Article 9 of the Anglo-American Loan Agreement, which prohibits discrimination against American merchants, should not apply to trade with non-self-governing areas of the British Empire. Some points of this matter are still under consideration, and no final decision has been made. Regarding Greece, Marshall said that the State Department was unable to confirm or deny reports of an "international legion" participating in the Greek war.

Marshall Writes to French Foreign Minister Bidault

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Regarding the Anglo-American meeting to discuss revising Germany's industrial level, sources say that French Foreign Minister Bidault received a letter from Secretary of State Marshall today, stating that the United States had agreed to postpone discussion of Germany's industrial level. It said that the US government had considered France's views and would now postpone the meeting with the UK to allow the French government sufficient time to discuss various issues with the British and American governments.

[Reuters, La Muette near Paris, 23rd] The French cabinet decided today at the President's summer residence that the French government should inform the British and American governments that France's opinion must be sought before making any decisions to change Germany's industrial production levels. France cannot face a fait accompli regarding the German economy.

### Senate Appropriations Committee Approves US Aid to Greece and Turkey Loans, Supplies to the Soviet Union Rejected

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] The US Senate Appropriations Committee today approved a $400 million loan to Greece and Turkey, as the House Appropriations Committee had already passed this loan.

In addition, the Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the US government's request for $17 million to ship supplies to the Soviet Union. Regarding expenses for the US-occupied territories in Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea, $625 million was allocated, plus $100 million to be used to purchase goods in these occupied territories.

US State Department Decides to No Longer Aid Poland

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] The State Department announced that Poland would not benefit from the recent Congressional appropriation of $350 million to aid war-torn countries after the end of UNRRA. The decision was made because the State Department recently received a report from Colonel Harrison, head of the US delegation to Poland, stating that Poland could ensure its minimum needs in 1947 even without US aid.

### US Appoints Envoy to Romania

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] President Truman today appointed Schoenfeld as the first post-war US envoy to Romania. Secretary of State Marshall issued a statement saying that the appointment of an envoy to Romania demonstrates the US concern for the welfare of the Romanian people, its desire to learn about developments in Romania, and its continued protection of US interests in Romania, and does not mean that the United States has forgiven the Romanian government's deprivation of the people's basic freedoms.

### US Army and Navy Merger Expected to Pass Senate

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Regarding the US Army and Navy merger bill, the Senate last night approved the House's request for a special guarantee that this move would not reduce the Navy's air combat power or abolish the Marine Corps' amphibious force. Therefore, the bill is very likely to pass, and today (July 24) is very likely to become the day the US Army and Navy merge. The US Congress may adjourn before the star-shaped city of Xiamen, so the bill will be discussed simultaneously by both houses of Congress today.

### US Plans to Establish World Trade Organization, Purchase Grain to Aid Europe, Senate Committee Approves Additional Foreign Aid Funds

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 24th broadcast: President Truman said at a press conference that he is considering establishing a world trade organization in accordance with the Marshall Plan to purchase grain for distribution to European countries.

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] President Truman requested that Congress appropriate $1.548 billion to support the foreign aid program for the next fiscal year. After the House reduced it by 12.6%, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted last night to restore most of it, approving a total of $1.53 billion, including $725 million to support the governments and relief efforts in the occupied territories for the next fifteen months.

### Jewish Refugees Deported Back to France, France Agrees to Provide Relief

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] After the French cabinet discussed the disposition of the 4,500 Jewish illegal immigrants deported from Palestine to France by the British Navy, Veteran Affairs Minister Mitterrand issued the following statement: France will not prevent these Jews from landing in France, and France will not force them to leave the ship if they do not wish to do so. The French government will provide rations to the Jews on shore or on the ship when necessary. Although France is willing to abide by the agreement with Britain, it must be pointed out that these immigrants had Colombian passports and travel permits when they left France, so France is not in a position to prevent their departure. At the same time, the Colombian Embassy denied that Colombian representatives in France had issued passports or travel permits, and said that what the Jews had were forgeries. The Colombian Embassy also stated that if these Jews go to Colombia, they will be refused entry.

### Atomic Energy Control, Impasse Still Lies in Veto Power

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 23rd] Regarding the issue of international control of atomic energy, after an agreement in principle was reached on the distribution of atomic energy raw materials, hopes for an early consensus among countries on international control of atomic energy were greatly heightened. However, when representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union held a meeting of the working committee of the Atomic Energy Commission today, they suddenly reiterated their opposing views on the veto power issue, thus all hopes vanished again. The working committee held a meeting today to discuss the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union, which argued that permanent members of the Security Council should still retain their veto power when the Security Council takes decisions to sanction countries that violate the convention banning the manufacture of atomic bombs. The US representative opposed this, saying that US representative Baruch had expressed opposition to this veto power on July 14, 1946, and the United States would never change its position. The working committee finally decided to postpone discussion of the Soviet amendments until the Atomic Energy Commission had discussed all aspects of the issue of controlling atomic energy before discussing them again.

### Brazilian Parliament Discusses Anti-Communist Security Bill

Arrests of Communists Imminent if Passed

[Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 24th] The Brazilian Federal Parliament today discussed an anti-communist security law. If this law is passed, a large-scale arrest of Brazilian Communist Party members will be imminent. Communist Party members will not be allowed to hold public office, employers will be able to dismiss Communist Party employees, and in some cases, the government will have the power to interfere with the judiciary. It is expected that the Brazilian government will use its majority party in Congress to quickly pass the bill.

### Sweden Uncovers International Spies, Names and Nationalities Temporarily Kept Secret

[United Press, Stockholm, 23rd] Swedish prosecutor Robert disclosed on the 23rd that a total of six people had been arrested on suspicion of participating in a spy organization. Lowe refused to announce their nationalities and names, fearing that it would damage Swedish interests. When asked about rumors that those arrested were American citizens, US Ambassador Trayfas replied that he was not aware of the matter and therefore could not confirm or deny it. (Robert later told the agency that no Americans were involved in the spy case.) The Soviet Embassy also denied knowing about it. The Swedish government will decide on the 25th whether to hold a formal trial, but regardless of the decision, it is not expected to be a public trial. According to tea reports, those arrested were members of a secret organization that has been quite active here recently, with the aim of opposing a certain country, not Sweden, nor a country related to the Nazis.

Now, in the name of unifying authority, it is also planned to organize a compensation agency directly under the cabinet. From now on, there will be another shadow between the Social Democratic and Democratic parties.

[United Press, Seoul, 24th] Rhee Syngman issued a statement today saying that former US President Hoover's recent statement in Congress that Koreans would not be able to handle their self-government in at least 25 years has deeply hurt the feelings of the Korean people. Such a statement is especially regrettable at a time when US-Korean cooperation is urgently needed.

### US Government to Propose Economic Aid to Korea Bill

UN Korean Envoy Condemns Soviet Union

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 24th] According to informed sources, the US government has decided to submit a bill to Congress before it adjourns to appropriate funds to aid Korea. The funds will be used to revive Korean industry and the general economy.

[United Press, New York, 24th] Ye Hui-hye, the Korean envoy to the United Nations, sent a letter to President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and congressional leaders on the 24th, strongly condemning the Soviet Union for implementing a "delayed independence policy" in Korea. The Soviet Union has achieved "victory" in preventing the independence of Korea, which had already been promised. The statement also said: "The Korean issue can be a touchstone for all promises made in the Second World War. If this promise is not kept, why should countries respect international agreements?"

### US Plans to Establish Atomic Weapons Test Site in the Pacific

It also reported that the production of atomic bombs is still continuing at the rate prescribed by the President and under the guidance of the Army.

### Fugitives in Burmese Massacre Captured, Government Now Able to Fully Control the Situation

[Reuters, Rangoon, 23rd] It has been learned that all the murderers who assassinated Burmese leaders have been arrested. One of them was shot and killed by police yesterday while trying to escape from a vehicle while being transferred from Bago to Rangoon. He was a former officer in the anti-Japanese guerrilla force during the war, now 30 years old. The identities of all the perpetrators have not yet been fully ascertained, but it is known that they appear to have received military training.

Authorities have denied reports that former Prime Minister U Saw committed suicide in prison or was killed by other inmates. U Saw is still safely held in Rangoon Prison. Another former Prime Minister, Ba Maw, who was previously reported missing, is safely residing with his relatives. According to the Burmese Inspector General of Police, the situation in Burma is now fully under control. The new Burmese Administrative Council's Foreign Minister, Saw Khun Kyi, took office today and said he would continue the policies of his predecessor to allow ethnic minorities to participate in the Union of Burma.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] Burmese Minister Without Portfolio, Zi Tin Du, the new Burmese High Commissioner to the UK, returned to Rangoon by plane today with his daughter and several representatives of the Burmese goodwill mission to the UK. Before leaving, he told the press that there was no reason to fear a dangerous rebellion in Burma. This evening, U will return to London in August to take up the post of High Commissioner.

### China May Exercise Veto to Block Outer Mongolia's Accession to the United Nations

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 23rd] Regarding Albania's application to join the United Nations, according to the general opinion of the member countries of the Security Council's Credentials Committee, this will depend on Albania's attitude towards the results of the Security Council's investigation into the Corfu Channel incident. The reason is that Britain has filed a complaint with the Security Council, accusing Albania of illegally laying mines in the Corfu Channel, causing heavy damage to two British warships. The UN Credentials Committee decided today to send a telegram to the Albanian government, requesting it to explain its intentions regarding the Security Council's resolution on the British complaint. On the other hand, Soviet representative Gromyko said that no country can prevent Albania from joining the United Nations organization, because no country can doubt Albania's peaceful intentions. The Council is now scheduled to hold a meeting on the 28th of this month to take a decision on Albania's application to join the United Nations, and then review the application of the Mongolian People's Republic. According to the Security Council, China may change the position it held last year and exercise its veto power over Outer Mongolia's application.

### British Delegation Stays in Moscow, Trade Negotiations May Turn Around, Soviet Union Shows Signs of Agreeing to Reduce Wheat Prices

[United Press, London, 24th] Wilson, the chief British representative in the Moscow Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations, has indefinitely postponed his return to Britain, and it is believed that this is a sign that the Soviet Union has agreed to reduce the wheat prices it is demanding.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Ministry of Commerce announced that the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations in Moscow have reached a deadlock, and Wilson, the chief British negotiator and Minister for Overseas Trade, is preparing to return to London tomorrow. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, the Soviet Union's demand for wheat prices is too high, making it impossible for the British government to compromise, which has completely broken down the negotiations.

Wilson's visit to Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Mikoyan tonight is only a farewell visit. Commerce Secretary Cripps reported the breakdown of the negotiations to the cabinet tonight and supported Wilson's position during the negotiations. Authoritative sources admit that the breakdown of the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations is indeed a major blow to Britain. Britain originally planned to exchange machinery and industrial products with the Soviet Union for wheat and timber. The British government recently stated that it hoped to obtain one million tons of wheat from the Soviet Union's harvest this year. If Britain could obtain this amount, the bread rationing system could be stopped. In addition, establishing trade with the Soviet Union could also reduce the difficulty of paying in US dollars when Britain orders from the United States or Canada. The reason for the breakdown of the negotiations is that the Soviet Union's asking price for wheat was too high, making Britain's exports to the Soviet Union insufficient to pay for the wheat purchased. The deficit would have to be made up with US dollars. Politically, the breakdown of the negotiations will further widen the East-West divide and have an adverse impact on the negotiations to revise the Anglo-Soviet alliance, which have been stalled for some time. The last meeting regarding the latter negotiations was held in Moscow several weeks ago. Although contact is still maintained, no progress has been made. The main obstacle to this diplomatic negotiation is the Soviet government's deep fear that Britain's foreign policy, especially in terms of security, is too close to the United States.

### Soviet Union Has Resumed Free Sale of Gasoline

[United Press, Moscow, 24th] Non-rationed gasoline has resumed sale in Moscow, the first time since the war that non-rationed gasoline can be purchased at "commercial" gas stations. Its price is four times higher than rationed gasoline per month.

### Security Council Discusses Balkan Issues, US Representative Straightforwardly Accuses Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria of Threatening International Peace

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 23rd] US Deputy Representative Johnson today abandoned diplomatic formalities and straightforwardly announced to the Security Council that Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria are threatening international peace. There is not the slightest sign of civil liberties in these three countries. Whatever name is used, dictatorship is always dictatorship. Johnson asked the Security Council to warn the three countries to focus on maintaining their own order and not interfere in other people's affairs, lest a Balkan war break out and affect the entire world. Soviet representative Gromyko, seeing Johnson's straightforward speech, immediately stood up and argued that Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania's internal affairs did not need American guidance. If this guidance is given on the UN platform, the speaker is overestimating the importance of his guidance. Johnson also retorted, "I have repeatedly heard people mention imperialism and fascism, as if this were the only political system opposed by certain people. We do not want to defend the Greek government, but Greece does not threaten international peace, while its three northern neighbors do pose this threat.

### Electricity Shortage Nears Most Serious Stage, Emergency Relief Measures Being Drawn Up, Public Utilities Bureau Director Discusses Four Main Principles, Re-emphasizing Ban on Electric Heating, Conserving Electricity

[Our Newspaper] The electricity shortage in this city has not eased. According to Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue, who told reporters yesterday: The end of this year will be the most serious stage of the electricity panic. Because the population of this city has increased compared to last year, and electricity consumption habits are also more common than in the past, there has been a sharp increase in electricity consumption in this city recently. As for relief measures, far-reaching measures such as the establishment of a joint power plant are now being actively planned, but because distant water cannot quench immediate thirst, emergency relief measures must be drawn up in advance for this winter's electricity shortage. The measures should not go beyond the following four principles. (1) Extend daylight saving time until the end of October. (It ended at the end of September last year). (2) Electric heating, such as electric stoves, etc., is prohibited. (3) Users conserve electricity, that is, a discount will be applied according to the highest electricity consumption in one year. The specific measures are being discussed. (4) All factories in this city with generator equipment must generate their own electricity. For example, China Textile Corporation has a 6,000 kW generator, and the Public Utilities Bureau is urging it to generate its own electricity.

Measures May Be Modified

Recalling the winter of last year, during the period of extreme electricity shortage, in addition to rotating power outages in various districts, Mayor Wu and Director Zhao personally went to various shops to persuade them to save electricity. Electricity consumption quotas for users were discounted, and those who exceeded the limit would be fined or have their electricity cut off, which caused the citizens unbearable pain. After the first Municipal Council raised objections, the restrictions on electricity consumption were lifted. However, according to Director Zhao, who told reporters yesterday: The severity of this year's electricity shortage will be even greater than last year, so electricity consumption must still be restricted. As for electricity saving measures, they may be more flexible than last year. They are currently being actively drawn up.

Hopes for Improvement Next Spring

According to Director Zhao's estimate, the electricity shortage situation may improve next spring. Because the 2,000 kW generator of the China Merchant Power Company in the south of the city has arrived here, and will be able to generate electricity next spring after the boiler is installed. In addition, the generator of the French Electricity Company can also be installed and generate electricity next year. At that time, the electricity supply situation in this city should be more abundant.

### Nanshi, Xujiahui, and Other Districts Approved to Appropriately Reduce the Number of Power Outage Days

[Our Newspaper] Due to insufficient power supply, Nanshi and Xujiahui and other districts have rotating power outage measures. Factories in the district have to stop electricity for an average of six days a month. The people in charge of the factories, because the power outage is too long, has a great impact on production, especially went to the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday to visit Director Zhao, requesting to reduce the power outage date. After detailed discussions, it was considered that more power outages did hinder production. It has been approved to reduce one day appropriately.

At the same time, electricity consumption for users in the district can also be expected to increase.

### First Conscript Volunteers, Mothers of Strong Men Fear Each Other, Applying for Exemption and Postponement Procedures, District Chiefs Must Not Hinder or Extort

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Chichong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, stated that the city's military service is about to begin, and the procedures for strong men to apply for exemption, postponement, and delayed conscription are currently being processed. He personally went to various district offices yesterday and the day before to inspect the handling situation. People from all walks of life do not yet fully understand the military service conscription situation. After the inspection, he issued the following written statement:

(1) This year's conscription will first recruit volunteers, so strong men in this city need not scare each other, causing anxiety. In particular, do not believe rumors, mistakenly thinking that you will be conscripted soon, which would fall into the trap of the Communist Party. (2) Currently, district offices are handling applications for delayed conscription, delayed enlistment, exemption, and prohibition from service for strong men of age. Any strong men who are 21 years old (actual age) who are notified by the district chief to complete the application procedures should go to the district office or district office to collect the application form, in duplicate, and pay a total processing fee of 500 yuan. District offices must not hinder or demand extra surcharges or collect other fees under various pretexts. (3) After the strong man receives the application form for delayed conscription, delayed enlistment, exemption, and prohibition from service, he should fill in each item in detail according to the application form, attach two photos, and affix a 50-yuan stamp (the duplicate application form does not need to be stamped). Submit it to the district office or district chief's office. However, submitting the application form is for processing the review of exemption and postponement procedures, not for immediate conscription. (4) The items listed on the application form that need to be certified by the neighborhood chief, such as being solely responsible for the family's livelihood and physical deformities that make them unable to serve, must be carefully verified by the relevant neighborhood chief. They must not deliberately obstruct or fail to provide certification. If the above situation occurs and is verified to be true, it will be transferred to the judicial authorities for legal action in accordance with Article 10 of the Statute on Punishment of Offenses Against Military Service (sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years but not more than five years). (5) The settlement allowance for volunteers and the preferential treatment for conscripted family members will be announced after the municipal government and the military service association formulate regulations. District chiefs must not arbitrarily collect settlement allowances and preferential treatment fees from strong men or residents who are processing application procedures. (6) It has been found that a few districts, such as the North Station District, charge a processing fee of 1,000 yuan. In addition, three districts in Songshan District have taken the initiative to collect 50,000 yuan in preferential treatment fees. All of them are limited to return the fees according to the roster before July 26th of this month. The Civil Affairs Department will send personnel to investigate each district. If the fees are not returned within the time limit, they will be severely punished. (7) If citizens have any questions about the application procedures, they can inquire at the guard section of the district office or directly inquire at the Third Section of the Civil Affairs Department. The phone number of that section is 43610, and the address is 295 Tanggu Road. Citizens are advised to pay attention. (8) In the past two days, I personally went to various districts and neighborhoods for explicit and implicit investigations. It was found that the application procedures for exemption and delayed conscription for strong men in Hongkou, Tilanqiao, Yangshupu, Yulin, Jiangning, Putuo, Xinjing, Longhua, and Yizhan districts were all good. However, a few districts, such as North Station, Xincheng, and Songshan, had errors in their procedures. The applications in the North Station and Jing'an districts are all processed in one place in the district office, which sometimes causes crowding and poor order for those who receive the application forms. The application forms should be distributed to the offices of each neighborhood for processing, but strict supervision is required to prevent corruption.

### Case of Hiding Rationed Rice: Shen Jinlong Prosecuted

[Our Newspaper's Report] Shen Jinlong from Baoshan, who lives at No. 62, Lane 416, West Avis Road, runs the Jinchang Rice Store. On April 2, Shen applied to the municipal government and was allocated 70 sacks of white rice by the Social Bureau. He secretly hid it in No. 3, Bian'anli, on the same road and did not sell it to the citizens of the district as determined by the Social Bureau. Someone secretly reported it to the municipal government. The Social Bureau and the Police Bureau investigated it. After questioning, Shen confessed to hoarding and hiding rice. After the police bureau transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, the prosecutor concluded the investigation of the case yesterday and filed a public prosecution according to law.

### Decided to Exchange Broken Rice Allocated to Poor Households for Indica Rice, Selling Price Still 178,000 per Stone

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ye Shifu, a counselor of the Ministry of Food, came to Shanghai from Beijing and visited Director Wu of the Social Bureau yesterday morning to exchange views on the quality of rice allocated to poor households. According to Director Wu, it has been decided to request the Ministry of Food to exchange the broken rice allocated to poor households for indica rice, and the price will still be 178,000 yuan per stone. If the broken rice is allocated through the Food Distribution Association, the people will have no complaints. Now that the price of rice has fallen, if it is allocated at a price of 178,000 yuan per stone, the people will be dissatisfied. Therefore, it is negotiated to request the Food Department to exchange it for the kind of rice used for factories and schools, but the price is cheaper than the 240,000 yuan per stone for factories and schools. Although it is the same indica rice, the allocated price is different.

### Trial of Fubo Ship Case Continued Yesterday: Dai Rulin Denies Being Scolded by Passengers, District Court Will Convene a Collegial Panel for Serious Handling

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Fubo ship sinking case was tried in the District Court yesterday morning. Judge Xian Dada took the seat and questioned the defendant Dai Rulin, captain of the Hai Min ship. He asked about the testimony of the ship's witness, stating that after the ship collided, the defendant did not order the crew to rescue people and was scolded by passengers. Was this true? According to Dai's confession, he was commanding on the bridge at the time of the accident and was asking the crew to prepare life-saving equipment and carry out rescue work. As the captain, he had to deal with this emergency calmly. As for the saying that passengers scolded him, he was on the bridge and did not have any passengers coming to the bridge to question him, so it was not true. Witness Fu, Lin Ruwen, a passenger on the Hai Bing Jing ship, stated the same situation as the previous witness. The second witness Fu, Huang Guang, testified that he was a student at Fudan University. He felt a shock while sleeping when the ship collided with the Fubo ship. He did not know whether the shipowner had ordered the crew to rescue people, but he saw someone outside the ship shining a flashlight. When he got up and looked outside, he vaguely saw a white object, which then disappeared. Then, the defendant's lawyer requested the court to send a letter to the Xiamen District Court to summon witness Ye, a member of the Political Participation Council, to record his testimony for reference. At the end of the court session, the case was adjourned for further trial, and the defendant Dai Rulin was still remanded in custody. It is heard that in order to seriously handle the case, the District Court will be handled by a collegial panel consisting of Presiding Judge Zhu Nianci and Judges Zhong Xianda and Xie Zhiying when the debate is opened.

### Laying Drainage Pipes on Yejiazhai Road: Public Works Bureau Rushing Day and Night

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Fuji, Director of the Drainage Canal Management Office, and Qian Weifan, a specialist, invited reporters from various newspapers to visit the pipe laying project on Yejiazhai Road at 9 pm last night.

The total project cost, according to the budget in March of this year, is 990 million yuan. It has now been increased to 2.1 billion yuan. The project was originally contracted by a contractor and started on April 21.

It is now rushing day and night, and it is estimated that 60 days of work will be required to complete the entire project.

### Preliminary Review of "Fake Phoenixes": Three Points Considered to be Revised, Barbers Still Raise Nine Demands, Director Wu Says They Cannot be Accepted

[Our Newspaper's Report] Whether the film "Fake Phoenixes" is insulting to the barber industry was specially reviewed by various agencies and groups yesterday. A screening was held at the Guanghua Theater at 10 am. Representatives from the Municipal Government, Social Bureau, Garrison Headquarters, Municipal Council, Police Bureau, Education Bureau, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and General Labor Union attended. In order to avoid misunderstandings in the barber industry, the Social Bureau first summoned representatives of the barber industry for explanation at around 9 am. Forty people from the Barber Industry Association and the Occupational Labor Union participated. The film started on time at 10 am, and the order was very good. After the screening ended at 11:50 am, the participating representatives exchanged preliminary views and believed that there were three points that they hoped to be revised: (1) The barber placing his hand on the female customer's shoulder. (2) The third person committing suicide by shaving the tie with a razor first. (3) Qi Diao (the one who impersonates Secretary Liu) is in a difficult situation after taking off his clothes and only having a undershirt and vest left.

### Wen Hua Said it Can be Revised

In the afternoon, Jiao Dingyi, chairman of the Seven Counties Association of Jiangsu natives in Shanghai, Wang Xiuchuan, chairman of the Barber Industry Association, the screenwriter of "Fake Phoenixes" from Wen Hua Company, Director Huang Zuolin, and Li Wudeng visited Director Wu Kaixian and Director Yuan Wenzhang of the Social Bureau. The barber industry still raised the nine demands from the previous time, but Director Wu believed that the Subei dialect is a local dialect and cannot be regarded as an insult. If it is said that the diamond ring worn by the barber is fake, it is not intended to be contemptuous. As for the barber being renamed as "master," such as with carpenters and clerks, the term "craftsman" does not contain any insult, so the proposed revision cannot be accepted. Director Wu also instructed Jiao Dingkai, chairman of the fellow countrymen association, to be in the position of a mediator in the middle and not to be biased towards one party. Wen Hua Company stated that if it is generally considered that there are any places that should be revised after the review, it can be accepted, but do not change too much or make the technical aspects feel too difficult.

### Speaking of Human Feelings Instead of the Law

Shui Xiangzhi, chairman of the General Labor Union, after watching the screening, believed that "Fake Phoenixes" is a successful comedy in itself. However, from the perspective of the subjective (barber), there is indeed a place to be insulted. Yuan Wenzhang, Director of the Social Bureau, stated that the film has been approved by the Film Inspection Office, and the Social Bureau can ignore it. However, the current desire to resolve the dispute is not a legal issue but a emotional issue. The three points that the preliminary review proposes to revise are not issues of the content of the film but to solve a social problem. According to Director Wu's report to reporters, "Fake Phoenixes" will be reviewed again by various agencies and groups in the next few days after the preliminary review, and the opinions will be summarized. After the representatives jointly sign, Wen Hua Company will be notified to revise it, and there will be no problem. If the Barber Industry Labor Union can no longer accept this solution, it will undoubtedly lose the sympathy of society.

### Several More Lines Can be Added

Director Wu also said: At the end of the film, praising the barber's self-reliance and not being lowly, it is being discussed to request Wen Hua Company to add a few more lines, the general meaning of which is "We women should not marry a rich person who has no occupation, but would rather marry a person who has an occupation, is self-reliant, and has no money," in order to emphasize the sanctity of labor and self-reliance as glorious, so that everyone knows that they should have an occupation and advise women not to be vain. As for the three points that are considered to be deleted and revised, it is planned to ask the Film Inspection Office to re-examine and revise them.

It is also heard that "Fake Phoenixes" has been internally scheduled to be exclusively screened at the Da Guangming Theater as soon as the dispute is resolved.

### Saying it is Child's Play: Climbing Over the Wall to Propose is Not Easy to Close the Case

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhai Wanli, who once studied at Soochow University, climbed over the wall late at night on the 30th of last month, carrying a gun and sneaking into the residence of Chen Zhizhu (who studied at St. John's University) to propose. The next day, Chen's father reported it to the Changning Road Police Station for "obstructing freedom" and transferred it to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Ding Tongjun summoned Zhai Wanli and Chen Zhizhu to court for questioning. Zhai Wanli is quite handsome, wearing a white shirt and beige khaki trousers, accompanied by his father, and reported to the court at around 3 pm. Chen Zhizhu did not respond to the summons to appear in court. The trial lasted until 7 pm yesterday and has not yet been completed. The reporter talked with Zhai before the trial and asked about the proposal situation that night. He was quite embarrassed, but said: "It is about the same as the situation described in the Shen Bao on the 16th of this month." He also said: "I knew Chen Zhizhu in the past and was classmates at St. John's." His father interjected and said: "Our two families are acquainted. Now the Chen family is willing to withdraw the complaint. I am preparing to send Wanli to the United States to study. These are all things that children do." The reporter asked if the crime was more serious because he used a gun to threaten. Zhai's father said: "The origin of this gun is that a naval friend, Wang Kaiyuan, obtained it for 300,000 yuan. Mr. Wang can testify to this matter, and there are no bullets inside. It is just that the child is playing." Prosecutor Ding stated that the case cannot be closed if Chen Zhizhu does not appear in court to make a statement. If he refuses to appear in court again next time, an arrest warrant will be issued. Furthermore, the case cannot be withdrawn according to law, and the District Prosecutor's Office will continue to investigate.

### Wujin Township Head Murder Case: Hubei Fellow Countrymen's Association Asks for Severe Punishment

### Laughter, Tears, All Shapes and Sizes: Renji Hospital's Twenty-Four Hours

More Than Two Hundred Inpatients Moaning and Struggling for Life, Thousands of Citizens Coming Daily to Seek Relief from Pain

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Late at night, twelve o'clock, in Renji Hospital, a six-story building on Shandong Road, the wards are still brightly lit. More than two hundred patients are struggling for their lives. Some are quietly asleep, some are still delirious, moaning...

Outside the large iron gate, a burst of engine sounds and car horns comes. An ambulance has arrived. Inside the gatehouse, a switch is flipped, and the bells in the emergency department's clinic and the doctor's lounge ring loudly. The doctors and nurses on duty immediately become alert and begin to move.

The patient being carried in is in her thirties or forties, with a pale face and sweat streaming down. She is clutching her abdomen with both hands, constantly crying out, "It hurts, it hurts!" The family members accompanying her, probably her wife, are as anxious as ants on a hot pan.

The patient is carried into the emergency room. After more than ten minutes, the doctor comes out and says that it is acute appendicitis and requires immediate surgery.

### Acute Appendicitis - Immediate Surgery Required

The woman signs the form with a trembling hand. The patient is carried to the operating room on the fourth floor. The doctor responsible for the surgery wakes up from his dream. This is another time, another life in his hands. The woman is left in the hallway, murmuring prayers, praying.

Silence returns to the emergency department. The doctor on duty wants to go back to the lounge to lie down for a while,

But the bell rings again. As the iron gate opens, another ambulance drives in. This time, it is a dancer who attempted suicide by consuming DDT. She fell in love with a young and poor boy, but her old mother insisted that she marry a rich, ugly old man. The conflict between money and love, a quarrel between mother and daughter...

### A Poisoned Dancer Sent In

She ended her life with DDT. It was too late, too late when she was sent to the hospital. What use is it now for that old woman—her mother—to jump and wail!

The woman waiting for her husband's surgery is attracted by this scene and temporarily forgets her own worries. Suddenly, a nurse brings good news from upstairs that her husband is out of danger. A smile like spring clouds spreads across the woman's face. She and the old woman who lost her daughter, one crying and one smiling, walk out of the hospital gate one after the other.

The emergency department returns to silence. But who knows when the next bell will ring, what kind of person will be sent in next?

### Adult or Child?

The night fades away, and dawn arrives. The entire hospital begins to stir. More than fifty doctors, more than a hundred nurses, and more than a hundred staff members enthusiastically and sincerely undertake the health work of society. From 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM is the time for outpatient services. Each day, about a thousand patients come from all corners of Shanghai to seek relief from their pain. Here, we can see many stories of joys and sorrows.

In the obstetrics department on the third floor, a woman giving birth for the first time encounters a difficult delivery. The situation is very dangerous. The doctor finds her husband and her mother-in-law together. "Adult or child?" the doctor asks. The husband lowers his head and thinks for a moment. "Of course, the adult," he says. The old mother next to him moves her lips as if she wants to say something but shrinks back. She thinks: of course, the daughter-in-law is important, but she won't be able to hold the grandson she has been waiting for for three years!

### Snatched Back from the Hands of Death

In the operating room on the fourth floor, a very difficult operation is underway. A patient with pulmonary tuberculosis has a corner of his lung rotten and suppurating. Such a terminal illness was incurable in the past, but now it can be overcome with the latest medical techniques. The equipment and medicines were only shipped from the United States last year. The surgeon carefully injects anesthetic into the lungs. This anesthetic has the effect of expanding the lungs, so that they are not crushed by the air outside the body during surgery. Then, he cuts open the chest, removes the rotten corner, applies medicine, and sews it up. A life is snatched back from the hands of death. This is not a miracle, not a gift from God, it is the success of science!

### Acute Meningitis Saved

In a first-class ward on the fifth floor, a chubby seven or eight-year-old child is rolling around on the bed. Hey, what illness does he have? Oh, don't look at him being so lively now. When he was sent to the hospital three days ago, he was already half dead. He was suffering from tuberculous acute meningitis, another terminal illness. However, a special medicine, Streptomycin, recently invented in medicine, saved him. Spinal fluid is extracted from the back near the waist, and then this medicine is injected directly into the brain, showing immediate results. A small bottle is worth 600,000 National Currency. This child has already had sixty bottles, six sixes are thirty-six, 36 million National Currency!

### Fresh Blood Like a Pig's Trotter

Let's go back and look at the emergency room during the day. Here, a boatman's fingers have been crushed by an iron plate, covered in fresh blood like a pig's trotter. Over there is a rickshaw puller who was hit by a Jeep car, losing half of his leg. He has already passed out. And here, there, are all bloody "urban trauma cases."

The scene is too tragic. Let's look at something more relaxed: Little Sanzi and Little Liuzi at the dock fought over work. The two were taken to the police station. Little Sanzi said he was beaten by Little Liuzi, and Little Liuzi said he was beaten by Little Sanzi. Both were brought to the hospital for examination. The doctor examined them and found that neither was injured. Okay, okay, everyone go back. You are both poor people, why fight each other like enemies!

### A Scene of Deception - The Woman Was Long Gone

The sun shifts to the west, and twilight approaches again. The hospital gradually becomes quiet. After dinner, the night deepens. Officer × from the police station brings a man in his thirties and a girl of seventeen or eighteen. The girl keeps saying that the man forcibly violated her virginity. The two made a scene at the police station, and the police chief sent her to the hospital for examination.

The doctor, after examining her, reveals an awkward expression and tells the police that the girl is no longer a virgin. The man is shocked to hear this and wants to argue, but the doctor continues: she has been violated multiple times and there are no new traces. Thus, the girl's scheme is exposed. She gives two crisp slaps, cries, and follows the police away. Tomorrow in the newspaper, we can see another blackmailing social news story.

The clock ticks second by second, and we hear midnight strike again. The bell in the emergency room rings again. We don't need to record what this one is about again. In this, Shanghai's largest hospital, all kinds of stories unfold in twenty-four hours. Here, you may see a microcosm of Shanghai society, and you can also taste the flavors of life's joys and sorrows.

### A Disturbance at the North Station - Staff Officer Beaten and Injured - Passengers Flee as Gunfire Erupts

[Report from This Newspaper] On the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, undisciplined soldiers often ride without tickets and carry private goods. Although the Railway Bureau's police department has tried hard to crack down on this, it has not been completely eradicated. At 4:10 PM yesterday, Staff Officer Zhang of the Garrison Headquarters' Military Transportation Office, stationed on the two railways, was patrolling Platform No. 6 when he saw dozens of officers and soldiers from the Seventh Company of the Second Battalion of the Weining Training Regiment, under the jurisdiction of the Zhengdong Division, gathered on the platform. Staff Officer Zhang stepped forward to persuade them to move, which caused a conflict, and Staff Officer Zhang was beaten and injured. At that time, Zhang's two guards tried to step forward to mediate, but were also drawn into the fray. At the same time, the gun they were carrying suddenly went off. Passengers on the station did not know the truth and fled in all directions, causing great chaos. Military police stationed at the station arrived to suppress the situation, which prevented the situation from escalating. Staff Officer Zhang was seriously injured and sent to the Railway Hospital for treatment.

### Fudan Air-Raid Shelter Case - Zhang Yi Hosts Reporters

[Report from This Newspaper] Regarding the case of the demolition of the air-raid shelter at National Fudan University, which implicated Rui Baogong, the head of general affairs at Fudan, Zhang Yi, the president of Fudan University, hosted reporters at the New Life Club at 5:00 PM yesterday to explain the situation. It was stated that the school's campus was narrow, and after the restoration, if there was no suitable sports field, there was a plan to use the square formerly used by the pseudo-Shanghai University as a temporary sports field for the school. The Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau was consulted to inquire about the ownership of the land, so that it could be requisitioned according to law. In November of last year, Zhang Guoxian, the local Baochang (head of a Bao) and the principal of Guoji Elementary School, planned to demolish the air-raid shelter and use the remaining bricks and materials to expand the school building. He sent a letter to Fudan for consent. Fudan, as an educational institution, had no right to prevent the Baochang from doing so, so it did not express any opinion. It was not until December that Zhang Guoxian and the contractor Che Jigui signed a contract to start demolition. The facts confirmed in the indictment prove that Zhang's employment of workers to demolish the air-raid shelter had nothing to do with Rui Baogong, the head of general affairs at Fudan, which is very clear. On January 14 of this year, Zhang borrowed 1 million National Currency from Fudan as a graduate of the school's free elementary school (most of the children of the school's faculty and staff attend the elementary school) and as the principal of Guoji Elementary School. Fudan reluctantly granted the request, and Zhang made a promissory note. Moreover, the loan was made many days after the start of construction. The indictment stated that Rui, the head of general affairs, first paid 1 million National Currency in construction fees, which is clearly inconsistent with the facts. The above-mentioned key facts were all stated by Rui, the head of general affairs, during the investigation by the procuratorate. The indictment stated that the defendant admitted this without hesitation, and that Rui, the head of general affairs, encouraged the contractor Che to start construction as soon as possible, and that the rest of the wages would be found later. This was a misinterpretation of the contractor's one-sided lies, which is regrettable. Zhang concluded by saying that Rui, the head of general affairs, usually handles school affairs and does not hesitate to bear complaints. In this case, he has no personal interest and is implicated in the performance of his duties. In addition to following legal channels to seek a fair judgment, he will explain the facts.

### Coveting Gold Mortgage Money - Impersonating Police Department Personnel for Extortion - Apprehended with Stolen Goods Within Two Hours

The Municipal Police Bureau cracked a major fraud case in two hours on the 23rd. A businessman, Zhang Jianquan, 50 years old, from Suzhou, urgently needed money and planned to mortgage gold. Through his friend Ying Jinsheng, he was introduced to Chen Dehua at 96 Zhili Road, above the Xuchangshun Woodware Store. At 10:00 AM on the 23rd, Zhang went to Chen's place, bringing 28 gold rings, 17 pairs of gold earrings, and 3 small gold bars, weighing about 11 liang and 4 qian, to mortgage for 20 million yuan. He also borrowed 3.366 million yuan from the witness Ying Jinsheng. Chen Dehua issued a check for 23.366 million yuan, check number 48289 from Qichang Money Shop, dated July 23. While Zhang and the others were going through the procedures of counting and delivering the money, Xu Yiming and Yuan Youren, impersonating police officers, used the pretext that they were engaged in black market gold mortgage transactions to threaten and intimidate Zhang in every way, extorting 4 million yuan in cash and 5 gold rings (weighing 2 liang) from Zhang, and also taking away the check for 23.366 million yuan. After this case occurred, the Police Bureau's Detective Section obtained information and immediately dispatched Section Chief Deng, Squad Leader Xue Minjie, police officers Ji Qingxun, Yu Gan, and others to investigate. The case was solved in two hours. The main culprit, Xu Yiming, and his accomplice, Yuan Youren, were arrested, and the stolen gold rings, checks, and other items were recovered. After being brought to the bureau for interrogation overnight, the main culprit, Xu Yiming, confessed that he was from Suzhou, 23 years old, lived at 51 Maqi Road in this city, and had worked at the Shangtian Funeral Home. He had been unemployed for a long time, so he colluded with Yuan Youren to impersonate voluntary inspectors from the Garrison Headquarters and swindle people. He directly admitted to this case. The accomplice, Yuan Youren, confessed that he was from Chongming, 23 years old, lived at 1 Zhujiawan in Zhabei, and had worked at the Xinzong Yarn Factory. He was also currently unemployed. This time, he colluded with Xu Yiming to extort money in name only, which was true.

### Two Abbots of Longhua Temple Dispute - District Prosecutor's Office Summons Four Monks

[Report from This Newspaper] Yongchan, the abbot of Longhua Temple during the enemy-puppet period, was accused by Xinci, the former abbot of Longhua Temple, who stated that when the Hangzhou War broke out in the 26th year of the Republic (1937), Xinci was deceived by patriotism into handing over the temple affairs to the supervisor monk Zheng and to participate in the monks' rescue team. He served as the captain of the rescue team and traveled to more than ten provinces.

Each province and city should increase the number of provincial, municipal, and county-level sports venues, completing the standard of at least one in each province, county, and city as soon as possible. B. Municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan should build more swimming pools and gymnasiums. C. A national gymnasium should be planned and built in the capital. (6) Holding the Seventh National Games. To be held on May 5th next year. (7) Organizing a sports delegation to visit foreign countries for observation. A decision will be made based on the situation when selecting athletes to participate in the World Games at the next National Games. In addition, the plans for conducting sports skill tests, physical fitness tests, rewarding sports academic research and continuing to experiment with sports teaching materials, and rewarding sports equipment inventions and compiling standards for sports equipment were all decided to be carried out by the Ministry next year in order of urgency.

### Basketball Theory Test to Be Held This Afternoon

The basketball theory test organized by the Basketball Committee is scheduled to be held this afternoon at 5:00 p.m. in the conference room of the Municipal Gymnasium. This test was originally divided into men's and women's groups, but as a result of registration, the men's group was very enthusiastic, reaching more than 40 people, while the women's group only had one person. Therefore, it was decided to cancel the women's group. The scope of the test is divided into two parts: theory and rules. All test papers will be sealed.

### Beijing-Shanghai Women's Basketball Invitational: Xiang Team Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, to Play Against Xuebai Tonight

8:00 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium

[Our Newspaper] The Xiang team, a strong women's basketball team from the capital, led by team leader Yu Jinxiang, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m. by the Qiantang train. The Shanghai Municipal Sports Association Basketball Committee, the Municipal Gymnasium, and representatives from the Green Team and Xuebai Women's Youth, including Qian Xucang, Gong Shiyin, Huang Mingyuan, Zhang Xiuli, Zhu Jiazhen, and Jian Zhiguang, welcomed them at the North Station at 2:45 p.m. They were immediately taken by special car to the gymnasium for rest and refreshments. The Xiang team originally planned to represent the Lizhi Society to come to Shanghai for a competition during the spring break, but it was not possible due to various problems. This time, the team members are traveling at their own expense, which is commendable. Most of the nine team members are married and teach at various schools in Beijing. This trip is entirely to promote women's sports and awaken Chinese professional women to the importance of sports, which is truly a model for women. The team's record in Beijing is well-known. When the Green Team went to Beijing this spring, they only managed to win by two points, which shows the strength of the Xiang team. Veterans Tan Biyun, Xi Xun, and Liu Shouguang have rich experience on the court. The other new players are all strong players in the Beijing women's basketball scene. They are scheduled to stay in Shanghai for about four or five days. The Basketball Committee held an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss the welcome schedule, which was decided as follows:

First Game: vs. Xuebai Tonight at 8:00 PM

Second Game: vs. Green Team This Sunday

Third Game: vs. Qinglian Next Monday

The Xiang team is currently staying at the Municipal Gymnasium. Yu Julu will be the referee for today's game against Xuebai. Tickets are 3,000 yuan for the upper floor and 5,000 yuan for the lower floor.

The Xuebai team, under the leadership of team captain Zhang Xiuli, has worked hard. In addition to the basic team members Wang Huiling, Zhu Jiazhen, and Wang Shan, who are the runners-up in Shanghai women's basketball, the recent addition of Chen Hongmin and the Wu Zhaorui and Wu Zhaoming sisters has made the lineup even stronger. There will be fierce competition tonight. The rosters of both teams are listed below:

Xiang Team

Leader and Coach Yu Jinxiang, Captain Chen Baixue, Executive Tan Biyun, Players Liu Shouguang, Xi Xun, Li Chuan'ai, Gao Yingying, Wan Shunxiang Chen Bin, Wu Huixian.

### This Year's Domestic Cotton Estimate: Approximately 6 Million Dan Available for Yarn Mills

[Our Newspaper] According to cotton expert Mr. Wu Weijing's estimate: This year, China's cotton production can reach the goal of 10 million dan. Approximately 6 million dan of this can be purchased by various yarn mills for spinning. The remaining 4 million dan will be consumed by farmers themselves. Of the 6 million dan available for purchase, improved cotton varieties account for approximately 400,000 dan. This batch of cotton is mostly Italian varieties. Of the initial 100,000 dan of cotton seeds sown, 60,000 dan were supplied by the United Relief Administration and 40,000 dan were promoted by the Cotton Production Improvement Association of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, planted in cotton-producing areas such as Shaanxi and Hubei, covering a total area of 1 million mu. If this batch of cotton is affected by unfavorable weather conditions or human factors, it can still yield at least 300,000 dan, with an expected "standard" of 400,000 dan. This batch of cotton is of excellent quality and can be spun into fine yarn of 32 counts or higher. After harvesting, it will be processed through sophisticated ginning equipment to create a fully prepared lint. The government, having invested a large amount of capital in this batch of cotton, should purchase it. At 400,000 dan, the purchase funds will be approximately 8 billion yuan. Adding in the costs of improvement and promotion, the total amount will need to reach 10 billion yuan. After purchasing this batch of cotton, the government will distribute it to yarn mills with sophisticated equipment to spin fine-count yarn for the purpose of promoting cotton yarn exports. In addition to this batch of improved cotton varieties, the remaining approximately 6 million dan of cotton can be spun into cotton yarn of 20 counts or higher, accounting for approximately 3.5 million dan. Cotton for 12 to 16 count yarn accounts for approximately 1 million dan. Other items such as coarse velvet, wild cotton, and mixed flowers account for approximately 1.5 million dan. This batch of cotton is scattered in various cotton-producing areas. If the government were to purchase it all, the funds required would be too large, or it would be purchased by the factories themselves. However, a purchase price will first be agreed upon, cotton grade standards will be assessed, and then, based on this price and standard, it will be purchased separately according to individual needs, one step at a time. According to his personal observation: Regarding this batch of cotton, because it is purchased by the factories themselves, the government will probably not adopt a proxy spinning policy. Furthermore, even if the government can provide the factories with financial convenience for purchasing cotton, it is unlikely to be conditional on proxy spinning. The work of purchasing new cotton should begin in September this year, and this year will probably be no exception.

### 來函2　　
Respected Editor: The section in today's edition of your newspaper, page six, regarding my discussion of opening trade with Japan does not align with my original intent. I am writing to respectfully request a correction. Respectfully submitted, Luo Yinpu. July 24.

Non-Import Goods Foreign Exchange Examination - Application Procedures to be Simplified

[Our Newspaper's Report] It has been approved that the Non-Import Goods Foreign Exchange Examination Committee will streamline the examination procedures for foreign exchange applications related to item four (export freight) and item five (export insurance) as listed in the amended regulations. For these two items, designated banks may still follow the Central Bank's Circular No. 72, relying on the exporter's application and relevant documents. If the handling bank deems it undoubtedly accurate, and the foreign exchange obtained from the exported goods has already been sold to the bank or is pre-sold to the bank, the bank can first approve the foreign exchange needed for export freight and export marine insurance. After the sale is completed, the second, third, and fourth duplicate copies of the application should be attached to the weekly report and submitted to the National Bank for examination. After the National Bank conducts a preliminary review, it will still be submitted to the Executive Yuan's Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for reconsideration. The above measures have been issued by the National Bank's Business Bureau in Circular No. 105 to all designated banks.

### Cholera Mortality and Treatment by Yao Xingshu

Last year on July 31, this newspaper's Social Service column published a letter from Mr. Lu Xibai of Songyin, Songjiang. I now extract it as follows: "Since the outbreak of true cholera in my town, it has gradually spread. Although patients have been treated by Western doctors and injected with appropriate saline and cardiac stimulants, taken anti-emetics and anti-diarrheal drugs and absorption (?) and other symptomatic treatments, very few have been cured. Most patients experience a gradual return of body temperature and pulse after saline injection, but after two or three hours, a relapse occurs, and they cannot be saved. The mortality rate is alarmingly high, around 80% or more. Having read in the newspaper that the cholera mortality rate in Shanghai is only below 20%, the difference is so significant. Now the locals have lost faith in Western medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine has no countermeasures. Upon discovering this disease, they can only resign themselves to fate and await death. Driven by compassion, I have listed several questions and respectfully request inquiries from hospitals or specialist doctors in Shanghai regarding treatment processes and medications, to be published in the newspaper for doctors in epidemic areas to refer to. The questions are listed below:

(1) Symptomatic Treatment: What are effective treatments for vomiting and diarrhea? Vomiting is truly abhorrent; even medication is immediately vomited, preventing it from taking effect. Is there any effective injection that can stop vomiting immediately, allowing medication to be administered afterward? Diarrhea is also terrible; after two or three episodes of severe diarrhea, dehydration symptoms appear. Common carbon-based absorbents are ineffective. Please publish effective anti-diarrheal prescriptions.

(2) Root Cause Treatment: Which bactericidal agent is more effective?

(3) Is injecting plasma or blood protein more effective than saline?

(4) How should cholera acidosis be treated?

(5) Cholera patients often experience urinary retention. Which diuretic is appropriate?"

Mr. Lu's questions should be answered by the doctors in that column and published simultaneously; therefore, I will not discuss them here. A year has passed easily, and the cholera season has arrived again. Inspired by Mr. Lu's letter, I will briefly write about my observations.

According to Chen's book, the average mortality rate of cholera is 60%. This means that if cholera patients are left untreated, at most 40 people can survive, and more than half will die, which is horrifying. In the cholera outbreak in Songyin, the treatment methods, as described by Mr. Lu, are commonly used, but the mortality rate is "around 80% or more." It is no wonder that Mr. Lu is greatly moved by compassion.

The cause of cholera is the cholera bacteria. The cause of death from cholera is the loss of body fluids. The reason for fluid loss is the result of bacterial toxins, which cause the small intestine to secrete large amounts of mucus. The intestinal tract cannot contain it, leading to vomiting and diarrhea, which expel it from the body. Vomiting and diarrhea can be seen as the body's natural healing mechanism, but this is not like ordinary "food poisoning," where vomiting once and having diarrhea twice can solve the problem. Cholera bacteria continuously multiply in the intestinal tract, making it difficult to stop the vomiting and diarrhea, eventually leading to the loss of fluids from various organs. The subsequent impact of fluid loss causes blood circulation problems, making it difficult to eliminate bacteria, and weakening the body's resistance, creating a cause-and-effect relationship that endangers life.

The pathology of cholera is now fairly well understood, but there is no effective treatment for the causative bacteria, so the treatment methods are still not satisfactory. Scholars have varying opinions and different viewpoints. In essence, they are all doing their best and leaving the rest to fate. In 1831, British doctor Thomas Latho introduced the use of isotonic saline (physiological saline) injections, which significantly improved dehydration and collapse caused by frequent vomiting and diarrhea and was temporarily regarded as a life-saving remedy. However, upon closer examination, it is still only a symptomatic treatment. According to statistics from British doctor Rogers:

·Year of Implementation· ·Treatment Method· ·Patients Treated: Mortality Rate·
1895-1905 Subcutaneous injection of isotonic saline 1243 59.0%
1906 Intravenous injection of isotonic saline 112 51.0%
1907 Subcutaneous injection of isotonic saline 158 59.5%

As the statistics show, despite injections of physiological saline, cholera mortality remains high. Naturally, it cannot be denied that the patient's blood circulation improves after the injection, gaining time for the body to form immune forces and exert its healing functions. Therefore, saline injection is a necessary treatment for dehydration during cholera and is recognized by doctors.

Scholars have also discussed the efficacy of physiological saline. As recorded in Chen's book: "The duration of its effect is often short, or it may even lead to a relapse after several hours." "The patient may feel slightly better, but ultimately there is not much effect." All of this coincides with Mr. Lu's statement that "after two or three hours, a relapse occurs, and they cannot be saved." The function of physiological saline should not be overestimated. Rogers, in view of this, introduced the use of hypertonic saline, claiming that its efficacy was extraordinary and greatly reduced the mortality rate. Those who sell melons do not say their melons are bitter, and some think this is an exaggeration. In addition, Ringer's solution and Locke's solution are also used for cholera. Their composition is more complex than physiological saline, and their effectiveness seems to be better, but I have not read widely enough to see the statistics. That being said, physiological saline seems to be used the most, perhaps because it is cheaper.

The method of treating cholera in Songyin, as described by Mr. Lu, can be said to fully follow established methods. The reason why the mortality rate is so high, in my opinion, may be that the pathogens circulating there have a stronger toxicity, so their killing power is also greater. Mr. Lu said, "Having read in the newspaper that the cholera mortality rate in Shanghai is only below 20%," expressing admiration and pleading for the patients in Songyin. I dare to tell Mr. Lu that this is what the newspaper reported, so-called recording everything heard, and it is another matter. I also used to engage in "epidemic" treatment in Shanghai and remember that staff reported the number of people treated and died, which did not necessarily match the facts. After all, these were not academic figures. I also remember that those who temporarily stayed in the morgue were all treated according to protocol, and doctors would do their best. Without effective antibacterial agents, no matter the medical skills, some patients still "died after all." I imagine it is the same everywhere.

Regarding more effective antibacterial agents, it can be said that we have been looking forward to them for a long time. Since sulfonamides suddenly emerged as a treatment, many people have tried them. Among them, sulfadiazine has received much praise, scattered throughout the medical literature. Undoubtedly, it is currently the only effective antibacterial agent for cholera. However, sulfaguanidine, which has always been considered a potent intestinal disinfectant that is not easily absorbed in the intestine and produces a higher concentration, does not work for cholera. According to an experiment by Garruthers in 1942, 50 cholera patients were treated with sulfaguanidine, with another 88 patients used as a control group. There was no difference in the course and severity of the disease between the two groups. Its advanced formulation, succinylsulfathiazole, has not been recommended by scholars in the literature for cholera. Last year, a colleague of mine replied to Mr. Lu, saying, "Sulfaguanidine can be taken internally," which is corrected here.

When I treated cholera last year, I used sulfathiazole instead of sulfadiazine due to a lack of the latter. The effect was not weak, and the price was relatively low, which is worth noting.

The abhorrent vomiting of cholera prevents patients from taking medication. The anti-emetics that have always been used can be said to be ineffective. The only ones that are relatively effective for a short time are morphine preparations. However, this is not a fundamental solution; the effect of the drug disappears, and vomiting continues. Moreover, there are still some concerns regarding its use. My observation is that after injecting sulfadiazine or sulfathiazole, if one can endure for a moment, vomiting can indeed be reduced, and it becomes gradually easier to take medication and drink water. Naturally, if vomiting is truly too frequent, it cannot be completely avoided.

Supplementing bodily fluids, plasma seems to be the most ideal, but this product was mostly imported and is currently difficult to obtain. Although China has already established a dry blood plasma production facility (see Military Medical Digest), it is unlikely to be universally supplied, and I have no experience in its use, so I will not discuss it further. Physiological saline, however, is the most widely used. However, if the patient is in a state of drowsiness, glucose solution or Ringer's solution should be used. Simple physiological saline is not effective. In addition, in order to prevent patients from developing acidosis and sulfonamides from precipitating crystals in the kidneys, do not forget to provide the patient with an appropriate amount of sodium bicarbonate. Established formulas of cardiac stimulants and diuretics should still be used. As for patient care, follow the old rules.

Some patients with early stages of dehydration who are not very severe can be injected with sulfonamides and then given an appropriate amount to take internally, along with instructions to drink small amounts of beverages from time to time. The symptoms gradually subside and stop, leading to recovery. This is much more convenient than administering cholera drops and adsorbents, which ultimately require injections of saline.

I contracted cholera in 1926 and experienced the taste of intravenous saline injections. I also engaged in "epidemic" treatment. The effectiveness of intravenous saline injections should not be denied, but the chills and high fever after the injection are unbearable. However, if the intravenous injection volume is not too large each time, from 500 cc to 1000 cc, it may not cause a reaction. The rest can be administered subcutaneously. Cholera has incurable cases, but there are also cases of death due to "water poisoning." Therefore, when injecting saline, the quality of the saline, the amount of water, the temperature of the water, and the cleanliness and sterilization of the equipment must all be carefully considered.

### Nervousness by Yu Zhengxing

Wherever there are humans in the universe, there will be nervousness. Nervousness is an abnormal phenomenon, causing the individual to feel uneasy and tense, while others perceive their behavior as unusual. Nervousness results from disappointment or fear and is often triggered by some physiological or psychological illness. Nervous people often experience excessive anxiety about an imagined physiological or psychological abnormality.

The symptoms of nervousness are endless, varying in severity, depending entirely on the individual's constitution and their sensitivity to internal and external stimuli. Some people are tormented by their own rapid heartbeat, while others cannot tolerate chaotic environments. Other symptoms of nervousness include anxiety, unease, fidgeting with clothing, stuttering, trembling, staring, blushing, rapid heartbeat and breathing, goosebumps, sweating, and diarrhea. People with these conditions may or may not be aware of them.

A nervous personality can often be detected shortly after birth. The form may vary with age, but abnormal states are visible in each period. Crying babies are easily startled. Those who were resistant may become shy, timid, and cowardly, or they may become noisy, violent, and destructive. When they reach their teens, they will develop various behavioral problems, including seclusion, prudence, and quietness. Some may pathologically lie, skip school, or become bullies. Counseling alone cannot correct this personality. A suitable environment can temporarily change it.

During the recovery period from infectious diseases, some patients may develop nervousness. Children become irritable and restless in their sleep, unable to be satisfied. Adults, on the other hand, become fault-finding and argumentative. For example, a person suffering from tuberculosis, upon learning of their illness, is initially terrified. As their temperature drops, their cough decreases, their appetite improves, and they gain weight, they have hope. However, this long-term illness may change their past character and temperament. A strong person may become rude or docile, while a calm person may remain unchanged, but they may become humble or disruptive, though less commonly.

A person who experiences setbacks in work, love, career, or friendships may develop temporary resentment, despair, and anger. They lose interest in people and things, experience insomnia, and other physiological changes. After this initial stage passes, the distress gradually becomes blurred, and the reaction fades away. Their previous personality may reappear, and they start working hard again, eventually achieving success, and all past unhappiness is eliminated.

The classification of diseases has increased our knowledge of psychoanalysis. Simple emotional instability can lead to nervousness or contain other factors. Anxiety states are the most common type, similar to worry or fear. This is the most common mental disturbance and is not very serious. However, when it occurs severely or persists, anxiety can cause a great deal of distress. Anxiety can affect physical health. Simple and easily curable anxiety states can lead to weight loss, weakness, anemia, and pain due to neglect.

Many people's personalities are insufficient to cope with failure. When internal distress becomes too great, the emotional response changes or is projected onto imagined illnesses or disabilities. Many paralyzed or blind people are cured after praying to Buddha, performing religious rituals, or undergoing hypnosis. They belong to this category. Psychoanalytic therapy is effective for most of these patients.

Another type of nervousness involves patients with a fixed idea. They suspect they have a certain disease, fear certain places, are afraid to go out alone, or are afraid to perform a certain action, such as opening a door. Those obsessed with ghosts and spirits belong to this category. These people are very distressed, as they are continuously repeating some matters, dangerous or terrible thoughts and actions. These patients tend to have introverted personalities and are highly prone to fixed ideas, making them difficult to cure. Transferring their ideas with healthier thoughts or actions can reduce their worries. Based on psychoanalytic healing experience, recalling the events that led to the fixed idea in a "shock" state can compensate for or neutralize these related thoughts and actions. However, this is very difficult to do because patients often completely forget the initial events. Even after years of psychoanalysis and interpretation, the cause remains unclear. Regardless, the assistance of a psychoanalytic expert can still alleviate the patient's condition. These patients are very careful in their daily lives and have no physical illnesses. They can hardly be certain about anything, but despite their distress, they can still perform daily work and take care of themselves.

Tics or habitual spasms are simple automations of voluntary muscles, usually in the head or face. These mimic reactions to a strong insult or are remnants of those reactions, or the price of an aversion to a feeling or thought. Just like any habit, this is unconscious. It is not difficult to eliminate with willpower.

The so-called hypochondria, originally referred specifically to those who believed they had a disease on the right side of their abdomen. Now, in medicine, it broadly refers to anyone who suspects they have a disease in any part of their body, especially the abdomen. This includes those who feel the affected area is constantly changing, moving from one place to another. These people often unconsciously harbor a desire to attract attention, but they are not aware of it.

People with mental illnesses can naturally also experience nervousness. Here, it should be specifically pointed out that mild mental disorders are clearly different from mental illnesses and are not a part of mental illness. The two cannot be merged or combined. Their difference is like a sore throat versus pneumonia. Neither is hereditary. An abnormal personality may be hereditary, but mental disorders do not develop in this way. People with mild mental disorders can hold jobs and occupy high positions in many professions. As for those with true mental illnesses and insanity, they do not have this ability. Nervousness is the main concern in mild mental disorders, while in mania or other functional diseases of psychological dysfunction, it is insignificant.

What can be done about nervousness and emotional imbalance? The approach is the same as treating any illness: to achieve a thorough cure, the cause must be removed. This is often possible, but it is sometimes difficult to determine the cause of nervousness. While searching for this spiritual wound, simultaneously advise the patient to pay attention to their personal physiological needs, such as sleep, nutrition, and cleanliness, and use work, entertainment, or exercise to forget disturbing thoughts.

In the past 50 years, psychoanalysis has seen three major advances: hypnosis, the analysis and explanation of psychological mechanisms, and "shock" therapy. Although these three methods take different paths, they are all used to resolve the emotional factors and abnormalities of psychological phenomena. Naturally, drugs and physical therapies can also help with treatment. Each case has its own unique needs. A person with mild nervousness only needs to have a simple discussion with a doctor to properly organize the relevant issues.

The prognosis of nervousness is difficult to predict. Generally, if nervousness is the primary concern, as in mild mental disorders, the outcome is often recovery. If the patient is particularly attentive to seeking proper treatment, recovery is quick. Fixed ideas are more difficult because the patient is stubborn and unwilling to listen to the advice of psychoanalytic experts.

Taking infectious diseases as an example, it took a long time for the public to understand the value of prevention. Successful health campaigns require everyone's cooperation. Prevention of mental illness is equally important. Family styles, paternal attitudes, school education, and social environments are all related to human mental disorders. Harmonious human relationships are the most important goal of the mental hygiene movement. It is more effective in preventing mental disorders than methods of preventing tuberculosis and syphilis. Therefore, everyone must work to support the mental hygiene movement and improve human relationships. Seek balance, learn tolerance and reconciliation, and avoid stubbornness and animosity. Such actions will surely bring comfort and happiness, and one will never suffer from nervousness.

### Random Musings on Typhoid Fever Treatment (Part 1) by Shou Wuqing

Typhoid fever is the most common infectious disease in summer, well known to readers. The length of its course always makes patients impatient. Those fortunate enough not to be affected do not realize the happiness of health, while those who are affected suddenly feel the suffering of depression. If one can control their diet and be careful of cold and heat, then the way to prevent illness will be half achieved.

I once saw a child surnamed Jia, who had a high fever for 12 days. Because his parents did not recognize the illness, they forced him to go to school. One evening, he returned home exhausted and collapsed at the threshold. After medical treatment, it was found to be typhoid fever. Another child, Yi, had been ill for a week. One day, guests arrived, and he ate a large amount of soda and ice cream, followed by stir-fried noodles with shredded meat as a snack. In the evening, his fever rose to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. After examination, it was also typhoid fever. A third child, Bing, aged five, had had a fever, cough, and nosebleeds for five days. His parents suspected a cold. After medical consultation, it was determined to be typhoid fever. All were cured one by one. Conversely, a fourth child, Ding, had a fever, severe cough, and rapid breathing for five days without relief. His father firmly believed it was typhoid fever, but the diagnosis was pneumonia. A fifth child, Wu, had chills and fever for six days, with a high of 104 degrees Fahrenheit and a low of 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit, interspersed with shivering, followed by profuse sweating. His mother undoubtedly thought it was typhoid fever. I treated him with pain relief, and he recovered the next day. Such cases are countless. All are due to a lack of recognition of typhoid fever symptoms, or vague symptoms, without understanding the beginning and end, confusing a deer for a horse. Therefore, before treating typhoid fever, an accurate diagnosis is necessary.

Typhoid fever treatment involves a mix of Chinese and Western medicine, plus folk remedies and over-the-counter drugs, numbering no less than thousands. However, there is no specific method that can cure it immediately, which is recognized by doctors at home and abroad, past and present. However, treating the disease when it appears and treating the symptoms when they appear is indispensable when one unfortunately contracts typhoid fever. Moreover, according to my humble opinion, if the treatment can be sustained and is not delayed for too long, the mortality rate is not too high. I have summarized the general treatment methods for typhoid fever into eight points for amateur readers to refer to and understand the outline.

(1) Cleansing and Purging Treatment:
This is used in the early stages of typhoid fever, within a few days, when symptoms such as chills, fever, greasy tongue coating, bad breath, and constipation are present. Mild laxatives such as calomel tablets, sesame oil, liquid paraffin, and agarol are effective. Small doses are better. Watery laxatives and strong laxatives are prohibited. They should not be used in the second week, otherwise, they may cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal distension, intestinal bleeding, and other dangers.

(2) Fever Reducing Treatment
From the first week of typhoid fever, body temperature gradually rises, reaching between 103 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the second week, with slight decreases in the morning and higher temperatures in the afternoon. The sick body is plagued by the heat, making it difficult to turn around as desired. Therefore, the issue of reducing fever has value for consideration. The most common antipyretics are paracetamol tablets and antipyrine tablets. Absolutely do not use large doses; it is better to use small doses multiple times. Quinine powder can sometimes be used, and tasteless quinine powder can be used instead for young children. As for anti-inflammatory tablets such as diagen tablets, they are ineffective. The new pulmonary disease medicine, Stricto Measule (not specifically for lung disease, the name is inappropriate, there is no suitable translation in Shanghai, it should be translated as Streptomycin, hoping to match the original name), is effective against various bacilli, but it has no fever-reducing effect on typhoid bacilli.

(3) Fluid Therapy:
This is purely a Westernized treatment, which some may consider unsuitable for the constitution of the Chinese people. Hospitals mostly adopt it. The method involves using cold water baths, ice tooth brushing, wearing ice caps, ice packs, or cold water recirculation tubes, and applying cold water and alcohol to the body when the heat is too high (i.e., above 103 degrees Fahrenheit). The purpose is to evaporate moisture and dissipate heat rapidly from the body, thereby achieving the purpose of reducing fever. It is performed in the summer, when a hot body already feels uncomfortable; how can it be used in autumn and winter? It is not surprising in foreign countries. An eighty-year-old man still takes a cold water bath in the morning when the ice and snow are cold, as a habit. Therefore, this ice and fluid therapy is quite refreshing, but people in Shanghai do not have this habit. When suffering from typhoid fever, only pressing the forehead with a cold water towel or using a cold water bag as a pillow can still be adopted. It is also difficult in cold weather in autumn and winter.

(4) Bed Rest Therapy:
From the incubation period to the recovery period of typhoid fever, which lasts for several weeks, one must rest in bed. First, to regulate the normal heart and strength; second, to reduce the consumption of physical strength. At the same time, it can avoid accidents and the risk of intestinal perforation. Poor patients who have difficulty seeking medical treatment must maintain bed rest to await the recovery of the disease. Excessive movement, getting up, getting out of bed to go to the toilet, etc., which violate the purpose of bed rest therapy, should be absolutely prohibited. The supine position is preferred. Thin patients and those with painful bedsores can lie on their side. Care must be taken when turning over, relying entirely on the assistance of caregivers.

(5) Dietary Therapy:
Diet plays an extremely important role throughout the course of typhoid fever. Liquids that can be used include rice soup, lotus root starch, clear soup, and vegetable soup. Wait until the heat goes down, then add vermicelli soup, biscuits, eggs, beef soup, chicken soup, tomato soup, etc. Gradually increase the amount and concentration until normal diet is restored. At the same time, observe body temperature, which is the only focus of dietary therapy. If the method is wrong or the selection is careless, it may cause a relapse. Children who have recovered from the disease often do not have enough to eat. Therefore, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, porridge, and candy must be stored outside the room to prevent them from taking food on their own, in addition to being given at regular times. As for fruits, fresh tangerines can be used, and pears can also be used. Apples can also be used after recovery, but bananas, persimmons, and peaches are not suitable. Some use watermelon as a cooling agent, but it is prone to cause fullness and bloating, which I dare not agree with. (To be continued)

### Social Services: Tuberculosis Treatment (Part 1)

To promote national health and advocate for tuberculosis prevention, this newspaper has partnered with ten major hospitals to sponsor free tuberculosis X-ray examinations. Since the start on April 20th, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic, indicating that the prevalence of tuberculosis is indeed a common phenomenon, and its deep impact is self-evident. This time, this newspaper's advocacy for tuberculosis prevention has alerted those who were unaware early and allowed those who are already ill to be treated early and regain their health. Some young people, after this examination, realized that they had contracted tuberculosis, which inevitably leads to a decline in morale. In view of this, this newspaper has specially invited Dr. Wu Shaoqing, Director-General of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Joint Committee and Director of the Tuberculosis Center Clinic, to write this article, instructing patients on how to recuperate and receive treatment. It aims to encourage the courage of patients spiritually, save the consumption of patients materially, and promote the recovery of patients physically. This newspaper has printed special leaflets to distribute to patients, hoping that everyone will carefully experience and follow the instructions, and work together to eradicate this evil tuberculosis bacteria to achieve the goal of this newspaper's advocacy for tuberculosis prevention. (Editor)

Fluoroscopic lung examination is a reliable method for detecting tuberculosis, but its accuracy is not absolutely reliable in extremely mild cases. If lung disease or suspected lung disease is found after fluoroscopy, it is necessary to follow the doctor's instructions and retake X-ray films for more accurate research.

In order to answer common questions from people with lung disease and to address the matters that should be noted, without exploring academic theories, I will provide simple and practical explanations for general patients to refer to for medical treatment and recuperation.

(A) The Attitude That Patients Should Have
Finding out that you have lung disease is not a happy thing, but it is not a terrible thing either. It is fortunate to find a thief hidden in the home; otherwise, if it is hidden and unnoticed, the harm will be greater. Discovering tuberculosis has the same meaning. However, suddenly hearing the doctor's diagnosis is always shocking, and one's spirit suffers some impact. This is human nature. However, those with strong willpower can embrace the spirit of fearlessness, calmly deal with it, keep their minds calm, not panic, and overcome their own diseases step by step. These people, even if their lung disease is severe, can often be effectively treated and can be determined to be cured because they have the determination to overcome the bacteria. There is also a type of person with weak willpower. Upon hearing that they have lung disease, it is like a death sentence. Their spirits are lost, and they feel sorry for themselves, even falling into despair, ultimately unable to break free. Even if the disease is mild, it can often worsen, leading to no cure because they lack courage and the determination to overcome the bacteria. You must know that if you do not overcome tuberculosis, tuberculosis will definitely overcome you. Those who lack a fighting spirit are not qualified to talk about war. Is overcoming tuberculosis any different?

P.S.
For those who request leaflets, please include a return envelope with the recipient's detailed address and sufficient postage. Sincerely.

### Reply to Jiang Bojun
Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation After Restoration states: "If, after the establishment of a legal act, due to reasons not attributable to the parties, the circumstances change, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and the original effect is obviously unfair, the court should fairly adjudicate and increase or decrease the payment or change other original effects." Therefore, the first request made by the other party is reasonable. This matter should be resolved through consultation and negotiation.

### Reader of This Newspaper, Mr. Jin De, Generously Donates 5 Million Yuan to the Families of Martyred Journalists

Dear Editor: Having read about your newspaper's "Relief Fund for the Families of Martyred Journalists," I deeply sympathize with the loyal and help the orphans and widows. It is the responsibility of us who survive. If your newspaper can investigate and announce the names of the martyred journalists and the situation and number of their families, donors will have a goal, and the amount of donations may be more enthusiastic. Moreover, the newspaper and media giants, as colleagues or employers of the martyred journalists, should be more concerned about protecting the families of the martyred journalists than other sectors. If they can donate and promote it and publish it daily in your newspaper, it will attract the attention of the public and accomplish this righteous act, which I think will be supported by the media. Is this appropriate? I respectfully ask for your opinion. I am enclosing a check for 5 million yuan to you. It is just a drop in the bucket, expressing my sympathy. Respectfully,

Sincerely, Jin De, the sponsor of the Relief Fund for the Families of Martyred Journalists, organized by Shenbao.

### Odds and Ends from the Spring and Autumn by Shi Jimi

Small Raindrops II

One

"Every family has rain during the plum rain season." So, every household puts mothballs in their chests and cabinets to prevent the clothes that have been left for years from becoming moldy.

Why don't human memories become moldy? It would be so great if memories could also become moldy. However, that is impossible because mothballs of emotion are placed in the memory chest.

Two

People complain about the frivolousness of peach blossoms because they drift with the waves. However, Mr. Wuliu, the lofty scholar who loved chrysanthemums, also used them to adorn the otherworldly paradise of the Wuling fisherman. Are you more noble than Tao Jingjie?

If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a reason!

Three

The fan said, "Without me, how could you get through this scorching July?"

You self-important little thing, where did you come from without mankind's omnipotent hands! Where does your wind come from?

Four

The spider in front of the eaves is mocking the silkworm for making a cocoon and binding itself.

The silkworm said, "I don't deny my stupidity, but when I have spun all my silk, my life will also end. But you, clever friend, you painstakingly weave your web, but why do you trouble yourself to sit in the center of the web..."

Five

In a small book with a purple cover, I found a lovely sentence: "In this world, some first encounters are like reunions." Yes, that's great, but another sentence should be added: "There are also hundreds of meetings that are still like first encounters."

Six

Ah, evening glow, you are the poem left by the setting sun on the horizon as it departs, enough for me to linger hundreds and thousands of times.

"When a person is about to die, their words are good; when a bird is about to die, its cries are sad." Parting words are always easier to leave in memory than initial conversations.

Seven

There are ten thousand fireflies in the wasteland. Are you stars exiled from heaven? Banished to the human world, still unable to forget, remembering to release your light!

Eight

Tulip, may I pick one? I want to use you to replace the cup of life, lightly pouring a cup of light water and giving it to my friend.

Nine

Don't think about last night's moon because "the plan for the day is in the morning."

Take another look at the sunset on the ancient pagoda, because "it's just near dusk."

When you are young, don't look back; when you are old, don't look ahead. Clever friend, are you willing to remember this ignorant warning?

Ten

Lotus seed, why is your heart so bitter?

The withered lotus flower sighed, "Have you forgotten how I struggled in that dirty swamp?"

Eleven

Yanhong, what is your original name? Did you not even have a name before the wild geese came south?

Yanhong replied shyly, "People have forgotten my original name; I am called Autumn Color."

Twelve

Why, even when the lotus root is cut, are the fibers still connected?

The knife said, "Because it has many hearts."

Thirteen

Sometimes, a string of pearls cannot buy half a smile; and some people, with a sigh, can exchange for many tears.

Fourteen

You say, is there fair trade in the friendship market?

The scavenging child carefully searches for useful things in the garbage.

People who enjoy leisure and pleasure turn useful things into garbage.

Fifteen

When the child grows up, he puts the doll he played with day and night in a broken box. The doll feels neglected and sighs with sadness. There is also a broken tumbler in the box, which was the child's father's childhood favorite and has been exiled here

### Hesitant Buyers, Sluggish Transactions of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the resurgence of Yong Shajigongsi stocks dimmed the luster of other popular stocks. Sin Hwa and China Silk once hit their daily trading limits due to price drops. The new Yong Shajigongsi stocks were weak, and the bears' momentum increased. Buyers hesitated, and deliveries remained sluggish. Arbitrage interest rates fell to as low as six cents, with little demand. The entire morning's trading was languid and unbearable. Near closing, active traders began to reverse their positions on Yong Shajigongsi, switching from selling to buying. American Asiatic also saw some short covering, with prices rebounding after falling.

At the opening, attention was diverted by the debut of new Yong Shajigongsi stocks at 200 yuan, causing other stocks to fluctuate. After the debut of Yong Shajigongsi, traders numbered 223, 22, 235, 35, 85, 202, 224, 77, and 65 all began selling. Although Kwong Hong traders numbered 218 and 45, along with New China and others, tried to hold Yong Shajigongsi at 200 yuan, the overall trend was against them, and this level was eventually broken. Trader 223 simultaneously sold American Asiatic aggressively, causing the market atmosphere to weaken again. Yong Shajigongsi fell to 186 yuan. At 9:30 AM, traders 49 and 169 pushed Yong Shajigongsi back up to 198 yuan. Trader 235 liquidated spot Yong Shajigongsi, and traders 104 and 152 also sold, driving the price back down to 186 yuan. At 10:00 AM, traders 231 and 76 made some purchases, but the increase was minimal. Traders 224 and 335 sold spot Yong Shajigongsi, and trader 35 also dumped Yong Shajigongsi delivery contracts, causing both spot and delivery prices to fall to 180 yuan. Sino-Foreign trade was sparse; traders 35 and 152 slightly divested, and delivery contracts plummeted to the daily limit at 10:15 AM. Other smaller, popular stocks also consistently fell to lower prices. At 10:35 AM, traders 202, 218, and 102 showed slightly stronger buying interest, and Yong Shajigongsi delivery contracts rebounded to 192 yuan. Traders 235, 14, and 27 continued to sell spot Yong Shajigongsi. Traders 231, 36, 102, and 22 further pushed Yong Shajigongsi delivery contracts down to 185 yuan. Traders 223, 32, and 142 dumped small amounts of American Asiatic, with delivery contracts at 430 yuan and spot contracts at a low of 423 yuan. Around 11:45 AM, traders 133, 104, 61, 129, 224, 2322, 117, and 141 all absorbed some stock, with trader 224 showing the strongest buying interest. Before closing, Yong Shajigongsi delivery contracts rebounded to 195 yuan, and spot contracts to 191 yuan. American Asiatic was bought up by traders 186 and 85, among others, and delivery contracts also rebounded to above 450 yuan. Traders 4, 153, 32, and retail investors continued to sell. Yong Shajigongsi closed at 191 yuan. American Asiatic's delivery contracts retreated to 440 yuan by closing time, with supply from trader 154 and arbitrage. Other stocks were generally stagnant. In the end, compared to the previous closing prices, Sino-Foreign, China United, China-France, and Keen Hing spot stocks each fell by slightly more than half a percent. American Asiatic, New Kwong, and King Fook each fell by around 10 percent. New China and Yong Shajigongsi suffered minor setbacks. China Silk rebounded after hitting its limit, reducing its loss to slightly more than half a percent. New Asia and Commercial Press rose slightly. China Textile, National Goods, King Lun, and An Nei Yi each fell by half a percent. Other stocks generally reported slight declines. In terms of delivery contracts, Sino-Foreign rebounded after hitting its limit, with losses of slightly less than half a percent. American Asiatic, China United, New Kwong, King Fook, and Keen Hing fell by slightly more than half a percent. Yong Shajigongsi suffered a minor setback. Older stocks outside the market remained sluggish.

Spot and delivery arbitrage funds were scarce. Yesterday, under pressure from short sellers, few people were interested in delivery contracts, leading to excess positions for banks such as traders 45, 207, and 220. Interest rates fell, with combined interest rates retreating from 12 cents to slightly more than 5 cents, eventually settling at around 9 cents. American Asiatic opened at 10 yuan, fell to 8 yuan, rebounded to 13 yuan, and closed at 10 yuan. Yong Shajigongsi retreated from 4.5 yuan to 3.5 yuan, New Kwong from 5 yuan to 3.5 yuan, Sino-Foreign from 100 yuan to 50 yuan, and China United from 3 yuan to 2 yuan.

Compared to the previous closing prices, United Types A and B each rose by 500 yuan, United Type C rose by 900 yuan, United Type D rose by 700 yuan, and United Type E rose by 800 yuan.

Yesterday, Kwong Hong engaged in some arbitrage buying of foreign stocks, and securities firms also showed buying interest. Although foreign firms sold, there was still a slight improvement. Banks supplied Union Insurance, which made it the weakest. Jardine Silk opened at 64,000 yuan and rose to close at 70,500 yuan. Compared to the previous closing prices, Jardine Silk and Steel each rose by half a percent, Union Insurance and Paper suffered slight setbacks, while Eastern Kwong and Ping An were flat, and the rest rose slightly.

### China Trust Bureau Completes Rapeseed Collection

[Our Reporter] According to information from the Central Trust Bureau: As of now, the total amount of rapeseed collected has reached nearly 50,000 dan, including 15,000 dan from Pinghu, 18,000 dan from Suzhou, and 12,000 dan from Wuhu. The total amount of funds used for the collection has reached over 13 billion yuan. The bureau's rapeseed collection work has now come to a temporary halt.

### Nylon's Popularity Dominates, Our Silk Exports Dim, Japanese and Italian Dumping in the US Market Also Fierce Competition

Recently, silk sales in the US market have become sluggish for all silk-producing countries. The crux of the problem is not simply that costs and prices cannot be matched. According to a confirmed report received by a local silk export leader from the US yesterday, the number of silk sales there last month was only 1,045 bales, while the amount of goods shipped from Japan and Italy was as high as 52,776 bales. If the monthly sales are projected based on the above figures, it will take some time to sell out. Moreover, Japan intends to increase production, and it is estimated that it can produce 150,000 bales per year. Because of this, silk merchants in New York are competing with each other, with some dropping the price from US$4.20 per pound to US$3.70. In this situation, the future of silk exports is bleak. However, qualified people analyzed the underlying factors, which are due to the increased production of nylon substitutes. Americans like new things and dislike old things, and nylon is popular with customers because of its low cost and easy profit.

With automatic machines for weaving silk products, one person can manage up to 15 units, while for weaving nylon, one person can manage 35 to 40 units. Moreover, before the war, silk weaving machines were converted to nylon machines due to the interruption of raw materials during the war. If they were to be converted again, it would be very expensive. Furthermore, considering that silk was used for military purposes during the war, such as parachutes, radio insulation, and essential materials in submarines, there is a big question as to whether the supply of silk can be uninterrupted given the unpredictable international situation.

Currently, the only way to save silk from this crisis is to work hard to improve product quality, to seek uniform grades, to meet export standards, and to strengthen international publicity, so that those who love silk fabrics can understand the elegance and toughness of silk products. Moreover, nylon products have no pores and are not suitable for human skin, so it is necessary to wait for customers to distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of this item before the future of silk can shine again.

### China Textile Valuation Committee Reviews Asset Unit Prices

[Our Reporter] The valuation committee of China Textile Construction Corporation held a meeting at the company yesterday afternoon.

Afterwards, it was resolved to form another inspection team, divided into mechanical, chemical, and factory base groups, to conduct a separate review. The review work can be completed in about a month. The valuation work of the company can also be temporarily completed.

### Cotton Market Turns Weak

Yesterday's spot cotton market was characterized by panic due to the continuous decline in yarn and cloth prices. Retail investors scrambled to sell, and prices of high-grade cotton gradually fell. Eventually, yarn factories absorbed some at lower prices, and the market stabilized slightly. Lingbao cotton saw the most trading activity, as its price was nearly the same as that of Shashi, and had already fallen to the lowest limit compared to other prices, so yarn factories competed to buy it. Factory delivery prices for Lingbao cotton were 2.19 million, 2.15 million, 2.20 million, and 2.22 million. Shashi was 2.07 million, cocoon Taicang 1.86 million, Chongnan Tai 1.80 million, and fire machine 1.84 million. Prices for warehouse delivery were Lingbao 2.07 million, 2.10 million, 2.12 million, 2.13 million, 2.15 million, 2.16 million, 2.18 million, L.S.S. 2.25 million, Han fine 2.08 million, sea flower 1.80 million, and Zhoupu seed flower 320,000 per group.

### Cotton Transported to Tianjin

### Representatives of Jiangyin Native Cloth Industry Apply to Textile Regulation for Cotton Yarn Allocation

Over 700,000 Farmers and Workers Rely on Weaving for a Living

Jiangyin native cloth is a special product of the county, and has long enjoyed a great reputation. Before the war, it was exported as far as the South Seas Islands, Mongolia, and Xinjiang. After the victory, they resumed their business one after another. Recently, after the implementation of the cotton yarn allocation system, the black market has become rampant, and the industry has been greatly affected. They have repeatedly appealed to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, etc., requesting the allocation of cotton yarn, but it has not been approved. Therefore, the industry sent representatives Ye Haoran and others to the China Textile Construction Company with a letter applying for cotton yarn allocation. Vice General Manager Wu Weijing received them and promised to consider it, and the result was satisfactory. They also plan to make the same request to the Textile Industry Regulation Committee, and their eight reasons are as follows: (1) Purchasing cotton yarn from the black market to weave native cloth increases costs and affects exports. (2) Those who set up factories can get cotton yarn allocation, but those who do not set up factories cannot get cotton yarn allocation. It seems unfair to treat the same replication industry differently. (3) Native cloth is woven and used by poor farmers and workers, which is of great importance to people's livelihood. (4) Jiangyin is located in a key location and is the source of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army, which caused the enemy army to hate it deeply, and almost all materials were burned and looted. It is urgent to use work as a substitute for disaster relief. (5) More than 700,000 farmers and workers in Jiangyin rely on weaving native cloth for wages and living. When they heard that the native cloth industry could not get cotton yarn allocation, they were panicked and deeply worried about unemployment. (6) After the government's rehabilitation, in order to encourage native cloth production and support the national economy, it exempted taxes. Now it is difficult to survive due to the ravages of the black market price of cotton yarn. Please allocate cotton yarn as soon as possible to maintain it. (7) There are more than 110,000 cloth machines in Jiangyin, which is the most in the country and has a long history. (8) In the midst of the prevailing cotton yarn black market, it is impossible for the native cloth industry to survive. In addition to applying for cotton yarn allocation, there is no other good solution.

### China Trust Bureau Resumes Investment Trust Securities, Committee Re-appointed
