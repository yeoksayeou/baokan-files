### National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Yuan Members' Election Dates Decided Separately; Voting in Late October and December

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The third committee meeting of the General Election Office was held at 3:00 PM on the 10th. Chairman Zhang Lisheng presided over the meeting, and the following important matters were discussed and approved: (1) Decided on the format of the nomination and signature forms for candidates for National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members. (2) Decided that the General Election Office will draft general rules for the meetings of the election committees of district-level election offices, which will be submitted to the meeting for approval and then promulgated. (3) Decided that voting for National Assembly representatives will be held on October 21st, 22nd, and 23rd (three days), and voting for Legislative Yuan members will be held on December 21st, 22nd, and 23rd (three days). Other opinions related to election affairs were also widely exchanged.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is reported that the election date for Legislative Yuan members has been set for December 21st to 23rd. According to Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law, incumbent civil or military officials who are candidates in the election district under their jurisdiction or where their office is located should resign five months before the election period. Therefore, all incumbent officials who are running for Legislative Yuan membership in their jurisdiction or where their office is located should resign before July 20th. However, given that the election date is approaching rapidly, and to ensure that restricted officials can participate in the election, it has been clarified that the resignation date will be calculated from the date the resignation letter is submitted. The date of submission of the resignation letter must be communicated by the official's superior in the name of the organization to the competent election office via telegram. If the resignation is rejected with persuasion to stay, the date of the resubmitted resignation letter will be used for calculation. If the date of the resubmitted resignation letter is later than July 20th, the resignation will be invalid. The Judicial Yuan has clarified that the scope of officials refers to civil officials above the rank of appointee and military officials above the rank of second lieutenant. The office has clarified that the "election district where the office is located" refers to "the election district where the government office is located." For example, if Zhenjiang County is one of the election districts for Legislative Yuan members in Jiangsu Province and is also the location of the provincial and county governments, then all restricted officials who have not resigned will not be eligible to be elected as Legislative Yuan members in the Zhenjiang election district. Furthermore, the office has also clarified that the "election district of jurisdiction" refers to "the area of jurisdiction, whether partially or wholly included within the scope of an election district, must resign according to law before participating in the election in that election district." For example, if an administrative inspectorate district governs six counties, and these six counties belong to two or more Legislative Yuan member election districts, then the restricted officials of this inspectorate must resign before competing in these multiple election districts.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association held its 17th executive committee meeting at 9:00 AM on the 10th in the conference room on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall.

Subsequently, they unanimously supported the government's issuance of a mobilization order.

[Our Newspaper, Gui绥, 10th] Communist bandits from northern Shaanxi have moved north, entering Otog Banner from Sanduan 土. Yang Sen扎布 telegraphed the province to report the emergency.

[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 10th] Communist bandits in four townships in Chicheng are carrying out bloody struggles. Those with more than 30 acres of land are first struggled against and then killed. The people are terrified and are fleeing to Longguan. More than 200 men, women, and children are hoping that the National Army will send troops to rescue them from the abyss of suffering. Furthermore, according to refugees who recently fled from Hequ, the communist bandits recently held an emergency meeting and decided to launch a fundraising campaign. Wealthy households and those who have made money by joining the Trade Bureau's "turn over" team must donate large amounts of money. If they disobey in the slightest, they will be severely tortured and treated as national special stubborn elements and sentenced to death, with their property confiscated. The communist bandits also instructed their cadres that "now is the time to kill people. If the bourgeoisie does not wake up, they can only be awakened with a knife." Currently, the people in the communist-controlled areas who have a few acres of meager land are unable to survive and are fleeing to our area. Everyone who hears about this is filled with righteous indignation.

[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 10th] At 3:00 AM on the 10th, the Communist Independent Regiment and three county brigades from Yanqing and other counties, totaling more than 1,100 people, suddenly besieged Da Xiaobailao, which is about ten li northwest of our Yongning City. Although our self-defense force only had more than 30 people, they were able to use small but strong stronghold fortifications to resist bravely. After an hour of fierce fighting, the communist bandits were unable to succeed. A certain regiment of the National Army received the news and dispatched a battalion to quickly provide support. At 4:00 AM, they arrived and coordinated with our self-defense force, launching a pincer attack on the bandits from both inside and outside. After two hours, at dawn, the entire bandit force was defeated. It is estimated that the bandits left behind 100 corpses, and hundreds were wounded. More than 90 prisoners were captured, and three light machine guns and 50 or 60 rifles were seized. Our self-defense force suffered less than ten casualties.

The State Department's statement was issued by the newly appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Armer, and stated that US$1,095,020.32 of the aforementioned figure was interest due on July 1, 1947.

Based on the estimated total debt owed by China under the June 14, 1946, Lend-Lease Oil Pipeline Agreement, which is $51.75 million, the above number accounts for approximately 1/30th of it.

However, the thorough implementation of general mobilization relies on close cooperation between the people and the government. Leng was unwilling to predict when the war to suppress the communist bandits would be concluded. He said that sometimes it is for pure scientists, sometimes it is for non-scientists, so prediction is difficult to be reliable. Leng is scheduled to return to Nanjing in a day or two. He denied the news that he would succeed Li Mo'an as the Pacification Commander of northern Jiangsu.

### Gao Shuxun's Troops in Southeastern Shanxi Clashed Fiercely with the Main Force of the Communist Bandits

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th] Gao Shuxun's troops in southeastern Shanxi, who are holding up the banner of the Chinese Communist Party, are on the verge of clashing fiercely with the main force of the communist bandits. Gao's troops have withdrawn all units east of Dongyangguan westward, and the main force is concentrated in the Changzhi, Lucheng, Licheng, and Nangyuan areas. It is reported that Gao himself is currently stationed in the strongholds of Beijiaoshan City and Nanwulongshan, northeast of Changzhi City, and is currently strengthening fortifications. According to military sources, Liu Bocheng recently ordered Qin Jiwei, commander of the Communist Taihang Military Region, and Chen Geng, commander of the Fourth Column, to eliminate Gao's troops within a limited time. Chen's main force arrived in Xihuozhen (southeast of Changzhi), and Qin's bandits occupied Dongyangguan (east of Licheng). In addition, more than 10,000 people bearing the designation "New Fourth Army" advanced from northern Henan through Licheng towards Nangyuan, taking an encirclement posture against Gao's troops. Currently, Gao's troops have confiscated all communist bandit trade bureaus, cooperatives, public-run stores, and other production institutions in their controlled areas. Militiamen are uniformly disarmed. On the one hand, they are extensively recruiting people who have been subjected to liquidation and are dissatisfied with the communist bandits' brutal behavior.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] There is great expectation from all sides regarding the border demarcation issue between China and Outer Mongolia.

### Arrested Communist Personnel in Chongqing Confirmed to Have Solid Evidence After Investigation

The remaining, after the headquarters' multi-faceted investigation and questioning, are believed to have solid evidence against them. Those who admitted to being underground Communist workers or having close relations with the Communist Party totaled 32 people, who are still being held for questioning and have not been released. A reporter recently met with Commander Sun Yuanliang of the headquarters, who said: "These 32 people detained are all involved in serious circumstances.

However, for the sake of caring for young people, if they can change their ways, repent, and start anew, they can also be released at our discretion."

### China's Agricultural Mechanization; Currently Sprouting and Actively Promoting; Tractor Tillage Achieves Excellent Results

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] A certain agricultural expert from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry recently gave a speech on the improvement of agricultural machinery and its use by farmers, stating: "European and American countries have moved toward rural electrification, while China's agricultural mechanization is still in its initial stage. The achievements of agricultural mechanization in the United States can serve as a model for our country's efforts. In 1929, one-third of the population of the United States was engaged in farming, producing enough food to be self-sufficient. By the end of 1945, not only was food self-sufficient, but also in large surplus, exported abroad, while the number of people engaged in farming was less than one-fifth of the total population. This is entirely the effect of agricultural mechanization. In contrast, more than 70% of farmers in our country still need to rely on others for food. Irrigation tools are urgently needed in China's rice-growing areas. Currently, they are already being used in various locations. In order to promote this, this year, the Ministry has ordered 12-inch water pumps and 25-horsepower cold-start engines from the Wuxi Farm Tool Factory, nine sets each. It has also cooperated with the Farmers Bank of China to pilot the mechanical irrigation loan purchase demonstration project in Danyang and Jintan counties in Jiangsu. If the results are excellent, it will continue to expand the program. The use of tractors can greatly save labor costs. Currently, tractor tillage stations have been established in Weishi and Fugou in the Yellow River flooded area, Shayang in Hubei, Shatang in Guangxi, and Hengyang in Hunan, with excellent results. With the use of tractors, more than 50 mu can be cultivated every day. Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Northeast provinces are also actively preparing to establish these stations. Other machines such as harvesters, threshers, and rice mills are also very commonly used in various parts of our country."

### President Zhang Proposes to the Economic Commission; Hoping for the Strict Implementation of Savings and Consumption; Executive Yuan Discusses Implementation Measures for Mobilization

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] In order to strictly implement the General Mobilization Plan, President Zhang proposed the "Measures for the Strict Implementation of Savings and Consumption" at the sixth meeting of the National Economic Commission held in the afternoon of the 10th. After the proposal was made, President Zhang himself explained it, hoping that all administrative agencies could take the lead in promoting savings and strictly implement them. In addition, all public banquet expenses must be reduced. After the report was completed, the discussion began. Several committee members suggested that the implementation of savings should emphasize both law and morality, and must be seriously implemented to be effective; otherwise, it would become a mere formality, disturbing the public. Some committee members believed that savings and consumption should pay special attention to large cities such as Shanghai. If such cities are allowed to indulge in extravagant and wasteful spending, then even if we loudly call for savings, it will be in vain. After deliberation, it was decided to hand the matter over to Wang Yunwu, Lou Tongsun, Xiao Jie, Pan Xulun, He Haoruo, and others to form a subcommittee with the Ministry of Social Affairs for further discussion, convened by Wang Yunwu. The main points of President Zhang's original proposal are three: (1) saving manpower, (2) saving materials, and (3) saving time. Subsequently, the "Regulations on the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises" was discussed and approved. It is said that the main task of the committee is to supervise and approve the sale price and other works when state-owned enterprises are sold in the future. The committee members are designated by President Zhang. (2) The principle of reducing organizations, which is the report case of the review subcommittee. After the report, it was approved after discussion. The main task is to first conduct spot checks on the organization, personnel, and expenses of each agency. After the results of the investigation are compiled, a specific plan for reduction will be determined. (3) Li Ming proposed the formation of a committee to assist in the handling of enemy and puppet industries in Shanghai. Chen Lifu and others believed that there was no need to set up another agency. Finally, it was decided that the Shanghai Trust Bureau should first report on the handling process before further discussion. Furthermore, the review reports of the financial subcommittee and the food subcommittee of the economic reform plan have not yet been submitted, and were not discussed at today's meeting. After the comprehensive subcommittee compiles the text, it will be submitted to the seventh plenary meeting next week for discussion. Today's meeting began at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, chaired by President Zhang, with committee members such as Chen Lifu and Huang Yuanbin in attendance.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Executive Yuan has scheduled a temporary meeting to be held on the morning of the 11th to discuss the implementation measures for each department of the General Mobilization Order and the mobilization measures for the economic sector, which will be based on the wartime general mobilization guidelines and coordinated with the economic reform plan to cope with both peacetime and emergency periods. Regarding the food sector, the principles have not yet been decided. Senior officials of the Ministry of Food have been in frequent contact with people from all walks of life in recent days, exchanging opinions extensively.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] In order to study how to cooperate with the national mobilization decrees, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established five subcommittees: (1) General Affairs Subcommittee, handling all document matters. (2) Materials Subcommittee, responsible for studying the control of materials such as cotton yarn. (3) Price Subcommittee, responsible for price management and research on improving the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants.

### Commentary from the Washington Star: Urging the United States to Assist China Promptly; Military Observers Claim the Soviets Are Actively Aiding the CCP

[United Press International, Washington, 9th] The Washington Star editorial stated that if the United States does not aid China, communism will inevitably spread throughout the country, which is of great importance to American foreign policy. The severity of the issue is not only related to American policy towards China and the rest of the Far East, but also to America's global policy. With the $500 million loan to China from the Export-Import Bank set aside, the Chinese government's financial situation and American policy towards China have reached a focal point. The American loan to China was originally attached to conditions, namely that Chinese politics must be on the right track. Marshall's mission as a special envoy to mediate the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists for nearly a year was based on this type of agreement. Since Marshall's return to the United States, the situation in China has been deteriorating, with civil war raging in many places and the economy on the verge of chaos. Assuming that China has lost the opportunity to borrow from the United States, the coalition government, if it includes the Communist Party, will inevitably be allowed to do as it pleases, and will ultimately control the overall situation, or it will be difficult to succeed. If so, isn't the American government asking the impossible of President Chiang?

[Another dispatch] Several American military observers who went to China for inspection and recently returned to the United States stated that since the withdrawal of American troops from North China, Soviet policy towards China has shifted from passive to active. "Before the withdrawal of American troops, the Communist forces in Northeast China and North China felt a severe shortage of military supplies. As soon as the American troops withdrew, the Communist forces in Northeast China launched an offensive and were equipped with artillery pieces, whereas previously they only had one or two field guns." These American officers believe that the Soviet troops in northern Korea are actively assisting the CCP with equipment and the Korean Communists they have trained.

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th] Merchant ships from a certain country, the "Gogol", "Disna", "Simoni", and "Kobosev," have recently been traveling between Vladivostok and Shanghai, providing supplies to the Communist forces along the coast.

The Recall of John Carter Vincent to His Home Country Draws Attention; Observers Believe Wedemeyer Will Be Sent to China

[Associated Press, Shanghai] The recent recall of John Carter Vincent, the American Minister-Counselor, to his home country to consult with Secretary of State Marshall has once again sparked speculation as to whether Ambassador Stuart will be replaced. If this matter is under consideration, observers believe that the likely successor would be Lieutenant General Albert Wedemeyer, the former commander of the U.S. forces in the China theater. Wedemeyer was originally scheduled to succeed Major General Hurley as the ambassador to China, but this was not realized because it was feared that this move would hinder the Nationalist-Communist negotiations. The CCP considers Wedemeyer to be pro-government and therefore does not welcome him. The United States had to take the CCP's views into account at that time, but now that the Nationalists and Communists have been openly at war for several months, and there is no hope of resuming peace talks, this point need not be considered any further. Wedemeyer was greatly appreciated by President Chiang during the war in Chongqing, and the two had a close friendship. When Wedemeyer succeeded Lieutenant General Stilwell as the commander of the China theater, he also served as Chief of Staff to the President, and the two sides cooperated seamlessly. The U.S. government recently decided to sell 130 million rounds of rifle ammunition manufactured for China during the war to China, and observers here mostly believe that the U.S. policy of appeasement towards the CCP will come to an end. Dr. Stuart's appointment as ambassador to China was specially recommended by Marshal Marshall, who believed that Stuart was an important assistant in achieving peaceful unification of China, that both the Nationalists and Communists had a good impression of him, and that he was a famous scholar with a deep understanding of Chinese writing. Unexpectedly, Stuart's talents and Marshal Marshall's efforts were ultimately in vain.

Veterans Who Fought in China Organize an Association in the United States

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] American soldiers who fought in China are being led by Albert Wedemeyer, the former commander of the U.S. forces in the China theater, to form an association here to commemorate their relationship with China. The name has not yet been decided. All those who have been stationed in China are eligible to join, and it is planned to hold monthly gatherings to connect emotionally.

[Our newspaper, Yanzhou, 10th] The fighting near Jieshou, north of Tai'an, intensified on the 9th and 10th. The Communist forces in that area have increased from over 20,000 to over 50,000. Fierce fighting continued until the evening of the 14th. Furthermore, in order to take the initiative in mobile operations, the Nationalist forces voluntarily abandoned Feicheng and Pingyin on the 9th.

[Our newspaper, Linyi, 10th] The four columns of Communist forces surrounded in the area of Qingtuosi and Tangtouzhen suffered heavy casualties and supply difficulties. On the evening of the 7th, two of the columns broke through and fled back between Yishui and Donglidian. The Nationalist forces are pursuing and attacking them. As for the remaining two columns, it will not be difficult to annihilate them all within days.

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th] The main force of over 100,000 Communist troops in the Yunmengshan area of southern Shandong, in order to avoid being annihilated by the Nationalist forces in one fell swoop, has been divided into a dozen small groups and are breaking through and fleeing into the rear of the Nationalist forces. This is a desperate struggle after the complete loss of the CCP base in Shandong, providing the Nationalist forces with a good opportunity to defeat them individually. The 69th and other columns fled eastward towards Donglidian. Over 10,000 troops from the 8th Column captured Tai'an on the night of the 7th and continued to capture Dawenkou on the afternoon of the 9th. The 28th and 29th Divisions of the 10th Column, with over 8,000 troops, captured Jieshou, north of Tai'an, on the afternoon of the 8th, and continued to attack Shengfo Station, northeast of Feicheng, on the 9th. The Nationalist forces are blocking and attacking them. Another group of over 2,000 Communist troops attacked Zaozhuang on the morning of the 9th from Liangqiu and captured Yixian in the afternoon. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.

[Our newspaper, Yanzhou, 10th] The fighting on the western Shandong front continued on the 10th along the line of Heze, Juye, Wenshang, and Ningyang. When the Communist forces captured Yuncheng, they detained over 500 public officials and educators in the city. According to refugees who escaped, over 200 of them were buried alive.

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th] Over 6,000 troops from the 6th Column of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces in western Shandong attacked Dingtao fiercely on the 9th, but were unsuccessful. Juye, Jiaxiang, and Heze all remain impregnable. Furthermore, the Nationalist forces in southern Shandong captured strongholds such as Heyangzhen on the afternoon of the 9th. Moreover, over 4,000 Communist troops in eastern Henan captured Luyi on the morning of the 8th.

### Communist Forces Obstruct the Repair of the Yellow River Dike; The Situation Becomes Increasingly Serious; The Hebei Repair and Defense Office Urges Employees to Repair at the Risk of Their Lives

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The work of restoring the Yellow River dike in Hebei Province is being expedited by the Hebei Repair and Defense Office. It is expected that all dangerous projects will be completed before the 10th of this month. However, since the Communist bandits broke their promise and crossed the river to disrupt, the situation has become very serious. The Ministry of Water Resources recently received a report from the office stating that the elevated part of the dike restoration project could not be completed due to the disruption of the Communist forces. If the water level rises sharply, there is a risk of widespread breaches. The situation of the various dangerous projects is also serious. The office has agreed on two emergency rescue measures: (1) In the sections near the Communist-occupied areas, employees should repair at the risk of their lives. (2) Strengthen the transportation of labor and materials. The commissioners and county magistrates have prepared for emergency implementation when necessary. The Ministry of Water Resources has strictly ordered the office that, regardless of the Communist bandits' disruption and destruction, all employees should do their utmost to seize the opportunity and make every effort to protect the dikes.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Ministry of Water Resources recently received a telegram from Wang Shangde, the section chief of the Hebei Repair and Defense Office, on the 8th of this month, stating that the bandits on the north bank were constantly firing, and many of the dike restoration employees were frightened and fled. By the 5th of this month, only over 10,000 people remained, and by the 7th, only 6,000 to 7,000 people remained. The Dongming County government has been entrusted to quickly recruit and resume work in order to complete the project. Furthermore, Zhang Peigong, an engineer from the Ministry of Water Resources, returned to Nanjing on the 8th of this month with Ye Nan, a representative of the Ministry of National Defense, and Ding Zhizhong, a representative of the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to seek instructions.

### Huang Shaohong Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing; Calls for Relief for the Guangxi Flood Disaster; Huang Xuchu Arrives in Shanghai Today and Returns to Guangxi the Day After Tomorrow

[Our newspaper report] Huang Shaohong, Vice President of the Control Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 1:30 p.m. yesterday. According to him, the disaster situation in Guangxi is serious, and this visit is related to disaster relief. He hopes that all sectors of the city will sympathize with the situation. Furthermore, Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, met with President Chiang yesterday morning to report on the disaster situation in Guangxi. He is scheduled to fly to Shanghai today. Both will jointly host a reception for all sectors of Shanghai in the coming days to report on the severity of the disaster situation in Guangxi and request generous donations for emergency relief.

The Tragic Situation of the Guangxi Disaster

According to Guangxi natives in Shanghai, the people of Guangxi have been suffering from famine and are unable to survive. This summer, they were hit by a major flood. Due to continuous rain last month, mountain torrents broke out, causing rivers to flood. The basins of the West River, Yu River, Yong River, and the left and right rivers, such as Yongning, Heng County, Tiandong, Qianjiang, Teng County, Binyang, Yongchun, and more than 20 other counties and cities, have suffered floods unprecedented in the past 50 years. The cities of Guixian, Wuzhou, and Tengxian were flooded to depths of 10 to 20 feet. Counties further away from the river were flooded by mountain torrents. For example, the area within 30 miles of the Wuming district was turned into a swamp, with water depths reaching 25 feet. In the disaster area, all crops such as rice, corn, peanuts, etc., in more than 500 towns and villages were washed away by the floods, and the harvest is hopeless. As for the loss of human lives, livestock, and property, detailed statistics are not yet available. According to a rough estimate by the provincial government, a total of 56 counties have been affected, with approximately 3 million disaster victims. Emergency relief work is urgently needed. After arriving in Nanjing on the 7th, Chairman Huang repeatedly negotiated and obtained approval for an allocation of 2 billion to provide relief, and a loan of 5 billion from the Four Banks Consortium to purchase grain for relief. Relief from the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is also being negotiated, hoping to immediately release the materials stored in Guangxi and request an allocation of 30,000 tons of relief grain, but no final decision has been made. In addition, he requested the central government to allocate 300,000 piculs of grain from Guangxi Province's requisition quota for 1946 for emergency relief, and this matter is being reviewed by the Ministry of Food.

Furthermore, the staff accompanying Chairman Huang on this trip to Shanghai include Secretary-General Huang of the Provincial Government, Director Yin Zhi of the Department of Social Affairs, and Consultant Chen Niiren. Huang and his party are scheduled to fly back to Guilin this Sunday.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Chairman Huang Xuchu of Guangxi met with President Chiang at 1:00 p.m. on the 10th to report on the disaster situation in order to seek relief for the Guangxi disaster. Huang is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the morning of the 11th to continue raising funds for disaster relief in Guangxi. Furthermore, the government has decided to allocate 2 billion for disaster relief in Guangxi, but Huang believes that the disaster area is too large and the funds are insufficient, and is still in negotiations.

### Europe Reaches a Critical Juncture of Division and Unity!

The European Economic Recovery Conference will open on the 12th. The 22 countries of Europe have all received invitations from Britain and France. Whether they should accept the invitation or not must be decided within these few days. As of the time of writing, according to a report from Agence France-Presse, 15 European countries, namely Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Greece, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, and Southern Ireland, have successively and formally indicated their acceptance of the invitation to participate in the European Recovery Conference to discuss the U.S. Secretary of State's plan for economic aid to Europe. Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have formally refused. The remaining five countries are still carefully considering. Europe's "division" and "unity" have reached a final juncture, and the outcome will be clear within these few days. Therefore, the development of the European political situation in these few days is really worth our close attention. A diplomatic reporter from the Associated Press stated yesterday: "The ideal of 'One World' is on the verge of disillusionment." This statement is not an exaggeration, or perhaps it is intended to be alarmist: Europe's "division" and "unity" have indeed reached a crossroads.

Secretary of State Marshall's plan for aid to Europe was originally the second chapter of the Truman Doctrine, seeking to explore the Soviet Union's true intentions towards Europe through economic aid to European countries' recovery, thereby finding a way out in the gap between the U.S. and Soviet Union's confrontation. However, because Britain and France urgently needed U.S. assistance, upon hearing Secretary of State Marshall's speech at Harvard University, Foreign Secretary Bevin hastily went to Paris to first consult on the common attitude of Britain and France, and then decided to invite Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Paris to hold a three-nation foreign ministers' conference. At that time, although some people doubted whether Foreign Minister Molotov would accept the invitation from the British and French foreign ministers, in the end, Molotov finally arrived in Paris to participate in the three-nation foreign ministers' conference, which greatly excited the general public, who believed that the future of Europe was very optimistic. Unexpectedly, very obvious rifts occurred at the three-nation foreign ministers' conference, namely that the opinions of Britain and France and the Soviet Union's proposals were vastly different, virtually running in opposite directions. The more the three foreign ministers debated, the more divergent their opinions became, and therefore the three-nation foreign ministers' conference broke up in disagreement.

The failure of the three-nation foreign ministers' conference was a great loss for European countries, because European countries suffered war destruction during the war period, their vitality was greatly damaged, and the post-war devastation was everywhere. If they wanted to talk about recovery and prosperity, they had to obtain foreign assistance. Britain and France were in the same situation. Since the United States had expressed its willingness to provide economic assistance, Britain and France could not easily abandon the opportunity for U.S. assistance because of the Soviet Union's opposition. Therefore, Britain and France invited 22 European countries to hold a pan-European conference to jointly discuss methods for implementing the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. However, on the Soviet side, since it believed that Britain and France were secretly colluding and attempting to manipulate the Soviet Union, it was unwilling to participate in the European Economic Conference again. The Soviet Union also considered that European countries generally tended to lean towards the Western bloc, and of course it was unwilling for its vassal countries to accept the invitation from Britain and France and participate in the European Economic Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. In addition to exerting slight pressure on Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Finland, and other countries politically and diplomatically, it also provided grain aid to Romania to show that the Soviet Union also had the intention and ability to provide economic assistance to other countries, which could give some comfort to its vassal countries. Therefore, under this situation, Europe had no choice but to move towards a path of division.

The development of this situation, no matter from which perspective it is observed, is a pessimistic phenomenon. Although the Soviet Union repeatedly attacked the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe as "interfering in the internal affairs of other countries" and used this as a reason to refuse to participate in the implementation of this plan, we, as third parties, feel impartially that the responsibility for the division of Europe should be borne by the Soviet Union. Because after the United States proposed the plan for aid to Europe, it was deeply afraid of excessively stimulating some European countries, and always remained silent, never clearly stating its position. As for the U.S. aid-to-Europe conditions reported by Agence France-Presse on June 27: (1) Abolishing preferential tariff barriers; (2) Making various commercial agreements multilateral in nature; (3) Treating all countries on an equal basis; (4) Allowing free navigation on European inland waterways, especially the Danube; (5) Realizing the economic unification of Germany; (6) Ratifying and signing peace treaties; (7) Allocating European resources evenly each year; these were just speculations by people in Washington and cannot be regarded as the U.S. government's true attitude. Therefore, Wallace, who has always been pro-Soviet, also wrote an article in his edited New Republic magazine attacking the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the invitation from Britain and France.

In short, Europe has reached a critical juncture of "division" and "unity," and the seriousness of the situation has almost reached an unimaginable stage. It has not been two years since the victorious end of World War II, and yet among the Allied countries, because they cannot trust and accommodate each other, they instead suspect and undermine each other, causing the "One World" that people yearned for during the war to be completely disillusioned, which is really a great tragedy for mankind. However, according to French Foreign Minister Bidault's announcement, the European Conference will not be able to officially begin discussing the U.S. aid-to-Europe plan until the 15th, after its opening on the 12th. According to this, Europe's "division" and "unity" still have five days of room for maneuver. We ultimately hope that the political diplomats of various countries can use their political wisdom in these four or five days to ensure that Europe can unite and not divide, otherwise the future of Europe will not only have no peace to speak of, but also the coexistence of two Europes will be difficult to maintain, and sooner or later it will inevitably lead to another great calamity for mankind.

People's organizations from all walks of life in Shanghai, in order to support the government's promulgation of the General Mobilization Order and to celebrate the great victory of the National Army in Siping Street, had already decided to hold a "Suppress Communism and Build the Nation: Ten Thousand Yuan Comfort the Troops" conference on the 20th of this month. Everything is being actively prepared, and the solicitation committee will also hold a meeting this morning to discuss the specific methods of solicitation.

We believe that the solicitation methods should be as simple as possible, because donating money to comfort the troops is an obligation that the people should fulfill, and it is completely different from ordinary donations. First, the people in the rear can still live a normal life to this day, and they cannot fail to thank the soldiers who are fighting bloody battles on the front lines. If it were not for the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers on the front lines, today's rear would have already become a second Northeast or North China. Not only would the people's property have no guarantee, but the people's lives would also be in danger at any moment. In these few days, we have seen the tragic scene of Siping Street after the battle in Chinese and foreign newspapers. How can we not be moved by such loyal and brave soldiers who defend the country and protect the people? Second, although the amount of solicitation is huge, it can be obtained by using Shanghai's Baojia system, calculating at 10,000 yuan per household, which can yield 700 million yuan; if calculated at 10,000 yuan per person, it can yield 30 to 40 billion yuan. In today's Shanghai, if everyone saves a little in other aspects and donates 10,000 yuan to comfort the troops, it is really an easy task. Third, the people's donation to comfort the troops is an expression of the people's support for the government's mobilization order, and its significance is even greater. Ambassador Stuart said in Beiping: "The effect of the General Mobilization Order will depend on the people's support." We fully agree; the people's voluntary donation to comfort the troops is the best way for the people to express their support for the General Mobilization Order.

Finally, based on the principle of those who have strength contributing strength and those who have money contributing money, we hope that wealthy families in Shanghai will generously donate money!

### British Foreign Secretary Flies to Paris Today, Preparing to Attend the Opening Ceremony of the European Conference; Five Countries: Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and South Yugoslavia Decide to Reject British and French Invitations

[Agence France-Presse, London, 10th] It has just been learned that British Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to fly to Paris on the afternoon of the 11th, accompanied by the Foreign Office's economic advisor, Helbach. Bevin will stay in France until after the opening of the Paris Economic Conference.

[Our Dispatch] London, 10th Broadcast: Hungary has formally refused to participate. After a lengthy meeting, the Hungarian government issued a statement in Budapest saying, "Because not all major powers are participating in this conference, Hungary feels deeply sorry for not attending."

[Associated Press, London, 10th] Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia have rejected the invitations from Britain and France and will not participate in the conference to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe, which will be held in Paris this Saturday.

[Associated Press, Helsinki, 10th] The Finnish Cabinet held a meeting on the 10th for final discussion on the invitation from France. A resolution is expected to be announced on the evening of the 10th. In addition, the Foreign Affairs Committee convened a meeting at 8:00 PM on the 10th to study a secret memorandum on the economic situation of various countries.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Of the 22 European countries invited to attend the Paris Conference this Saturday, only Albania and Finland have not yet responded by today, the deadline for submitting replies. The remaining 15 have already accepted, and 5 have refused. The five countries that have definitely refused are Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Hungary. Yugoslavia's note expressing its refusal to accept the invitation criticized the proposed aid-to-Europe plan, saying that it would allow some countries to threaten the economic life and independence of other countries. Poland's note stated that the interests of small countries cannot be guaranteed, and judging from the conditions of the invitation, any proposed amendments or other amendments to the proposed establishment of the institution have already been preemptively rejected. Romania's decision to refuse did not state the reasons. The most recent statements of acceptance were made by Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, which decided to accept after the foreign ministers of the three countries met in Copenhagen. The 15 countries that have already accepted are Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Southern Ireland, Greece, the Netherlands, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey.

[Our Dispatch] London, 10th Broadcast: The Soviet official news agency TASS accused British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault of willingly being used by the United States to achieve the goal of forming a European group of countries to isolate the Soviet Union. The above telegram was published in prominent positions in Soviet newspapers and is the most blatant criticism of the Marshall Plan for economic aid to Europe by Soviet newspapers. The agency also accused the U.S., Britain, and France of attempting to win over western Germany to join the group.

[Associated Press, Paris, 10th] French Foreign Minister Bidault told the French National Assembly that the first three days of the Paris Conference will be devoted to debating the conference's organizational law. Substantive discussions will begin on Tuesday. Bidault explained that Germany will not have representatives participating during the conference. Later, the military governors of the British, American, and French occupied zones may discuss this issue.

### Poland's Refusal to Participate in the European Conference is Due to Soviet Pressure, According to U.S. State Department Officials

[United Press, Washington, 10th] U.S. officials believe that Poland's refusal to participate in the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan is due to Soviet pressure. The State Department stated that the Polish Embassy had declared its support for the Marshall Plan two weeks ago, and that Poland would greatly benefit from participating in European recovery. The sudden change of decision is disappointing. Poland had requested U.S. aid. Now that it has decided to refuse to participate in the Paris Conference, such a request inevitably loses its force. At the same time, the authorities here express their increased respect for Czechoslovakia's decision to participate. It is still unknown whether the Soviet Union will use the same pressure on Czechoslovakia. In the future, the Soviet Union may forcibly revise Czechoslovakia's election law and other restrictive laws to allow the Communist Party to gain more influence in the Czech government.

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] Czech Ambassador to the U.S., Salavik, said that Czechoslovakia's decision to participate in the Paris Conference can end the "speculation about the Iron Curtain." He said that he had never doubted that Czechoslovakia would attend the Paris Conference.

### United Nations Requests to Be Informed of the Progress of the European Conference

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 9th] Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations, Beardsley, said here today: The United Nations has not been invited to send observers to the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan, but he has urged Britain to allow the United Nations to be informed of the entire progress of the conference. Beardsley is acting in his position while Lie is traveling to Norway. He also reiterated Lie's hope that the Soviet Union's rejection of the Marshall Plan is not its final statement on the issue.

### Czech Delegation Arrives in Soviet Union, Soviet Foreign Minister Welcomes Them in Person

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] Czech Prime Minister Gottwald and Foreign Minister Masaryk led a Czech delegation to visit the Soviet Union and arrived here this afternoon. Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky personally welcomed them at the airport. In addition, a Czech trade delegation led by Minister of Justice Traina has also arrived in Moscow.

### The Soviet Union Should Not Refuse to Participate in the European Economic Conference, Wallace Expresses His Views

[Associated Press, New York, 9th] Wallace wrote an article in the current issue of "New Republic Magazine" stating: The Soviet Union should accept the opportunity given by the Paris Conference. Its failure to do so will cause the Marshall Plan to create a serious crisis of world division. This conference is the first meeting to strive for the free world. Although it has failed, it is not a complete loss. From the perspective of an internationalist, we should criticize the Truman Doctrine of providing military aid to anti-Soviet governments, but we agree in principle with the plan proposed by Marshall. By providing economic aid to various countries and cooperating to rebuild the world, Congress holds the key to world peace. If the Republican Party fears the socialist development of Europe, the Marshall Plan will not achieve good results and will instead lead to bad consequences. If it is thought that the United States does not obtain sufficient support in the United Nations Conference to subdue the Soviet Union and therefore wants to reduce the tasks of the United Nations Economic Commission and wants to promote the Marshall Plan, it will ultimately fail. But I believe that the Soviet Union should accept the opportunity given by the Paris Conference, because if the Soviet Union does not participate, the result of promoting the Marshall Plan will lead to a crisis of world division. If the philosophy of the Truman Doctrine is not abolished, the world will form a divided situation and will ultimately fail. This philosophy is only to form a Western European group and make Germany a fortress against the Soviet Union.

### Soviet Suspicion is an Obstacle to Peaceful Understanding, Eleanor Roosevelt Analyzes the Soviet Attitude

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] Eleanor Roosevelt said in her daily column today: The Soviet Union's suspicion is a real obstacle to peaceful understanding. When answering why the Soviet Union did not participate in all activities of the United Nations, she quoted the former President as saying: One of the reasons is that the Soviet Union needs the best talents to engage in domestic construction, so the Soviet Union chooses good talents in this area instead of selecting qualified talents to serve in various United Nations activities? Regarding why the Soviet Union believes that other countries must fully accept its plan and cannot make any modifications to achieve cooperation, Mrs. Roosevelt replied: For many years, the Soviet Union has been isolated by other countries, so the Soviet Union often has suspicions when contacting other countries.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] An article published in this month's Foreign Affairs Quarterly by a person signing as "Mr. X" represents the views of the highest authority. It is said that the United States must treat the Soviet Union as a "fierce enemy rather than a partner" for many years. If the Soviet Union can be suppressed in this way for ten years or more, the result will either be to make it adopt a more cooperative attitude or to weaken its power. Foreign affairs officials believe that this view reflects the ideas of George Kennan, director of the Policy Planning Staff of Secretary of State Marshall. The argument of this article is that the Soviet authorities hope and expect that the capitalist world will eventually collapse. At this moment, Soviet leaders are taking the opportunity to promote the "threat of capitalist encirclement" domestically and are expanding their influence everywhere abroad towards weak countries to protect their own dictatorship. The only key is that Soviet actions do not have a timetable. Their advance and retreat completely depend on the strength of the opposing forces. Strategically speaking, the Soviet Union cannot always wait and achieve nothing. If the United States can plan for this weakness, unite with other Western countries, adopt a policy of fortified walls and clear fields, and monitor it, then in ten or fifteen years, Soviet power will either soften or break.

### Soviet Debt to the U.S.: Interest Repayment

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] The State Department announced that the Soviet government has repaid interest of $4.17 million in accordance with the agreement.

### Security Council Continues to Discuss the Balkan Dispute, U.S. Rejects Compromise Plan

[United Press, Lake Success, 9th] According to reliable sources: France and Colombia have proposed a compromise plan to reconcile the opinions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union on resolving the Balkan dispute. The U.S. delegation has rejected it and still insists on establishing a semi-permanent investigation team to curb the Greek border dispute and believes that it can obtain the statutory majority of seven votes in the Security Council, leaving the Soviet Union as the only weapon to obstruct it with its veto power.

### U.S. Senate Approves Army, Navy, and Air Force Merger Bill, Recommends Command by Secretary of Defense

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Senate today approved a compromise bill for the permanent merger of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This bill was drafted at the repeated request of President Truman for two years and has now been sent to the House of Representatives for discussion. Republican leaders in that House believe it must be passed.

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] The Senate passed a bill by voice vote on the 10th to appoint one Secretary of Defense to command the nation's armed forces.

### Britain Hopes to Establish a Peacetime Lend-Lease Agreement with the United States to Avoid Economic Collapse

[United Press, London, 9th] The British government may seek to establish a peacetime lend-lease agreement with the United States to avoid economic collapse. Deputy Prime Minister Morrison and Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton made explicit statements in the House of Commons last night, saying that the U.S. loan of $3.75 billion to Britain is being rapidly depleted. At the current rate, it will be exhausted by late winter. Morrison also said: "The only remedy is to bring in goods worth billions of dollars from North and South America to supply aid, without immediately shipping equivalent goods from Europe in exchange. Britain currently owes an average of £450 million per year to pay for food and raw materials, maintain scarce rations, and ease the recovering industries. After the U.S. provides assistance again, our production and living standards will be greatly adjusted. We cannot enter into trade without limit that cannot be paid for." The newspapers this morning are all studying the government's policy, only the Labour Party's "Daily Herald" is silent.

### US Wheat Exports: Expected Participation This Year, To Be a Major Part of the Aid to Europe Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The International Food Conference opened here today, attended by representatives from forty-two countries. After a welcoming address by French Prime Minister Ramadier, French Minister of Agriculture Plihon was unanimously elected as Chairman of the Conference. The US representative, Secretary of Agriculture Anderson, stated in his speech: "The annual grain movement has begun. The United States will be able to make concrete contributions to world grain import and export trade in the future. However, the grain shortage is unlikely to improve significantly before next spring. It is estimated that the US wheat harvest this year will be 1.4 billion bushels, so its wheat exports may be slightly more than last year. The US currently has more stored corn than last year, but the autumn harvest of corn, barley, and oats may be inferior to last year. Therefore, although the wheat harvest will increase, the total grain harvest may be less than last year. I am pleased to announce that the amount of wheat will be increased among the grains that the United States should export this year. In short, increasing food production, especially grain production, is undoubtedly a major part of the Marshall Plan for European aid. Europe should immediately start to achieve its results."

### US Senate Bipartisan Group Proposes Strengthening UN Institutions, Advocates Granting Power to Prevent War

[United Press, Washington, 10th] The United States yesterday proposed three resolutions aimed at giving the United Nations institutions strong arms to start anew. If the Soviet Union obstructs progress, there is a sincerity to discard it. According to ten Democratic and Republican members of the House of Representatives, convening a new charter conference of the United Nations and empowering the United Nations institutions with the power to enforce world law and prevent war is the most reliable way to determine whether the Soviet Union is determined to conquer the world. Ten Democratic and Republican senators have proposed that President Truman convene a meeting to reorganize the United Nations institutions and amend the Charter to enhance its power to uphold world peace, which can proceed without the addition of the Soviet Union. One of the proposers, together with two other senators, has also proposed a bill to authorize the United Nations institutions to formulate, interpret, and enforce laws to maintain world peace.

The resolution proposed in the House of Representatives has the same content, advocating that Congress urge the President to take the initiative to convene the United Nations General Assembly in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, so that the organization can formulate, interpret, and enforce world laws to prevent war. According to their statement, "The proposers believe that the most reliable way to determine whether the Soviet Union is determined to conquer the world is to find out whether the Soviet Union is willing to jointly create a United Nations organization with other countries that can guarantee its security. Two years of experience have convinced the members of the United Nations that if the United Nations organization is to maintain world peace, its strength must be enhanced. The proposers believe that the direct actions of the United States to aid Greece, Turkey, and the European recovery have made it clear that the United Nations organization in its current form is insufficient to cope with the major pressure of this divided world. As for the United States' unwillingness to hand over the power of international control of atomic energy to the Security Council, it can be left unsaid for the time being. At the same time, during the debate on the aid to Greece and Turkey, it has been proven that not only the general opinion of members of Congress believes that the United Nations organization is our only hope for peace, but there is also a very strong advocacy in favor of strengthening the United Nations organization so that it can perform its tasks." According to Article 109 of the Charter, a Constitutional Conference can be convened with the consent of two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly plus any seven members of the Security Council. However, the Charter cannot be amended without the unanimous consent of all five permanent members of the Security Council, namely the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China. At Lake Success, United Nations officials claim that any major revisions to the United Nations Charter at this time may cause the breakup of the world organization. A United Nations official commented on the proposal in the US Congress, saying that "there is absolutely no chance of amending the Charter under the current circumstances. Any serious action by the United States may lead to the demise of the United Nations organization."

### US Tax Cut Bill: President Plans to Veto Again

[Our newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Radio: President Truman told reporters today that he would veto the Republican tax cut bill. The House of Representatives has already passed the bill, and the Senate began discussing it today.

### Truman to Convene Bipartisan Leaders to Discuss Marshall Plan Legislation

[United Press, Washington, 9th] It has just been learned from well-informed sources that President Truman is scheduled to convene six leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties at the White House on Monday for a meeting. At that time, he will submit to them legislation to implement the Marshall Plan for European aid. The six people invited are Senate Speaker Vandenberg, Senate Republican Leader White, Senate Democratic Leader Barkley, House Speaker Martin, House Republican Leader Halleck, and House Democratic Leader Rayburn. Although the content of Truman's plan has not been made clear, it is expected that it will be about formulating legislation for the Marshall Plan and, if necessary, convening a special session of Congress this year to discuss foreign policy and other matters.

[Our newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Radio: President Truman said today that he will convene a special session of Congress in the fall of this year to implement the Marshall Plan for European aid, but there is no need to convene it at present.

### Unprecedented Grand Gathering at Buckingham Palace to Celebrate the Marriage of the British Heir Apparent; Wedding Likely to Be Held Before Next Spring

[Our newspaper] London, 10th Radio: Princess Elizabeth, accompanied by Philip Mountbatten, attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace today.

[Reuters, London, 9th] King George VI announced tonight his consent to the marriage of the heir to the British throne, Princess Elizabeth, to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, the Princess is twenty-one years old, and the Lieutenant is the former Prince Philip of Greece. The Court Circular issued by Buckingham Palace tonight reads: "The King and Queen announce with great pleasure the betrothal of their beloved daughter, Princess Elizabeth, to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten of the Royal Navy (son of the late Prince Andrew of Greece). The King has been pleased to give his consent to the marriage." The date of the wedding has not yet been determined, but according to authoritative sources tonight, the wedding is likely to be held before next spring. Princess Elizabeth's marriage must comply with the provisions of the Royal Marriages Act of 1772. The King's consent to the marriage is based on the provisions of the Act. The holding of the wedding is also subject to the King's approval. At that time, the Privy Council will convene a special meeting and invite representatives of the Empire, Parliament, and leaders of the opposition party, as well as heads of the church, to attend. The King will formally approve the Princess's wedding. The King's consent to the marriage has been notified to Prime Minister Attlee and the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Southern Rhodesia. Congratulatory messages have been pouring in from all parts of the British Commonwealth, but Buckingham Palace did not hold a ceremony tonight. A garden party may be held at the palace tomorrow afternoon, at which both the Princess and Lieutenant Mountbatten will participate.

Handling Procedures in Accordance with the Constitution

[Reuters, London, 9th] After the betrothal of Princess Elizabeth and Lieutenant Mountbatten, the following steps will be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution: (1) Prime Minister Attlee will formally announce the Princess's marriage to the members of the House of Commons, and a similar announcement will be made in the House of Lords. (2) Both houses will pass resolutions approving the Princess's marriage and expressing congratulations. The holding of the wedding does not need to be approved by Parliament again. (3) Parliament should determine the annual salary of the Princess and her husband. The annual salary is 60 pounds when the Princess is a minor, and it will increase to 15,000 pounds after she reaches adulthood. It is expected to increase to 60,000 pounds after marriage, but the exact amount must be passed by Parliament in a special bill. (4) Lieutenant Mountbatten is expected to be awarded the highest rank of nobility, the title of Duke, and participate in the House of Lords.

Deeply Rooted Seeds in the Early Days of the War

[United Press, London, 9th] According to unofficial sources at Buckingham Palace, Elizabeth and Philip's wedding will be held in Westminster Abbey in October. It is learned that Lieutenant Philip gave Princess Elizabeth a ring with three large diamonds some time ago, but the Princess has not worn this ring in public places. Philip first met the Princess when he visited Dartmouth Naval College a few months before the outbreak of the war in 1939. At that time, Philip was eighteen years old and the Princess was thirteen years old. They did not talk when they met, but they often gathered together during the war, especially at the home of Philip's uncle, the current Indian Governor Mountbatten. Love began because of this. However, the marriage proposal was not made until January of this year. At that time, the King asked them to wait a while. After the King and his entourage returned from a tour of South Africa in April, the King expressed his consent, and the lovers became a family.

A Match Made in Heaven Becomes a Reality

[United Press, London, 9th] The husband of Britain's future Queen, Philip Mountbatten, was originally a Greek prince, the sixth heir to the Greek royal family. In order to conclude a good marriage with British Crown Princess Elizabeth, he joined British nationality at the beginning of this year and changed his surname to that of his uncle, Indian Governor Lord Mountbatten. His ancestors were half British and half Danish, and he is the cousin of King George VI. Born in Corfu, he is handsome. It is reported that he will receive the title of Duke after marriage and will convert to the Church of England according to custom. Philip was entrusted to Mountbatten's upbringing at the age of four, studied in Scotland and England, and entered the Royal Naval Academy at the age of eighteen. In 1940, he went to sea for practice and became a naval second lieutenant candidate. Philip is currently a naval lieutenant, 26 years old, 6 feet 2 inches tall, and weighs 185 pounds. Although he is of Greek and Danish descent, he has a British demeanor.

Princess Elizabeth's engagement ring is made of platinum inlaid with a large diamond and two small diamonds. The Princess's full name is Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor. She is 21 years old, loves literature and music, is 5 feet 5 inches tall, and weighs 136 pounds. She can speak French and German. Like her great-grandfather, King Edward VII, she likes drama and horse racing. She is often seen in London theaters and nightclubs. She and Philip are both praised as the most beautiful royal couple in Europe.

### Truman Denies Atomic Energy Secret Documents Were Stolen

[Our newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Radio: The New York Sun reported that atomic secret documents were stolen. President Truman denied this at a press conference.

### Syria Brewing Civil War: Durzi Tribe Conspires to Overthrow Syrian Government Rule

[United Press, Damascus, 9th] Arab newspapers here reported on the 9th that the Durzi clans have now concentrated in the Jebel area on the border between Syria and Transjordan, waiting for their chieftain Al-Atrash to issue an order to launch a civil war. Syrian Prime Minister Mardam Bey declared that the Syrian government is very concerned about the conspiracy to overthrow the Syrian authorities in the Jebel area (Note: The Jebel area was an autonomous province under French mandate before the war), and the Syrian Prime Minister has notified King Abdullah of Transjordan of the matter. It is rumored that non-Durzi officials in the Jebel area, in view of the seriousness of the situation, have fled with their families and property, because after the Syrian government's attempt to mediate with the Durzi tribe failed, Chief Al-Atrash issued an order to resolve the matter by force. At the same time, the Syrian Prime Minister has ordered the arrest of Daricha, because he was one of the leaders of the 1925 revolution, and the planning of this new conspiracy is also related to him. In addition, the Syrian Prime Minister announced that he had obtained evidence that three opposition party leaders in Damascus City participated in the next conspiracy, but during the recent general election, he did not intend to order their arrest.

### Soviet Production Increases Sharply, Mostly Exceeding Targets: Design Committee Releases Report

[United Press, Moscow, 9th] The Soviet Planning Committee announced today that in 1947, the area under cultivation increased by 20 million acres, and industrial production increased by 15%. Transportation in various sectors has also improved. The spring plowing plan has been completed, and food production this season has exceeded the target by 10%. The production of the textile and light industries increased by 28%, and retail commerce increased by 20%. The construction of houses in the first half of this year increased by 14% compared with the same period last year. Other production in the second quarter exceeded the predetermined targets, with the following percentages: drugs 29, chemicals 15, electrical appliances 13, rubber 14, construction and paving 3, coal 2, heavy machinery industry 5, and machine tools 5. London believes that the Soviet Union's release of this statistic four days before the opening of the Paris Economic Conference is probably intended to prove that it is shouldering the heavy responsibility of reviving the European continent.

### Indonesian Provisional Government Expected to Be Established Within Days; Netherlands Still Demands Joint Police Force

[United Press, Batavia, 10th] According to a report from the Dutch News Agency on the 10th, the Indonesian provisional government proposed by the Netherlands will soon be established. According to a spokesman for the Republic, Vice President Hatta and former Prime Minister Sjahrir may be the representatives of Indonesia in the provisional government. The Dutch side may be represented by cabinet advisor Keizer and economic advisor Van Suetstraten, with Van Mook as the chief commissioner. West Borneo is most likely to be represented by Speaker Hamid II, while East Borneo may be represented by Information Minister Tejagaga and Minister without Portfolio Krapperts. At the same time, Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Setyadjit has returned to Yogyakarta to establish a domestic security department, and he is expected to return to Batavia tomorrow to make detailed suggestions on this. A spokesman for a certain Republican government told the Dutch News Agency that a "special division" belonging to the united government may be established. Prime Minister Sjahrir and Deputy Prime Ministers Setyadjit and Gani are scheduled to inspect the front lines of the Dutch and Indonesian armies in Java and Sumatra in the near future in order to completely cease hostilities.

[Reuters, The Hague, 9th] The Dutch Cabinet convened a special meeting today to discuss Indonesia's supplementary note to Dutch and Indonesian Governor-General Van Mook yesterday. The Dutch government will issue a formal statement on the Indonesian situation in Parliament tomorrow. According to authoritative sources, the Dutch government will suggest that both sides hold talks on the point of forming a joint police force, and then accept Indonesia's reply, because apart from the point of forming a joint police force, Indonesia has agreed to all the points in the Dutch note of May 27. The news of Indonesia's concession has made the Dutch government very pleased.

However, the far-right parties such as the Conservative Party in the opposition continue to oppose cooperation between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The Conservative Party's newspaper today pointed out that Indonesia's reply is absolutely unsatisfactory, and at the same time predicted that in Indonesia, extremists will still oppose Prime Minister Sjahrir's policy, so the future of the Indonesian situation is not yet fully optimistic.

[US News Agency, New York, 9th] The New York Times wrote an article today detailing the new developments in the Indonesian situation, stating: "If The Hague can adopt the latest proposals put forward by Indonesia, this will be a milestone in the progress of the Far East from colonies to autonomy, and become a good example of peaceful negotiations for Asian countries. Indonesia will usher in a new era."

### Standards for Purging Japanese Zaibatsu Have Been Established

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] In order to complete the purge work, the Japanese government, in addition to the standards for purging the press that were decided a few days ago, is now actively formulating relevant standards for purging the zaibatsu. Among them, it is reported that the following have been decided to be purged among the operators of the dissolved zaibatsu and holding companies: (1) 56 zaibatsu family members must not hold any position in any company in the future.

(3) Those who have served as important employees of the designated companies before September 1, Showa 20 must not serve as employees of companies in the future in accordance with the Public Office Purge Order, especially trade companies that have close relations with zaibatsu and special companies.

### Japanese Right-Wing Forces Combine; Yoshida Plans to Co-opt Shidehara; This Will Be a Fatal Blow to Ashida

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] It is learned that the hope of a political combination between the Liberal Party and the Shidehara faction of the Democratic Party has become active again. The alliance between Yoshida and Shidehara will be a swift revenge of the Liberal Party against the Democratic Party President Hitoshi Ashida, who left the Liberal Party organization in the early part of this year to form the Democratic Party.

### South Korea to Open Foreign Trade in Mid-Month

The government also issued a communiqué explaining the police arrests, stating that the government has long known about the Communist Party's attempt to spread the civil war to the capital and other cities, and has closely monitored the activities of more than 10,000 communists in Athens and other cities. Since it has found evidence of their conspiracy to launch an uprising at 1:00 am on July 10, the government has taken this necessary measure. The Greek Minister of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will meet tomorrow to discuss thoroughly investigating the cases of the arrested persons and deciding on their banishment.

### Achieving Righteousness and Sacrificing Oneself Without Shame Before Heaven and Man: Seven Groups Commemorate Yang Guang-sheng with Deep Sorrow and Tears

[Our Newspaper News] The memorial service for the late Consul-General Yang Guang-sheng of our country stationed in the Philippines was held yesterday at 5:30 PM. It was initiated by seven organizations, including the Diplomatic Affairs Office in Shanghai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Continental Newspaper, World Society, Lake Society, North Pole Company, China Benevolent Society, and Tsinghua Alumni Association. The venue was the Wu Liande Party of the Asian Cultural Society on the Museum Road. The hall was decorated in a solemn and respectful manner.

The memorial ceremony began with an opening address by Wang Zuliang, President of the Shanghai Branch of the Tsinghua Alumni Association, who reported on the circumstances of Yang's martyrdom. This was followed by a report from Chen Changtong, Manager of the Foreign Department of the Bank of China. Chen and Yang were close friends and associates. He spent much time with Yang in Manila and was the last of his friends to see him. He knew Yang's character very well. When he tearfully recounted Yang's tragic murder by the enemy, he was overcome with grief.

Next, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, saying, "Mr. Yang and I were classmates at Tsinghua and also fellow students in the United States. When the news of Mr. Yang's death arrived, I was saddened for many days. Consul-General Yang can be said to be one of the most loyal to the country and the nation. I hope that every citizen in the future, when facing danger, will be willing to sacrifice their lives and take Mr. Yang as an example. Regardless of success or failure, we must emulate Mr. Yang's spirit and put the country and the nation first."

After the Mayor's speech, Dr. Yin Zulan played a mournful song. Then, Speaker Pan delivered a speech, stating, "Mr. Yang Guang-sheng devoted himself to his country and regarded death as returning home. This spirit can indeed be an example for future generations. The members of the Lake Society and Mr. Guang-sheng were from the same hometown. Now that Mr. Guang-sheng has sacrificed himself for the country, this is not only the glory of Wuxing but the glory of the entire nation. Because of Mr. Yang, I recall another martyr from Wuxing, Mr. Chen Yingshi. After Martyr Chen sacrificed himself for the revolution, President Sun sent a mourning couplet. Today, I would like to use these two sentences of the mourning couplet to praise the spirit of Martyr Yang. The words are: 'Holding up the fallen and supporting the endangered, his deeds shine like the sun and moon; achieving righteousness and sacrificing himself, he faces heaven and man without shame.'"

Finally, Yang Guangli, the fifth younger brother of Yang Guang-sheng, delivered a thank-you speech, saying that his sister-in-law was currently working in the United Nations organization in the United States. Due to the inconvenience of taking leave, she specifically sent a telegram to thank everyone. The family members in Shanghai were deeply grateful for everyone's enthusiastic participation in the memorial service. At the same time, he also expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the overseas Chinese in the Philippines. Since his late brother's martyrdom, for the past three and a half years, the living expenses of the bereaved family have been supported by the local overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese also specially published newspapers and over ten thousand photos before his late brother's remains were sent back to the motherland. When the special plane took off, over ten thousand overseas Chinese went to the scene to bid farewell. In addition, he also expressed gratitude for the public funeral and grand memorial service held by our government in Beijing on September 3rd.

### Wandering for Fifteen Years, Traveling Tens of Thousands of Miles, the First Batch of Northeastern Anti-Japanese Heroes Arrive in Shanghai Today; Various Organizations Discuss Ways to Offer Comfort

[Our Newspaper News] The Northeastern Volunteer Army, which fought against the Japanese during the "September 18th Incident," was forced to retreat into Siberia and returned to the country via Xinjiang. Over the course of fifteen years, they traveled tens of thousands of miles. Of the original 140,000 people, only 8,500 remain. In May of this year, the central government ordered the Ministry of Social Affairs to be responsible for the demobilization of these anti-Japanese heroes. At that time, a Northeastern Volunteer Army transit station was established in Dihua, and they were sent back to the Northeast in batches. After passing through Lanzhou and Xi'an southward, the last eleventh batch departed from Dihua to the east at the beginning of this month. The first batch of about 1,200 people departed from Xuzhou on the evening of the 9th, passed through Nanjing and came to Shanghai, and may arrive today. After arriving in Shanghai, they will wait for ships to take them to Yingkou, Huludao, or Qinhuangdao to be sent back to various places.

### Improvement Planned for the Issuance of Allowances for Public Educators

In light of this, the municipal government has formulated two improvement measures: (1) All supplying agencies are required to collect the total amount of allowances to be received within one week and quickly submit them to the supplying agency; (2) After receiving the official documents from the supplying agency, the supplying agency is required to issue the due allowance amount to the requesting agency within three days.

### Balancing the Needs of Both Landlords and Tenants; The Land Bureau Schedules a Meeting to Discuss Rent Standards

[Our Newspaper News] The debate over rent standards in this city has been going on for a long time. The Land Bureau has recently formulated a number of measures and has scheduled a joint meeting with relevant French authorities on the 16th of this month to discuss and make a decision. Mayor Wu will personally preside over the meeting at that time.

Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the standards formulated by the Land Bureau this time are based on the resolutions of the Provisional Council and are intended to simultaneously consider the income of landlords and the affordability of tenants as the original intention. The salaries of public educators are adjusted at any time and are flexible, so it is more reasonable to base the rent standard on the multiple of the salaries of public educators. On the one hand, the necessary expenses for landlords to retain property rights are taken into account, and on the other hand, the affordability of tenants is also considered.

### A Few Landlords Drastically Increase Rents; The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association Petitions to Stop Them

[Our Newspaper News] The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association submitted a petition to the Municipal Government and the Council yesterday, requesting them to stop landlords from drastically increasing rents by multiple amounts. The petition stated: Landlords in this city, before the war, were said to have "every inch of land worth an inch of gold." They lived in luxury and enjoyed peace. During the war, prosperous areas remained intact. Even though the war has spread, Shanghai remains majestic. It is already a great blessing. If they still use food and clothing as an excuse to increase rents, they are pushing the cold masses into further suffering, which is either madness or rebellion. Therefore, the current problem is that the landlords are taking advantage of the situation, which is the same crime as silk merchants hoarding yarn. In the past eight or nine years, landlords have entrusted all the costs of repairs, management, and various taxes to the tenants. All their income is pure profit. Compared to before the war, it has not decreased at all. Now, speaking in terms of multiple proportions, the payment of pre-war deposits in banks, as ruled by the court, is about a thousand times. Compared to the City Council's proposal to increase rent by 1,800 times, it is only half that much. Why can't those landlords understand the difficulties to such an extent? The government authorities are sparing no effort to stabilize people's livelihoods and stop the rise in prices. They should not allow the actions of a few landlords in the important sector of people's lives, namely housing.

The youth did not respond but lifted the corner of his coat and patted the handgun tied around his waist, indicating that he was a public official. Ticket inspector number 52, due to the fact the youth was in plain clothes and his identity was difficult to determine, asked which unit he belonged to.

At the same time, the conductor and other personnel on the bus also came to his aid. Seeing that he was outnumbered, the youth fled towards Avenue Albert. The ticket inspector relentlessly pursued him. When he approached the entrance of the Third Inspection Brigade of the 423 Garrison Headquarters on the road, the youth hailed the two sentries on guard, turned around, grabbed the ticket inspector, beat him severely, and brought him into the unit. The news spread in an instant, arousing public outrage among all the French Concession tram and bus field personnel, who suspended the service of buses and trams on all lines to protest. Upon hearing the news, the company authorities and the union sent representatives to negotiate with the Third Inspection Brigade. They made four demands: (1) Severely punish the perpetrator. (2) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. (3) Compensate the injured party for medical expenses. (4) Issue a public apology. The captain of the Inspection Brigade, Zhang Hanguang, agreed in principle to the first three demands but did not accept the last one, stating that he needed to investigate the facts. As for the ticket inspector number 52, who was detained in the unit, he was immediately released and taken back by the representatives.

They are currently actively planning. It is reported that the school is scheduled to enroll new students for the first time on the 15th of this month. The school currently has a summer tutoring class to prepare junior and senior high school students for further studies and to provide remedial classes for students who have dropped out of junior and senior high school.

### Jiaotong University Scheduled to Enroll Students; Wu Baofeng Going to Beijing Next Week to Discuss Funding Issues with the Ministry of Education

[Our Report] The date for Jiaotong University to enroll new students has recently been decided. It will be held on the 15th and 16th of next month. Registration will be from the 7th to the 10th of next month. Admission brochures are being printed. It is reported that the number of classes will increase next semester, and the school buildings will be insufficient. The originally established university preparatory class will be discontinued. In order to give preferential treatment to students from border areas who are promoted to higher education, the school can accept 15 students recommended by Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan, and other provinces next semester.

Also: The person in charge of the school replied to students' inquiries about rumors that some professors had been dismissed, stating that the school had not received any official orders from the Ministry of Education to dismiss professors. The departure and retention of professors during the summer is a normal occurrence and is definitely not related to political issues. The president of the school can handle the departure and retention of professors at his discretion, and the competent authorities have always respected the opinions of the schools according to usual practice, and this year should be no exception. It is heard that President Wu Baoju will go to Beijing next week to discuss funding issues with the Ministry of Education.

### Seven Units from China, the United States, and Britain to Participate in a Swimming Friendship Competition: To Be Held on the Evenings of the 24th and 25th at the Hongkou Swimming Pool

The Sino-American-British swimming friendship competition initiated by the US military authorities in China and sponsored by the municipal government will be organized by the Shanghai Reception Office of the Lizhi Society. Peng Wenyu, Zhang Zhilei, and US Navy Lieutenant Xu Lun have been jointly conducting the preparations for days, and it has been decided to hold it on the evenings of the 24th and 25th of this month at the Hongkou Swimming Pool. The US Navy preliminary selection was originally scheduled for the 17th and 18th, also at the Hongkou Swimming Pool, but because the number of participating athletes from the US Navy in the Western Pacific was far less than expected, it was changed to be held at the Columbia Country Club, and the dates remain unchanged.

This friendship competition has no team championship and only counts individual winners. The participants include one unit from the US Navy, four units from the US Army, one unit from the British Navy, and the Chinese team, totaling seven units. The competition events are: (1) 50 yards, (2) 100 yards, (3) 100-yard backstroke, (4) 200-yard breaststroke, (5) 400 yards, (6) 400-yard relay, (7) 1500 yards, and (8) eight types of fancy diving.

As for the order of the venue, the Sino-American military police cooperative will each send a group of military police to maintain order at the venue.

The Hongkou Swimming Pool has limited space and cannot accommodate a large crowd, so tickets will be sold at the time, with a ticket price of 15,000 yuan each. They will be sold in advance by the Hongkou Swimming Pool and the American and British embassies and consulates. No tickets will be sold on the spot. The income from the ticket sales will be used for the competition and the Sino-American-British friendship banquet on the evening of the 26th (the banquet will be held at the Lizhi Society at 118 Jin Shenfu Road). The number of tickets is limited to 400 each evening, and another 400 complimentary tickets will be printed and distributed to military and political leaders and sports and media figures from China, the United States, and Britain.

There were more than 400 spectators, and Dai Yongquan and Shen Bohong served as referees. The Green Team once broke through Hualian, creating a great sensation, but yesterday it fought against Shanghai Star and was completely defeated. After the contact, the Shanghai Star generals were incomparably brave. Cheng Aixin, Xue Xuchu, Fu Qifang, and Wang Changhou defeated the four gates. In the fifth group, Chen Yilong of the Green Team struggled and defeated Huang Gaoyuan of Shanghai Star. In the sixth and seventh groups, each side lost once, and as a result, Shanghai Star defeated the Green Team 5-2. The results are as follows:

(Shanghai Star) (Green Team) (Score)

Cheng Aixin Wang Yishan 3-1

Qifang Qin Duyan 3-0

Xue Xuchu Chen Yinzhou 3-0

### China Youth Volleyball A Group Tournament: Yongan Red Meets Soviet Union Tonight

Today, they will play with a mixed brigade. In terms of strength, they are still considerable. Yongan Red is the incarnation of Guangdong, and made its debut last week, directly defeating Jiguang by three goals. There will definitely be a fierce battle with the foreign army at that time.

Fuhua - Jinde Blue (Women's) 5:30 PM

Shantou Team - Nanxing (B Youth) 6:10 PM

Yongan Red - Soviet Red (A Group) 7:00 PM

### "Collective Voice" Can't Pass the Fifth Checkpoint

[Central News Agency, Singapore Airmail] The Philippine "Collective Voice" basketball team, which was invincible domestically last year, encountered defeat in its southern expedition to Malaya. They were defeated by the Singapore United team at the fifth checkpoint with a score of 46 to 41, a difference of two and a half goals. In this battle, "Collective Voice" not only lost but also lost in an ungraceful manner. Players lost their temper and disagreed with the referee's decisions, even repeatedly insisting on withdrawing from the game midway during the last quarter. Their bias for victory and aversion to defeat, as well as their emotional impulsiveness, completely disregarded sportsmanship and the spirit of athletics. This aroused much dissatisfaction among the audience, leading to jeers and shouts. Originally, "Collective Voice" had given a very good impression in several matches in Singapore. This time, their transgression and misbehavior not only lost the audience's sympathy but also tarnished their past reputation, which is truly regrettable.

Overseas Fans Exclaim in Awe

"Collective Voice," together with the Hong Kong Sing Tao Football Team, arrived in Singapore on the 13th of this month, scheduled to play seven matches in Singapore, two of which were charity matches to raise education funds for a Fujian association. They first displayed their skills on the evening of the 15th, narrowly defeating the Singapore Mixed Team with a score of 60 to 47. (I say narrowly because "Collective Voice" had, unusually, been at a disadvantage by three points in the first half). Subsequently, carrying the momentum of victory, "Collective Voice" successively broke through three checkpoints, defeating Selangor Team 49 to 37, Business & Industry Team 54 to 42 (Business & Industry had won the All-Singapore Championship consecutively in 1946 and 1947), and Perak Team 74 to 61. In these matches, "Collective Voice" consistently performed well. Their superb skills and excellent spirit were highly appreciated by the people of Singapore, especially Cai Wenhua's leaping, turning, and one-handed shots; Qiu Guai Cai Wenzhang's all-court flying; Chen Jinde's advancing, retreating, attacking, and defending with assured command; as well as all the feints, rotating attacks (what the Filipinos call "lawu-lawu"), and butterfly-like weaving tactics, which left overseas fans exclaiming in awe. Originally, each checkpoint's defenders had their own famous players, such as Gong Bangjie, Yin Hongxiang, and Li Guorui, who were all veterans from the Central Plains. However, they were unfortunately too old and could not compare with the energetic athletes of "Collective Voice."

The Fifth Checkpoint Encounters a Strong Opponent

However, it must be said that the level of sports in Malaya is not low after all. While older players are difficult to contend with, young fellows are still brave and valiant. The "Collective Voice" team rushed through four checkpoints but ultimately stumbled at the fifth checkpoint, encountering a strong opponent: the Singapore United team. In terms of lineup, the Singapore United team possessed the essence of all Singapore, and their strength should not be underestimated. Center Huang Fuxi is six feet two inches tall, as tall as Hollywood star Gary Cooper. His ball-grabbing and passing are both fast and accurate. Forwards Lin Wendian and Huang Shuhao, and guards Li Yinan and Hou Shenhu, are all battle-tested veterans. The lineup is very ideal. On the other hand, "Collective Voice" had already played several games, and their playing style and weaknesses were somewhat exposed and discovered by their opponents. Therefore, before the match, newspaper commentators believed that even if the Singapore United team lost, it would not be a crushing defeat, and even if "Collective Voice" won, it would be a laborious victory. "Collective Voice" knew that this battle would be against a strong opponent, so they also fielded their strongest team: Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, and Yang Renhui. But even with a strong team, they still suffered a defeat. In theory, victory and defeat are commonplace for soldiers, and losing a game is not a big deal. Unfortunately, "Collective Voice" was too eager to win and completely forgot about morality and sportsmanship. They lost their composure in front of everyone during the defeat, which led to an unpleasant scene, with the audience shouting "Hit them!" and the players being surrounded after the game, almost unable to leave the stadium.

The Course of Events Was as Follows

The course of events was as follows: The unpleasantness began in the fourth quarter of the game. With about six or seven minutes left until the end of the game, "Collective Voice" was at a disadvantage, trailing by nine points. Guard Yang Renhui intercepted the ball in the chaos and rushed forward along the edge. The situation was tense. The United Team's defense stepped forward to block him. Just as the saying goes, "No sooner said than done," roughly when their bodies came into contact with each other, the referee blew his silver whistle and ruled that Yang Renhui had committed a foul. In Yang Renhui's view, the fault was on the other side, but he was penalized instead. He felt that the referee was unfair and immediately protested. However, the referee did not budge, and the protest was ineffective. He then angrily left the court. The referee then ruled a technical foul, and the entire "Collective Voice" team stopped playing. Deputy leader Cai Dawen also came out to negotiate. While they were arguing, the audience shouted, and the order was in great chaos. After the Consul General in Singapore, Wu Bosheng, came forward to mediate, the game barely continued. The "Collective Voice" players, after this stimulation, had lost their composure. In less than two minutes, another dispute arose. Chen Jinzhi committed a foul and was also ruled out of the game. The anger of "Collective Voice" increased even further, and the entire team put on their jackets again. After much persuasion, Li Shiqiao, Hu Bingjun, Cai Lianke, Chen Jinde, and Cai Wenhua reluctantly took the field. In the last minute, they once managed to close the gap to only two points, but finally the game ended with a score of 46 to 41. (To be continued)

### Impressions of Sing Tao's Southern Expedition (II)

Little Gao Shannu's performance was the most disappointing. He is responsible for the right wing, but he often mistakenly goes to the inside forward position, resulting in several times when the ball was lobbed to the right wing, but he failed to respond. His ball-handling skills are also far inferior to before. The "old waiting for the ball to come to my feet" problem of center forward Feng Jingxiang has not been removed. He is a typical designer. He has never had any aerial skills, nor the courage to sprint and hard tackle. His advantage is distributing to the wings and creating scoring opportunities for the inside forwards. This skill has not been matched by any Chinese player to date. In several matches in Singapore this time, his short passes and long balls have been quite impressive, but because he cannot grab the ball and dares not shoot, it always feels a bit lacking. However, for someone over forty years old to still maintain this level, it is indeed worthy of our respect. Inside forward Li Zhaorong's shots are powerful and accurate, making him the most threatening member of Sing Tao's forward line. His shooting can be done from any angle, whether it is a turning volley or a direct kick, he has his own way. He also has a superhuman ability, which is composure. Even in the chaotic array of heads and feet, he still commands calmly and can clearly see where the enemy's weaknesses are. His weakness is that he doesn't like to run much, perhaps because he is too fat. Sing Tao Football Team wins because their forwards are rich in opportunities for trickery, and there is also full understanding and coordination between them. They are not rushed in front of the goal, they never miss a shot, their passing is agile, and their changes are alert. However, their defense is inversely proportional. They cannot fully control the distribution, nor can they prevent the enemy's wings from flanking. As a result, as soon as the enemy forwards advance, they immediately force the door, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Under these circumstances, their own forwards have to retreat to help defend. By the time the siege is relieved and the ball is swung towards the opponent, the forwards are too late to push forward. This simply wears out the forward line. By the second half, they are exhausted, and the wonderfulness is lost. This phenomenon was clearly evident in the first three games. In the first battle against Sing Hua, they drew 3-3. All three goals scored by Sing Tao were in the first half. In the second half, not only did they make no progress, but they were also seized by Sing Hua for three consecutive goals. In the second battle against the Military United, although they won with an absolute advantage of 5-1, all five goals were also scored in the first half, and the result in the second half was only 0-0. In the third battle against Sing Min United, the score was 5-3. Although four goals were scored in the second half, all four goals were scored in the first ten minutes, taking advantage of the forwards' vigor. After that, it became a stage of "every bush an enemy." Although Sing Min United was only able to recover two goals, their advantage at that time was simply one-sided. It was only a pity that their forwards' shots were not accurate enough and they did not know how to seize opportunities. Otherwise, Sing Tao might have suffered a defeat in this game. Sing Tao's weak defensive power has never been remedied. So, when they faced the Ma Hua team that day, they happened to encounter the forwards' failure, and the entire army collapsed. Originally, Sing Tao's forwards failed and also encountered the iron-wall defenders Chen Jiashou and Chen Jiawan, making them feel even more inferior and at a loss. This is the main reason for Sing Tao's failure. (It is heard that Sing Tao has invited Chen Jiashou to participate in a trip to England.)

### The China Trust Bureau Determines Purchase Methods for Imported Cotton Without Import Permits; Methods for Subsidized Spinning and Export of Yarn are Still Under Negotiation

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the imported cotton that arrived at the port before April 30th of this year and for which import permits could not be obtained, the Central Bank previously decided to entrust the Central Trust Bureau to purchase it on behalf of the government. In order to smoothly advance this work, the China Trust Bureau specially convened a group meeting at the bureau at about 3 PM yesterday afternoon. Shao Zenghua and Wu Changfu from the Central Bank, Zhang Sili and Xu Zansan from the China Textile Construction Company, Rong Yixin from the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, 　Zhiquan from the Auditing Department, and others attended, chaired by Zhang Xu from the China Trust Bureau. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM, and the main decisions were as follows:

Scope of Purchase

(1) Cotton that shipped before November 24th of last year and arrived at the port before April 30th of this year, for which import permits could not be obtained, will be purchased.

(2) Cotton that shipped after November 24th of last year but was sold before November 24th (sold to flower shops or yarn factories) and arrived at the port before April 30th of this year, for which import permits could not be obtained, will be purchased.

(3) The deadline for applying to the Trust Bureau for purchase in this case is set at the end of July, and applications will not be accepted after the deadline.

Purchase Price

(1) The purchase price shall be based on the original price (True C.I.F. Value) stipulated in the sales contract between the foreign packing plant and the local importer, and shall be accompanied by valid proof such as the letter of credit issued by the bank at that time or other documents.

(2) Commissions paid by the importer to the flower shop or yarn factory will not be paid.

(3) Dock rent and other necessary national currency expenses payable after arrival at the port may also be paid after verification.

Payment Method

After the price is approved, the applicant shall submit all documents to the China Trust Bureau, and payment procedures will be processed after verification.

In addition, detailed methods for cotton yarn spinning and methods for subsidized yarn sales to various factories will be discussed by the China Textile Construction Company in conjunction with the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association before further consultation and decision with the China Trust Bureau. The government will negotiate the export of this batch of cotton yarn in order to recover foreign exchange as soon as possible.

Cotton Merchants' Opinions

Furthermore, the Cotton Business Association convened a trade discussion meeting the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of purchasing imported cotton. The meeting adjourned at 4 PM. According to the association's chairman, Liu Pingxun, after the Central Bank announced the handling methods for purchasing imported cotton arriving at the port, the association immediately received a notice. Afterwards, he convened relevant traders to discuss and listen to opinions several times. He then contacted the China Trust Bureau, and the deadlock in the discussions was the issue of exchange rate prices, which was difficult to approach. The China Trust Bureau's regulations for purchasing cotton stipulate that the US dollars paid by cotton merchants when placing orders with foreign countries in the past should be converted into national currency according to the official exchange rate and paid to the cotton merchants. This point makes cotton merchants not only unprofitable but also at a loss, so cotton merchants cannot accept it. Cotton merchants used black market foreign exchange in the past, which was higher than the official price, and most of the cotton was ordered during December of last year and January and February of this year. At that time, the price of foreign cotton was generally around 38 to 39 US cents per pound, but it has now reached 44 US cents. Therefore, there is a significant difference based on the price set when ordering, which would cause cotton merchants to suffer double losses, which is naturally difficult to sacrifice. However, in order to take into account the difficulties of both the government and the merchants, the association proposed a compromise solution: (1) Please pay the cotton merchants the original amount of US dollars they paid in the past, allowing them to use it, and the unpaid portion owed to foreign merchants should be handled by the China Trust Bureau itself. (2) If the authorities must recover the US dollars stored by the cotton merchants, the cotton merchants request that the price be calculated according to the current US price. Please also consider subsidizing the exchange rate.

### Foreign Stock Continues to Weaken

Foreign stocks had low transaction volume yesterday. With no external stimulus, market prices further weakened. The telephone sector suffered most from unfavorable conditions. British American Tobacco also softened due to heavy offloading. Ewo Cotton Mill started at $81,500 in the morning, dropping slightly to close at $79,000. Foreign firms were selling, while securities houses and individual investors also engaged in selling. As a result, telephone shares fell by 10% compared to the previous close, British American Tobacco also fell by 5%, and the remaining stocks showed mixed performance.

Government bonds also weakened yesterday. Unified Bonds (Class C) opened at $7,100 in the morning, immediately falling to $6,300 before recovering slightly, eventually fluctuating around $6,800. As a result, Classes A, B, and D fell by $100 compared to the previous close, while Classes C and E also fell by $200. Market participants believed that rooms 360 and 549 were sellers, while rooms 539 and 503 were buyers, with a total transaction volume of around 2 million.

### Pre-War Deposit Issues

Banking Industry Provides Guarantees; Court Considers Exempting from Provisional Execution

[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that the National Federation of Banking Associations is reporting that when the courts in Hankou order local banks to pay double the amount for pre-war deposits, they often grant provisional execution based on the plaintiff's request, causing deep anxiety among the banking industry. The Federation has reportedly sent representatives to consult with the Ministry of Finance, which has agreed that banks can provide guarantees to avoid provisional execution. In addition, the banking industries in Tianjin are planning to establish a joint reserve association, and the Banking Association will provide technical assistance and apply to the government for approval to establish it.

### Yung Shing's Capital Increase Imminent; Sino-Foreign's Brilliance Revealed

Yesterday was the last day for Yung Shing Cotton Mill to adjust interest rates before its capital increase. Active traders abandoned Yung Shing and switched to Sino-Foreign as an alternative, resulting in Sino-Foreign reaching its limit price with transactions at a premium. Yung Shing, on the other hand, retreated in steps and closed in a tired state. Small stocks such as King Fook and New Light were the most popular. The market opened stable in the morning. After the opening of Yung Shing, drop-period selling was encountered, with Nos. 54 and 104 offering to sell, and Nos. 157, 142, 231, and 117 all selling Yung Shing, forcing the price down to $10,880. Current Yung Shing also reached a low price of $10,480. Nos. 234, 224, 24, 85, and 69 advanced to over $11,000, while Nos. 177, 106, 36, and arbitrageurs were all selling, still struggling. Nos. 85, 224, 137, 223, 234, 154, 104, 181, 31, and 105 advanced to $11,420. Suddenly, a large buying trend arose for Sino-Foreign, with Nos. 89, 160, 84, 224, 159, and 69 all advancing, taking Yung Shing's place, and the price rose again and again, reaching the limit price. Drop-period Yung Shing, Nos. 611, 185, and 163, offered at high prices, and Nos. 89 and 171 also sold Yung Shing, forcing drop-period Yung Shing down to $11,200. However, Sino-Foreign's rising trend remained strong, and people still had some nostalgia, with Nos. 218, 65, 207, and 142 advancing to $11,420. Nos. 76, 148, 36, and 69 took advantage of the situation to sell, and drop-period Yung Shing fell below $11,250. But at this time, people's sentiment was still good, and Sino-Foreign's current delivery was taken over by No. 152, and the drop-period delivery was taken over by Nos. 116 and 8, all at the limit price. Drop-period Yung Shing was bought by Nos. 152 and 19, and current Yung Shing was absorbed by No. 220. At 10:20 AM, drop-period Yung Shing rose again to over $11,400. The gray market for drop-period Sino-Foreign even had a premium of $60. American Asia, New Light, and King Fook all showed vitality. However, since Yung Shing was about to implement a capital increase, most of the major market players were gradually leaving to switch to Sino-Foreign and American Asia. The off-market interest rate opened very high. Therefore, Nos. 154, 218, and 183 sold current Yung Shing, and Nos. 231, 83, 224, 183, 54, 76, 32, 12, 102, 142, and 89 all released a lot of stock. At 12:15 PM, drop-period Yung Shing fell to a low price of $10,760. After absorption by Nos. 219 and 22, it still rose back to $10,950. Nos. 224, 218, 129, 148, etc., still came to close out positions, and the noon close retreated to $2,800. After the close, No. 61 and others offered to sell, and the final price rose to over $10,850. Current King Fook soared by $10 to close, and the difference with drop-period delivery was only $2, indicating that the circulating chips were extremely scarce. The results compared to the previous close were: Sino-Foreign rose to the limit, New Light and American Asia rose slightly, China Flour and France Flour were flat, Yung Shing and Chin Hsing fell slightly, Yung Kong and King Fook each rose by more than 5%, New China alone fell by more than 10%, Commercial and King Lun rose by more than 5%, Matches, China Silk, Wuhe, Datong, and National Products all rose, Lilian fell by 5%, and New Asia Underwear fell slightly. Drop-period stocks: Sino-Foreign rose to the limit, King Fook, New Asia, and American Asia each rose by about 10%, Yung Kong and China Flour each rose by 5%, Yung Shing rose but only slightly, and Tung Hsing saw a slight decrease. In the off-market, old stocks such as World Paper Mill were still difficult to recover, and the rest were stable.

### Not Many Arbitrage Transactions Between Current and Drop-Period Delivery

Yesterday's arbitrage transactions between current and drop-period delivery had an interest rate of around $0.14 to $0.20. Yung Shing rose from $460 to $540 and closed at $510. Banking groups Nos. 181, 174, 74, 31, and 320 bought in, and Nos. 4, 89, 149, 224, and 173 sold out. Sino-Foreign ranged from $165 to $190, and New Light ranged from $9 to $10. Transaction volume was low.

### Rayon Falls; Factory-Management Transactions Are Quiet

Yesterday, the rayon market initially showed firmness, but ultimately fell due to the imbalance between supply and demand. No. 120, Asahi, was bid at $31 million, with the largest bid at $1.5 million, but no transaction occurred. Due to the abundance of sellers, prices declined, and the noon close had retreated to $30 million. Dongyang rayon was traded at $30.3 million. In the afternoon, sentiment remained weak, and prices fell below the $30 million mark again, with the final price at $29.7 million. No. 150, Asahi, and No. 75, Semi-Gloss, were abundant in the market because the silk weaving joint venture distributed a large number of them to silk factories, but they were not practical, so the prices also plummeted. No. 150, Asahi, had the same price as No. 210, and No. 75, Semi-Gloss, was only $3 million higher than No. 120, Asahi.

Yesterday, factory-management transactions were very quiet. Market prices were stable. Grades A, B, and C still had no transactions, only Grade D was traded at $33.3 million, and Grade E was traded at $2.8 million, but the payment was due in one week. Spot transactions were at $2 million for mid-grade goods and $3 million for high-grade goods. The dried-goods market price remained unchanged.

Yesterday, the silk market continued to decline. American Asia bedspreads were traded at $3.4 million, and Dachen bedspreads were traded at $2.75 million, with bids as high as $800,000. China Strong goods were also traded at $2.7 million. Dachen checkered crepe suffered an even greater decline, opening at $41,000 and falling all the way to a low of $39,800. Later, major players pulled it up, reversing the decline, but ultimately it did not improve. The spot price at the close was $40,000, and the deferred price was $40,400. China Kam crepe softened slightly due to raw materials. Yesterday, high-end goods were traded at $27,000.

### The Textile Adjustment Committee Actively Plans to Promote Yarn and Fabric Exports

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Yuan Zhongda, Director of the Secretariat of the Textile Adjustment Committee, the Committee is actively planning how to promote the export of yarn and fabric. It is rumored that the recent rise in yarn and fabric prices in Shanghai is related to the Committee's promotion of yarn and fabric exports. In fact, the Committee's plan is to find ways to increase the national cotton yarn production by two-sixths based on the current production volume and then use this increase of two-sixths to promote exports. Therefore, it will not affect the domestic yarn and fabric supply. In order to handle the promotion of exports, the Committee will send four specialists to foreign countries to investigate the market conditions and the demand for yarn and fabric. At the same time, it will ask national and private yarn factories to each send 20 specialists to assist the Committee in planning the promotion.

### As of June 30th, the Total Sales of US Dollar Bonds Nationwide Reached More Than 41 Million

[Reported by this newspaper] According to the US Dollar Bond Sales Committee, the sales performance of bonds nationwide as of June 30th was: US Dollar Public Bonds $20,950,700, Short-Term Treasury Bills $20,471,600, totaling $41,422,300.

Also, yesterday's total sales of treasury bills was $72,680, of which New China Bank sold $45,500 and Guangdong Bank sold $10,000.

### Fund Depository Institutions to be Approved Independently by the Committee

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the fund issue for the 1947 US Dollar Public Bonds, according to the organizational regulations of the US Dollar Bond Fund Supervisory Committee, the Ministry of Finance should allocate the fund (foreign exchange fund) to the institution designated by the Committee before each public bond matures for principal and interest payments. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has issued an official document instructing the Central Bank to allocate the funds accordingly. However, it has recently been found that the Public Treasury Law stipulates that whenever treasury funds are transferred to any institution, the receiving institution must deposit the received treasury funds with the Central Bank. The organizational regulations of the US Dollar Bond Committee were promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. As a result, the fund depository methods stipulated in the organizational regulations cannot supersede the provisions of the Public Treasury Law. However, in order to demonstrate greater trustworthiness and avoid the fund being deposited with the Central Bank, the Bond Committee has requested the Ministry of Finance to forward a request to the Executive Yuan, asking the National Government to separately approve the Bond Committee's independent designation of the fund's depository institution. It is heard that the National Government has approved this case. Once the official document is issued to the Bond Committee, the Committee will send a letter to the Central Bank requesting that the British gold be allocated accordingly. In the future, the foreign exchange gold will be considered for deposit with the Bank of China in New York. As for the fund issue for short-term treasury bills, it is heard that the Bond Committee is currently submitting a request to the Ministry of Finance to allocate the funds to the Committee for safekeeping before each treasury bill matures for principal and interest payments.

### Stores Actively Buy to Strengthen Their Stocks; Rice Prices Decline and Then Rise; Vegetable Oil Prices Decline by Ten Thousand

### Spot Cotton Market Remains Stable

### Developing the Nanyang Market: Overseas Chinese Hope for Domestic Goods Sales in Nanyang

Zhang Shoushi, Standing Director and General Manager of the Hong Kong China Nanyang Economic Association, invited local economic scholars Wei Youye, Zhu Sihuang, and others to discuss the Nanyang market issue at the Bankers Club yesterday. Zhang Yifan first introduced the topic, and then Zhang Shoushi reported on the current situation of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, stating that overseas Chinese are currently under dual oppression and are in a worse situation than before, and they feel very distressed about the current situation in their motherland. They hope that national industries can gain a significant position in the Nanyang market. Finally, those present believed that the obstacles to selling domestic goods in Nanyang are domestic rather than foreign. One is the excessively low exchange rate, and the other is the excessively high domestic prices. They unanimously hoped that the association could take on the responsibility of communicating between the domestic market and overseas Chinese in Nanyang.

### New Wheat Procurement Procedures: Four Banks Jointly to Provide Loans, Flour Industry to Nominate Xi Debing and Rong Yiren for Negotiations

According to sources, the Ministry of Food has recently finalized the procurement procedures for new wheat this year. The capital portion will be allocated by the Four Banks Joint Office, providing the ministry with 300 billion yuan for application. The loan agreement will be signed this week in Nanjing by Director Wang of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food and the Nanjing branch of the Central Bank. The procurement matters will be handled by the various branches of the China Farmers Bank entrusted by the Ministry of Food. However, in order to expedite the procurement process, the Fourth District Flour Industry Association and its five major factories, including Fuxin, Maoxin, Huafeng, Yutong, and Fufeng, will jointly form a procurement price review committee with the grain industry associations in various producing areas. The procurement area is limited to the original wheat distribution centers along the Yangtze River, including Hankou, Wuhu, Pinghu, Suzhou, Taixian, and other places. After a certain amount has been procured, it will be collected and sold on behalf of the five major factories such as Fuxin. The handling fee per bag is between 15,000 and 20,000 yuan, and the Ministry of Food is responsible for overall allocation. It is expected to officially start in the second half of this month. Currently, the flour industry has nominated Xi Debing of Fufeng Factory and Rong Yiren of Maoxin to conduct negotiations on the future, and it is also planned to request the authorities to support small and medium-sized factories in the industry.

### Cotton Production in Shaanxi and Hubei Not Drastically Reduced

[Our Newspaper] Recent reports have indicated that cotton production in Shaanxi, Hubei, and other places this year has been significantly reduced compared to the pre-war period. According to a cotton textile industry authority in this city, this report is not entirely accurate. Taking Shaanxi as an example, in 1937, the production was 1,067,612 dan, last year's production was 711,000 dan, and this year's estimate is more than 1 million dan. In Hubei Province, in 1937, the production was 1,517,337 dan, last year's production was 1,721,000 dan, and this year's estimate is 1.9 million dan. If there were no natural disasters and disturbances, the above-mentioned output would not be limited to this and could even exceed the pre-war output. As for the total number of spindles in our country, the most accurate statistics are 4,512,890, with 4,061,000 actually operating. However, due to insufficient electricity and shortened working hours, the operating efficiency is 85% of the pre-war level. To date, the cotton textile industry has the most generous profits in the national industrial sector, and there is no crisis as rumored.

### Dyed Cloth Market Still Strong

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw insiders selling at high prices and retailers liquidating their positions. In addition, due to strict investigations by the authorities, buyers remained cautious, and the market suddenly weakened. As a result, the off-exchange price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell back to 471,000 yuan. Fine cloths such as Five Happiness Blue Chicken, Colored Ball, and Yanghe also fell slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. However, due to increased dye and labor costs, the prices of dark blue Drill and blue cloth rose sharply by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. The Textile Construction Company sold 26 types of cloth, with Blue Chicken fine cloth rising to 420,000 yuan.

### Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Start Production

The Sericulture Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministries of Agriculture and Economic Affairs released two pieces of news yesterday.

The committee once stipulated that production should start from July 1st to 15th. Currently, the dry cocoon mortgage loans are being processed by the China Farmers Bank. To date, more than a dozen factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, including Fuhua, Yongkang, and Dingxin, have started production. The rest will be able to start production completely within a few days. (2) Research on autumn silkworm eggs. Regarding the sale price, quantity, and acid treatment date of autumn silkworm eggs, the committee's tenth meeting designated a group consisting of Shao Shenpei, Xu Danren, Zhu Xinyu, Jiang Shiqi, and Guan Yi to be responsible for research and first solicit the opinions of the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It is also learned that the committee will submit the topic for discussion at its eleventh meeting on the 12th.

### Foreign Tea Market Prices Rise

Yesterday's foreign tea market saw a sudden surge in trading, and the market continued to rise. Initially, prices only increased slightly, but then the upward trend intensified, and as a result, the price of each grade rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per dan compared to the previous day. The reason for this is the rumor that France and Morocco may open up trade in Chinese tea, and it is feared that this will become a reality. At the same time, the French trading company Yongxing has finalized a deal for 900 tons of Chun Mee green tea, which will be delivered and exported within a few days. It is said that it has been distributed to local exporters in this city, who are actively rushing to ship it overseas, leading to increasingly strong buying sentiment in the market. Currently, in addition to Shui Xing Trading Company acquiring 2,000 boxes, Tongfu Trading Company and Wuchang and other tea companies have also acquired around 1,000 boxes. Under these circumstances, sentiment is naturally bullish. As for domestic sales of black and green tea, they have been performing consistently well recently, and prices are also extraordinarily strong. The future is particularly optimistic.

### Summer Precautions: Street Vendors Selling Cold Drinks and Cooked Food

— Cheng Hanzhang

Recently, I have seen wine shops, food stores, and food stalls along the street selling cold drinks, cooked chicken, cooked meat, and the like. These foods and drinks are most likely to attract flies, which are a medium for spreading typhoid and cholera germs. If we do not plan ahead now, we will regret it if an epidemic breaks out in the future! However, strict prohibition is likely to cause disturbances and unrest. Excessive leniency will be viewed as if nothing is happening. The best approach is to increase public knowledge so that people are aware of the dangers and are unwilling to buy or eat them. Then the sellers will not be able to make a profit or even suffer losses, so they have no reason not to change their business. Therefore, I have made slogans on the left: Street vendors selling cold drinks are a concentrated pool of germs. Street vendors selling cooked food are a breeding ground for the god of plague.

### Are You Anemic?

— Yu Zhengxing

Fatigue, exhaustion, lack of energy may be the result of anemia. Anemia weakens the work efficiency of countless people. During the war, the world did not doubt its progress and harmed the lives of thousands of people. Now there are many facts about anemia, do you know them? Please see:

Anemia is a deficiency of red blood cells - correct. People with anemia may have insufficient red blood cells, or they may have a normal number of red blood cells, but insufficient red blood pigment.

Anemia is a new disease, a product of civilization - incorrect. As early as 1670, the English physician Sydenham recognized anemia and treated the disease with iron. Early medical records also mention anemia. Liver treatment for pernicious anemia was only recently discovered in the United States.

Hemoglobin is the substance that makes red blood cells red - correct. Hemoglobin is a complex protein that transports gas and carbon dioxide and contains iron, trace amounts of copper, and other essential substances.

Except for the loss of bleeding, red blood cells are a permanent part of the body - incorrect. Blood cells are constantly dying and constantly regenerating. The average life of a red blood cell may be less than three months.

The number of red blood cells often increases with infection - incorrect. It is white blood cells that increase with infection. Many infections, especially streptococcal infections, reduce the number of red blood cells.

More red blood cells are produced than the body needs - correct. The number of newly formed blood cells is usually greater than the number that permanently exists. When a child's life begins, red blood cells are destroyed to prepare to store iron in the liver.

Paleness is often a symptom of anemia - incorrect. While paleness may be a cause of anemia, not all pale people are necessarily anemic. Many people have sufficient red blood cells and hemoglobin, but still appear pale because their blood vessels cannot bring blood to the surface of the skin. In many people, red blood cells must be reduced by almost 50 percent before the paleness of anemia can be detected.

Anemia has no symptoms - incorrect. In non-pernicious anemia cases, symptoms such as weakness and fatigue are often discovered after a short period of time. Mild anemia often results in shortness of breadth, heart murmur, swelling of the feet and ankles, and headaches. Severe anemia is sometimes caused by numbness, enlargement of the abdomen, deafness, pale or yellow skin, and enlargement of the fingertips.

A naturally cold person is probably anemic on average - correct. A lack of red blood may increase sensitivity to low temperatures.

If a person is anemic, it can be judged by the redness of the corners of their eyes and mouth - incorrect. If the anemia is severe, there may be a significant loss of pigmentation. But strong suspicion is not completely reliable.

The correct way to diagnose anemia is a blood count - correct. An accurate blood count can determine the occurrence and extent of anemia, as well as its symptoms or the lack of red blood cells. This is the only diagnostic method.

The biggest cause of anemia is the lack of iron in the diet - correct. It must be remembered that the cause of anemia is iron deficiency - often referred to as secondary anemia, or nutritional anemia - which is commonly seen. There are twelve different types. Anemia is caused by severe infections. Diseases such as pernicious anemia, hemorrhagic anemia,　disease, hookworm disease, and syphilis are a few types, not caused by iron deficiency.

Anemia in pregnant women may transmit the disease to the child - correct. The child's body relies on the mother's supply of iron and other essential components to form red blood cells. A child born to an anemic mother may not be anemic at birth, but without sufficient iron reserves in his body, he may become ill in the first year of his life.

Mothers who are not anemic do not have anemic children - incorrect. Special anemia may be transmitted by non-anemic mothers. This is due to genetic factors, not inappropriate diet or recklessness. It is entirely due to the causes of pregnancy. This type of formation is found in the Mediforranean race. Another cause, called erythroblastic anemia, has not been discovered until recently. Blood transfusions in childhood can usually suppress these hereditary anemias.

If a child drinks only milk, he will not be anemic - incorrect. Although milk contains very small amounts of iron, this life element is still rare in milk. Newborns often need enough iron to meet their needs. However, unless foods containing iron are adequately supplied within eight or nine months after birth, anemia may be discovered.

To prevent anemia, liver must be used in food - correct. Liver contains the essential substances to inhibit pernicious anemia and prevent anemia in middle age or old age. However, this one food should not be needed alone. But no matter what, liver is a good food rich in iron.

Foods that are easy to provide to prevent anemia are those with iron - correct. Foods that actually have iron include all grains, egg yolks, liver, lean meat, garden peas, beans, dates, prunes, raisins, rhubarb, soybeans, spinach, and turnips, green vegetables, mustard greens, and beets, vegetables, cauliflower, cabbage, bean sprouts, asparagus, potatoes, and fruits are also rich in iron.

Spinach can be used in every food because it is a food that prevents anemia - incorrect. When spinach contains iron, substances present in green leafy foods will not force children to eat.

### Three-Character Classic on Typhoid Fever

— Shou Wuqing

The weather is currently out of balance, with uncertain sunny and rainy days. It is suddenly sunny and bright, and suddenly overcast and surging. Although acute epidemics are rare, infections with typhoid fever, according to clinical observations, have increased rather than decreased. Moreover, typhoid fever is mostly the typical type and less often the atypical type, so the course of the disease is quite long. I have jokingly written a "Three-Character Classic on Typhoid Fever" to provide children with reading material, which is not without benefit for promoting summer hygiene.

Typhoid fever, infectious disease. All children, have heard of it.

Easy to contract, be careful. Long illness, truly harmful.　High fever, takes much effort. Do not delay, it's most important.

Has bacteria, like rods. With cilia, very agile.　From the mouth, enters. Dirty flies, act as matchmakers.

Incubation period, takes two weeks. At first, observe fever closely.

Cold does not subside, heat does not clear. Sweating, like malaria.

Taking white medicine, won't be effective. Has cough, mostly nasal discharge.

Often constipated, or diarrhea. Porridge soup, difficult to take.　Develops white fur, red rash. Only sleeps, often moans.　Intestinal bleeding, complications. Intestinal perforation, very scary.

Three weeks, illness lessens. Wants food, escapes death.

Skin and bones, skinny and clean. Lacks blood, like a ghost.

Looking at it, truly frightening. Glucose, given by injection.

Vitamins, quickly take. Quickly recover, slowly get up.

Advise siblings, pay attention to hygiene. Often wash hands, kill flies.

Be moderate in diet, guard against calamity. Remember carefully, ward off all diseases!

(Note) White medicine is the common name for quinine powder.

### More on Calcium-Vitamin C Compound

— Song Guobin

Since I raised this issue in the fourth issue of this publication, I have seen the high opinions expressed by Mr. Shen, Mr. Wu, and Mr. Zhu in the 10th, 13th, 15th, and 16th issues one after another, opening the door to research and contributing to the path. The merits of all gentlemen are truly undeniable!

This issue is of great importance. It not only has its rights and wrongs in academic terms, but also affects medical treatment. My personal prejudice is trivial, but the interests of patients are great. I must speak my mind frankly. "How can I be fond of argument? I have no choice!"

(1) The theory of prohibiting acid is not consistent. For decades, there have been advocates for and against it, each holding different views, each with reasons, each with teachers, and each with schools of thought. The competition between factions is not a one-day affair. I follow Sergent's theory, believing that patients with progressive tuberculosis have a high calcium deficiency and need even more calcium. Since acid overcomes calcium, the theory of prohibiting acid is of course a reasonable theory during calcium treatment. As for Mr. Wang's statement that "gastric juice is inherently acidic," the orally administered calcium has already been affected by it, and there is no need to prohibit acid, which is already the case. However, it is not known that before taking calcium supplements, it is necessary to drink a cup of antacid water to neutralize gastric juice, so that gastric acid cannot play its role, and to achieve the purpose of calcium therapy. Why is this? Furthermore, oral medications containing calcium and vitamin C are rarely seen among foreign proprietary medicines. As far as I know, there are only calcium-vitamin D compounds, such as Calcipot D. As for calcium-vitamin C compounds, only a certain Leaf factory in China began to produce Calcivit C to meet the needs of doctors in our country. Why is this? Taking a broad view of Mr. Wang's theory of not prohibiting acid, it also has considerable reasons. If there is a public experimental proof, I would not hesitate to abandon Sergent's theory and "completely abandon his learning and learn from it."

(2) Mr. Shen stated that "tuberculosis is certain to lack calcium," advocating that all tuberculosis patients should be treated with calcium. I dare not agree with this point. Tuberculosis is a polymorphic disease. Some patients lack calcium, and some do not. In fibrotic and calcified tuberculosis, calcium in the lesions has reached saturation. If calcium is injected again, it will inevitably be "excreted out of the body" as Mr. Shen said. Then, the injection is equal to no injection. Even if there is no great harm, there is no benefit. Is this why Mr. Shen has been doing this for "two or three years" without much effect?

(3) Elderly tuberculosis is mostly a stubborn chronic disease, and progressive activity is in the minority. Whether or not to inject calcium should be determined based on the patient. If calcium is administered regardless of the disease type, it is almost blind.

In short, this issue cannot be resolved by empty words. We must carry out: (A) autopsies to examine the lesions of bodies that have taken or injected calcium-vitamin C compounds. (1) Are there any insoluble calcium lumps? (2) If there are calcium lumps, what kind of calcium salt do they belong to?

(B) Animal experiments. Take several guinea pigs, make them tuberculous, and then administer calcium-vitamin C compound and pure calcium for comparison.

(C) Clinical experiments. Divide tuberculosis patients into two groups, one group injected with calcium-vitamin C compound and the other group injected with pure calcium. At the same time, the diet should prohibit acid, and examine the urine for calcium excretion and compare the amount of excretion.

In this way, the truth can be made clear to the world. What do you three gentlemen, Shen, Wu, and Wang, think?

### Preventing Yellow Fever!

— Chai Te-lin

On the sixth floor of a large building on Euston Road in London, five young men in white coats were working diligently, whispering softly, producing a yellow powder. This building is the location of the Wellcome Tropical Medicine Research Institute, a crucial command center in the battle against various deadly tropical diseases. The yellow powder these young men were producing is a vaccine, arguably humanity's first line of defense against yellow fever.

Our prevention of yellow fever transmission relies on injecting this live virus—a wondrous pathogenic entity somewhere between living and non-living, invisible to ordinary optical microscopes. However, while both yellow fever vaccination and smallpox inoculation involve living organisms, there are significant differences. The smallpox vaccine is taken from cows, and inoculation results in cowpox. The virus used for the yellow fever vaccine, on the other hand, has been cultured and propagated for years in the Euston Road laboratory. The initial trace of the virus has been artificially reproduced thousands of times, as only laboratory cultivation can produce enough virus to meet demand. The viral strain used by the Wellcome Institute and other laboratories around the world is called "17D," a mutation and fortuitous product of the original viral strain.

Part of the story of this viral strain involves Asibi, a native of the British Gold Coast. Twenty years ago, a British-American expedition studying yellow fever in Africa obtained some virus specimens from Asibi, who was infected with the disease. Laboratories in both Britain and the United States then began research. One day, an unusual development was observed in the American laboratory culturing the Asibi virus: the virus (when injected into monkeys) no longer caused illness. It had lost its ability to cause yellow fever, although it retained the ability to provide lasting immunity. Not long ago, the British colonial government, recognizing Asibi's donation of the virus as beneficial to humanity, awarded him a pension.

Manufacturing this vaccine takes sixteen days, and a total of three weeks is required, including the final testing, before it can be stored and used. Ordinary chicken eggs are crucial to the manufacturing process. The Wellcome Institute uses over a thousand eggs per month, an average of 268 per week, sourced from farms in Middlesex, Kent, and Surrey.

The Wellcome Institute starts manufacturing new batches of vaccine twice a week, each time producing several batches. After the eggs arrive from the farms or suppliers, they are incubated at a temperature of 102-3 degrees Fahrenheit for nine days to allow the embryos to develop. On the ninth day, the eggs are removed from the incubator and inspected against a light source using a specially designed machine. Non-viable eggs are discarded immediately, and the remaining ones are inoculated with the yellow fever virus.

During inoculation, the atmosphere in the laboratory resembles that of an operating room. The one performing the inoculation is senior technical assistant Mr. Green. He was awarded the British Empire Medal for his contributions to vaccine production. When inoculating, he wears a transparent mask to prevent contamination from the eggs. The surface of the eggs is also wiped with alcohol, resulting in a strong odor of disinfectant in the air. The hypodermic needles used for injection are replaced every three eggs to minimize the number of contaminated eggs in case a needle becomes contaminated.

The injection takes one second per egg. He deftly inserts the needle with a downward pressure of his finger, injecting one-tenth of a cubic centimeter of the virus into each egg. On average, each egg injected in this way can produce enough doses for a hundred people. Sometimes one egg yields as many as two hundred doses. The eggs are then placed back in the incubator for three or four days to allow the virus to continue to grow within the embryos. (See attached illustration.)

On the twelfth or thirteenth day, the embryos are removed from the eggshells, ground up with water, and the resulting mixture is placed in test tubes. They are then spun rapidly in a centrifuge to allow the larger particles to settle to the bottom of the tube, leaving a layer of cloudy, brownish liquid above, which is the vaccine. This vaccine must then be tested to see if it is contaminated with bacteria.

Up to this point, every step is a race against time, because the virus is an extremely fragile organism that is at risk of dying at any moment before the liquid is dried and turned into powder. Even after it becomes powder, it can only be preserved for one or two months and must be kept at the proper temperature, not exceeding four degrees Celsius. That is why the vaccine is sent out from the laboratory packaged in insulated bottles containing ice or in boxes containing dry ice.

In the vaccine manufacturing process, it only becomes a powder on the sixteenth day. This is achieved by first placing the liquid into small glass tubes, freezing them, and then using a drying method.

But before this batch of vaccine can be used, one problem must be solved: the crucial issue of dosage. Exactly how much is needed to achieve an immunizing effect? In other words, how much virus does this batch of vaccine contain? Therefore, the powder must be diluted with thousands of times its original water content and then tested. Based on the results of this test, the strength of the virus in each batch of vaccine can be determined.

The manufactured vaccine resembles large yellow pills. When used, it must be dissolved in distilled water and injected into the human body. The injection only takes a few minutes, but after the injection, 90 to 95 percent of people will be completely immune to yellow fever for at least four years.

### Eggs in the Incubator

Eggs are incubated for nine days, and non-viable eggs are discarded. The remaining eggs are injected with the yellow fever virus and placed in the incubator for another three or four days before the embryos are removed from the eggshells. If left to hatch naturally, they would hatch into chicks in another eight days. (Photo courtesy of the British Information Service)

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

I.

It's all because the flower season is too fleeting; even if one doesn't love flowers, one still pauses before the flower-selling girl.

The young, naive flower-selling girl smiles expectantly at people.

"This one," she picks up a bunch of deep red, half-open flowers—roses; she asks, "Do you want it?"

"Um—? Want, don't want..." I'm staring intently at the pink wall over there, the wisteria in someone's yard, blooming so profusely? Perhaps the branches are delicate and soft; a cluster has been blown down by the wind, falling on the ground outside the wall...

"Do you want it or not?" She raises the flowers in her hand a little higher; the shadows of the roses are reflected on her face; she also has a flower-like youth, but she doesn't know it. She just wants to exchange the flowers for money to buy rice, so a distressed anxiety appears on her face.

I nod, telling her that I want them.

The cheeks shadowed by the roses then gain a comforting smile.

As she hands me the roses, I ask her to pick up that sprig of wisteria lying on the road.

She's a little surprised, but happily does it; she also says with a grin: "Do you even like the flowers at the foot of the wall?"

"Why not?..." But I don't say it out loud.

She laughs at how silly I am, and I pity how silly she is...

II.

Summer gradually matures. Another year of flowers, leaves, nightingales, thrushes—

Green darkens and red thins; don't you dislike the transience of spring?

A friend returning from the South asks: "Tell me, do you love fiery July?"

I nod casually at her.

She laughs: "What in this season makes you most fascinated?"

"Watching lotuses blossom, listening to rain hitting banana leaves," I think for a moment: "Also, the cool breeze at night, the artful clouds in the sky, the croaking of frogs in the pond, the cicadas on the high branches..."

"Hmm," she ponders: "People who have lived in Jiangnan for a long time will appreciate these gentle, leisurely beauties."

"What? Don't you think these are the most lovable?" Her words make me feel lost.

"I love the blazing sun, hurricanes, torrential rain, lightning, and thunder."

"Isn't it a bit too stimulating?" I laugh: "You didn't used to be like this; a not-too-long trip has brought you the passion of the South."

She smiles calmly and asks: "Don't you think that stimulating, symbolizing the passion of life, isn't better than gentle peace?"

III.

On a clear, moonlit midsummer night, in a quiet, brightly lit room, we were silently facing each other.

She suddenly felt melancholy.

"On such a beautiful night, even if there's something sad, it should be temporarily forgotten," I advise her.

"Forgotten?" She raises her sorrowful eyes: "Unless the seas turn into mulberry fields."

"Ah, why do you always have so much longing for the past, which can never return? That's not very good, I think."

"I think so too," she says softly: "But it's more than just longing."

"What else is it?"

"Maybe it's indignation? Even I... can't figure it out."

"Indignation?" I ask in surprise, raising my head to look at her.

She nods, adding: "Indignation over the death of a friend."

"A good friend, right? He died too tragically and too young," I sigh.

"And died too ordinarily," she explains: "So I will never be able to forget, I will always be indignant for him, until I die, I will carry this endless sorrow into the grave."

"You loved him?"

"Please don't say that," she answers solemnly: "I don't cling to the past because of love, but because of his death, I hate—"

"I understand what you mean; you regret his death—a promising young man meeting an unnamed sacrifice; you are eternally indignant."

"Yes, an eagle must never die like a crow; how can a furious horse not die on the battlefield?" She raises her head slightly, lifting her dangerous and thoughtful eyes: "How can a hero-like person not have a heroic death?"

"How can a hero-like person not have a heroic death?" I deliberately repeat her words, telling our hero among friends, and all the friends of heroes!

IV.

I have never thought about how to arrange my own tomb, or recalled the death of a most intimate friend.

However, once—

"If a best friend died," he asked me: "How would you commemorate him?"

"It wouldn't be you, would it?"

"Maybe it would be me!"

"If it were you, then," I thought for a moment: "I would go to your cemetery without interruption, offering a bunch of yellow tulips, or cold, beautiful white peonies; if it were a snowy, windy, bitterly cold day, I would definitely bring a sprig of elegant winter plum..."

He was silent.

"Do you dislike it?" I give him a puzzled glance; "Aren't these all the things you love?"

"Those are what I loved when I was alive, but not necessarily what I need after death," he says solemnly.

"Yes, I also have to tell them to decorate your lonely tomb with evergreen pines and cypresses—"

"No, no," he interrupts me: "I didn't think about needing a grave."

"Ah, I understand," I realize with a start: "As Ms. Bing Xin said, on a clear, moonlit night, bury the remains at the bottom of the ocean—I guessed right?"

He laughs brightly: "Hmm, a poet's idea; actually, the seabed may not be able to sleep peacefully, and perhaps you can't even see coral..."

"..."

"..." I'm at a loss, not knowing what to say.

"Can't you think of anything else? You confused person, do you remember a saying: Our graves are not on the ground, but in people's hearts."

"You mean," I exclaim: "I'll forget you? No, no, that's absolutely impossible; I remember you, forever, forever."

"I think, I hope so too," he says as if murmuring to himself: "Haven't you said? The strongest memory of mankind is God's most cruel arrangement."

"Thank God for such an arrangement," he laughs. Both joyful and melancholic: "And thank you; you know? Being able to forget is the happiest thing, but being forgotten is the most unfortunate thing..."

—That's right, living in people's memories is the most beautiful grave, better than eternal life! Don't you think so?

### New Words from a Green Window

— Zizhen

The "New Words from a Green Window," a collection of legendary writings, was very popular in the Ming Dynasty, as can be seen from various book lists. It enjoyed the same popularity as the "Unofficial History of Yu Chu," falsely attributed to Tang Xianzu (actually written by Ling Xingde under a pseudonym), and the "Collection of Beautiful Women," attributed to Wang Shizhen (suspected to have been written by Ling Chu's brothers). All three books contain legendary writings, with the "Taiping Guangji" being a major source for them. The latter two are later in date, so they also include works from the Ming Dynasty, while the "New Words from a Green Window" does not contain any works from after the Song Dynasty.

In the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, Chao Li of Kaizhou compiled the "Shiwentang Book List" ("Peiping Library Monthly," Volume 3, Issue 2), which lists "New Tales from a Green Window" in the category of miscellaneous writings. This is indeed the book in question. He also lists "Records of the Green Window" as a separate book, seemingly another work. During the Wanli period, Zhu Muxue's "Wanjuanlou Book List" ("Yujianzhai Books") Volume 3 also listed: "New Words from a Green Window, Four Volumes." Neither book list mentions the compiler, so it is unknown by whose hand it was compiled. The recent "Shubo Yongtan" Volume 4 records a manuscript copy seen at the Hososawa shop in Japan, titled: "Compiled by the Master of Imperial Capital Romance." Also, Xiang's "Eight Thousand Volume Building Book List" in Qiantang during the Qing Dynasty also listed this book. Half of the Eight Thousand Volume Building's collection was acquired by the National Academy of Sciences Library in Panlongli, Nanjing. It is unknown whether this book was among them; even if it was once stored there, it is now unknown whether it still exists. In addition, the Liu family of Nanxun also had a copy in their Jia Ye Tang collection, but its current whereabouts are also unknown. Unfortunately, all three copies held domestically and abroad are currently inaccessible; all that can be seen is the full table of contents of the book transcribed in "Shubo Yongtan."

Although the original book is not available, its date of completion can still be roughly determined. In the first volume of Luo Ye's "Drunken Old Man's Talks" from the Song and Yuan Dynasties (Japanese photoprint edition), the "Preface to the Tongue-Plowing Narrative" discusses storytellers of fiction, saying:

"...In youth, he studied the 'Taiping Guangji'; in adulthood, he attacked historical books of past dynasties; the legendary tales of powder and rouge were stored within his heart; knowledge of romance and beauty only resided above the mundane; he perused 'Yijianzhi' without exception, and mastered all that was recorded in the 'Xiuyingji'; no hidden secret escaped the 'Dongshan Laughing Grove'; he returned to the 'New Tales from a Green Window' as a basis."

Since it is listed alongside the "Yijianzhi" and predates the "Drunken Old Man's Talks," and contains no works from after the Song Dynasty, then its date of completion should be in the Southern Song, and the compiler was a resident of the Southern Song capital, Lin'an.

After this book was compiled and published, it also underwent changes. In Yuan Yang Chaoying's "Taiping Yuefu" Volume 7, the Yue Tiao tune "Quail Suite," the opening song of Zhou Zhongbin's "Ode to Little Qing" says:

Releasing the scroll, picking up the lamp, I now view the ancients, hating the wind, burying the clouds, resenting the rain. Because of viewing the surviving writings of Jindou, therefore, 'New Words from a Green Window' was created. Considering it, there are windows within; it's good that there are also tea merchants, it's good that there are also able literati.

According to Zhou's song, the subject is the love affair between the Song courtesan Su Qing (Little Qing) and the scholar Shuang Jian, and the merchant Feng Kui. The original story can be found in Mei Dingzuo's "Qingni Lotus Flower Record" Volume 7 in Ming Dynasty. The Song musician Zhang Wuniu had various palace tunes, and there were also many Yuan dramas that used this story as material. Jindou is Jindou County in Luzhou, the birthplace of Little Qing, hence the name. "'Jie Window New Words' should refer to this book. It is credible that the Yuan Dynasty would have also included the story of Little Qing in 'New Master from a Green Window,' and this story was exactly what the Yuan people liked to sing about the most (there are many in Yuan Sanqu). However, the extant Japanese collection does not contain this record, which should be because the manuscript copy used the Song printed edition as its source, so it was not included; and this matter is only seen in the Yuan people's 'Supplemented' edition. Secondly, the book titles are also inconsistent: the manuscript copy and Zhou Zhongbin's song and the 'Wanjuanlou Book List' use 'New Words from a Green Window'; while the 'Drunken Old Man's Talks' and the 'Baowentang Book List' use 'New Tales from a Green Window.' There may be some clerical errors, but that may not be the main reason; it is likely that the original was divergent like this, and the two characters are similar in form and meaning, so they are easily confused. However, the two should be the same book, there seems to be no doubt.

The more than one hundred legendary titles recorded in this book also give us many insights: The "Biography of Zheng Delin" according to this book and the "Guangji of Annual Customs," we know comes from the Tang Dynasty Pei Xing's "Legend," sufficient to correct the Ming Dynasty Lu Ji's error in the "Ancient and Modern Collection of Sayings." "Jin Yan's Spring Outing Meets Niang" (from "Yanyu Fiction") and the "Qingshi" compared, is the "Jin Zhuang Spring Outing" in the "Drunken Old Man's Talks." "Yang Ai'ai Did Not Marry Her Second Husband" (from Su Zimei's essay, but the current "Collection of Su Scholar" does not contain it), is what the story "Ai Ai Ci" is based on, "Cui Bao's Praise Xue Qiong Playing the Zither" (derived from "Yiqing Collection"), is also seen in "Guangji of Annual Customs," which is what Bai Pu's "Xue Qiong's Moonlight Night Zither Lament," Zheng Dehui's "Cui Huaibao Hears the Zither on a Moonlit Night" two miscellaneous dramas and Yuan Dynasty Southern drama "Cui Huaibao" are based on.

### The Annunciation

— El Greco

El Greco (1545-1614) was originally Greek, but because he lived in Spain for a long time and laid the foundation for Spanish art, most historians include him in the history of Spanish art.

He was a religious believer, and his works mostly used religious myths as themes. They are solemn and powerful, and he was good at using colors and symbolizing things with colors. Although the figures he made were mostly exaggerated, they did not make people feel strange or uneasy. This style directly influenced modern times.

"The Annunciation" is one of his most famous works. (Liu Shi)

### Past Events

— Lotus Seed

Although I have never seen the vast ocean, water always fills me with too much love. I envy its freedom, because when it is annoyed, it can vent its anger with surging waves; unlike me, who has to hide my original kind soul all day long, floating cautiously in the wind and dust of the people; even in times of sorrow, I am not allowed to shed a single tear with relief.

I remember once in the countryside, I accompanied my mother on a small boat to visit a distant relative. Because of the long journey, we set off almost still under the cover of darkness, pushing aside the low-hanging treetops on both sides of the narrow river surface. Just as dawn was breaking, the boat had already sailed onto the wide river surface at the foot of Dushan Mountain. The river was as calm as an old nun's mood, without a trace of worldly ripples. The morning sun had just revealed half of its red face, dyeing the water all over with golden red. In the clear water, I could clearly see the strands of aquatic plants and the large and small fish swimming in groups among them. The boat glided over the tops of the aquatic plants, and the fish secretly kissed the edges of the boat submerged in the water; I stared wide-eyed at all this, doubting that I was swimming in a dream.

On the sandbars in the river, pairs of gulls were washing each other's feathers. Some had finished their morning lessons and were frolicking in the air, while occasionally one or two solitary gulls stood alone by the water, stretching their necks as if waiting for their lost companions to return.

At this moment, a pair of gulls hovered above me, and I deeply wished them happiness and freedom. Suddenly, a gunshot struck one of them, instantly taking its precious life. It fell from the sky, while the other fled with a cry of sorrow. Watching this cruel scene, I couldn't help but cry out, and my mother in the cabin hurriedly called out to reassure me, thinking I was startled by the gunshot. But how could she know her daughter's feelings? Looking up at the sky where the tragedy had occurred, with tears in my eyes, I lamented for a long time. I pitied the unfortunate encounter of the gull who had met with disaster, but I even more regretted the fate of the surviving gull. From now on, in how much longing and sorrow would it recall its never-returning lover? In how much loneliness and desolation would it gaze at its own reflection and spend these sorrowful days?

Why are humans so cruel? Don't they deserve the right to be together freely? I was saddened.

### Anecdotes of Shakespeare

— Oriental Mist

When Shakespeare had not yet become a famous poet and playwright, he once competed with the comedian Jonson on the London stage. However, sometimes the performance of Jonson's comedy could not even cover the reception fees; while the characters created by Shakespeare, as soon as they appeared on stage, the "sold out" sign would immediately be hung high at the door of the theater.

However, Jonson not only did not feel jealous, resentful, or complaining, but instead greatly admired Shakespeare. Once, when Shakespeare's play was published, Jonson actually compared him with the great writers of Greece, Rome, and all ages, and also wrote a poem:

"England, you have a poet to be proud of! The theater scene of Europe depends on his holy achievements and miracles. He is not a scholar of a temporary moment, but a literary dragon for all ages."

It is said that Shakespeare was very afraid during his lifetime that his tomb would be dug up by others after his death. Therefore, he firmly refused to be buried in Westminster Abbey after his death, and also personally wrote such an epitaph, engraved on his tombstone:

"Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear,
To dig the dust enclosed here.
Blessed be the man that spares these stones,
And cursed be he that moves my bones."

Don't underestimate the power of this short inscription. Legend has it that later, those who wanted to take a look at Shakespeare's remains were all frightened by it.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 339

— Ye Jingfeng

"One." Mr. W shook his head; "That's only referring to the Nankou side… The central government received our report from this side,… and of course, there were other on-the-spot investigation reports, like Mr. Dai personally going to the Northeast some time ago, and so on… The central government got this information, so it urgently instructed Jin Yan to transfer generals to defend Nankou… Nankou is the throat of the northwest, if you block it, you can stabilize half of the country; if you attack, you can shake the main force of the Japanese invaders going south. It's a most important location…"

"But the central government's instruction to defend Nankou, although it was extremely urgent, was received by Jin Yan; because this tiger's den area had already been assigned to Jin Yan's responsibility. The instruction was delayed a bit in Yan's hands, considering personnel selection, and so on." By the time Tang Enbo received this instruction, it was already half past midnight on July 30th. Fortunately, Tang's troops moved quickly, and within a few hours, they rushed to Nankou between midnight on the 31st and after 0:00 on August 1st, and arranged the defensive line to seize and block; Tang's main army also rushed from Suidong and set up the headquarters in Huailai…"

"On the same day, almost at the same time, the Japanese army decided to launch a major offensive in Pingjin and Pinghan before August 5th, as a response to the 'August Secret'; on the one hand, Itagaki still transferred troops to follow the original plan and take the PingSui line to meet the Japanese army advancing south from Zhangbei. Who knew that just as he reached Changping, our army had already taken the lead in Nankou's strategic location and made almost all of the necessary arrangements. When I say 'five parts fortune, five parts luck,' that's what I'm referring to… Think about such an important place, if the Japanese army had arrived first…"

"The Juyongguan Nankou area is one of the nine major fortresses in our country. Considering how serious the situation is in the Pingjin area, even if the central government didn't receive intelligence, shouldn't they have paid attention?…" I interjected, asking Mr. W.

"Of course there were defense forces, but they were pitifully small." When Mr. W said this, he couldn't help but shake his head and sigh: "………In short, it's a personnel problem!………" Mr. W was silent for a while, as if he was trying to suppress his impulsive emotions; then he suddenly woke up from his absent-minded state and turned around: "………Let's discuss how to cross Nankou." He pointed to the military map spread out on the table, showing it to me:

"Assuming you get to Changping, that's the end point of the '15th' method of action. Going further west, of course, is the front line of the two armies, and all means of transportation, except horses, are probably impassable. You have to walk or ride a horse… But look—" Mr. W pointed to the map: "Nankou's terrain faces southeast and sits on the northwest; the Juyongguan and the Great Wall act as a screen in the back. The western side of Nankou, starting from Shuanglingkou, is all continuous mountains and high ridges, and the eastern side, starting from Ma'anshan, is also layer upon layer of high peaks, stretching for dozens of miles; so only this narrow passage in the front can be used for transportation…"

"I understand." I knew what Mr. W meant. At this time, if I wanted to go to Zhangbei along the PingSui Road to search for those little tigers, I could only go as far as Changping at most. Since Nankou was already defended, ordinary people were naturally cut off from going back and forth, and they couldn't fly over even with wings; unless they took a risk and passed through the "no man's land" and safely found our army's outposts, they would advance using the method that Mr. W was about to arrange for me. But in this "no man's land," the outposts of both armies could shoot at any time; it would be difficult to pass safely. Mr. W had already seen this point.

"Listen!" Mr. W didn't let me interrupt him: "………The front line of Nankou probably directly reaches the gate of the fortress called Pingzhang, a high ground called Longhukou, or Longhutai. It's still about three to five miles from Changping to here. I have no information here about the situation on this three-to-five-mile stretch of road, so I can't guess. This………"

### "A Century of Planning"

— Shi Lang

Because of the unrest in all aspects, it directly affects the academic and educational circles, making them deeply infected with a state of disturbance and unease in both work and life.

The other day, we saw celebrations from all sides for a university professor who had been teaching for 25 years, which is worthy of celebration; but it may not be easy to ask an elementary school teacher to persevere for 25 years under the current living conditions.

We are not discouraged for the education community. We believe that professors and teachers in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools should be given an environment and state of mind that allows them to teach with peace of mind. That means not disturbing these physically and mentally exhausted educators with anxious emotions.

There is an old Chinese saying, called "a century to cultivate people," which means that it is not a matter of one day or one night to get a good education; and the responsibility of this "century to cultivate people" falls on the shoulders of educators.

Therefore, when we see the City Elementary School Principals Association petitioning the Education Bureau, and the University Professors Association making demands to the Ministry of Education, all of them repeatedly asking to guarantee their positions and issue appointment letters quickly, so that they can work with peace of mind, this voice sounds so sad and heartbreaking now!

Education is "a plan for a century," we must ensure that it is not affected by any fluctuations or interference, so that education specialists can teach and research at the same time, so that the desolate and barren education garden can thrive from now on, that will be the gospel of the Chinese nation.

### Diplomacy in the Early Southern Song Dynasty

— Ji Ming

Reports state that Supervisor So-and-so and others have filed an impeachment against Wang Shijie for his weak diplomacy towards the Soviet Union, and it has been approved by the President of the Yuan for investigation and establishment. Wang's personal merits and demerits to the country are set aside for the moment, but in short, a diplomat is restricted internally by national policies and responds externally to international changes. His every word and action may not all come from his own heart, and even if they do, they may not be beneficial to the overall situation. The evolution of diplomacy to this day is no longer the era of "Zichan having eloquent words, which the country relied on." In that case, the strength or weakness of the attitude towards the Soviet Union, the central government has already decided in advance, and the Soviet Union has used this as an excuse afterward. Wang's personal actions are merely to implement it in a roundabout way. What merits or demerits are there?

Recently, reading the History of the Song Dynasty, I feel that the diplomacy in the early Southern Song Dynasty is similar to that of today. I will briefly compare them below to accord with the purpose of learning from the past to know the future.

The so-called "early Southern Song Dynasty" here refers to the four generations of Emperor Gaozong, Xiaozong, Guangzong, and Ningzong. Its diplomatic object is not as complex as it is today. Liao had already fallen, and Yuan had not yet risen. Those who talked about peace or war only referred to the Jin people in the north.

Initially, Prince Kang Gou crossed south and ascended the throne in Jiankang, appointing Li Gang as the Prime Minister and Zong Ze defending Bian. At that time, there was quite a desire to restore the Central Plains. When Huang Qianshan and Wang Boyan were in power, the emperor was confused by them, so he went south to Lin'an to avoid the Jin's attacks. However, the two countries were in a state of war, and the relationship between the two sides was not yet determined. Earlier, when Bianjing was in crisis, Emperor Qinzong, for the sake of temporary peace, signed a treaty with Jin, with the Jin ruler and the Song subject, paying a certain amount of silver and silk each year, called tribute. When Emperor Gaozong ascended the throne, Jin again demanded tribute. At first, Emperor Gaozong was forced by public opinion to reluctantly discuss war, but later he appointed Qin Hui to vigorously advocate peace. It is known that before Shaoxing, Song and Jin were enemy countries, but after the peace treaty was signed, the relationship changed to that of ruler and subject. The history records that Wang Lun led the Jin envoys back in the name of notifying Jiangnan, saying that if Song yielded, the Empress Dowager could be restored, the coffin could be returned, Emperor Huizong could return, and the Central Plains could be obtained. Prime Minister Qin Hui and Sun Jin and others all agreed with peace. All those who opposed the peace talks were first to kill Yue Fei and Zhang Jun, and then to dismiss Zhao Ding and demote Hu Quan. For a time, public opinion was unified, as if there was no diplomacy to follow other than showing peace.

Emperor Xiaozong resolutely took it upon himself to restore the country, appointing Yu Yunwen and Liu Qi as Prime Ministers, and allied with Jin. However, he was defeated by Mian. At that time, the Jin ruler Shizong was known as a wise ruler, so there was no opportunity for either side to take advantage of. As a result, the soldiers were withdrawn and peace was negotiated. Song was the nephew, and Jin was the uncle, abolishing the etiquette of the ruler and subject, and meeting as allied countries. Contemporary discussions praised it as the restoration. Emperor Guangzong succeeded to the throne, and there was no war, the same as Emperor Xiaozong.

During the reign of Emperor Ningzong, the hardliners were revived. Han Tuozhou was the Prime Minister, ambitious and eager to show off his military power. Therefore, he requested to posthumously confer Yue Fei, decreed the demotion of Qin Hui, and strongly criticized the loss of the peace treaty. In the early years of Emperor Ningzong, there was an army to attack Jin. Tuozhou himself was the Grand Master, the Prince of Pingyuan, and the Pacifier of Military and National Affairs. For a time, patriotic men of lofty ideals, such as Xin Qiji and others, all advocated supporting him. Unfortunately, Tuozhou was ambitious but lacked talent, unlearned and unskilled, resulting in the army failing to achieve any results and suffering a terrible defeat. The Song people cut off Tuozhou's head and sent it to the Jin army, agreeing to the etiquette of uncle and nephew. As a result, the Song's military strength weakened, and Jin was also exhausted, laying the groundwork for the Yuan people to establish their country in the future.

In general, the diplomatic policies of the above four dynasties were not desirable. War was fruitless, and peace was humiliating. In particular, Emperor Gaozong's bowing down and acknowledging himself as a subject was even more egregious. In the early Southern Song Dynasty, there was too much impetuosity. When they were strong, they rubbed their fists and palms, and when they were weak, they crawled and showed pity. They did not ask about the country's major plans or the right track of diplomacy. Only Emperor Xiaozong's "seeking peace through war" was a relatively stable strategy. Unfortunately, he did not meet the right time, and it was a pity that he could not achieve his ambition.

Today's diplomatic situation is more complex than that of the Southern Song Dynasty. Those who steer the wheel of diplomacy are not able to hide things among one or two senior officials, and being between two great powers often gives them a sense of serving both Qi and Chu. A wrong step can easily lead to unpredictable disasters. So what should we do? I believe that foreign affairs should be foreign affairs, and domestic affairs should be domestic affairs. The two do not necessarily have to affect each other. In extraordinary times, measures should also be extraordinary.

### The Protest of the Sikh People

— Rong Guan

Goujian suffered a defeat. In order to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, he did not hesitate to use the dignity of the monarch to flatter the King of Wu in a servile manner. On the one hand, he slept on brushwood and tasted gall, and on the other hand, he spent ten years accumulating resources and ten years teaching. As a result, he avenged his humiliation and set an example for future generations of disaster-stricken and prosperous countries.

Today, other ethnic groups have also learned lessons from history and understand this secret. For example, in the struggle for independence in India, a part of the ethnic groups strongly advocated separation, but the vast majority were painfully awaiting the arrival of this split. Just as this division between India and Pakistan is becoming more and more realized, the telegraph has sent out a message that is almost as moving and praiseworthy as sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall:

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd] Indian Sikhs and Indian religious congressmen went on strike on the 3rd to protest the partition. The Sikh people seem to be even more unhappy, because they are almost equally divided between the two countries. Their leaders instructed them to commemorate this day of opposition to the partition in the traditional way, so they ordered everyone not to light lamps, not to sleep on beds, not to use metal utensils, and not to eat on tables. They also put straw on the bed, or put leaves under the dishes, with the intention of not forgetting the pain of the country's division.

Among the arts, the pain of division is most clearly understood by the Polish people. Poland suffered three divisions and two national disasters. Who would not sigh and sigh for its misfortune! However, the Sikh people can foresee the pain of division before it happens, endure hardships, and seek ways to avoid or protest it. As long as they persevere to the end, like Poland, they will still not lose the day of their completion.

### The Origin of the Names of the Twelve Months

— Xifeng

After you know the origin of the names of the seven days of the week, you must also want to know the origin of the names of the twelve months. Now let me give you a simple introduction:

January: is the month of the god Janus. He has two heads, one looking forward and the other looking backward. He is a god of "beginning and ending". January is the beginning of the new year and the end of the old year. All things of the past are as dead as yesterday, and all things of the future are as born as today; the old will be annihilated from now on, and the new will sprout from now on. It is most appropriate to name the beginning of the year with Janus. Janus's job in heaven is to be a gatekeeper, so people also hired him to be the "god of the door".

February: comes from Februa. This is a festival held by the Romans in this month. This "purification festival" is specially set up to worship the god Lupercus. February was originally the last month. It was not until 450 BC that it was changed to the second month. Later, it was changed again, but now it has been restored, but February is still an unstable month, with 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year, with an extra day every four years.

March: is the month of the god of war Mars. He often holds a "terror", "spear", and a shield in one hand. Whenever the ancient Romans went out on an expedition, they would always flatter the gods and predict good or bad luck in front of the gods. The master would carefully offer a small bird imprisoned in a cage, and then test it with a ear of new grain in front of the bird. If the grain was pecked at, it was considered that the battle would be won, and they would immediately swear an oath and set off; otherwise, they would lower the flag and stop the drums. Mars was also worshipped as the "god of all things". The ancient Roman men and women almost made all their decisions based on him, taking his will as their will.

April: is an elegant, intelligent, gentle and kind angel. She followed Mars's bloody, foul-smelling trail, spreading the seeds of joyful peace. The grass revealed its head, and tears of joy blurred its eyes, and the flower buds smiled shyly. The earth was filled with joy, and all things were breeding and growing. April originally meant Opener. In fact, April is indeed the "month of expansion".

May: is the month of the goddess Maia. She is one of the seven daughters of the Hercules Atlas, who carries the earth on his shoulders. She is also the mother of the "god of commerce" Mercury. The Roman god of the gods formed her seven sisters into a Pleiades constellation. She is the dimmest of the seven stars, because she worked hard for her husband Xifu being punished by the gods to carry huge stones, going up and down the mountains all day long, so that she looked depressed and unhappy.

June: is the month to worship the goddess Juno, and some say it is to commemorate the Roman family Junius. The former is Cupid's lovely wife, often swimming in the heavenly palace on a chariot pulled by peacocks. The latter is a beautiful and jealous young lady.

July: Mentioning the name of Julius Caesar is almost universally known. He is not only a brave and good hero, but also a learned and versatile genius. He changed the law, abolished the old calendar, and changed the old calendar, which took March as the beginning of the year and was the fifth month of the year, to July, and named it after his own name. This is because he was born in this month.

August: Augustus's original name was Augustus, the nephew of Caesar. He and Antony and Lepidus dominated Rome. Later, he became emperor and changed his name to Augustus, which means "dignity". August was the month when he made the most achievements. He ended the war and laid the foundation for peace. The Roman golden age also began at this point, writing a splendid page in history. The Romans named August after him to commemorate his great achievements. And in order to avoid jealousy, he specially moved a day from September to August, so that it had 31 days like Caesar's July.

The Romans felt that after Augustus, there were no more great men to name the remaining months. Therefore, the names of the months after August were all the same as before. Because only March was the beginning of the year in the old calendar, September, October, November, and December originally meant the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth months, but now they are expressed as September, October, November, and December according to the new calendar.

### American Miscellany

— Xu Ziyuan

A Night at Lisa's Painting Studio

At the Xiaoshidun Writers Association, I met many writers, poets, and painters. They mentioned a local painter named Liza. Liza had studied painting with famous teachers in France and Italy, and her attainments were quite deep, but after returning to the United States, her work was too sophisticated for the general public, and her art was not sold. Now she has changed her style and focuses on business. She is very busy painting and cannot meet the demand. I am very willing to meet this artist. We made an appointment for a day and accompanied the colleagues of the Writers Association to drive to her residence. It was a one-story house with a living room, dining room, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom. The layout was very exquisite. Liza was in her thirties and looked plain, but her speech was very delicate, like a sixteen-year-old girl. I did not see her painting studio throughout the house. When I asked, I learned that the painting studio was set up in the garage. Liza prepared dinner, and after eating, I asked to see her works. She refused, but I insisted, so she reluctantly took out a huge book to show me. Revealing this was the work of an art traitor. The painting was not hand-painted but printed by woodcut. According to Liza, she took the method from ancient Chinese forest carving, but instead of using wooden boards, she used rubber floor tiles. Her cleverness can be seen. She printed the carved portraits on hand towels and tea towels, and then applied colors and inscribed poems. The names were all enchanting and punning. For example, "I don't mean Private, I mean a little privacy" depicts a nude girl talking on the phone with a private 1st class soldier. Another example is Brigadier-general's hot stuff, which is also very vivid. These handkerchiefs and tea towels are mostly sold to Hollywood and women in entertainment venues. Linen ones start at $18 per dozen, and silk ones start at $24 per dozen. Liza earns a lot of money from selling paintings, with a monthly income of thousands of dollars, and her life is very prosperous, but living alone is inevitably a pity. When I was about to leave, she gave me a handkerchief, which turned out to be Brigadier-general's hot stuff. (Can be translated as the Brigadier General's sweetheart) (Sixteen)

### Chen Juan in "Spring Dream"

### Two Seas

— By American B. Barton, translated by Xu Tianhong

There are two seas in Palestine.

One is fresh water, in which there are fish, and its banks are decorated with lush green, and trees scatter their branches on it, stretching out their dry roots to suck up its healing waters.

Along its shores, children play, just as "He" (Jesus Christ) was there. "He" loved it. When "He" told his parables, "He" could look out over its silvery waters. On a rolling plain not far away, "He" fed five thousand people with two fish and a few loaves of bread.

The Jordan River made this sea with its dazzling waters from the mountains. People built houses near it, and birds built their nests; all living things are happier because it is there.

The Jordan River continues to flow south and flows into another sea.

Here there is no splashing of fish, no dancing leaves, no singing of birds, no laughter of children. Unless there is something urgent to do, travelers are unwilling to walk through here. The air is heavily shrouded over its waters, and neither man nor beast drinks it.

What makes these two adjacent seas so different?

Not the Jordan River—it pours the same good water into them both, nor the soil they lie on; nor the place around them.

The difference is this, the Sea of Galilee accepts the Jordan River but does not keep it. One drop flows in, and another flows out.

The other sea is more cunning, jealously hoarding what it takes in.

It cannot be induced to an impulse of generosity. Every drop it gets, it keeps.

The Sea of Galilee gives, so it lives. The other one gives nothing. It is called the Dead Sea.

There are two seas in Palestine.

There are two kinds of people in the world.

### Zhao Songxue and His Wife

— Ji Ming

Zhao Mengfu, whose style name was Ziyang and sobriquet was Songxue Daoren, was a native of Huzhou. He was originally a member of the Song imperial family, surrendered to the Yuan, and served as a Hanlin Academician. Therefore, he was also called Zhao Chengzhi. His calligraphy followed Chu and Mi, especially his running script and regular script. The "Zhao Post" that people copy today is Mengfu's masterpiece. Although this man was a cultural traitor, he was romantic and unrestrained throughout his life, and he was good at poetry and lyrics, and can be called a great master of the Yuan Dynasty. He married Guan Zhongji, known as Madam Guan, who painted ink bamboo, orchids, and plums with a clear and elegant brush. Her calligraphy in running script and regular script was almost indistinguishable from Songxue's. After Madam Wei, there were no such people in the world. According to the Yuan History, there are many interesting things about the relationship between Songxue and his wife. At first, the two were extremely affectionate, but later, when Zhongji's beauty faded, Songxue had the intention of taking a concubine, so he tried to test her with a ci poem, saying: "I am an academician, and you are a wife. Have you not heard that Academician Wang has Taoye and Taogen, and Academician Su has Chaoyun and Muyun? It is not too much for me to marry a few more Yue girls and Wu girls. You are over forty years old, and you only occupy Yutangchun!" Zhongji, upon receiving the poem, also replied with a humorous poem, saying: "You me, me you, we are so affectionate, the affection is as hot as fire. We take a piece of mud and look at you, we knead you and me into being. If we break the two of us at the same time, and we mix the water until harmony, we reshape you, we knead you and me, you in my mud, me in your mud, we live together in the same quilt, die in the same ." Songxue was moved by her deep affection and gave up the idea of taking a concubine. In the past, Wenjun eloped with Xiangru. In his later years, Xiangru also wanted to marry again. Wenjun wrote "White Head Yin" to indicate her intentions. It can be seen that "infatuated women, unfaithful men" are the same throughout the ages. Although I am not a woman, I have always complained for the women's circle.
