### Meritorious Military Service in the Siping Campaign Will Be Investigated and Rewarded by the National Government; Bamiancheng and Guojadian Recovered Successively

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Government issued an order on July 2nd: The purpose of our country's eight-year war of resistance was to defend our territory, recover the Northeast, and maintain the integrity of our sovereignty and territory. Unexpectedly, since the victory, the communist bandits Zhu Mao and others have betrayed the country and poisoned the people, deliberately obstructing our national army from taking over the Northeast territory and sovereignty, and repeatedly harassed and disturbed us. In recent days, they have launched large-scale offensives in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Near Siping, they concentrated ten times the defending army's strength to continuously attack, and their offensive was particularly fierce. Our defending army, the 71st Corps under the command of Army Commander Chen Mingren, united with the local officials and people, fought bravely, disregarding their own lives, and defended heroically. After eighteen days and nights of bloody battle, they advanced wave after wave, repeatedly thwarting the stubborn offensive. Our two-way reinforcement armies advanced in successive battles, attacking from both inside and outside, and finally eliminated the ferocious enemy on the morning of June 30, lifting the heavy siege. The violence was quelled, and the rebellious plot was thwarted. The important town of the Northeast stood tall and upright. The great righteousness of the nation and the country has since been as clear as the sun and stars. The meritorious deeds of suppressing the rebellion and pacifying the insurgents will soon be accomplished with ease. Without generous rewards, how can we encourage loyalty and merit? It is ordered that the Northeast Headquarters quickly issue commendations to all the officers, soldiers, officials, and people who participated in the defense and rescue of Siping. At the same time, investigate and verify the facts of their meritorious deeds, and report them separately for awards and commendations. The military and civilians who died should be given preferential treatment and pensions to show our condolences and to encourage others. This order.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] Li Bailin, Deputy Commander of the 5th Regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Detachment of the National Army, bravely advanced in the sweeping battle of Changnan, capturing many enemies. Commander Du recently issued a hand-written commendation and recorded a major merit.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Capital Comforting Committee for the National Army believes that the National Army's relief of Siping has had a significant impact on the entire Northeast war situation. In addition to submitting a donation of 100 million yuan to the central government for distribution, it also sent a telegram of condolence.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 2nd] The northern troops of the National Army's right-wing force yesterday recovered Bamiancheng on the Pingqi Railway line. The communist army suffered extremely heavy casualties. It is reported that their First and Second Columns were protecting those retreating from Bamiancheng. The left-wing troops of the National Army yesterday recovered Banlashanmen, southeast of Siping. The fighting on the Pingmei Railway line was fierce. In addition, the air force took advantage of the bright moonlight one day and night to conduct a raid. Communist army vehicles were found on the road near Bamiancheng. One bomb was dropped, hitting the target directly. The sound of the explosion suddenly rose, and the bright moonlight was almost obscured by thick smoke.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 2nd] The center of gravity of the battle on the north bank of the Liao River is near Yitong. The National Army's pincer attack will achieve great results. It seems difficult for the remaining communists in that area to escape their fate of defeat. In addition, 5,000 to 6,000 communist troops who fled west of Taojiatun and Daheilinzi in Changnan, retreated to Huaide with injuries. The National Army is currently advancing towards Huaide.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] Military News: (1) The National Army's southward corps recovered Guojadian, 50 li south of Gongzhuling, at 3:00 p.m. on the 1st. The vanguard troops also crossed Ershijiazi, sweeping away the communist troops who had fled near Heshu. Another unit is pressing towards Yitong County. (2) The National Army's powerful corps is now clearing the remaining communist troops along the Huaide-Dayushu highway.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd] After the communist army's disastrous defeat on the outskirts of Siping Street, the main force has fled in the direction of Liaoyuan and Xi'an. The remaining troops are preventing the National Army from pursuing in the northeast of Kaiyuan in order to cover the escape of their main force. A certain powerful unit of the National Army has joined forces with the communist army there, and fierce fighting has been going on for a day and a night. A major annihilation battle should take place there within days.

### Chen Mingren Reports to Reporters on the Defense of the City

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd] General Chen Mingren reported to a group of Chinese and foreign reporters on the 2nd about the defense of Siping, which lasted for one hour. He briefly stated: Siping has been under heavy attack by the communist army since May 21st, and fierce fighting immediately broke out in the southeastern highlands. Our army calmly held firm, and the communist army repeatedly failed in its attacks. It then attacked south along the Middle East Railway line. On June 11th, the communist army once again spied on Siping, concentrating the strength of twelve divisions, four brigades, and one artillery division to launch a fierce attack on our airfield area. On the evening of the 14th, the communist army concentrated artillery fire to bombard the urban area and surrounding positions, firing more than 20,000 shells. At night, they broke into the urban area from the southwest corner, spreading rapidly. Our defending army launched fierce street battles with them. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. The communist army even formed a human shield with corpses. Their brutal behavior was appalling. On the night of the 15th, the communist army attempted to open a second gap in the southwest corner. Our army bravely fought back, and the communist bandits retreated after leaving behind more than a thousand corpses. From the 21st, the communist army again broke into the east of the road, rushing forward at any cost, attempting to resolve the Siping battle before our reinforcements arrived. Our army firmly defended the strongholds, resisting resolutely. Every wall and every house was a must-contested place. On the 24th, the Zhongxing Grain Depot and Alcohol Factory east of the road were successively lost. On the 28th, the communist army reinforced the 18th Division and launched a fierce attack throughout the night, but ultimately failed. On the 29th, the communist army knew that reinforcements were about to arrive and that the situation was dire, but they still attempted to make a final stand. We counterattacked with all our strength, and the communist army suffered heavy casualties and retreated westward. Our army then launched an attack at dawn on the 30th, clearing the remaining enemies and recovering the streets west of the road and the airfield. General Chen stated: In this battle, the communist army fired a total of 100,000 shells and suffered a total of more than 50,000 casualties. More than 2,000 prisoners were captured, including Japanese and Korean people. There were more than 1,000 light machine guns, more than 100 heavy machine guns, and countless other ammunition and weapons.

[Central News Agency, Bamiancheng, 2nd] As a result of the relief of Siping, first, Shenyang, Changchun, and Yongji were all relieved of the siege and stood in a proactive position, extending their iron fists to hammer the fleeing remnants of the enemy. Second, the Shenchang and Changji railway lines were restored. The National Army went east to capture the escaping communists, and Meihekou was in sight. The Northeast war situation, due to the victory in Siping, has generally returned to the situation before May 10th.

### The Great Disaster of Siping Street; It Will Take Fifty Years to Restore to Its Original State

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 2nd] This reporter stayed in Siping for two days and saw General Chen Mingren leading the remaining cadres and soldiers to repair the fortifications to prevent the communist army from coming again. When I left Siping to return to Shenyang at noon on the 2nd, I could still smell the burnt odor in the high sky. The painful impression never left my mind. The following is a miscellaneous record of my observations on this trip.

(1) Siping after the disaster is still shrouded in black smoke. Soybeans are burning, and the fire is raging. The sound of hand grenades and gunfire rises and falls. After the war stopped, the military and civilians cleared the battlefield, but the dead bodies could not be buried quickly enough.

(2) The stench of rotting corpses and the mixed odor of soybean oil smoke made people sick. The streets are burning, and it is impossible to move the corpses. The Shenyang sanitation team has arrived and is preparing to start disinfection and epidemic prevention work.

(3) The people who spent more than ten days of hardship in the cellars of their homes have just calmed their shocked souls. The military and political authorities opened up the soybean burning area on the 2nd, allowing people to move and take away the unburned soybeans near the fire. Men, women, old, and children competed to load and eat them in the smoke and gunfire.

(4) Most of the people in the suburbs fled and returned, supporting the old and carrying the young. The situation was extremely difficult. After returning, most of them placed their belongings among the tiles, preparing to live on. Currently, Siping is completely destroyed except for the northeast corner of the line east area.

(5) Chairman Liu Handong said: Ten counties and three banners in Liaobei Province have suffered this catastrophe. They have been successively recovered, and the need for relief is urgent. The Northeast Headquarters allocated 30 million yuan in circulating notes for emergency relief to Siping on the 2nd, so that the returning people could have food and shelter.

(6) About 100,000 tons of soybeans and sorghum were piled up beside the Middle East Railway. Only 30% to 40% were not burned. Mr. Liu concluded with a heavy tone: This great disaster in Siping will take fifty years to restore Siping to its original state.

### Shandong Province Enters Decisive Battle Stage

Qingdao National Army Coordinates Attack

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 2nd] Shandong Province has entered the stage of full-scale decisive battle. The National Army has launched a general offensive, leaving the communist army with no way to escape. Wang Yaowu's troops along the Jiaoji Railway launched a full-scale attack on the 2nd to coordinate with the great battle in the Yimeng Mountain area. (1) The Qingdao National Army launched attacks in the north and west directions on the 2nd, recovering Dongshengjizhuang, northeast of Lingshan and Lancun. (2) The National Army of Chu County recovered Muhushan and Nigushan on the morning of the 2nd, only eight kilometers east of Linyi. (3) The National Army dispatched from Jinan continued to advance in separate routes near Shaoyangguan, east of Zhangqiu and Pujiji.

[Our Newspaper, Linyi, 2nd] The bloody battle in the Yishan area is in full swing. Donglidian has become a tug-of-war situation. The bloody battle in Yue Village is also fierce. The communist army that sneaked southwest of Yishui and southeast of Mengyin, attempting to encircle the rear of the National Army, has been surrounded by the National Army and will not be difficult to annihilate in the Tianma Mountain area.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 2nd] The main force of the communist army in the Yimeng Mountain area has been dismembered by the National Army and trapped in three encirclements, which can be annihilated.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 2nd] Guo Chan, Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Operations, arrived in Xuzhou from Nanjing on the morning of the 1st and will inspect central Shandong within days.

### Sun Lianzhong Goes to the Front Line

Communist Army Retreats West in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Sun Yunzhong, Director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, accompanied by Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Headquarters, and Zhang Han, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Government, took an armored train to Zhuoxian in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway on the afternoon of the 2nd to inspect the front line.

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 2nd] In the battle situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, the National Army has adopted an active offensive, and the main force of the communist army has gradually moved westward. Officials said: The corps advancing south along the Pingbao Road confirmed that it had attacked Guchengzhen last night. Two communist countries were surrounded and annihilated, and they collapsed and withdrew in separate routes.

### Communist Cadre Wang Minqiang Surrenders in Tianjin After Arriving from Cang County

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] On July 1st, Wang Minqiang, a communist cadre from Cang County, surrendered to the local police station. Before he set off for Tianjin, he was forced by the communist army to kill his grandmother to show his loyalty. When he surrendered, he stated that when the communist army attacked Cang County, he was the commander of the Xiaonanmen in the county. Because he could not bear to see his hometown elders die in the artillery fire, he did not actively fight and was once detained. Recently, he was sent to Tianjin to organize people's welfare societies to engage in intelligence work. When he was forced to personally kill his grandmother, it was on the eve of his departure to Tianjin. After arriving in Tianjin, in view of the communist army's brutality, he voluntarily surrendered to atone for his previous sins.

### The Economic Commission's Plenary Review Meeting Discusses Economic Reform Plans; The Sixth Meeting Is Postponed and Will Continue the Review Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Economic Commission held a plenary review meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 2nd to review the "Economic Reform Plan" proposed by President Zhang. It lasted for four hours, and there was heated debate on the points of developing human resources, increasing production, increasing materials, and stabilizing prices. The review meeting will be reopened on the 3rd. The 6th meeting of the Economic Commission, originally scheduled to be held on the 3rd, will be postponed.

The review meeting on the 2nd was chaired by Xu Kan. When discussing agricultural loans, industrial loans, and export loans, there was intense debate. According to the original proposal, these types of loans should be based on the principles of large amounts and universality, with the aim of promoting rice. Wheat. Cotton. Bean and flour. Gauze. Oil · Sugar · Fuel and other production, and use a part of the discussion results to make corrections. Currently, it is not within the national financial capacity to talk about large-scale universal loans, and there is a risk of causing inflation. When Chen Lifu explained, he believed that this type of loan would not cause inflation, because the loan would be enough to increase production, and in the future, the repayment would be made in kind. This is an important point in the plan, so it is appropriate to maintain the original plan. Other committee members believed that this method had the following drawbacks: (1) Before production increases, malicious inflation occurs first; (2) Cunning merchants use loans to engage in other speculations; (3) They deliberately delay repayment or pay with inferior products.

Restrictions on Industrial and Agricultural Loans

As a result of the debate, future loans will be based on the principles of conditional, partial, and restricted. During the meeting, when discussing the government's plan to supply and distribute daily necessities to officers, soldiers, public educators, and workers in production factories first, Chen Lifu explained that there would be no difficulty in supply. Other committee members believed that there might not be enough time, so the result was corrected. It was decided to first supply cities with higher prices and more civil servants. Regarding the issue of stabilizing the value of the currency, according to the original plan, there were three measures: (1) Quickly dispose of enterprises that do not need to be operated by the state, sell enemy and puppet industries and surplus materials, and reorganize tax revenue to make up for the financial deficit in the short term and prevent inflation. (2) The government should be fully prepared and choose an appropriate time to reorganize the currency system so that it can gradually return to normal. (3) The currency systems of the three places of Northeast, Taiwan, and Xinjiang must be reorganized at the same time to make them consistent. There was discussion about this during the meeting. Then, the reform of the financial system was discussed. According to the original plan, the reform of the financial system must pay special attention to serving the national economic policy and increasing agricultural and industrial production as the main purpose. Financial institutions should each have their own main specialized business, and it was decided to use the county as the grassroots institution of the financial system to support the establishment of county banks to facilitate construction and cooperate with the promotion of local autonomy. The county bank should be based on the principle of one bank per county. After Chen Lifu explained, Pan Xulun and others objected, believing that if the plan was followed, there would be more than 2,000 county banks, which would be too many. Three amendments were proposed at the meeting: (1) The Agricultural Bank and the Cooperative Treasury should establish branches in necessary locations. (2) The provincial bank should establish branches in important areas. (3) After the county bank is established, the provincial bank will be cancelled. None of these three opinions were passed at the meeting. The meeting did not adjourn until 7:30 p.m. The review meeting will be reopened on the 3rd to continue the discussion. Also, some committee members at the review meeting on the 2nd believed that the economic reform plan included too much and involved too much. It is better to select urgent and easy-to-implement ones and organize them first.

### The Central Political Committee Discusses Military and Diplomatic Affairs; Comforts Various Units in Siping; The Xinjiang Incident Prompts a Second Protest

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The Central Political Committee held its seventh meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 2nd. Dai Chuanxian attended the meeting. Chen Cheng and Wang Shijie made military and diplomatic reports. After listening to the reports, the committee members immediately decided (1) that the troops under the command of Army Commander Chen Mingren, who firmly defended Siping, and the various troops that reinforced and joined forces to relieve the siege, disregarded their own lives and fought bravely, which was worthy of commendation, and it was decided to send a telegram of condolence. (2) Regarding the Beitashan incident, the Soviet reply did not match the facts, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should file a second protest, stating that Beitashan is our country's territory. Chen Cheng's military report focused on the battle of Siping. He said that the victory in Siping had improved the military situation in the Northeast and greatly boosted morale. However, because the communist army had looted the food from the surrounding counties, and our military and political cooperation was not close enough, there were difficulties in terms of supplies. In terms of the overall situation of suppressing the communists militarily, the focus besides the war in the Northeast is on Shandong. If a decisive victory is won in central Shandong, the overall situation will improve. Wang Shijie's diplomatic report analyzed the international situation in detail, especially focusing on the United States' decision on foreign policy. Because the United States is conducting a survey of domestic resources for the purpose of assisting Europe and relieving East Asia, it seemed to focus on Europe in the past, but judging from the recent lifting of the arms embargo, it seems that it has also focused on East Asia. We hope that the United States can have a clear plan and expression before the foreign ministers' meeting in August. Regarding the Xinjiang incident, Wang also continued to report. The reports submitted by the three small groups of the Central Political Committee, namely internal affairs, diplomacy, and military affairs, were submitted for discussion at the same time. The report stated that Xinjiang geography and Beitashan belong to Xinjiang. During Sheng Shicai's rule in Xinjiang, a gold mining bureau was established in the Ashan area. The bureau hired Soviet advisors. If Beitashan was not under the jurisdiction of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang Province would not be able to establish a bureau in the area to mine gold. This is very clear. At the meeting, it was decided to submit a second protest and hand it over to the relevant authorities for implementation.

Responsible Parties Should Be Responsible for the Smooth Transportation of Materials in the Northeast

Regarding the issue of Northeast resources, the committee members questioned the Northeast Economic Commission a lot. They all believed that the Northeast has abundant resources of coal and soybean production. In the past, the Soviet army and the communist army smuggled exports and extracted foreign exchange, but we felt it was difficult to transport them out. It is a pity that abundant products were abandoned on the ground. The responsible parties should be ordered to investigate the responsibility and transport them as smoothly as possible. The meeting also passed two personnel transfer cases: (1) Weng Jingtang was internally appointed as the chairman of the Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee; (2) Zheng Zhenyu, the political deputy of the Ministry of Land Affairs, was approved to resign, and Tang Huisun, the current administrative deputy, was internally appointed to fill the position. Zhu Ding was the candidate for the administrative deputy. The above personnel transfers will be submitted to the State Council for discussion. As for the issue of the number of legislators from professional groups, it was brought up again on the 2nd. Most of the committee members advocated restoring the number of 112 that was passed before the State Council meeting. The previous resolution of the Legislative Yuan was 84. This is only a suggestion, and the decision-making power still lies with the State Council. It should be submitted to the State Council and request that the original proposal be maintained and passed according to 112.

### The Soviet Union Has Notified Our Government That It Will Send Overseas Chinese Back to Their Country

Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Answers Reporters' Questions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] At the press conference of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan on the 2nd, when asked how the Chinese government viewed the importance of the Soviet Union's decision to repatriate 3,000 households of overseas Chinese living in major cities in China, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that some time ago, the Soviet government repatriated a batch of Russian overseas Chinese from the Northeast, and everyone must remember this matter. This time, the Soviet government intends to transport back another batch, including about 150 orphans. The Soviet government has notified our government of this intention, and our government will provide the necessary convenience to Russian overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to the Soviet Union.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 2nd] Tianjin Soviet Deputy Consul Du Ruofeiyefu declared that the Tianjin Soviet Consulate had transferred orders from the Nanjing Embassy regarding the repatriation of Soviet overseas Chinese in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai.

### Some White Russians in Beiping Are Willing to Naturalize in Our Country

It is understood that there are more than 1,000 White Russians in Beiping, most of whom work for others or do business. Only some of them have obtained Soviet nationality, while the rest insist on White Russian integrity, do not join Soviet nationality, and maintain their stateless status. Some even request to naturalize in China in order to avoid joining Soviet nationality.

### The General Order to Arrest Mao Zedong Is Purely of a Judicial Nature; Interview with the Prosecutor-General of the Supreme Court

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] After the Supreme Court Procuratorate issued an order to all courts to arrest Mao Zedong, people across the country attached great importance to it. This reporter recently visited Zheng Lie, the Prosecutor-General of the court, to inquire whether the motive for arresting Mao Zedong this time was only as stated in the order, or whether it had a political nature. He replied: "This move is purely of a judicial nature, because the Criminal Law has a special chapter on the crime of internal disorder. Mao Zedong is trying to subvert the government, and his crime of internal disorder is known to everyone. Recently, he has even colluded with Korean communists and used Japanese prisoners to harm the motherland. If he is not arrested, then what is the point of me being the Prosecutor-General of the country? Furthermore, the head of the Gansu High Court has filed a request for investigation, so how can I put it aside and ignore it?" The reporter continued to ask whether other communist personnel would also be arrested. Zheng replied: "Although I am a believer in the Three Principles of the People, in order to respect the freedom of thought of others, I will never interfere with those who believe in communism and operate within the scope of the law. But the so-called Chinese Communist Party today, first, intends to subvert the government, and no country can tolerate this situation. Second, it possesses a large military force to confront the government, which is unprecedented for foreign communist parties. Third, although it is crowned with the two characters of China, its actions have actually wiped out these two characters and "called others father," fearing that China will not perish. If this can be tolerated, then weren't our previous efforts to resist Japan superfluous? However, because there are too many members of the rebellious party, we should make every effort to suppress them. Arresting their leaders is enough to correct the public's view."

### Disregarding the Lives and Property of Tens of Millions: Communist Army Obstructs Yellow River Repair and Defense, Lu Re-Embankment Employees Withdraw, Situation Critical

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 2nd] The actions of the Chinese Communists in destroying the Yellow River repair and defense agreement have been confirmed by the authorities here. According to reports received by the Ministry of Water Resources, Liu Bocheng's Communist troops crossed the river stealthily on the night of June 30th, numbering over 20,000. By the afternoon of the 30th, Communist troops north of the Yellow River below Huangkou had generally crossed the river, a critical situation. The work sections east of Linpu Township were all seized. The employees of the Lu Repair and Defense Office in Linpu and Caozhou withdrew in batches to Heze on the morning of the 30th. Director Kong of that office led 60 employees, carrying important documents, to Bian. Zhukou and Zhonggudui also cannot proceed with construction. Over a hundred employees are still there, unable to withdraw. On June 29th, Communist troops from Juye and Dongping infiltrated to Xinxian and the northeast of Youcheng, numbering several thousand. All the people's embankments began martial law. Contact with the employees in Zhonggudui and other places has been cut off.

All employees are desperately working at risk. On the morning of July 1st, the Dongzhuang project employees in the Linhuaiji section were attacked by Communist troops and have withdrawn to Caozhou. It is said that Communist troops have reached the side of the highway between Huangkou, Linhuai, and Heze, and traces of Communist troops have been found. Therefore, the Yellow River repair and defense work has been completely obstructed, and the agreement negotiated in Heze on June 21st has also been torn up. The agreement stipulated that re-embankment employees on both sides should not engage in military or political activities and guaranteed the safety of employees on both sides. Unexpectedly, the Communist army pretended to negotiate on one hand, and on the other hand, secretly sent a large army to cross the river to harass the area. The lives and property of tens of millions of people along the river will inevitably suffer significant losses this year.

[Another Dispatch] Regarding the urgent need for the lower Yellow River re-embankment project, the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) consulted with the government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to cease military actions along the Yellow River. The government has repeatedly expressed its agreement and has begun emergency repairs on the south bank of the Yellow River. However, the CCP disregarded the lives of the people and took the opportunity to cross the river south to commit offenses. According to relevant sources, the government authorities and the UNRRA have not yet received a formal response from the CCP regarding the re-embankment project as of today. It is also learned that after the Communist army committed the offense, the Executive Yuan Relief Committee had not received reports on the safety of the engineering personnel in the re-embankment area as of the 2nd.

[Our Yanzhou Dispatch of the 2nd] The over 10,000 troops of Liu Bocheng's army, who stealthily crossed the Yellow River from western Shandong and destroyed the agreement to cease military actions on both banks, have been blocked by the National Army in the Dongkou Linpuji area and are currently engaged in battle.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 2nd] After Liu Bocheng's Communist troops stealthily crossed the Yellow River from Dongkou on the evening of the 30th, their subsequent troops continued to cross south overnight, reaching 20,000 by noon on the 1st. One force advanced south towards Beiwangzhao, and another advanced east towards Youcheng. The situation in those two places is unclear. All the dike repair workers and civilians have been captured.

### Chen Cheng Responds to Cleveland, Declares Government's Position: If the CCP Truly Ceases Hostilities, the Government Can Issue a Ceasefire Order

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng responded on the 1st to the letter of June 19th from Cleveland, Director of the UNRRA Office in China, regarding the Yellow River re-embankment project, declaring the government's position. If the CCP truly ceases all hostilities in the designated areas and time frame, the government can issue a ceasefire order, and the government will provide definite protection for the personnel, materials, and equipment of the Yellow River dike repair project on both banks. According to Mr. Cleveland's letter to Chief of Staff Chen, in addition to the above point, he also inquired whether the Chinese government believed that the expansion of the recent Kuomintang-Communist war in several locations was not contradictory to the goals of UNRRA's work in China. He also inquired about how to protect the safety of UNRRA personnel traveling to Communist areas or materials and equipment transported to Communist areas, among other issues. Chief of Staff Chen's response also included the following three main points: (1) The Chinese government's military measures are purely to quell the rebellion in order to restore peace to the country as soon as possible and reduce the suffering of the people. UNRRA's work in China aims to relieve the Chinese people after the war and assist the government in handling the aftermath. Although difficulties may be encountered during implementation, they can be overcome through communication and cooperation. The goals of the two sides are very consistent. (2) In order to avoid errors, the National Army hopes to be notified in advance of the dates and locations of material shipments and arrivals, and it is hoped that the Ministry of National Defense will be notified as much as possible one week in advance of the markings on ships, vehicles, and houses, so that they are clear. Liaison should be rapid and accurate, so that difficulties and errors can be avoided. (3) Regarding the order to all troops to do their utmost to protect the safety of UNRRA-related materials and personnel, the government has repeatedly issued orders and will do so again in the future if necessary. Chief of Staff Chen also stated at the end of the letter that regarding General Edgerton's suggestion to establish a five-person committee in Linpuji, it could be established immediately, and two government representatives would be assigned. The committee could set up an office in Zhangqiuji to meet the same needs on the north bank of the Yellow River. Finally, he reiterated his deep concern for concentrating all efforts to expedite the re-embankment project before the Yellow River flood season.

### UNRRA Director Rooks Discusses Relief Work in China

### Over Two Hundred Water Pumps Transported to Jiangsu and Zhejiang for Irrigation

[By Our Correspondent] On the 29th of last month, UNRRA transported 256 water pumps for agricultural irrigation to various locations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Water pumps with diameters of 4 and 12 inches will be used in six counties in Zhejiang Province. Some large water pumps will be used to pump water from small islands in the Yangtze River and flooded farmland around Gaoyou and Baoying. Smaller diameter water pumps will be used to irrigate rice paddies.

All water pumps were transported to various locations along with diesel engines. Each pump is equipped with 20 feet of rubber hose and 40 feet of iron pipe. The 12-inch diameter water pumps use 35-40 horsepower diesel engines and can pump 5,000 gallons of water per minute.

The above water pumps will be sold by the Executive Yuan Relief Committee to farmers or farmers' cooperatives. At the same time, personnel from both the Executive Yuan Relief Committee and UNRRA will jointly provide guidance on how to use and install the machines.

Furthermore, UNRRA plans to transport 9,000 water pumps with diameters ranging from 2 to 12 inches to China in accordance with its plan to revitalize Chinese agriculture, so that they can be used for agricultural irrigation and increase agricultural production.

### Ministry of Agriculture Currently Studying the Rectification of Rural Villages Throughout the Country

Prohibition of Exporting Plough Cattle from Northern Jiangsu

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 2nd] Agriculture Minister Zuo Shunsheng answered reporters' questions on the 2nd. [Question] After the banditry in Northern Jiangsu, the rural villages are desolate. It is said that there is a severe shortage of plough cattle, which is affecting production. Are there any relief measures planned? [Answer]: Due to the bankruptcy of rural villages in Northern Jiangsu, farmers rely on these cattle for their livelihood. Recently, plough cattle have been continuously transported to the Jiangnan region. Most of the cattle slaughtered in Nanjing and Shanghai come from Northern Jiangsu. Furthermore, the Ministry of Agriculture has transferred the case of agricultural loans in Northern Jiangsu for providing loans to relieve farmers, and the prohibition of the export of plough cattle, to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering the counties in the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Area to strictly handle it. [Question] After taking office, has the Minister formulated a comprehensive rectification plan for rural villages throughout the country? [Answer] We are currently actively preparing. The ministry has dispatched 17 specialized personnel to study the rectification plan and discuss the budget. We will gradually start next year. However, the ministry's budget only accounts for 5/1000 of the national budget. We will do our best to use our limited financial resources to accomplish something.

### Recent Situation in Japan: Food Most Urgent, Empress Raises Silkworms and Chickens, Startling Crime Rate Among Officials

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 2nd] Wu Xueyi, our senior advisor to the Far East International Military Tribunal, who recently returned from Tokyo, spoke to reporters about the recent situation in Japan. He said that the most urgent issue facing Japan is the food problem. In early June, specialized schools above the junior college level in Kyoto, Nara, and other places had to take early holidays due to a lack of rice rations. The rationed food only covers two-thirds of the consumption amount, and the remaining one-third must be obtained from the black market or through self-cultivation for supplementation. Therefore, from the prime minister and ministers down to the common people, every household plants food crops and vegetables. The sides of roads and gaps between trees are also utilized. Even the Empress raises silkworms and chickens. Due to insufficient salaries to maintain integrity, the crime rate among officials is increasing daily. From September of the year before last to the end of last year, there were a total of 11,000 officials nationwide. The Japanese are extremely obedient and meticulous in their service to the American military. In the past six months, there has not been a single incident involving the Japanese against the Allied forces. Their goal in "enduring the unendurable" (words from the Japanese Emperor's surrender edict) is solely to hope to restore foreign trade and conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, so that they can return to normal as soon as possible. When asked about the difficulties for Chinese people who want to go to Japan, Wu said: Under military control in Japan, exit and entry both require special permission from MacArthur's headquarters, and food and accommodation are very difficult. Before the peace treaty is concluded, studying abroad is completely out of the question. Letters should also be sent to the Representative Office of the Mission to Japan at 88 Gaoyou Road, Shanghai, and entrusted to American military planes or commercial planes to fly to Japan, which takes about ten days.

### National Highway Network Plan: Divided into Baseline, Meridian, and Latitude Lines, Totaling More Than 57,000 Kilometers

[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Nanjing, 2nd] The National Highway Network Plan, which was passed at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 1st, was originally drafted by the Ministry of Communications with the ultimate goal of consolidating national defense. After review by the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and National Defense, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion. The plan stipulates that all national highways are divided into three types: baseline, meridian, and latitude lines. The baseline consists of four lines from Shanghai to Lhasa, the meridian consists of five lines from Shanhaiguan to Hai'an, and the latitude consists of six lines from Zhennanguan to Xiamen, as well as 23 connecting lines from Wuhu to Shexian, for a total of 38 lines. The total length is 57,252 kilometers. Routes with transportation value, such as the capital, important ports, and international passages, are all included. Some of these were originally provincial highways and will be taken over by the central government. Highways connecting provincial capitals and county seats will be designated as provincial highways. The initial national highway lines to be taken over by the central government are tentatively set at 38,573 kilometers to avoid difficulties for the provinces and prevent a sudden increase in the burden on the national treasury. Of these, more than 27,000 kilometers are already managed by the Ministry of Communications, so only about 10,000 kilometers will actually be taken over. After the takeover, the various district highway engineering management bureaus under the Highway Administration will handle the construction, maintenance, protection, improvement, supervision, transportation, and administrative tasks. The rest will remain under provincial management for the time being. For the routes taken over, the Ministry of Communications will negotiate with the provincial governments to formulate measures for gradual takeover, except for those already managed by central government bureaus. The unified management regulations for national highway transportation will be drafted by the Ministry of Communications and implemented after approval.

Editorial

### Inauguration of the National Federation of Shipping Associations

During the eight years of the war of resistance, the complete occupation of coastal ports led to significant losses in various industries, with the shipping industry being the most prominent. It is estimated that the total losses amounted to 300,000 tons, with private companies accounting for 90 percent of that.

At the beginning of the victory, the remaining vessels totaled only 100,000 tons. In less than two years, this has increased to 800,000 tons. Some were newly purchased by various companies, some were donated by the Allied forces, some were purchased from foreign countries, and some were purchased from foreign merchants in China. However, most of them were taken over from the enemy and puppet regimes. Regardless of their origin, the rapid organization, expansion, and catch-up within a short period, not only restoring the old appearance but also exceeding the original pre-war tonnage, is nothing short of a miracle. It is likely that similar recovery efforts in post-war economic reconstruction are rare.

That being said, the total tonnage of merchant ships in Japan is said to be 1.5 million tons, and the UK is actively building ships, with a total tonnage of nearly 20 million tons, while the US has expanded to over 60 million tons. Compared to our current total tonnage of ships, it is truly insignificant. Moreover, more than half of the ships are only 20 to 200 tons or more, only suitable for inland river routes and for lighterage near the docks. Only a few are 3,000 to 5,000 tons or more. Therefore, although there are currently four routes originating from Shanghai: (1) Southeast Asia route, (2) Northern Seas route, (3) Yangtze River route, (4) Ocean route, the actual routes are limited to the first three. The fourth route, including Shanghai to Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas, still needs to be prepared and planned. The possibility is very small until the US surplus ships, such as the Liberty and Victory classes, are transferred. Moreover, last September, the Ministry of Communications promulgated measures to allow the shipping industry to employ foreigners, stipulating the proportion of Chinese and foreign staff. Along the coast and in near seas, it cannot exceed one-third, and in the ocean, it cannot exceed one-half, which shows the current lack of talent. Furthermore, in October of last year, the Ministry of Communications issued minimum standards for shipping companies to purchase old ships, stipulating that passenger ships must not be more than 25 years old, cargo ships must not be more than 28 years old, the draft must be within 18 feet, the speed must be above 10 knots, and fuel must be coal-based. This shows that the Ministry of Communications is not completely satisfied with the existing ships.

Originally, after the victory, due to the urgent need for shipping, the profits of the shipping industry were considerable. Even under the burden of military and government transportation, the cost of purchased ships could be fully earned back after several months of operation. The relief materials undertaken by the jointly organized Ji Yun Group, although the freight must also be discounted, can still barely maintain the cost. The reason for the rapid recovery may be here, and the equipment still needs to be perfected, the management still needs to be refreshed, and the training of employees, the improvement of insurance and rescue, etc., still require the joint efforts of the shipping industry.

For all of the above reasons, a few months ago, the Shanghai Shipping Association sent a letter to colleagues in various places, initiating the organization of the National Federation of Shipping Associations, in order to pool strength and seek improvement together. This proposal has been widely supported in various places and will be officially established at a general meeting in Shanghai today. The significance of this move is extremely important. The two major arteries of transportation are railways and ships. At a time when internal strife has not subsided and land transportation is often obstructed, the shipping industry is relied upon to connect the north and south, maintain passenger transport, freight transport, and military transport. Therefore, the prosperity or decline of the shipping industry should not be viewed solely as a matter of interest to the industry, but as a matter of concern to the entire national economic lifeline.

Now, the issue of ship reparations from Japan is becoming increasingly urgent, and the transfer of surplus US ships is also about to mature. These tasks are extremely important and cannot be accomplished by one person or one organization alone. According to Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Shipping Association: China's shipping industry can reach 1.5 million tons next year and 3 million tons the year after. This heavy burden clearly needs to be shouldered jointly by relevant people across the country. Therefore, the establishment of the National Federation of Shipping Associations has special significance at present. Since the surrender of Japan and the abolition of unequal treaties, the scope of activities of China's shipping industry has expanded, but the responsibilities they bear have also increased. How to expand the scope, promote business, to meet the actual needs in the future, and how to consolidate shipping rights, and use foreign ships to enrich domestic and foreign routes, is the biggest issue facing the Federation.

### Consultations on Compromise Plan Fail: The Three Foreign Ministers' Conference Ends in Failure; Molotov Returns to Moscow Today; Bidault May Fly to England to Discuss Western European Reconstruction Plan

[News Dispatch] Paris, 2nd Broadcast: The Three Foreign Ministers' Conference declared its conclusion at 5:50 PM today. The compromise plan proposed by France was not accepted by the Soviet Union, leading to a deadlock in the conference and ending without result.

Another dispatch: Britain and France openly broke with the Soviet Union today over the Marshall Plan for European reconstruction. Before the break, Molotov delivered a lengthy speech denouncing the proposals of Britain and France, saying that they would divide Europe into two blocs, creating new difficulties. Molotov also warned Britain and France: "The Soviet government believes that Britain and France should be responsible for all the consequences. These consequences run counter to the path of European reconstruction." Molotov is scheduled to return to the Soviet Union tomorrow.

[News Dispatch] London, 2nd Broadcast: According to sources in Britain and France, Bevin and Bidault expected that Molotov would reject the compromise plan proposed by France and intend to jointly appeal to various countries to participate in the Western European reconstruction plan. It is said that Bidault may go to London on Friday to discuss the US aid plan for Western European reconstruction with Bevin in detail.

[Reuters News Agency, Paris, 1st] The plan proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault to the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference today is as follows: The Three Foreign Ministers' Conference of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, attaches importance to the need to accelerate the economic reconstruction and development of European countries affected by the war. This Conference believes that this task will be facilitated by the economic aid provided by the United States, as suggested by Secretary of State Marshall on June 5th. This Conference feels that Europe should first develop its economic production to help itself. The aid from the United States will enable Europe to carry out this task and, before Europe can obtain the necessary resources on its own, the United States will provide these resources, which is of decisive significance for Europe. Therefore, the aid from the United States will be the most reliable guarantee for European countries to restore their economies and maintain their independence. A special agency will be established to collect and prepare all the information needed to report on European resources and needs as soon as possible. This agency will be organized by European countries willing to participate. This agency will not interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, nor will it take any actions that could be regarded as infringing on the sovereignty of these countries, or that could hinder the development of trade between European countries.

### Marshall Delivers Speech: Says US Has No Imperialist Ambitions; Aid to Europe Aims to Help Self and Help Others

[Reuters News Agency, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Marshall delivered a speech to the National Women's Press Club today, refuting the notion that the United States has imperialist goals and attempts to use its aid plan for Europe to achieve its ambitions of political and economic domination, dismissing it as a fantasy distortion and malicious slander, and saying that those responsible for such malicious propaganda are harmful to distressed nations. The future of these nations depends on international economic cooperation.

Although Marshall did not directly mention the Soviet Union or the Paris Conference or his aid plan for Europe, when he spoke of the outside world criticizing rather than praising the aid provided by the United States, his goal was obvious. Although Marshall refuted the notion that the United States has imperialist goals, he also declared that the American people are not making contributions to help the world recover without any demands. The American people solemnly demand that whatever contributions they make must be used effectively to achieve the expected goals. The contributions of the American people must not be used for selfish political and economic goals, but only to help economic recovery. Finally, the aid of the American people has a great goal to restore the hope and trust of the American people, so that they know that the world will one day be peaceful and safe. Marshall also solemnly pointed out that US troops have withdrawn from Europe, and declared that there are no parties in European countries that are willing to be driven by US interests and attempt to conquer governments from within. The United States also has no spies attempting to control the police equipment of European countries. In addition, there are no companies jointly formed by the United States and Europe forcing European governments to recognize them. Furthermore, in terms of the figures of US aid to Europe since the end of the war, a total of 82 million tons of goods have been aided to Europe after the war, with a value of over 9 billion dollars. Marshall also declared that his enumeration of these facts is not to boast, but in view of the accusations of others against the United States, it is really necessary to make people not forget these facts. Judging from the historical record, no one has been more generous and selfless than the American people who have aided distressed people. Although there have been many examples of aiding others in history, their goals have all been to seek their own satisfaction. Now, the US government's assistance in restoring the world economy is not entirely based on a position of compassion. The American people believe that the stability and prosperity of the world is also an important factor in the happiness of the American people. The American people recognize the significant sacrifices made by other people and countries during the war, and this is not without a contribution. When Marshall began his speech, he also said that others have criticized the US's foreign policy for being erratic, but in fact, although the US is in a changing situation, it still maintains its consistent policy. The United States gave the greatest assistance to the establishment of the United Nations. Now the principles of this international organization are encountering obstacles everywhere, which cannot but make people feel greatly disappointed and uneasy. The American people know that the post-war world situation is not as good as expected, and the tasks ahead are even more arduous than anticipated three years ago. However, the American people's determination to build a world that allows the principles of the United Nations to be used and developed has not changed in the slightest. US policy is based on these determinations. Marshall also emphasized the importance of newspapers and radio stations in promoting public understanding of foreign affairs, because in countries with freedom of the press, even distorted propaganda can be corrected within a reasonable time.

### French New Proposals Leave Molotov Stymied

[French News Agency, London, 2nd] Regarding the new proposals made by French Foreign Minister Bidault in an effort to bring the Paris Conference to a successful conclusion, the "Daily Mail" recently commented: Britain and France "stymied" Molotov today, at least making him feel at a loss for a day, because Molotov is facing the fact that all Soviet satellite states are eager to accept US aid. This is probably the reason why Molotov is now asking for time to consider. The "Times" commented: Molotov also does not agree with the French proposal, and he has always been unwilling to completely reject any proposal at previous conference sessions, so it is expected that he will put forward a counter-proposal tomorrow for the other party to consider or reject. The "Daily Telegraph" also said: Molotov is now considering this suggestion worth considering, and he may ask Moscow for instructions again.

### TASS Announces Soviet Foreign Minister's Suggestions

[Reuters News Agency, Enskoe, 2nd] TASS announced today the content of the suggestion made by Foreign Minister Molotov to the Paris Conference last night. The full text is as follows: The Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, and the Soviet Union recognize the importance of accelerating the reconstruction and continued development of the economies of European countries affected by the war and believe that the implementation of this plan will be facilitated by the economic assistance provided by the United States. Secretary of State Marshall has already issued a statement on this assistance on June 5th. The Three Foreign Ministers' Conference believes that it is not the task of this Conference to draft a general economic plan for European countries, because the drafting of this economic plan, and the participation of other countries, will inevitably force other countries to accept the intentions of strong countries, constituting interference in the internal affairs of other countries and infringing on the sovereignty of other countries.

Moreover, drafting a general economic plan for European countries is sufficient to disrupt the existing economic relations between European countries, causing friction between these countries, making it more difficult to develop the extremely necessary economic relations between European countries. Therefore, the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference believes that the following steps should be taken: An Aid Committee should be established, composed of representatives of France, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and representatives of other European countries, to investigate the needs of European countries for economic assistance, the possibility of the United States providing such assistance, and to assist European countries in obtaining such assistance. Under the Aid Committee, there will be subcommittees on food, fuel, equipment, etc. Each subcommittee will be composed of representatives of France, Britain, and the Soviet Union, together with two representatives selected from European countries that were occupied by Germany and contributed to the defeat of the enemy, based on their special interests in the work of the subcommittee. Former enemy countries may also be invited by the subcommittee to submit their opinions. The problem of Germany will be examined by the four major powers of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. The tasks of the Aid Committee are: (1) to accept the estimates of European countries regarding US assistance; (2) to draft a free plan based on these estimates, in which priority should be given to countries that were invaded by Germany and contributed to the victory of the Allied forces; (3) to investigate the possibility of the United States providing appropriate economic assistance; (4) to establish relations with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

### Former US Assistant Secretary of State: Denounces Aggressor Nations

[United Press, New York, 1st] Bill, a leader of New York liberals who formerly served as Assistant Secretary of State, said in a speech at a dinner to welcome Italian Socialist leaders Lagaz and Tieciong: Peace treaties are diplomatic strategies used to establish peace in Europe, but peace has not yet arrived, so the United States still assumes the obligation to provide assistance in maintaining and rebuilding Italy as an independent nation. The American people believe that Italy's social system is a matter for the Italian people to decide for themselves. What the United States wants is a free and independent Italy, free from the control of any foreign country. The American people are supporting the Marshall Plan to liberate Europe from hunger, poverty, and turmoil. Italy is an important factor in the Marshall Plan. Bill is confident that the American people and Congress will approve the supply of money and materials under the Marshall Plan, and said: "The claim spread by Moscow that the United States is about to collapse economically is obviously absurd. The American people are deeply bewildered and puzzled by the fact that some countries are suppressing the freedom of the people, bullying neighboring countries, and carrying out military expansion on the one hand, and telling the United States about poverty on the other hand. The American people are willing to spend millions of dollars to relieve poverty, but are unwilling to give a single cent to aggressor nations."

### MacArthur's Measures Towards Japan Increase Allied Dissatisfaction; Australia Expected to Express Strong Position at Peace Conference

[Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd] The British Foreign Office spokesman's explicit expression of dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the American policy towards Japan has been well received by representatives of various Allied nations here. Officials at MacArthur's headquarters have stated that Australia's attitude is expected to be the most difficult to deal with at the peace conference. Following Britain's formal protest regarding the permission given to Japan for whaling and the mining of phosphate on Angaur Island, the British Foreign Office spokesman's clear statement further confirms that Britain and Australia hold the same position. Britain and Australia particularly express skepticism towards MacArthur's "spiritual revolution," believing it premature to claim that Japan has already abandoned militarism, and they do not feel optimistic about the future of Japan as envisioned by MacArthur. They also express dissatisfaction with the propaganda from MacArthur's headquarters that the United States is granting benefits to Japan while other Allied nations are waiting for an opportunity to oppress Japan. China's criticism of the occupation policy is even more profound and meticulous than Britain's. For example, China has expressed opposition to MacArthur's directive allowing Japanese police to carry rifles and pistols, and Chinese representatives are particularly indignant about the treatment of Chinese and Korean people in Japan. As for the Soviet Union, it has consistently not recognized any merit in the occupation policy. From the beginning, the Soviet Union has opposed MacArthur's headquarters' policies on wages, price controls, fishing rights, and land reform, among others.

### British Refutation: MacArthur's Headquarters Statement

[Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd] Officials of the British Commonwealth are deeply shocked by the statement made last night by a spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters regarding the permission granted to Japan for whaling and the mining of phosphate on Angaur Island. They believe that these two matters should have been discussed with the countries concerned before being approved by MacArthur's headquarters. As for the discussion on whaling, it is far from completion; as for the mining of phosphate, the opinions of other Allied nations were not sought at all. Whaling involves the economic and military issues of Australia and New Zealand, and there is a suspicion of events that should be handled under the preliminary peace treaty, providing grounds for a strong protest.

### South's Representative to the Security Council Firmly Denies; South's Assistance to Greek Guerrillas; Accuses US of Deliberately Protecting Greece

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 1st] The report submitted by the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee has recently been discussed by the United Nations Security Council. During the session, the Yugoslav representative firmly denied that Yugoslavia assisted Greek guerrillas in resisting the Greek government. It is claimed that Greece had submitted fifty-seven incidents of border conflicts to the investigation committee, accusing Yugoslavia of assisting Greek guerrillas. The investigation committee only reviewed four of these incidents, and then immediately determined that Yugoslavia should be responsible for these border incidents. On the other hand, the Yugoslav government had also submitted seventy-nine incidents of Greek violations of the Yugoslav border to the investigation committee, but none of them were considered by the investigation committee. The United States' representative to the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee, Mr. Etheridge, acted hastily in assigning responsibility to northern Greece, with the aim of concealing the fact that there was insufficient evidence. In short, Yugoslavia hopes that the Security Council will carefully study the report of the investigation committee to accurately understand the truth of the situation in northern Greece.

### Over 3,000 Restaurants Operated by Overseas Chinese in Japan Cease Operations

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd Dispatch] The Japanese government has ordered all restaurants, cafes, bars, and other various drinking establishments in Japan to cease operations from July 5th to the end of this year. This Japanese government ordinance is equally effective for hotels owned or operated by our overseas Chinese compatriots and Korean people. Anyone who violates this emergency measures law will be sentenced to imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of 50,000 yen. Japanese newspapers believe that this ordinance will affect 200,000 restaurants and hotels, and it is estimated that it will lead to the unemployment of 4 million people.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] In order to conserve food, the Japanese government has prohibited the opening of food shops nationwide. As a result, among the more than 3,000 food shops opened by overseas Chinese in Japan, two-thirds of the workers are affected. The head of our delegation in Japan, Mr. Shang, is very concerned about this.

### President Truman Signs Bill to Join Refugee Organization

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] President Truman has recently signed the bill for the United States to join the International Refugee Organization. The bill authorizes the government to allocate $73.5 million as the U.S. contribution to the organization's expenses for the next twelve months.

### Japanese Diet Begins Questioning: Katayama Emphasizes Rejection of Class Struggle; Minister of Agriculture States This Year's Food Shortage is Two Million Koku

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] The proceedings of today's Diet session are as follows: In the House of Councillors, representatives from the Liberal Party (Itagaki), Ryokufūkai (Sato), and Socialist Party (Yoshikawa) sequentially questioned Prime Minister Katayama's policy speech from yesterday, and Prime Minister Katayama and various ministers successively responded. The session adjourned at 12:20 PM. In the House of Representatives, the session began at 1:50 PM. First, Kato Kanju questioned, and Katayama, Ashida, Hirano, and Awazu sequentially responded. The session recessed at 3:45 PM and reconvened at 4:06 PM. Kitamura Tokutaro raised questions, and Katayama and Morito responded. Both Kato's and Kitamura's questions remained within the positions of their parties, so the Diet session today can be considered to have proceeded smoothly. The session adjourned at 4:54 PM.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] The Japanese Diet continued its session today, and the questioning battle of various parties has already begun. Prime Minister Katayama and various ministers responded to the questions of each party one by one. The following is a summary: (1) Prime Minister Katayama's response to "General Policy" stated: In political actions, we will eliminate all secretism and not allow extreme thoughts and actions. While acknowledging the existence of classes, we reject class struggle. As for strikes, they are the legitimate rights of workers, so we recognize them. All politics will be conducted through the parliamentary system, and we absolutely reject the bureaucratic self-righteousness. (2) Minister of Agriculture Hirano's response to the "Food Problem" stated: Until the new grains are on the market this autumn, the quantity of main food needed by Japan is 16.52 million koku, while the total amount of requisitioning and the projected amount of imported food to be released this year is only 14.18 million koku, leaving a shortage of 1.34 million koku, which means that each person is short of 16 days of food. Adding the 12 days of food that has been delayed in distribution so far, there is a shortage of about one month of food in total. Therefore, if we maintain the current rationing level, we must fundamentally change the amount of rice to be requisitioned for the next year, so we have submitted a bill related to this problem in this Diet session. (3) Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani's response to "National Management" stated: Coal national management will not implement bureaucratic control, but will fully pay attention to its democratization, and intends to ensure the planned production of 30 million tons. (4) Minister of Education Morito's response to "School Education" stated: Regardless of whether the population has increased or not, schools were not added during the war, but rather decreased by more than 80,000 due to war damage, of which 30% have no school buildings. The current policy is to restore normalcy as much as possible.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Discuss Former Japanese Mandated Islands Trusteeship; US Prepares to Participate in South Pacific Conference

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st Dispatch] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee will discuss on the 7th the agreement between the United States and the United Nations regarding the control of the former Japanese mandated territories, namely the Mariana, Marshall, and Caroline Islands. According to the agreement passed by the United Nations Security Council, these three territories are all placed under the control of a "strategic area," and the United States may, if necessary, establish defense facilities on these islands and may prohibit foreigners from traveling to these islands.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg recently told the press that the committee has approved the United States' participation in the Caribbean Sea Commission (which is organized by representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands) and the South Pacific Commission (which is organized by representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Australia). The purpose of this meeting is to promote international cooperation to promote the culture of non-self-governing regions in these two regions.

### Ashida Hitoshi Attempts to Conceal His Ambitions; Still Intends to Covet Islands Near the Mainland

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida solemnly declared on the 2nd that Japan has no territorial ambitions and firmly insisted that Japan faithfully abides by the Potsdam Declaration, abandons armed forces, and has done its best so far to promote the democratization of Japan. Ashida made this statement in response to a question from Social Democratic Party member Kato at a plenary session of the House of Representatives. Kato stated: According to news reports, Ashida had expressed that Japan demands the return of Okinawa Island and the Kuril Islands, which gives the impression that Japan has territorial ambitions. According to Ashida's address to the Diet members, his remarks were made when meeting with foreign reporters on June 5th, and unfortunately the news was misrepresented. The territory of Japan will be finally determined by the future peace conference, "but there are some islands near Hokkaido and Kyushu that have always been part of the Japanese mainland both ethnically and historically. We have never intended to acquire territory by force; this is what I wanted to tell the foreign reporters."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Prime Minister Katayama stated today in response to a question from Sato Naotake (Ryokufūkai) in the House of Councillors that Foreign Minister Ashida actually holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister in this cabinet. This is enough to show that the current cabinet does not disregard diplomatic issues.

### Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia Plan to Form Southeast Asian League

And Intend to Invite India and Indonesia to Participate

[United Press, Bangkok, 1st] Thai Prime Minister Nuai Suwan declared today that Thailand and France will initiate the organization of a Southeast Asian alliance by Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam; India, Indonesia, and Borneo should also be invited to participate in the future. The alliance will discuss matters related to irrigation, fisheries, and transportation in the Southeast Asian region.

### Chilean Supreme Court Announces: State of War with Japan Ends

[Associated Press, Santiago, 2nd] The Chilean Supreme Court announced on the afternoon of the 1st that the state of war between Chile and Japan has ended. It is claimed that although Chile has not actually signed a peace treaty with Japan, it is not necessary to conclude a treaty to end the state of war. After the end of the war, the state of war also ends. There are many precedents for this, such as the Chilean-Spanish War in 1865 and the French-Spanish War in 1720. The important significance of this move lies in using the existence or absence of a state of war with Japan as a legal procedure for political competition. For example, the law stipulates that members of the Chilean Senate and House of Representatives can only hold government positions during wartime. Therefore, Senator Duhart was able to serve as Vice President, Joryde was able to serve as Foreign Minister, Baussay was able to serve as Minister of Economy, and Rios was able to serve as Minister of Education.

### Indonesian Cabinet Still Not Formed, Naval Battle Erupts Again off Java Coast; Overseas Chinese Demand Our Country Recognize Indonesia

[Associated Press, Batavia, 2nd] The Indonesian Republic's reply to the United States' note on mediating the Indonesian-Dutch crisis is expected to be released soon. According to Dutch sources here, the differences in political views among the four major parties in Indonesia may prevent them from reaching an agreement. According to Indonesian sources, former Prime Minister Sjahrir, who resigned last week, will return to Yogyakarta within a day or two to assume an important position. The Republic's communication agency reports that President Sukarno has consulted with Socialist leader Sjahrir, Nationalist Party's Gani, and labor leader Setiadjit on the formation of a cabinet, and it is likely that a left-wing Nationalist Party cabinet will be formed. Although the largest party (Muslim Party) will not participate, this will also be a strong cabinet. The Nationalist Party is the second largest party, occupying 47 seats in Congress. At the same time, it is learned that the Nationalist Party has no objection to Sjahrir serving as Prime Minister.

Also according to Yogyakarta sources, the position of Prime Minister may be entrusted to Rom, the former Minister of Interior of the Muslim Party, but according to Muslim leader Sudarman, he has not received this request.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 2nd] An Indonesian military spokesman reported today that two Dutch warships opened fire on an Indonesian battery on the east coast of Java, destroying three observation posts and a telegraph line. A Dutch light cruiser also passed by the battery during the engagement but did not cause any trouble. However, this information has not been confirmed by the Dutch side.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 2nd] According to Anita News Agency, the largest overseas Chinese organization in the Dutch East Indies, the Chung Hwa Society, held a meeting and decided to request the Chinese government to formally recognize the Indonesian Republic.

### Japan's Huge Gold Reserves: Allied Headquarters Requests Unfreezing

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] According to information obtained by the Associated Press, the Allied Headquarters has submitted a request to the Far Eastern Commission to use Japan's frozen gold and other precious metals, worth approximately $200 million, for the Allied Headquarters' use as collateral for purchasing raw materials. These metals are currently sealed in the Bank of Japan. It is believed here that this matter is another attempt by the Allied Headquarters' Economic and Scientific Section to obtain revolving funds for Japan to purchase its own repayable bulk raw materials. It is pointed out that a collateral of 200 million in gold can obtain loans several times greater than this. Therefore, it is believed here that American or other foreign merchants who are willing to ship raw materials to Japan would be very satisfied if they could obtain a 20% gold guarantee. It is expected that some members of the Far Eastern Commission will express opposition, as they have always viewed the gold sealed in the Bank of Japan as only for reparations.

### Syngman Rhee Returns to Violation; Meets with Kim Gu and Syngman Rhee Yesterday

The US State Department announced today that the military government affairs of South Korea will be transferred from the Department of the Army to the Department of State.

### French Cabinet to be Reorganized

Government Asks Parliament for Vote of Confidence

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] The French government's motion of confidence will be voted on by the National Assembly on the 4th of this month, and it is expected that the government will obtain a majority of votes. At the same time, rumors are spreading that Prime Minister Ramadier will mention the possibility of internal cabinet reorganization during his speech in parliament and announce three or four new cabinet members, with Minister of State Gouin entering the cabinet. It is heard that those joining the cabinet will be Socialist leader Blum, Radical Party leader Herriot, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor Chatel, and former Prime Minister Reynaud.

### Philippine Prisoners Break Out of Jail; Rob Mayor and Occupy Airport

[Associated Press, Manila, 2nd] According to a report from an official of the Aviation Bureau, prisoners in Mindoro Province broke out of jail today and attempted to seize the Calapan Airport and a Philippine Airlines plane. The military police are currently engaging them in combat.

According to Philippine Airlines, they have not received any radio communication from Calapan since this morning. The Ministry of the Interior stated that the prisoners robbed Mindoro Governor Molent, and two C47 aircraft full of soldiers have flown from Manila to Calapan to suppress the rebellion.

According to a telegram from the "Champagne" ship docked in Calapan, a group of armed men disarmed the police in the city and surrounded and guarded all military police. Military police from Hatton Gas have rushed to provide assistance.

### Italian Transport Ship Explodes

[United Press, Rome, 1st] The transport ship "Bani Gagari" exploded suddenly today while unloading ammunition in the port of Santo Stefano, killing 68 people. Several others are trapped in the cabin and unable to escape.

### Indian Army to be Divided; Will be Reorganized with Assistance from British Officers

[United Press, London, 2nd] The India Office announced today that Indian Governor-General Mountbatten has ordered the existing land, sea, and air forces of India to be divided between the Indian State and the Islamic State. Units with a majority of Islamic officers and soldiers will be transferred to the Islamic State, and those with a minority will be transferred to the Indian State. After August 15th, all troops should be reorganized as soon as possible based on volunteerism and territorial basis. Muslims in units serving within the Indian State may join the Islamic State army, and non-Muslims in units within the Islamic State may join the Indian State army. However, before the governments of each country can provide for them, they will still be under the unified command of Marshal Auchinleck.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 2nd] The Indian army will also be divided into two within nine months, belonging to "Hindustan" and "Pakistan" respectively. This move will likely make both unable to abandon British assistance, and will cause the British army to postpone its withdrawal. Although both India and Pakistan will establish their own general staff departments, they will still need the assistance of experienced British officers to reorganize them. Regarding the Joint Defense Council opposed by the Congress Party, although it will be abolished after the completion of the division, it is expected that Britain will exert pressure at that time to allow it to continue to exist, so that it can plan India's defense issues within the British liaison organization.

### Clayton Arrives in Geneva; Says US Concerned about Europe's Reaction to Marshall Plan

### Economic Supervision Work; Takes Active Action; Spot Checks Yarn and Cloth Shops; Removes Intercom Telephones; Acting Director Yu Expresses "Tiger Hunting" Determination

[Our Report] After the Economic Council held its first meeting the day before yesterday, it was decided that economic supervision work will be uniformly implemented by the Police Bureau in the future. The Economic Section of the bureau officially started action yesterday, first targeting several illegal yarn and cloth merchants who monopolize, raise prices, and hoard for speculation. It is reported that yesterday, Dafeng, Shengji, Changcheng, Deji, Yutai, and five other companies were investigated. In addition to continuing spot checks today, they will also thoroughly remove unauthorized intercom telephones in major building securities firms in conjunction with the Public Utilities Bureau, so as to eliminate off-site transactions and the black market for gold and banknotes. At the same time, the business of all banks in the city will be inspected one by one in conjunction with the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai-based personnel. Acting Director Yu said to reporters during a meeting yesterday that this work can be completed within this week. Yu also said that Mayor Wu has a great determination for economic supervision work. In addition, cases that violate the economic emergency measures laws will be handled by the courts if the circumstances are relatively minor, while more serious cases will be submitted to the central government for approval. In addition, the Telegraph Bureau has been requested to refuse to receive or send reports on port exchange rates and various black market quotes, and newspapers are strictly prohibited from publishing them. In order to achieve contact in the execution of work, Yu intends to propose to the mayor that the gold banknote, yarn and cloth, food, cooking oil, and fuel groups under the Economic Council jointly establish an office to have the opportunity to review the regular work. Finally, Yu revealed that the Economic Council will be permanent, so the bureau's economic police will be increased to 100.

### Restriction of Warehouse Receipt Transactions Under Study by Various Agencies

[Our Report] It was proposed to restrict warehouse receipt transactions at the first Economic Conference. Regarding this issue, Mr. Gu Yuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday: Regulations for various warehouse receipt transactions in Shanghai include the provision that Taicang public warehouse receipts for guns must be directly delivered within ten days; otherwise, the rights are cancelled. In the case of cooking oil, the Social Affairs Bureau discovered illegal buying and selling of locally produced goods, so last week, it ordered that the warehouse receipts be cleared within ten days. For cotton cloth, Mayor Wu and the Economic Supervision Group agreed to limit the time for picking up goods to one week to half a month; otherwise, it would be considered hoarding. Coal has always been delivered directly by the Coal Industry Association, so there are no warehouse receipt transactions. The same is true for rice. The Economic Conference decided to impose restrictions on the storage period after goods are traded, and various materials agencies are carefully studying this matter.

### Rice for Poor Households Can Now Be Distributed

[Our Report] Regarding the distribution of rice to the poor in the city, the Civil Food Adjustment Committee stated yesterday that the Pingtiao stations in the Yimiao and Ti Lan Qiao districts will soon be established.

One million rice ration cards for the poor and six hundred thousand rice ration cards for workers are currently being printed and will be issued as soon as they are ready. If the quantity allocated by the Adjustment Committee is insufficient for distribution in each district, the distribution to ordinary poor households may be temporarily delayed, and priority will be given to the moderately poor and destitute. As of now, more than 40,000 dan of rice have been approved for distribution to factories and schools for June. Applications for another 16,000 dan or so have been submitted and are expected to be approved soon.

### Dispute at Guang Sheng Hang Resolved, Knitting Operations in the Second District to Resume

[Our Report] The Xiechang Tobacco Company on Daxilu Road suspended operations in April, with the factory paying workers half a month's salary. Workers expressed dissatisfaction and demanded additional payment, which the factory refused. As a result, several hundred workers gathered yesterday morning to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that the factory's payment of half a month's wages during the suspension of operations was in compliance with the law, and the Social Affairs Bureau could not intervene in the workers' additional demands.

The labor-management dispute at the Hua Lü Gang Jing Factory remained unresolved despite all-day mediation efforts. The Social Affairs Bureau will now consult with the employer to first issue some wages to maintain the livelihoods of unemployed workers.

The work stoppage dispute at Guang Sheng Hang, which produces Two Girls brand face lotion and perfume, has been resolved through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. Both parties have agreed to lay off half of the workers, totaling 45, with those with shorter years of service being laid off first. Severance pay will be issued in accordance with government regulations. The factory will try to resume operations within the month, and laid-off workers will have priority in rehiring when more workers are needed in the future. Three worker representatives will be retained.

The wage index dispute among hand-operated knitting machine workers in the knitting industry has been resolved in the First and Third districts, but workers in the Second district disagree and remain on strike. The Social Affairs Bureau met with the chairman of the Second District Labor Union, Jia Fangxiong, and others yesterday and decided on the following principles for handling the situation: (1) The May wages have already been submitted to the municipal government for arbitration, and the decision will be awaited according to the law. (2) Starting with the June wages, wages will be handled in accordance with the labor-management contract, i.e., the previous month's index will be used, and wages will be calculated at 85% of that. (3) The Social Affairs Bureau will investigate and handle the arrested workers. (4) Workers should be ordered to fully resume work by July 4. (5) There should be no further excessive actions. The labor union expressed its acceptance and is making every effort to persuade the workers. It is expected that work can resume tomorrow.

At the same time, the court's criminal division handled the legal procedures for the retrial in preparation. The students' families came to the court to inquire on the 30th of last month, but as the court had not yet received a reply from the municipal government, it could not provide a concrete response, but indicated that it would handle the matter in accordance with the law. The municipal government's reply arrived at the court yesterday. The detailed content is not yet known because it has not been reviewed, so nothing can be disclosed. If the conditions for retrial are met, the retrial will be conducted within 24 hours. If it involves the crime of internal rebellion, it will be sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation first. If it involves the crime of disrupting order, it will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation first. If the municipal government's reply invokes martial law, the court has no right to conduct a retrial.

### Yarn Industry Colludes with Customs Brokers to Exploit the Opportunity for Large-Scale Fraud - Large Batch of Export Customs Declarations Approved After Verification

According to information from the Economic Section of the Garrison Command: In order to balance the supply of cotton yarn and cloth and stabilize prices, the Executive Yuan issued an order on April 22 stating that "Cotton yarn and cloth declared for transit or transfer by rail must be released only after the Textile Industry Management Committee has issued a permit." The Ministries of Finance, Economics, and Communications were instructed to comply, and the Shanghai Municipal Government was instructed to follow suit. However, the Jianghai Customs Office did not formally announce this order until 11 a.m. on the 25th. Upon receiving intelligence, relevant personnel immediately took advantage of the opportunity to quickly collude with familiar customs brokers and commit fraud within a few hours that morning. They rapidly approved a large number of inflated export customs declarations for yarn and cloth. Investigators were dispatched to verify the addresses and confirmed that the information was accurate. The entire case file and evidence have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for investigation.

### New Utility Prices Proposed - Director Zhao to Go to Nanjing to Negotiate, Lowest Increase of One Time, Highest Increase of Three Times

[Our Report] The new prices for utility services in the city have been calculated by the Public Utilities Bureau. It was originally planned that Director Zhao Zengjue would take them to Nanjing for implementation after they were approved by the National Price Conference yesterday. However, due to the temporary postponement of the Price Conference, the price increase will have to wait for some time. However, the utility service agencies are suffering huge losses due to the old prices, and there is no fixed date for the National Price Conference to be convened, so Director Zhao is quite anxious. He spoke to Nanjing on the phone yesterday, saying that if the National Price Conference is not planned to be convened for a while, he will go to the capital first to personally consult with Executive Yuan President Zhang. According to what Director Zhao told reporters yesterday: The basic method for adjusting utility prices has been drafted, using fuel, foreign exchange, and the cost of living index as the basis. He hopes to obtain a thorough solution on this trip to the capital so that the city's utility services can automatically adjust prices based on a set method in the future, without having to wait for the decision of the National Price Conference each time.

Although the new prices after the utility service adjustment have been decided, Director Zhao is unwilling to disclose them before they are approved by the central government. However, according to his statement: Because the cost increases for each company are different, the adjustment of prices also varies, with the lowest increase being one time and the highest not exceeding three times.

### Sino-American Wireless Telephone Temporarily Suspends Acceptance of Registration - Very Low Fees, Supply Falls Short of Demand

[Our Report] The Sino-American wireless telephone officially opened the day before yesterday, and many citizens went to register. However, due to solar flares, only four hours of telephone service are available each day, from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. the next morning, and changes in weather can also temporarily affect the transmission of radio waves, so at most only a dozen calls can be made each day. The Telecommunications Bureau has scheduled those who have already registered and has temporarily suspended registration since yesterday. It is estimated that those who have already registered will be able to complete their calls by this Friday. According to the person in charge of international wireless telephones at the Telecommunications Bureau: The close relations between China and the United States and the demand for communications were expected, so the crowding of wireless telephone registrations was inevitable. Also, because the fees are too low, they will increase the use by general non-essential and curious individuals. The expedited telephone fee between Shanghai and Chongqing is 163,000 yuan per call, while a Sino-American call only costs 144,000 yuan, which is not very reasonable. However, due to the Sino-American agreement, the telephone fee will not increase unless the foreign exchange rate changes.

### Da Zhonghua Shuttle Factory's Timber Raw Material Supply Interrupted

It recently submitted a document to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, stating that the factory was formerly the Da Zhu Yangxing factory, a property of the enemy, and was purchased last summer. The raw materials used are Taiwanese wood, and the performance of wood from other regions does not meet the standards, so it has specially commissioned merchants to purchase wood in Taiwan. It has now ordered more than 100,000 pieces, but the Taiwan authorities have banned exports, resulting in an interruption of raw material supplies. Therefore, it has submitted a document to the Guidance Office, requesting it to negotiate with the Taiwan Provincial Government so that exports can be approved as soon as possible.

### More Than 70% of Land Tax Collected in Xinjing and Longhua Districts

[Our Report] Former Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan reorganized the land register and changed the land tax collection method. In October of last year, he conducted land tax registration in order to ensure that the land and tax records match and that nothing is missed. However, due to the low educational level of people in the suburbs and the displacement and loss of property certificates during the war, the maps are inaccurate, the land area is erroneous, and many people have applied repeatedly. However, the overall situation of land tax collection is still good. According to the report from the land tax supervisors in the Pusong district of the Finance Bureau, the Xinjing and Longhua districts of the city began collecting on April 25 of this year, and as of the end of last month, the original tax amount was more than 400 million yuan, with 11.91 million jin of grain paid by the taxpayers, and the amount collected was more than 70% of the original tax amount.

After Prosecutor Liang Gengshun questioned him, he immediately ordered his detention. The victim, Han Zhongyi, a native of Ningbo, is a laborer. His wife, Han Chen, came to Shanghai from the countryside. Because they had no place to live, they temporarily stayed at the home of their friend Zhang Jinquan (No. 18, Lane 321, Wuchang Road). Zhang took advantage of Han's absence at work to flirt with Chen and demand indecency. Chen initially refused, but Zhang threatened to evict them, and on June 4, they eventually engaged in physical relations. After hearing about this, Han moved to a shed in Qinghefang, Zhonghua Road, but Zhang continued to pester them from time to time. Chen also reproached him repeatedly, which was also discovered by Han. It was then decided to send Chen back to the countryside on the 25th of last month. Upon hearing this news, Zhang went to Han's residence on the evening of the 25th and openly demanded another tryst as a farewell memorial. Han and his wife refused, and an argument ensued, followed by a physical fight. Zhang first took scissors and stabbed Han, but missed. Then he took a kitchen knife and slashed at Han, but neighbors took the knife away and sent him to the Beizhan Police Station, and then transferred him to the General Bureau. He was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday to be investigated for obstructing family and attempted murder.

All 100+ proposals have been compiled and printed into a booklet. The agenda of the General Assembly has been scheduled.

Hosting the Press to Report Progress

Yang Guanbei and Li Zhenliang, members of the preparatory committee of the Federation, hosted the press at the Bank Club at 6:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the progress of the preparations and the mission of establishing the Federation. According to Li Yunliang, since the restoration, the Chinese people's understanding of the shipping industry has gradually deepened, and their interest has become stronger, so that the precarious shipping industry has regained its bright and lively atmosphere. Recalling the history of China's shipping industry, the ninety-five years from the Treaty of Nanjing to the beginning of the War of Resistance were a period of aggression, the eight years of the War of Resistance were a period of sacrifice and stagnation, and after the victory, it entered a stage of revival. Now that the Federation has been established, it will gather the strength of the whole country to solve various basic problems for the revival of the shipping industry.

The Most Important Tasks Can Be Divided into Five Points

Its most important tasks can be divided into five points: (1) The development of China's shipping industry has now entered an important stage, internally to maintain the navigation rights of inland rivers and coastal areas, and externally to seek the development of overseas shipping to replace the positions of various countries, especially Japan, in the Far East shipping industry in the past. (2) To establish a modern and sound shipping business, innovate business operations, and abolish the traditional corrupt system of compradores in the past. (3) To carry out various undertakings related to the shipping industry, such as shipbuilding and training of navigation talents, handling insurance, and building wharves and warehouses. (4) To assist the government to catch up with the world's shipping standards, such as ship inspections, safety, mutual recognition, and exchange of information. Participate in all international shipping conferences, so as to establish close ties with the shipping industries of various countries, in order to meet the standards of the World Maritime Safety Conference. (5) To seek contact between the same industry and with various industries. Finally, he also said: Shanghai's ship tonnage accounts for more than 80% of the country, with a total tonnage of 658,880.85 tons. In the future, China's shipping industry will still be centered on Shanghai. Regarding the fuel required by the shipping industry, Li Yunliang reported at last night's press conference that the required kerosene and oil have been agreed with the oil company to be supplied regularly by the company. However, the use of coal is currently increased by 20%, and a 200-ton ship requires 10 million yuan for coal, which is really unbearable, and the problem is extremely serious.

### Soliciting Names for the Chuiwanlou Poetry Collection; The Literary World Responds

Gao Chuiwanlou of Jinshan is highly regarded for his ancient poetry and prose. He encountered turmoil in Wuyin; his collection of books was almost completely looted, and his poetry and prose manuscripts could not be collected in time, resulting in simultaneous loss. Fortunately, the manuscripts were saved by his disciples. The following year, they were published in eighteen volumes as the Chuiwanlou Anthology, and those who heard about it competed to buy them. Not many were printed, and they were soon sold out. In the seven or eight years since then, he has been living at sea, and he has written more and more poems. He has specially inspected his recent works, and has searched extensively for those collected by friends near and far, as well as those scattered in old publications and remaining drafts, and has obtained several volumes, the total number of which is roughly equal to the Anthology. Now, Shen Siqi and Jin Lanqi, fellow villagers, and others, plan to print 1,000 copies of the Chuiwanlou Poetry Collection. The estimated cost of labor and materials is about 50 million yuan.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

(1) Two Husbands Competing for a Concubine

Zhu Junxin of Changshu asks: My friend Zhang Jun cohabited with a woman named Li in the spring of the 27th year. She was originally a concubine of Xu. During the incident, Li and Xu fled and were separated. Due to livelihood problems, Li and my friend Zhang Jun cohabited. Now Xu has returned home and urged Ms. Li to return to reunite. There are three doubts. Please give instructions: (1) My friend Zhang Jun has cohabited with Ms. Li for ten years. If Xu insists that Ms. Li return home to reunite, and Ms. Li is unwilling to go, and Zhang Jun also refuses, what legal responsibility does he have? (2) Ms. Li and Xu have a daughter, who is now twelve years old. When she returned to her mother's home, she was only two years old. All the expenses for upbringing and education were borne by Zhang Jun. Now Xu wants his daughter to be taken back and raised by himself. Can Zhang Jun refuse? Otherwise, can he ask for the return of living expenses (from the age of two to twelve)? (3) Ms. Li's biological mother is still alive. Li is now 32 years old. When she was 18 years old, her father passed away, and she was abducted and sold to Xu as a concubine by her father's concubine without the consent of her biological mother. Can the biological mother now come forward to accuse the concubine of abduction?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) The concubine system is not stipulated in the current civil law because it does not conform to the principle of equality between men and women. The woman does not want to be a concubine and can sever relations with the head of the family at any time (see Supreme Court Judgment No. 1437, 20th year). (2) The biological father taking back an illegitimate child cannot be refused by anyone. Zhang has adopted Xu's daughter for ten years and already has the relationship of an adoptive father. The Civil Law does not stipulate that an adopted child restores his original surname and restores the relationship between his biological father and daughter when the adoption relationship is terminated. The adoptive father can request the biological father to compensate for the damage. (3) Li's concubine slightly lured her away from the family. The highest degree of punishment is imprisonment of up to seven years. The statute of limitations for prosecution is ten years. Now it has been fourteen years, and there is no right to prosecute.

(2) Overstepping One's Authority

Ye Jiejun: My friend A and woman B fell in love, but B's parents accepted a betrothal gift of 1 million yuan from C. Now woman B wants to marry man A regardless of her parents' opposition. However, there are several legal questions. Please answer: (1) Is it illegal for A and B to marry on their own? (2) B returns the engagement gift to C. If C refuses to accept it, how should it be handled? (3) Can C demand compensation from B? (4) If B is not of legal age (19 years old), can she choose to marry herself? (5) Does C have the right to sue B's parents?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] The marriage contract should be made by the man and woman themselves. It is of course invalid for parents to make a marriage contract on behalf of their underage children. Therefore, in this case (1) A and B can marry, but if B is a minor, she should obtain the consent of her legal representative. (2) No reason to refuse to accept. (3) If there is no other damage, compensation cannot be demanded. (4) If B is under 20 years old, whether she is engaged or married, she must obtain the consent of her legal representative. (5) It should depend on whether C has other damages.

### Maha Team Defender Chen Jiasu Joins Sing Tao, Sing Tao Loses to Maha, Original General Injured

[Our Newspaper's Hong Kong Aviation News] Since its expedition, the Tiger Team has not encountered a worthy opponent. When it reached Singapore, it suffered its first defeat, losing 3-1 to the Malay Overseas Chinese team. After careful research, it turned out that three forwards were injured: wingers Qiu Ting and He Yingfen were injured, and Zhang Jinhai also had problems. Therefore, they had to use Gao Shanlong as the right winger and Liu Songsheng as the left winger.

This adjustment caused problems. Liu and Gao were transferred from the defense to the front, which loosened the defense and made the attack less effective, resulting in a defeat.

I said long ago that this technical expeditionary force lacked wingers, and it turned out to be true.

Now news comes that Chen Jiasu, the best right back of the Maha team, is accompanying Sing Tao on their expedition to England. This will strengthen the defense further, but what about the forwards? Worries, worries!

In this expeditionary force, there is a Western general, Gao Shanlong - that is, Xiao Gaoshan slave. This man's football skills are good. He and his brother Da Gaoshan slave dominate Hong Kong. Li Huitang is only like that (Xiao Gaoshan slave has been the Hong Kong Port Team captain eight times). He plays very well in every position on the football team.

Now he is accompanying the army on the expedition, playing a few left backs and has established special merits, worthy of a famous general.

Zhu Yongqiang was originally a good inside forward for South China. This time, he joined Sing Tao's expedition to Europe, playing center forward and left winger. Especially after playing two or three left winger games, he grabbed a lot of attention. "Little Zhu" has a very good basic skills. If he can strive for progress, his position will be indispensable in the future World Games selection.

Among a group of "veteran" players, one who can still maintain the position is "God Leg" Feng Jingxiang, and the other is "Iron Leg" Sun Jinshun. One "God" and one "Iron" still have the "stage style" of the World Games era, and the style remains the same.

Now "God Leg" is leading the army again, not only the central leader of the entire army, but also cleanly shooting a few goals from outside the twenty-yard line. The famous general has his own skills.

### Lixing Middle School Raises Funds to Hold Small Ball Charity Match

Lixing Middle School in this city has a good reputation and produces many talents. Sports stars such as Meng Yiliang, Tao Tingfu, Wang Jinghu, Wang Zhenglin, Guan Anda, and Wang Xuewu are all alumni. The school was successfully restored. Since Zhou Zenglin has been the principal, he has been actively building the school. However, funds are lacking.

The proceeds from the tickets will all be used to fund the construction of the school building.

### Ping Pong Finals Act V Shanghai Star vs. You Yi Tonight Finals Fourth Game Jingwu Narrowly Wins Green Team

The fourth game of the second Shanghai Ping Pong League's Top 8 Finals was held at 8:00 p.m. the night before at the Central Auditorium. The two-part champion Jingwu faced the fourth-part runner-up Green Team. There were more than 400 spectators. Jingwu has the ambition to win the championship this year and has great strength. However, it was greatly threatened by the new army Green Team that night, which was unexpected. When the battle started, Jingwu charged with the main force, unstoppable, and won three camps in a row. In the fourth group, Jingwu's all-around master Yang Kaiyun performed abnormally. Opponent Chen Yinzhou reversed the defeat and defeated Yang Kaiyun by three to two, which can be called a masterpiece. Yang's carelessness was defeated and almost affected the overall situation. In the fifth and sixth groups, the Green Team quickly caught up and won successively, tying the score at three each. In the final group, Jingwu relied on Gao Hongxing's steady shot and won Li Rongji, the Green Team's slicer, by three to one, laying the foundation for victory. As a result, Jingwu defeated the Green Team by four to three. The upset did not happen, which can be said to be dangerous.

Tonight from 8:00 p.m., the fifth game of the finals will be held at the original location. Shanghai Star will face You Yi. The referees are Chen Linsheng and Shao Yiyuan, and the record is Chen Zuguo. Shanghai Star has many talents, and You Yi is not its enemy. However, if they can deal with Shanghai Star with the spirit of the last battle against Hualian, there may be an excellent performance at that time. The results of the night before are as follows:

(Jingwu) (Green Team) (Score)

Zhang Fuwei Li Peiran Three——〇

Ouyang Wei Chen Yilong Three——〇

Chen Huiliang Wang Yishan Three——One

Yang Kaiyun Chen Yinzhou Two——Three

Xu Sunjia Qin Duyan One——Three

Han Dexian Dai Yixing 〇——Three

### Spinning Regulation Committee Gathers National and Private Yarn Factories to Thoroughly Implement Joint Distribution, Aiming to Eliminate Black Markets and Crack Down on Hoarding

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Spinning Regulation Committee has distributed cotton yarn for hoarding. Yesterday, China Textile Construction Corporation continued to distribute 301 pieces of yarn, all of which were distributed to the cotton yarn copying industry. A total of 147 purchase orders were submitted by various factories.

The committee wrote to continue to plan how to thoroughly implement joint pricing. With a view to jointly distributing the manufacturing industry, a small group meeting on the sales of finished products was specially convened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Currently, the temporary measure is that each national and private yarn factory provides 10,000 pieces of yarn for distribution, which must be paid in full before the 15th of this month. Before the joint distribution name is organized, the original staff of China Textile Construction Corporation will temporarily distribute and sell it according to the company's original sales method. As for how to make the yarn produced by national and private yarn factories be handed over to the joint distribution agency of the Spinning Regulation Committee, and how to supply and sell cotton yarn from other places, all must be stipulated from the beginning so that the implementation can be followed. The private factories mainly advocate joint pricing and individual distribution in order to maintain the business freedom of each factory. However, in order to implement the joint distribution system, the Spinning Regulation Committee allows private factories to take more responsibility for the organization of the future joint distribution agency, and even the distribution agency can be set up in the No. 6 District Cotton Textile Association. However, the joint distribution system must be thoroughly implemented. In short, under this basic distribution system, all yarn produced by national and private yarn factories is concentrated and distributed by the joint distribution Yangliu. Each yarn to be distributed must be approved by the Spinning Regulation Committee in advance to prevent abuses, and one distribution price will be used to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating black markets and cracking down on hoarding. It is reported that the opinions at yesterday's meeting were quite harmonious, and Gu's attending members expressed that the position of the Spinning Regulation Committee could be accepted for consideration. It is reported that important decisions on the detailed rules for the joint distribution system are expected to be made before the 7th of this month.

[Another News] According to relevant parties, after the government supplies cotton to Xingzongshi and imports 60 million U.S. dollars of foreign cotton in the first and second quarters, it will decide on new policies based on the results of the current cotton yarn regulation measures. It is reported that if the current joint distribution system is not ideal, the policy of spinning and weaving on behalf of the third quarter's quota import of foreign cotton may be adopted. At that time, the central government will supply raw materials and entrust each factory to spin cotton yarn on its behalf, and pay each factory reasonable unprofitability.

### Operators Stick to Old Methods, Pig Bristle Exports Are Sluggish, Hankou Goods Are Currently the Most Popular

It is worth paying attention to the sharp decline in our country's foreign trade. Taking the main export product, pig bristles, as an example, according to the famous manufacturers engaged in this business, such as Sichuan's Chang Chan, Chongde, Feng, and Heyuan, the export quantity in the previous month was only 15% of that in April, and the turnover in the previous month was rare. This phenomenon not only affects the national treasury's income, but also the international market position will gradually decline. The government authorities have long been concerned about this and have instructed the Central Trust Bureau to organize an export commodity price review committee to assist exporters.

According to the leader of the pig bristle industry, the sluggishness of our country's pig bristle trade is not only due to (1) high domestic costs, rising market prices, (2) rampant smuggling, and falling prices for dumping. (3) Overseas market prices have reached saturation, and buyers are difficult to turn good under the US government's price stabilization policy. The biggest knot is that the operators in our country (1) lack modern scientific methods in manufacturing methods, (2) their sales methods cannot grasp the psychology of those in need, and they simply follow the old ways, cut corners, and gradually reduce the past glorious history. If they do not seek thorough improvement, they will face a crisis of falling into decline. The most obvious phenomenon at present is: (1) The size is not standard enough, (2) The flexibility is not uniform, (3) The gloss is poor. In short, they are all too far away from using scientific methods. Among them, the most arduous flexibility test work often relies on experienced personnel to judge only by the feeling of holding it with fingers and palms. How can it maintain a permanent balance? Its failure can be known.

The most valuable of the seventeen types of pig bristles is the "No. 27 distribution box", and its size ranges from two inches to six inches. The best origin in our country is Tianjin, with long, moist, and extremely high-quality hair. Most of these goods are transported from the northwest, which is caused by the cold climate in cold regions. During the war, northwest goods were changed to enter Chongqing, creating Sichuan bristles, which were famous overseas. At that time, most of them were exported to the United States and the Soviet Union as military supplies for washing guns and mouths. After the victory, Hankou bristles were quite popular in the United States because of their uniform flexibility, so the current Chongqing goods only sell for 2.6 cents per pound in the United States, while Hankou goods sell for 3.3 cents. The spokesman also said that Americans are fickle and like the new and dislike the old. Now the raw materials for toothbrush bristles are often abandoning pig bristles and replacing them with artificial "nylon" finished products, which is another blow to the export sales of pig bristles in our country.

### Various Cotton Textiles Will Implement Price Negotiation

After the Textile Business Regulation Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs set new price negotiations for each branch of cotton yarn and implemented the cotton yarn joint distribution policy, the market will resume trading today and will buy and sell at a legal profit of 5% on top of the new negotiated price. It is reported that in order to stabilize the prices of general cotton textile products, the authorities will also stipulate negotiated prices for various cotton textiles such as cotton cloth shirts, socks, and towels based on the negotiated prices of cotton yarn and add reasonable profits so that merchants know what to follow.

If they exceed the negotiated price and attempt to obtain exorbitant profits, they will also be severely punished. This method is in preparation.

### Expansion of Universal Sale of US Treasury Bonds

Formal Treasury Bonds to be Printed by Early Next Month

The subscription tickets for U.S. Treasury bonds have recently seen a surge in sales. The fundraising committee has decided to continue expanding sales, with a large-scale campaign aimed at the general public across all social strata. The formal Treasury bonds are currently being rushed into print in Shanghai. Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, recently made another special trip to Shanghai to inspect the printing progress. It is expected that printing will be completed by early next month, and the subscription tickets originally issued will be exchanged. Once the formal Treasury bonds are issued, they may be immediately listed on the exchange's bond market to facilitate their use by holders.

### Cigarette Market Weakens

Yesterday, the cigarette market continued to show weakness. This was because the Economic Council had decided to begin a thorough investigation of prices today, which would impact speculators, causing anxiety. In addition, the banks' holiday period had ended, and those short on funds frequently resorted to selling off their stock, resulting in a step-by-step decline in quoted prices. Ten-cigarette packs of "British American Tobacco" (BAT) brands were traded extensively at prices as low as 7.28 million yuan. Twenty-cigarette packs of BAT brands were more resilient, and their base remained firm. In the afternoon session, retail sales showed slight movement, with ten-cigarette packs of BAT brands eventually recovering to 7.3 million yuan, a drop of 55,000 yuan from the previous day. "Old Knife" brand cigarettes also fell by 50,000 yuan to 6.3 million yuan. "Five Hua" brand cigarettes were reportedly being actively traded by foreign dealers, rising 30,000 yuan to 5.61 million yuan. "Haddemen" remained steady at 5.31 million yuan. Throughout the day, more transactions were conducted in domestic Chinese cigarettes, especially in the "Surprise" series. Due to reduced factory output and delays in delivery, the supply of these brands was tight, resulting in a particularly firm base.

Furthermore, American-made "Six Camel", "Marlboro", and other brands of packaged cigarettes, as well as fifty-cigarette tins of "Craven A" and "Three Fives", saw very little activity, with few buyers and a sluggish market. "Craven A" cigarettes could be traded for as little as 58,000 yuan, and "Three Fives" only attracted buyers at 50,000 yuan.

Yarn Sales by the "Spinning & Construction" Company

Yesterday, although the "Spinning & Construction" Company encountered the bank closing holiday for settlement, it still opened for yarn sales as usual. There were eight types of yarn available, with prices similar to those announced by the "Spinning Regulation Committee" on the 29th. Specifically, 10-count "Yang He" cone yarn was priced at 6,120 yuan (unit: 1,000 yuan); 16-count "Harvest Year" large package at 7,740 yuan; 20-count "Li Ma" large package at 8,800 yuan; 32-count "Xian Tao" cone yarn at 12,940 yuan; 40-count "Shi Guang" bundled package at 15,230 yuan; 42-count double-strand "Blue Phoenix" large package at 17,240 yuan; 60-count "Sunlight" cone yarn at 22,500 yuan; and 80-count double-strand "TK" multicolored ball large package at 49,500 yuan.

### Minor Fluctuations in Soap Prices

Yesterday, in the soap market for daily necessities, "Lever" medicated soap produced by the China Soap Company was in high demand due to the summer season, with brisk activity that surpassed "Huang Xiangmao" brand. Market sentiment was also buoyant. Quoted prices reportedly rose to 467,000 yuan per case, with very few sellers. Laundry soap saw some selling-off of old stock in the morning, causing prices to decline. The afternoon session was more active, with sporadic purchases. "Gu Ben" soap eventually recovered 10,000 yuan from the day before yesterday, reaching 470,000 yuan. "Arrow Knife" rose 5,000 yuan. "Huang Xiangmao" 220-bar cases also increased 10,000 yuan to 308,000 yuan. "Bai Xiangmao" 160-bar cases surged 45,000 yuan to 360,000 yuan. "Guang Hua" soap also rose 25,000 yuan. Other brands such as "Henry", "Cow Brand", and "Ding Feng" all rose between 20,000 and 25,000 yuan. The match market remained largely unchanged, with "Chicken Brand" wax candles standing firm at 280,000 yuan.

Kerosene Market. Transactions were generally stable, but with abundant inventory, selling-off continued. Prices were nominally stable but actually softening. "High-grade" barrel oil could be traded at around 150,000 yuan, while "Mobil" canned oil was at 97,000 to 98,000 yuan. However, the price of oil dregs increased slightly, ranging from 2,200 to 2,300 yuan per ladle.

Shortage of Oils and Fats Leads to Price Increases

The market prices of raw materials for soap and candles, such as asphalt and tallow, have been soaring recently, with increases of over 200% in just a few days, causing market confusion. According to industry insiders: the fats and oils business is normally slow during the summer months, with very sluggish transactions and reduced inventories at production sites. Soap and candle manufacturers have traditionally stockpiled enough raw materials before summer to last through the slow season. However, in recent years, due to the instability of the economic and social environment, this seasonal habit has been disrupted. New supplies must wait until after the autumn cool-down before they can be put on the market, while current inventories are dwindling, leading to price increases, competitive buying, and a speculative market, which is harming the public's livelihood.

### Calico Market Slightly Firmer

Yesterday, there was some activity in the cotton cloth market outside the venue, and calico was slightly firmer than before the break. The quoted price for 12-pound "Dragon Head" calico was 442,000 yuan, while bleached cloth, "Yuan Bu" and dark blue "Shi Bu" remained stable. The "Water Moon" and "Leaping Carp" bleached cloth supplied by "Spinning & Construction" the day before yesterday both saw price increases of 3,000 yuan. "Leaping Carp" gray raw twill increased by 4,000 yuan, while "Four Gentlemen" gold-seal "Yuan Bi" decreased by 1,000 yuan.

### Prohibition of Gold Imports Purchased with US Dollars; Hong Kong Government Controls US Dollars; Exporters to Face Significant Impact

(United Press Hong Kong, 2nd) Hong Kong has decided to make efforts to reduce the consumption of US dollars and, due to the increasingly serious global shortage of US dollars, has decided to make efforts to increase the available supply. The government has already promulgated a number of orders. It prohibits the import of gold purchased with US dollars, prohibits the public market from setting up US dollars as funds for imported goods, and designates several banks. 25% of the US dollars settled for certain exports should be available for government use.

Hong Kong's import and export trade in the five months of 1947 had more imports than exports, with a difference of approximately US$25,000,000, most of which was remitted in US dollars. Importers and exporters of goods imported from the dollar area have been warned by the government that due to the shrinking US dollar supply in Hong Kong, these expenditures will be more strictly restricted.

Up to now, the impact has been limited to items obtained from the United States, such as plastic products, radios, electrical supplies, lubricants, lighters, and similar miscellaneous items. The prohibition of gold imports held at the same time has the dual effect of reducing the consumption of US dollars and satisfying the Chinese government's protest that these goods are breaking through China's tariff barriers and being imported into China to evade taxes.

The recently announced stricter ban, which affects all exporters, is likely to be even greater. This ban stipulates that exporters of tung oil, tin, and rubber to the dollar area will sell 25% of the US dollar exchange settlement to the government at the official price of 4 Hong Kong dollars equal to 1 US dollar (the open market is 4.65 Hong Kong dollars equal to 1 US dollar).

Exports to the United States in the first five months of this year reached approximately US$10,000,000, accounting for 65% of total exports to the United States. Therefore, if the tung oil market is stable, the Hong Kong government is expected to earn a monthly income of US$500,000 from tung oil exports alone.

Some traders obtain US dollars by importing rubber from Malaya and re-exporting it to the United States, because rubber can be freely imported into Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong has already used a large amount of US dollars to pay for the cotton yarn sold by the Allied Headquarters and American commercial companies, merchants here expect that transactions in US dollars will be further restricted.

### Revival of Japanese Textile Industry; Hong Kong Merchants Worried

(United Press Hong Kong, 2nd) According to commercial sources, the recovery of private commerce in Japan from August 15 and the policies adopted by Japan when it re-enters the world textile market have caused anxiety among cloth merchants here. They are deeply afraid that Japan's recent monthly production of 1.4 million yards of cloth will be sold on the cloth market after accumulation. The Allied Headquarters' permission for Japan to overproduce has now caused the danger of a tragic price war. The only remedy is to distribute Japan's accumulated textiles for domestic consumption. In the past 18 months, Hong Kong merchants have exported a large number of textiles to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. It is reported that the region is now turning to Japan to order a large number of textiles.

### City Bank Establishes Fifth Office

The Shanghai City Bank was previously approved by the Municipal Government to establish a fifth office at 1124 Daming Road. It is now learned that the office has been prepared and will officially open tomorrow (4th). In addition to handling various banking businesses, it will also act as an agent for the Shanghai Municipal Treasury's revenue and expenditure matters.

### Cooperative Societies Illegally Engage in Deposit and Loan Business; Municipal Government Ordered to Ban Them

[Report from this newspaper] In order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures and strengthen the control of financial undertakings, the Ministry of Finance has designated Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, Jinan, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Suzhou, Yongjia, Kunming, and other seventeen regions as locations for restricting the resumption of business by commercial firms and the establishment of branch offices. However, the Ministry of Finance has recently received reports that many unscrupulous individuals in various places are openly engaged in ordinary deposit and loan business in the name of credit cooperatives, in order to circumvent regulations, hinder normal financial business, and greatly affect social and economic security. They are no different in nature from the "underground banks" that are established without authorization, and should be strictly banned in order to rectify the situation. After receiving the above instructions, the Municipal Government has issued orders to its subordinate units to handle the matter accordingly.

### Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Start Work on Schedule

[Report from this newspaper] The Sericulture Production and Sales Coordination Association has decided that all silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang must start work by the 15th of this month. Regarding the fuel, coal, and petroleum required by each factory, the association has listed the amount needed by each factory and the date of commencement of work reported by the silk reeling guilds in the three regions and sent them to the Fuel Management Committee and the China Petroleum Company, hoping that they will be approved and allocated quickly so that each factory can start work on schedule. In addition, the association has also telegraphed the Four Banks Joint Office to request that 84 billion yuan be approved and loaned in advance for the funds required for the commencement of work of each silk factory.

### Woolen Fabrics and Bedding Market Quietly Booming

Yesterday, the market for overcoat woolen fabrics was quietly booming, with both local and out-of-town merchants needing to purchase them. Fine-wool, high-quality floral woolen fabrics were also in greater demand than supply in the tea room market. Zhang Hua's merino wool fabrics were priced at 400,000 yuan per yard, with a 70% down payment required. The spot price was 370,000 to 380,000 yuan. Rainproof cloth was in demand in Guangdong and Guangxi due to the rainy season. Yesterday, more than 3,000 yards of white yarn twill were traded, purchased by Mai Qiangsi, who was commissioned by the Road Bureau to make uniforms.

### Fuel Subsidy Canceled; Fuel Management Committee Announces New Price; Adjusted to 540,000 per Ton

After the government decided to stop subsidizing public utilities, fuel prices were adjusted accordingly. It is reported that the new price of coal, which was approved by the Economic Department after being approved by the Fuel Management Committee, is 540,000 yuan per ton, and it took effect on the first of this month. This new price is based on the cost calculation and approval of the mine owners. The cost last month reached 450,000 yuan per ton, while the coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee to public utilities and transportation enterprises was only more than 100,000 yuan per ton, with the government subsidizing more than 200,000 yuan. The adjusted new price is actually the amount that the government should subsidize. Therefore, the adjustment of coal prices is by no means a general price increase. The increase of 540,000 per ton this time is only 90,000 more than last month, less than 15%. The Fuel Management Committee will continue to supply the needs of transportation and public utilities, and will also allocate coal to government employees and teachers.

### To Solve the Coal Shortage in Various Places, a Production Increase Conference Will Be Held

According to sources from the Fuel Management Committee: The coal shortage in Shanghai has not yet been resolved, and coal shortages have also occurred in various places. The reason for this is that coal is mainly produced in the Northeast. Under the current war situation, it cannot be transported out. If other measures are not taken to solve the problem urgently, the coal shortage will become even more serious. In order to solve the coal shortage, the Economic Department will convene representatives of coal mines from various places in mid-month to hold a "Coal Production Increase Conference" to find ways to increase coal production to meet the needs of the valley. The location of the meeting has not yet been decided, whether it will be in Nanjing or Shanghai.

### Spring Loan Collections in Zhejiang Province Exceed 90,000 Dan

[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou on the 2nd] The amount of collections from spring loans in Zhejiang Province this year is 91,059 dan, with a total loan of 106,963,984.375 yuan. Approximately 60,000 groups of silkworms were converted into raw silk due to the receipt of the loan. This is an increase of more than one-half compared to last year's production. According to Zhejiang Province, last year's production was 6,194 dan. Regarding the issue of poor germination of silkworm seeds from the Yunnan New Village Company, which caused severe damage to silkworms, it has been decided that the Zhejiang Sericulture Association and the China Sericulture Company will each pay 300 million yuan in compensation. The 300 million yuan from China Sericulture will be offset by this year's autumn seeds or next year's spring seeds.

### Survey of Cotton Merchants' Cotton Inventory in this City Shows a Total of Only 69,027 Dan

The Cotton Trade Association was recently ordered by Mayor Wu to survey the amount of cotton stored in various warehouses in the city, so as to provide a reference for the Spinning and Adjustment Committee. It is now learned that the survey has been completed. The total amount of cotton stored in the warehouses of various colleagues in the valley is 4,334 pieces of foreign cotton (including large and small packages), totaling 15,456 dan. The total number of domestic cotton (large and small packages) is 14,926 pieces, totaling 53,571 dan, for a total of 69,027 dan. According to Association Chairman Liu, the total amount of cotton stored has been sent to the Municipal Government. However, according to estimates by the Spinning and Adjustment Committee a few days ago, the cotton mills in the city need 30,000 dan of cotton per day, and the current amount is only enough for the yarn mills for two days of raw materials.

### Production Capacity of the Straw Hat Industry in this City Reduced Due to Lack of Raw Materials and Increased Costs

[Report from this newspaper] According to a survey by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: There are more than 80 member factories in the Shanghai Straw Hat Association, most of which are small-scale assembly plants, with 535 main operating machines. There are only 11 factories that have the full capacity to manufacture straw hats. Among them, the Xinhua Hat Factory, the Hua Chang Hat Factory, and the Da Lai Flannel Hat Blank Factory are the largest. In addition, there are about 20 factories that make flannel hats from hat blanks. The situation of the industry is summarized as follows:

(1) Production capacity: Approximately 550,000 dozens of flannel hats can be produced each year, but this year's output is only about 300,000 dozens. The reasons for the reduction are: (1) high interest rates, (2) high wages, (3) traffic obstruction, and (4) restrictions on the import of wool and rabbit hair. If there are no of the aforementioned four difficulties, and night shifts are added, approximately 1 million dozens can be produced each year.

(2) Sales: The flannel hats produced by the industry are sold in various ports across the country, especially in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and all factories feel that demand exceeds supply. In the past, flannel hats were also sold to Nanyang Siam and other places, but now it is difficult to compete with foreign goods due to the lack of raw materials and increased costs.

(3) Raw materials: According to the survey, the industry works for ten hours a day and uses 180,000 pounds of wool and 3,200 pounds of rabbit hair (or 10,000 pounds of rabbit skin) per month.

It was also found that there is a Da Lai Flannel Factory in the industry, whose exports are rabbit flannel products, and their quality is quite good. It was originally established by an American businessman, and was occupied by the Japanese after the outbreak of the Pacific War. After the victory, it was taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After being returned to the original owner, it was run jointly by the original owner and a Chinese national. It is the only rabbit flannel hat blank factory in the country. It has special machines, such as skinning and hair-taking machines, wool-flying machines, wool-carding machines, and wool-blending machines, all of which are made in the United States and can be used. However, the factory has recently been short of rabbit hair or rabbit hair skins (which are more cost-effective than rabbit hair) due to foreign exchange restrictions, and it is on the verge of shutting down. It is hoped that the Transportation Management Committee will consider the actual needs and maintain it.

### Food Prices All Fall Back

The grain market has turned soft because actual sales are light and there is little absorption. The association's set price is 660,000 to 670,000 yuan for Peruvian sand, 595,000 yuan for 20 medium sand white, down 5,000 yuan. Taiwanese rice is 560,000 yuan. Down 15,000 yuan. Oil rice opened at 420,000 yuan, down more than 10,000 yuan. Rice bran is 400,000 yuan, diao qing is 380,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan. Refined white is 560,000 to 550,000 yuan, and Xingchimen medium rice is 600,000 yuan. All down 10,000 yuan, a total of 370 pieces were traded.

### Shanghai Cement Company Holds Shareholders' Meeting

Li Bake, Chairman of the Shanghai Cement Company, held a shareholders' meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association the day before yesterday to discuss an increase in capital of 8 billion yuan. When the company resumed business in the past, its capital was 5 million yuan. This increase is 1,600 times the original capital. Its product, "Husheng" cement, is of excellent quality and has long been sold throughout the country. It is said that all departments in the factory have been reorganized and will be able to invest soon.

### New Golden Vegetables Will Appear on the Market

This year's new golden vegetables are more productive, and the inventory here is limited, so they are considered rare when they appear. Only a few dozen pounds of Xuzhou vegetables have arrived in Shanghai, which is not enough to be considered a regular market, and they are sold for 1.37 million yuan. It is reported that the price of Lianzhou mustard produced in Guangdong is 750,000 yuan.

### The Goal of the Shipping Association is "All within the Four Seas are One Family"

— Du Yong

Representatives of shipping industry associations from all over the country, holding the great ambition of developing the shipping industry and safeguarding shipping rights, have come all the way to Shanghai to participate in the founding conference of the China National Shipowners' Association (CNSA), and will then go to Nanjing to attend the National Shipping Administration Conference convened by the Ministry of Transportation. This is not only an unprecedented grand event in the history of China's shipping industry, but also a glorious page in the history of nation-building. As the chief representative of Shanghai, I would like to express my sincere welcome on behalf of more than 100 colleagues in Shanghai with an excited mood.

Confucius said: "All within the four seas are brothers." The vast seas and the crisscrossing rivers are the basis for human cultural exchanges and mutual assistance in life. In terms of national power: whoever can develop shipping and utilize the ocean will be strong and prosperous, and full of strength. My country's coastline stretches from the mouth of the Yalu River in the north to Dongxing in Guangzhou Bay in the south, including many islands, with a total of 10,333 miles, or more than 30,000 li. The inland waterways have a total of more than 100,000 li. In the past, they were not fully utilized and were bound by unequal treaties. Shipping rights have been trampled on for more than a century. It is really a disgrace to the Chinese people. Now that shipping rights have been recovered, the national fortune will eventually be revitalized. How to promote shipping construction, how to utilize rivers and seas, and even the public ocean, is really the sacred responsibility of our generation.

Although the situation since the restoration is extremely difficult; although the various problems facing us are heavy, it is the spirit of shipping that is strong, resolute, and far-reaching. We certainly hope that the government and all sectors of society will recognize the importance of shipping and provide special assistance and protection so that it can recover from the wartime destruction. At the same time, we should not ignore the important responsibility we bear for building and saving the country. We will never be isolated, nor will we be decadent. As the Western saying goes, "The crown of honor is woven with thorns." One point of effort, one point of gain. How can the thorns in sight hinder our progress! Only increase everyone's courage to fight. China's rivers and seas, and the world's oceans, are all gardens for us to cultivate. The birth of the Shipping Association—the great union of the national shipping industry—is a call to strengthen cultivation. As long as all within the four seas are one family, and we are in the same boat, will the success of China's preliminary goal of building 3 million tons of merchant ships be far away?

### Origin of Organizing the China National Shipowners' Association

— Du Yong, Xu Xueyu, Yang Guanbei, Qian Yongming, Lu Zuofu, Shi Fuchang, etc.

The shipping industry is a national and even international public utility. Rivers crisscross and oceans are vast. The exchange of culture and commerce depends on the communication of ships, which is related to the wealth and strength of a country. Most countries take shipping as the foundation of their country, and protect and assist it without reservation. Shipping merchants implement national policies and continue to move forward, thus forming a brilliant and glorious history. Our country was bound by unequal treaties, and shipping rights were lost, and the shipping industry was in decline for a century. Fortunately, our government and people continued to struggle unremittingly, and finally recovered inland river and coastal navigation rights. All Chinese people cherish shipping rights, and are even more obliged to build the shipping industry. Our shipping industry, bearing the burden of the restoration, shoulders the responsibility of revitalization, and should work together to vigorously develop, and seek convenience in water transportation internally, and seek the restoration of shipping rights externally. The tonnage of merchant ships has increased from the remaining 100,000 tons in the early days of the restoration to 800,000 tons. The organization of industry associations in various places is becoming more and more sound; the spirit of industry cooperation is becoming more and more vigorous. In order to strengthen the connection of the national shipping industry, unite the strength of the national shipping industry, promote the development of the shipping industry, and assist the government in the implementation of shipping policies, our association, etc., initiated the organization of the China National Shipowners' Association.

Representatives from various places held a founders' meeting in Shanghai on May 15th of this year. They were united in good faith and had the same idea. The purpose of the organization can be stated as follows:

(1) Concentrate the Strength of Shipping Merchants

The shipping industry has a long way to go. It is easy to carry on the past and open up the future. The isolated period of one industry and one place has passed. The era of scientific masses has arrived. There is a need for collective labor to replace the struggle of the lone army, and to unite the strength of the country to solve common problems.

(2) Promote Shipping Construction

The allocation of various ships nationwide, the distribution of shipping routes, the equipment of ports, and the storage and training of talents are all important goals of construction and the focus of the work of this association.

(3) Revitalize Shipping Industry Regulations

The shipping industry is an important social undertaking, and the relationship between the parties is extremely complex. All operations must pay attention to the spirit of the rule of law and scientific methods, in order to seek the revitalization of business management, the elimination of various bad practices, the development of the spirit of service, the reasonableness of maritime responsibilities, and the reduction of personnel disputes.

(4) Safeguard National Shipping Rights

Our country has just recovered its shipping rights. How to safeguard them and how to develop them, so that foreign ships no longer invade our inland rivers and coasts, and further develop overseas shipping, so that our national flag can be flown in the high seas, is an important topic for the national shipping industry.

(5) Connect International Relations

After the establishment of this association, it will work closely with shipping organizations of various countries in the spirit of equality and mutual assistance, participate in all international shipping conferences, and catch up with the world's standards in technology.

The tasks of this association are numerous. What is revealed here is just a brief overview of the main points. The Book says: "Be respectful in your work and harmonious with your neighbors"; a Western proverb also says: "Unity is strength"; our national shipping industry is united in one heart, determined to make all within the four seas one family, revitalize the great cause, and help each other in the same boat, protect shipping rights forever, and persevere. Please start from here!

### The Distinctive Characteristics of Shipping Industry Competition

— Li Yunliang

Since Queen Elizabeth used force to break the closed-sea policies of Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands at the time, countries have limited their control over the ocean to the extent of their territorial waters, namely the ocean within three nautical miles of the coastline. According to the theory of natural law and international law, the ocean beyond territorial waters should be the common property of mankind, which is the so-called high seas policy. To this day, the British still take pride in their Queen's famous saying: "The ocean and the air should be for the common use of mankind, and sovereignty over the ocean cannot belong to any country or private individual." Among the 138 million square miles of water on the globe, rivers, lakes, and marshes account for only one million square miles, and the area of territorial waters is also extremely limited. Therefore, the majority of the water surface is the high seas, which everyone can freely utilize. This kind of maritime freedom is the prerequisite for the expansion of the shipping industry and the development of civilization. Since the mercantile era of the 17th and 18th centuries, adventurous voyages and colonial companies have sprung up, and the tonnage of merchant ships has increased day by day. Although railways also rose one after another after the Industrial Revolution, waterways are more economical in terms of nature, engineering, distance, and investment. Taking coal consumption as an example: statistics show that railways require 0.066 pounds per ton-mile, while ships require only 0.029 pounds. Therefore, railways can only supplement waterways and cannot replace them. However, due to the vast scope of activities and low equipment costs of the shipping industry itself, its business nature is also what is called a "hollow business" - regardless of the number of goods and passengers carried, the cost of navigation is roughly the same. Therefore, it inherently has a high degree of competitiveness. Furthermore, due to commercial warfare, countries compete with countries, and companies compete with companies. As competition intensifies, profits inevitably decrease, and even losses occur, making it impossible to survive. When both sides are hurt, they cooperate to maintain freight rates. The history of the shipping industry over the past hundred years is almost like the warning sentence at the beginning of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms: "That which has long been divided must unite, and that which has long been united must divide." Division is competition; unity is cooperation. Moreover, as a general rule, cooperation is often a means of competition, such as uniting ships on the same route to cope with external competition, which is division and unity.

The most common form of competition in the shipping industry is price competition. For example, before the war, the ticket price for ships on the Shanghai-Taizhou route once fell to fifty cents per passenger, with shipowners providing meals and giving away a towel each. The freight rate for flour shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin once fell to three cents per bag, with shipowners bearing the cost of loading and unloading. The freight rate for miscellaneous grains from Shanghai to the United States also once had a record of four yuan per ton.

If a foreign ship joins the route, the original shipowners want to resist it. In terms of competitive strategy, there is a so-called Fighting Ship, that is, in addition to the original ship, one or several similar ships are equipped to sail at the same time, and the freight rate is specially reduced, so that all the goods and passengers that were intended to be shipped by the new company are seized. The new company, which is in its infancy and lacks strength, is bound to withdraw halfway or make concessions and negotiate.

The Deferred Rebate System is also a unique means of monopolistic competition. In order to maintain customers' exclusive shipment of goods and prevent them from declaring shipment on other companies' ships, a certain company or companies on a certain route can agree or state with customers: if all goods are shipped on the company's ships during the specified period (usually six months), the company will give a rebate of a certain percentage (usually 10%) of the freight paid at the end of the period. If the goods have been entrusted to other ships for transportation without the company's consent, no rebate will be given. There are also those who encourage customers to ship more goods without limiting the total number of shipments, and often adopt a progressive deferred rebate method, stipulating several levels of standards, such as giving a 10% rebate for a total freight amount of 5 million yuan during a certain period; giving a 15% rebate for 10 million yuan; and giving a 20% rebate for 15 million yuan.

Another method similar to the period deduction system is to sign long-term shipping contracts with customers to give them preferential prices and convenient procedures.

The above-mentioned competition methods have been implemented on the Yangtze River route, on the coastal routes, and on the Pacific and Atlantic routes. In addition, there are those who compete in service, such as handling pick-up and drop-off services, tidying up the stewards' services, booking tickets by phone, arranging sea, land and air combined transportation, and buying and selling goods on behalf of customers, etc., which are different from the struggle and crowding with the spirit of service.

Here, we should emphasize that unrestrained competition in the shipping industry can often weaken the strength of competitors, leading to mutual losses and the inability to extricate themselves. Moreover, competition in the shipping industry is not necessarily about the survival of the fittest, but often inferior ships take risks and make a small profit, causing good ships to suffer endlessly, just like the law of "bad money drives out good money" in economics. New and good ships are strongly structured, well-equipped, and cost hundreds of millions of yuan, while hiring excellent crew members, sailing according to scheduled routes, and ensuring safety and convenience naturally cost more. If someone disregards the overall situation of the shipping industry and only seeks personal gain, buys old ships that can barely sail for tens of millions of yuan, or even temporarily charters ships at a lower price, and joins routes with suitable or excessive supply and demand with simple equipment and inferior crew members, and lowers prices to compete for customers, because their ships are inferior and the capital is light, they can often fall to half price or less. The general customers only covet cheapness and disregard safety, and are bound to flock to them, while the original liner business is taken away by them and difficult to maintain. If it lasts for a long time, good ships will be replaced by inferior ships. This phenomenon is especially common in countries with an underdeveloped shipping industry like ours. This kind of competitive ships often appear on the near-sea routes of Shanghai, so new and good ships are as rare as phoenix feathers, not seen for years, which is really an internal cancer of shipping construction and should be treated urgently.

### Shakespeare's Translator

— Shi Ying

The Complete Works of Shakespeare's Plays (total of four volumes: Volume 1 Comedies, Volume 2 Tragedies, Volume 3 Problem Plays, Volume 4 Historical Plays) Translated by Zhu Shenghao Published by World Book Company

The thick three volumes of Shakespeare's complete works are placed on my desk. I stared at these huge volumes for a while, dumbfounded. Brother Shenghao's ten years of hard work have finally been published. My heart is full of mixed emotions of surprise, remembrance, and loss. I don't know whether I should recommend this great translation or introduce this unparalleled but obscure translator.

To borrow a common phrase, Shakespeare is too great, and I am too insignificant. There is no need to add more words to Shakespeare's lyrics that "cover the world and surpass the ages." Secondly, my English is simply a smattering. When reading Shakespeare's original works, I often have a sense of being unable to understand them. As for carefully comparing the original text with the translation to show that I am also a well-versed researcher, how dare I! However, considering that there have been many translations of Shakespeare's masterpieces, and Professor Cao Weifeng published a complete translation a year or two ago, I don't know which of Professor Cao and Brother Shenghao started translating Shakespeare's complete works first, nor do I know which of them spent more time. A fair criticism of the two translations requires literary experts and teachers who are well-versed in literature, and I, who am ignorant, am not allowed to praise or criticize them indiscriminately. However, my point is that if someone has long admired Shakespeare's masterpieces but has been unable to study the original text, Brother Shenghao's fluent and beautiful complete translation is worth recommending. Please read the translator's self-declaration to understand his painstaking efforts in translating (although the self-declaration is in classical Chinese, the play lyrics in the complete works are clear and colloquial):

The purpose of my translation of this book is, first, to preserve the spirit of the original work to the greatest possible extent; if I have to settle for second best, I must also use clear and understandable words to faithfully convey the meaning of the original text... I must make the author's intention clearly revealed and not obscured by obscure words. After translating each paragraph, I must first pretend to be a reader and check whether there are any ambiguous or unclear points in the translation, and I must also pretend to be an actor on the stage to examine whether the tone is smooth and whether the rhythm is harmonious. I often pondered over a word or sentence for days.

The above words are not at all boastful. Brother Shenghao is indeed a hardworking and extremely serious person. Now, facing this huge volume, I close my eyes, and the image of a gentle and refined young scholar still appears before my eyes: a tall and thin figure, a fair face, a gentle and silent demeanor, rarely saying a word or two, followed by a blush, he has an extremely introverted personality, not a celebrity but a typical poet. When he works and reads, he puts his whole energy into it, often forgetting to eat and sleep. Socializing and fame are not related to this indifferent poet.

A Silent Worker

Over ten years of translation work, what he has experienced are years of hardship and suffering! I remember that Brother Shenghao and I were classmates in middle school. Because he was two grades above me, we knew each other but were not familiar. After graduating, he entered Zhijiang University and always got the best grades. In the spring of 1935, I went to work at the editorial department of World Book Company, and only then did I meet Brother Shenghao again. At that time, we were all working in the English department, and the director was our old teacher, Mr. Zhan Wenhuhu. Brother Shenghao's writing desk was next to mine, and because of the connection in work, the manuscripts I translated and wrote were often handed to him before the ink was dry, and he would carefully correct them with a red ink pen. He was the most silent person in the office, often not saying a word all day long. When others asked him to chat, he would always respond with a kind smile, followed by a blush, and then it was over. His plan to translate Shakespeare's complete works began in the spring of 1935, and was encouraged by Mr. Zhan. However, he never let anyone know that he was trying to do this work. Others only saw him running to bookstores, diligently collecting various versions of Shakespeare's plays and books with commentaries, criticisms, and textual research from various scholars.

Meeting in Chaos, Only Carrying Shakespeare

When the August 13th Incident broke out, I took my family back to my hometown of Xinshi for the summer vacation, but I couldn't get out because of it, and temporarily took refuge in my old home. Then, the Japanese army landed in Hangzhou, and along the two railway lines, people were panic-stricken and made plans to evacuate. In mid-November, on a gloomy and cold afternoon, suddenly an unexpected guest came to visit my home. It was the tall and thin, refined Shenghao. Meeting in chaos, I was overjoyed. We talked for a long time before I learned that he had come here with his family to take refuge. The editorial department of World Book Company was in the Tilanqiao district. He said that on the eve of the storm, he had fled in a hurry in the middle of the night, leaving behind all his luggage, only carrying an original copy of Shakespeare's complete works and his own translated manuscripts. At the critical moment, he thought this was the most precious! I asked him what his plan was for the future. He said that he planned to move to the countryside for a short stay, and if life could be stabilized, he would concentrate on translating. We chatted happily, and he told me the whole process and plan of translating the complete works. In addition to admiring him, I had nothing to say.

The next time I met Brother Shenghao was in Shanghai, which had become an isolated island. Twice it was in Garden Village, and twice it was in the editorial department of the Sino-American Daily. At that time, he was a newspaper reporter who was fighting the enemy and puppets with paper bullets, and he was also the most capable assistant of Editor-in-Chief Zhan Wenhuhu. In casual conversations during occasional meetings, I learned that he still remembered the translation work, but he was too busy with official duties and had no spare time!

When the spare time came, an even more miserable reality was placed before him. That was the outbreak of the Pacific War. The Sino-American Daily was sealed up, and he lost his job. Because of his personality, he did not go inland with his friends, but stayed in Shanghai, hiding in a small room and starting the work of concentrated translation that he had long longed for. At that time, I lived in the countryside and lost contact with my old teachers and friends. I thought he had gone west, but I had no news of him and had no way to find out!

Closely Translating, Beset by Poverty and Illness

The next few years were the most difficult years. Almost everyone suffered physically and mentally and had a sense of "the sun is setting and the road is ending, what world is this!" In the summer of 1944, I joined a group of single porters and went from my hometown to Shanghai to contact the old residence of World Book Company to compile a few books, hoping to earn some money to make a living. I still remembered Brother Shenghao and his Shakespeare's complete works, so I asked the host of the book company about him. Who knew that they were not far apart. Brother Shenghao had not gone west, but was living in seclusion in his hometown of Jiaxing, continuing to translate, and writing to make a living, similar to my situation! To be honest, it was just as pitiful! I was very excited and wrote a letter to Jiaxing immediately when I got home. A few days later, a reply came, on a green-lined manuscript paper, which did not seem to be my familiar handwriting. The letter said that after he got married, he returned to his hometown and translated behind closed doors. The cost of living was increasing day by day, and the royalties were not enough to make a living. He was also suffering from lung disease and was now recuperating... In this chaotic and barren year, what could a kind-hearted man beset by poverty and illness talk about except letting hard work and tuberculosis torment himself? This reply must have been written by his wife. We did not communicate again. At that time, I was also on the verge of starvation. In order to save my wife and children from starvation, I was exhausted physically and mentally and forgot everything. Only the host of the book company unintentionally told me that Shakespeare's complete works were about to be finished, and only a few books were left when Shenghao recovered his health.

Brother Entrusted His Younger Brother to Complete the Manuscript in His Will

Victory came, the sky was bright, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. I came to Shanghai again and met Mr. Zhan Wenhuhu. When I mentioned Brother Shenghao, he said sadly that Shenghao had died of illness in Jiaxing in the winter of 1944. He only learned about it from the book company after he arrived in Shanghai. This news shocked me for a long time. The book company said that his translated manuscripts had been successively typeset, but the last few books were not finished after all. He left a will instructing his younger brother Wenzhen to complete them on his behalf. Wenzhen was in the same grade as me in middle school and also studied Western literature. He must be able to do it. Two years have passed since the victory, and these three thick volumes of Shakespeare's complete works have finally been published by the book company (the fourth volume of historical plays is still being translated). This is good news for the cultural circle, which is on the verge of death, but when I think that this is the culmination of a faithful and diligent man's ten years of hard work, and that he himself did not see its publication, isn't it extremely sad? Poverty and illness seem to be destined for Chinese cultural workers. Now that I see the complete works, reminiscing about Brother Shenghao, and thinking about my situation at that time, I really don't know where my tears should come from!

Brother Shenghao's wife wrote these few sentences in front of the book: "When he was critically ill, he also said that if he had known that he would not recover from his illness, he would have risked his life to translate it..." He is not only a faithful cultural worker, but simply full of the spirit of a martyr.

### A Pictorial History of the Sino-Japanese War

— By Liu Sui

Edited by Cao Juren and Shu Zongqiao, published by the United Pictorial Publishing House

The editors state: "This is a record of war."

War, especially the Chinese people’s resistance against Japan in the past century, is all too familiar to every Chinese person. For two generations, we have struggled in the torrents of suffering caused by war, swallowing countless sorrowful memories and lessons. Although the times have brought history into a new era, these memories and lessons are still worth pondering over.

As the editors quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt at the beginning of the book: "Although what we are writing is a record of war, we hope that it will shine forth the brilliance of promoting human happiness and fostering world peace." We should give the highest evaluation to war records written on this motivation. Although the book from beginning to end records nothing but national hatred and the nation's blood and tears – cruelty and destruction – these are all ugly, despicable, and brutal aspects of human nature. On the other side of this humanity is filled with kindness, beauty, and a sense of harmony surpassing the ego. We do not need to be afraid of the desperate sorrow of humanity exposed in these bloody historical pages. On the contrary, we should search from these records earned with the nation’s cross, for the reasons why the invaders lost their humanity, to understand the trajectory of our suffering, and strive from here to seek a foundation of freedom and peace for ourselves, our descendants, and all of humanity.

In the first chapter, "Introduction," the editors toll the death knell for the invaders. Ignorantly worshiping warriors and greedily drooling over the continent, nearly six or seventy years of education since the 19th century have led them all to the course of invading China. The illustrations collected by the editors in this chapter are obviously not rich enough. Ignorant palace worship, crazy shrine rituals, feudal and obscene geisha dances, primitive and arduous lifestyles – these are all psychological foundations for the invaders to be brave in going to war. It is at least a regret to omit them before the record of the job contention. However, one picture is very good. That is the countryside at the foot of Mount Fuji, a countryside where even the ridges and foothills are reclaimed as morning fields, but interspersed with factory chimneys. Can you say that Tanaka’s "Development of the Continent" memorial was due to the mere warmongering psychology of the warlords when industry and agriculture have been existing so disharmoniously on this limited and barren land?

The second chapter, "Prelude to Japan's Aggression," is actually the prelude to this Second World War. The editors objectively pointed out the evolution of the international situation surrounding the "September 18th Incident." They quoted Hitler's statement that "The League of Nations is a reed on the water," saying: "At that time, China was climbing on this reed, hoping to be saved by it." It is both grief and revelation. Re-reading this chapter in the face of reality, we feel that Beethoven's saying, "To complain and beg for mercy to people in a storm is the most clumsy thing in the world," contains infinite desolation and tragedy.

From the third to the ninth chapter, it records a long and tragic journey from the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident until Japan's collapse and surrender. The editors divided the eight years of arduous war into seven periods: from July 7th to December 1937, the battles of Nanjing, Wuhu, and Hangzhou; from January to May 1938, the battles of Jinpu, Lunan, Longhai, and Jiangnan; the Battle of Wuhan in the second half of 1938 and the guerrilla warfare in the northern battlefield. It is generally correct to divide these three periods into the first stage of the War of Resistance. Then, the battles of Nanchang, Changsha, Guinan, and northern Guangdong after the retreat from Wuhan from November 1938 to April 1940, and the battles in Hubei Province, the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian, until the outbreak of the Pacific War from May to December 1940, can actually be combined for the sake of the overall war situation. From January 1942, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, to the battles on the mainland battlefield and in the Burma region, until the various battles in the late stage of the War of Resistance in November 1944, it seems that it can be listed as the third stage of the War of Resistance separate from the above two periods. The various materials involved, such as international reactions, dynastic movements, and the situation of the enemy puppets, are rather brief, but the systematic description of the previous and subsequent battles is quite complete, and in several battles, the editors seemed to have experienced them personally, so there are some valuable anecdotes. The only shortcoming is that the area of the illustrations is larger, taking up too much space, and many admirable and tragic photos cannot be published. This book is named a pictorial history, but in fact, the text still occupies the main share.

The tenth chapter, "The Page of Victory," is the briefest part of the whole book, perhaps because it was printed earlier and there was not enough time to include a large amount of information. But we also hope that the record will end here, on the one hand, to let us permanently remember the hardship and solemnity of the great cause of the War of Resistance left by this album, and on the other hand, to allow us to vaguely smell a little of the lofty fragrance and warmth of the past in the boredom of reality.

Now someone has shouted the slogan "Face up to Japan after the war!" Can we be vigilant for our descendants and eliminate future aggressors from giving us a more tragic persecution? I would like to sincerely recommend this faithful "Record of the War of Resistance" to readers who have fully enjoyed the honor and comfort of victory.

### After Reading "Rainbow"

— By Dong

(1)

"Rainbow" by the Polish female writer Wanda Wasilewska is a masterpiece that has caused a sensation in the literary world. It has been praised by literary readers and has also been made into a movie, receiving the support and love of a wide audience.

The original author is the daughter of a revolutionary in New Poland. Later, she herself became a strong revolutionary. Her works are full of solemn, dignified, simple, and generous descriptions. At the same time, they show everywhere the spirit of heroic, brave, resolute, and optimistic.

The success of her works has long been established in the literary world.

Her writing life started very early. She wrote lyrical poems in high school, but they were not very successful. It was not until later that she wrote a program script for a workers' entertainment party and achieved great results, which solidified her determination to start her literary work.

Her life experience is rich. In her childhood, she worked with farmers in the fields and deeply understood the miserable lives of the farmers. During her school days, she was at the height of the revolutionary movement in New Poland. She was practically impacted by this wave, which further strengthened her soul. In the Soviet-German War, she personally abandoned her pen and joined the army... In her life experience, she fully realized the true meaning of the people.

Therefore, her works vividly express the descriptions of those real lives and become a modern famous writer of realism.

Her first book, "The Face of the Days," profoundly reflects the side of Polish lower-class society groaning, struggling, and fighting on the line of hunger and cold. Later works such as "Motherland," "The Earth in Suffering," and "The Flames on the Pond" are all mirrors reflecting social life. The publication of "Rainbow" caused an even greater sensation in the entire literary world, harvesting a

"Rainbow" is the crystallization of the author's personal observation, experience, and thinking in the blood and fire of war.

In terms of artistic writing, it is vigorous, prominent, authentic, and touching. It grabs the reader tightly with dramatic descriptions from the beginning.

The gist of this novel (which was also made into a movie script by the author) – that is, the source of its story – was frankly told by the author to an interviewer.

"In a village near the town of Iwalov, someone told me the story of an ordinary peasant woman whose name was Alexandra Daeleman. When the Germans occupied her village, she fled to the guerrillas and fought the Germans with them. At first, she cooked and washed clothes for the guerrillas, and later she was sent out to work as a scout, and she often provided a lot of valuable information. No one in the army ever thought that she was a pregnant woman. In order not to prevent her from taking on the most important work, she tried her best to hide her pregnancy, but as the due date approached, she decided to return to the village. For three days in a row, she successfully avoided the enemy, but on the fourth day, she was caught by the enemy. In the freezing weather, this woman who was about to give birth was stripped naked and forced to walk on the street in the middle of the night by the Germans, calling her to point out the families of the guerrillas.

"In the morning, the German soldiers beat her severely and locked her in a shed. She gave birth to a son there. The Germans began to torture her again, threatening to kill her son. She stubbornly resisted all the time. Finally, the Germans got annoyed, killed her son, and threw herself into the ice river."

Then, the author reported the source of her story:

"This woman's story deeply touched my heart. I was truly shocked by the ethical strength of these Soviet women. During this war, I had more opportunities to see the examples of these women. In the movie script I wrote, this sacrificed heroine, Alexandra Daeleman, is a protagonist, here renamed Orina. When I describe these heroines, I do not rely on any imagination. Almost every character is portrayed from real life."

The author used such a story as an example, plus her personal experience, to describe the deeds of a heroic and moving heroine.

Through her skillful literary techniques, these deeds were vividly reflected.

(3)

The Chinese translation of this book is also very successful. The translator, Mr. Cao Jinghua, was very dedicated when translating, and his writing was fluent. The original author also sent him a special telegram:

"Dear Mr. Cao Jinghua: I am paying attention to the great cultural work you are completing with admiration. I am very happy that even my works can contribute to the further consolidation of international literary ties. And to the Chinese friends and colleagues in the literary world, I extend my sincere respect! Faithfully yours, W. Wasilewska."

The value of the Chinese translation can be further proved by this.

Reading this work can increase our wartime knowledge, understand the wolfish hearts of the invaders, and learn the great patriotic enthusiasm of the resisters.

I hope that Chinese readers will all read this masterpiece (this book is written by Wanda Wasilewska, translated by Cao Jinghua, sold in major bookstores, priced at: 16,500 yuan)

### Rambling Thoughts in Solitary Berth

— By Wang Cong

A story I heard:

One day, Hitler, accompanied by Air Minister Göring and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, was driving a car when they were about to cross a bridge. A donkey was blocking the way in the middle of the bridge. Hitler originally wanted to rush over. However, the donkey was quite large. If the car had an accident and overturned off the bridge, it wouldn't be fun. So the leader first ran to the donkey and gave an hour-long violent speech. However, the donkey remained unmoved and stayed there. Hitler returned to the car dejectedly.

"My Führer, watch me," Göring excitedly walked to the donkey and shouted loudly, "If you ghost don't leave, I will immediately send three thousand planes to bomb you to death!"

The donkey leisurely remained motionless.

Finally, Goebbels went with great confidence. He grabbed the donkey's ear and said two words softly, taking less than a minute. The donkey desperately fled away.

The Führer and Göring were both surprised and asked Goebbels what reason made him triumph?

Goebbels smiled naturally and said, "I just said one sentence, 'Please join the Nazi Party.'"

### "Half Cunning, Half Foolish in Nature"

— By You Jin

In this day and age, it's really not easy to be a person. If you are too honest and straightforward, people will laugh at you as a fool; if you are too witty, people will scold you as cunning. Both foolishness and cunning are subject to criticism. So I thought of Huan Wen's wonderful words. "A New Account of Tales of the World" records that Huan Wen said to Gu Kaizhi: "There is half cunning and half foolishness in his nature." Lu Fangweng therefore has a line of poetry "People laugh that cunning and foolishness are both half." I don't believe there is really someone in the world who has half cunning and half foolishness. Who really has such a character split in half by a knife?

Cao Aman was the first cunning and quirky clever ghost in ancient times. In his childhood, he pretended to have a stroke, with a crooked mouth, to show his uncle who had repeatedly reprimanded him. The uncle reported to his father Cao Song, who was surprised and called Aman, but Aman was perfectly fine without any signs of illness. Song asked: "Uncle said you had a stroke, are you better now?" Aman said: "I didn't have a stroke, but I lost love from my uncle and suffered a curse." From then on, even if the uncle told Song about Aman's improper behavior, Song would not believe it. (See "Records of the Three Kingdoms, Biography of Wei.") This is the beginning of Aman's treachery, and this treachery is actually derived from the nature of cunning. This kind of "cunning," if developed, is great treachery, which is certainly not good.

But sometimes, in order to defend oneself and avoid disaster, cunning is indispensable. Also an event during the Three Kingdoms period: "Jia Xu was defeated at Yi, and met rebels on the road. Dozens of people traveling with him were all captured. Xu said, 'I am the nephew of Duke Duan. If you bury me separately, my family will surely redeem me generously.' At that time, Grand Commandant Duan Ying had long been a border general and his prestige shook the western land, so Xu used it to scare the Di. The Di people did not dare to speak, made an alliance and sent him away, and the rest all died. Xu was not Duan's nephew, but used power to save the situation. They are all of this kind." (See "Book of the Later Han.")

This is also a kind of cunning, but a cunning that does not harm righteousness, a forgivable cunning. Although it is lying, it is not a crime, because it is due to self-defense out of necessity. If cunning is permissible, we would rather take Jia Xu's cunning than Cao Aman's kind of cunning.

There are many examples of foolishness. The ancients called it foolish loyalty and foolish piety, and today people mostly praise beautiful straightforwardness and belittle intelligence. Unfortunately, few people can actually practice it. Being wise and protecting oneself, being hypocritical and evasive, still not daring to speak or scold about everything unreasonable, or even keeping one's mouth shut, following the old ways and compromising, thus preventing the society from having any signs of progress and clarity.

Seeing injustice on the road and drawing one's sword to help is a kind of bluntness, and also a kind of foolishness. Foolish bluntness is an indispensable character. If there are no foolish blunt people to do it, the world will be afraid of this injustice and continue to be dark and hopeless, and it will become worse. There are not many famous foolishly loyal people in history like Ji An of the Han Dynasty. Zhu Yun's "willing to be granted the Shangfang sword to chop off the head of a treacherous minister," and later "climbing and breaking the palace railing," can also be considered foolish enough. Although it did not save the decline of the Han surname, it is still considered loyalty, and it is still considered blunt, which is much stronger than the selfish and self-serving old men and hypocrites who only care about personal enjoyment.

If "half cunning, half foolish" can be established, I would rather people's "foolishness" be more than "cunning." In other words, it is better to lose to "foolishness" than to lose to "cunning."

### Caring for the Young and Supporting the Elderly

— By Heizi

If one has a penchant for textual research, one can cite historical facts to say that respect for the elderly and honoring the worthy has always been an ancient custom. Recently, I heard that the local authorities of this city intend to formulate measures to respect the elderly and honor the worthy, and will form a committee to plan matters related to this. What is "elderly" and what is "worthy"? It is said that definitions have already been made. All citizens of this city who are over seventy years old and of good character are called the elderly. Those who are highly respected and over fifty years old, and whose works or careers are worthy of emulation and can be models for citizens, are called worthy. The former is a general survey, and the latter is recommended by representatives of the district residents. This is indeed a "virtuous" policy.

Respect for the elderly and honor for the worthy are naturally beyond doubt. This kind of movement that implies both praise and criticism in respecting the elderly and honoring the worthy may be hoped by those who plan it to benefit the world and people's hearts and improve social morality.

Originally, "It is rare to live to seventy in life," especially in this "crowded" and "chaotic" city. Being able to survive for seventy years in bacteria, filth, war, and poverty is indeed the most resilient life, worthy of both respect and admiration. As for the worthy who are highly respected and have careers worthy of emulation and can be models for citizens, they are probably close to social "celebrities" and have probably already been respected and admired. Similarly, the elderly who are healthy are generally in a good environment. Then, with many children and grandchildren, they are already both respected and filial.

Therefore, it is more meaningful to care for the young and support the elderly than to respect the elderly and honor the worthy. As the saying goes: Love my young and extend it to the young of others, and support my elderly and extend it to the elderly of others. Caring for the young and supporting the elderly is actually more practical with immeasurable merit than respecting the elderly and honoring the worthy. Especially in today's society, where there are many cases of the elderly dying in tidal flats and the young begging in the streets, caring for the young and supporting the elderly is urgent. Providing them with relief in terms of food and clothing is in any case more valuable than holding meetings, banquets, sending plaques and rewarding objects to the elderly and the worthy. As for the "elderly" and the "worthy," giving them honor in addition to honor, even if it is not considered meddling, may not be valued much. However, those who are cared for and supported will inevitably feel boundless gratitude and never forget it.

Therefore, when the authorities are planning to "respect the elderly and honor the worthy," we earnestly hope to draw their attention to it and first "care for the young and support the elderly," dear sirs!

### "Prenatal Education" — One of the Random Records of Nostalgia in a Chaotic World

— By Ying

There are a few famous sayings: "The children of the poor wander the streets with messy hair and dirty faces, and the children of the rich turn around at home in demonic shapes, delicate voices, and delicate airs, all turning around in society in a dark and chaotic way, just like their parents, 'or even worse'." (See "Hot Wind.") If future generations are the same as or even "worse" than their predecessors, the world will naturally be even more unsightly, and people's hearts will become more inclined to "admire the ancient," so we should think of a way to reverse the decline, so that there will be more Auntie Qijin and fewer Miss Jiujin in society. The solution in the stationery store is: Everyone uses a brush, and "the national essence can survive"; the inventor of pills for the special treatment of spermatorrhea is: Everyone should swallow spermatorrhea pills, patients can be treated, and non-patients can be prevented, "the people will become stronger, and the country will have more hope"; in addition, scholars, professors, celebrities, and bureaucrats... have all opened many prescriptions, and they are all confident that it is absolutely necessary," but unfortunately, there are too many prescriptions, people's hearts are chaotic, and the children are still turning around in the country, even "worse" than before. The particularly large number of corpses of street children buried and cremated in Pushan Villa in March and April this year is clear proof.

"Nurturing you and raising you has benefited you." Children naturally belong to the nurturers as usual, with no room for protest. Because, towards the stronger, the cowards do not draw their swords against each other, but only towards the children, they are particularly brave, either glaring, roaring, or whipping, all without exception. Mr. Lu Xun said in his article "Children in Shanghai": "In China, middle-class families generally only have two methods of teaching children." These so-called "two methods" are: first, teaching children to be spiders in a web; second, teaching children to be small birds in a cage. Spiders dominate by building webs, and birds chirp sweetly, but outside the web and cage, they all become cowards like their nurturers.

Does this make us think more of the kindness of the ancients? Yes, but it is really not easy to be an ancient person. As a prince, even in the womb, his mother had to suffer the following hardships:

"When the queen was seven months pregnant, she went to the banquet room. The Grand Historian stood with a copper object on the left side of the door, and the Grand Steward held a dipper on the right side of the door. The Grand Diviner held a turtle shell under the hall, and all the officials guarded the inner part according to their duties. After three months of no enjoyment, if the queen sought sounds other than ritual music, the Grand Historian would cover the zither and say he was not familiar with it; if she sought flavors other than the correct flavor, the Grand Steward would rely on the dipper and dare not fry or season, and would say, 'I dare not use it to wait for the crown prince.' When the prince was born and cried, the Grand Historian blew the copper object and said, 'The sound is in a certain pitch,' and the Grand Steward said, 'The taste is above a certain pitch.' The Grand Diviner said, 'The life is in a certain state.' Then, a bow would be hung for the prince's body... " (From "Da Dai Li Ji Bao Zhuan Pian")

Under such prenatal education, the queen could only eat square meat, take square steps, and sleep square sleeps. If she was not careful, people would use the future crown prince to ask her to "take care of herself." I think the crown prince was unharmed after leaving the womb because of the queen's virtuous actions; otherwise, the queen would have had to suffer even more hardships. As for the prince himself, of course, it was even more miserable. Even the crying sound was not very natural. There are still the following sentences in "Bao Zhuan Pian":

"In ancient times, at the age of eight, they went out to the outer house to learn small skills and to practice small rituals! They tied their hair and went to university to learn great skills and to practice great rituals. When they lived, they treasured ritual literature, and when they walked, their jade pendants jingled, and when they got into the carriage, the sound of the luan bells was harmonious, so there was no way for deviant thoughts to enter... "

Deviant thoughts are actually "evil thoughts." Learning ritual literature and sounding jade pendants also means wanting him to be "kind." It would be better if he could become a piece of wooden furniture. Using "Why don't they eat meat porridge?" to answer the common people's loud cries of hunger is the prototype of ancient emperors.

Everyone feels that turning around is much worse than sitting still on the floor. The reason may be that prenatal education has not been promoted and rituals have been lost. So, if you want children to be quiet and look like something, there is a way to do it, just do it according to what is recorded in "The Book of Rites."

### American Miscellany

— By Xu Shutuan

The Lack of Spittoons in America

People who come to America for the first time feel quite inconvenienced by the lack of spittoons. Therefore, they want to buy a spittoon in the market, but they cannot find it after exhausting their search. Americans simply don't know what a spittoon is. No wonder that in the era of Sun Yat-sen, an old diplomat suddenly had a thick phlegm rising when attending a grand banquet, and in a moment of urgency, he had to use a glass as a spittoon. Americans cough and spit phlegm in the same way, but they don't spit phlegm casually, but choose a place to spit it. When walking on the road, you can still see Americans spitting phlegm, even urinating, and even women urinating on the side of the road, but with female companions forming a screen of flesh to cover their shame.

The place they spit phlegm is the toilet and the sink, but I have never seen anyone spit phlegm into a handkerchief. This is the style of high-class Chinese. American women carry Kleenex (thin gauze paper) with them. Kleenex has a wide range of uses. It can be used as a handkerchief, a powder puff, toilet paper, and also to spit phlegm. Kleenex costs one dime per box, and the military camp store sells it for only seven cents, which is much cheaper than using cotton or a handkerchief. Because Kleenex is cheap, women use it to wipe their leather shoes and spit phlegm. Our China needs Kleenex very much. When you walk through North Sichuan Road or Nanjing Road Bund, the ground is full of phlegm, almost becoming a phlegm world, and there is nowhere to set foot. The Municipal Council should send out a large number of cleaners to carry out daily phlegm-sweeping operations. The root cause is still clearing heat and eliminating phlegm. If the atmosphere is heavy, phlegm disease is inevitable. (9)

Scientific Essays

### The Science of Dreams (4)

— Gu Junzheng

What are children's dreams like?

Children's dreams are simple and genuine, not very symbolic, because children do not need to disguise their inner desires. But when they reach their teens, they gradually tend to examine their inner feelings, and their dreams become almost as symbolic as those of adults.

Children's dreams often involve seeing their parents, playing games, eating favorite foods, receiving gifts, or being chased by animals.

Do blind people see things in their dreams?

They absolutely can, unless they were born blind. People who are born blind primarily have dreams based on touch, with few visual dreams. However, there are a few cases where they can see things, but what they see are all things without concrete images, usually of a nightmare nature.

Can science probe into other people's dreams?

Yes, it can. Professor L.W. Max of New York University has studied the dreams of deaf-mutes. Deaf-mutes use sign language. When they dream, they move their fingers, sometimes expressing complete language, so a person who understands sign language standing by can really follow their dreamscape.

Can dreams predict the future?

Some authoritative scholars admit the existence of so-called "prophetic" dreams. However, there are many theories, the most popular explanation involving the phenomenon of so-called special senses. It is said that some people have a talent that allows them to read or know things without the use of the five senses.

However, most authoritative scholars take a skeptical attitude towards this so-called prophetic dream. The great psychologist Adler (AirxodAdler) studied many examples of seemingly prophetic dreams and found that dreamers are invariably in a state of anxiety, and he believes that this anxiety causes them to dream that the things they are worried about have already happened. Other skeptics believe that such dreams are largely coincidental; with thousands upon thousands of people dreaming of future events, it is only natural that some people's dreams will coincide with actual experiences.
