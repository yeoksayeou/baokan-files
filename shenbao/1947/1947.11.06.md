### U.S. State Department Officially Announces: Relief Grain to be Shipped to China by Month's End; Qiantang Seawall Bureau Receives U.S. Relief Funds

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 4th] The State Department announced today that, according to the terms of the relief agreement signed between China and the United States on October 27, 1947, $27.7 million has been allocated under the U.S. foreign relief program to purchase and transport urgently needed relief supplies for China. The current plan stipulates the supply of 50,000 long tons of wheat and 43,000 long tons of rice allocated by the United States, as well as nearly 30,000 long tons of rice allocated by Siam. The remaining portion of the plan largely consists of medical supplies. The procurement of wheat and rice is already underway in the United States and is expected to begin shipping around the end of November. The procurement of rice in Siam will be handled by the U.S. Materials Lending Corporation, entrusted by its agent in Bangkok on behalf of the State Department. China's need for grains is very large, and it is feared that the above plan will not be able to meet China's total needs. Therefore, for maximum effectiveness, the general plan will distribute the U.S. grain supplies mainly in coastal cities. In this way, rural areas that grow grains will not have to transport large quantities of their local produce to urban centers, but instead can meet their own urgent needs.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] U.S. State Department officials said that they have not yet decided which coastal cities in China will immediately receive U.S. relief supplies under the Sino-U.S. agreement. However, it is understood that Shanghai will be included in the prepared list. They also said: "Medical relief supplies shipped to China under this plan will be largely limited to currently manufactured treatments, such as sulfa drugs and penicillin, rather than various vaccines that China can already manufacture and supply."

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] Although the U.S. has not officially stipulated that the Chinese Communists cannot receive allocations of U.S. relief supplies to China, the fact that most of the supplies are intended to be shipped to Chinese coastal cities indicates that they will be exclusively for the National Government.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] The Qiantang Seawall Engineering Bureau will receive US$2.5 million in relief funds, which are being provided by the American Government's China Relief Organization in accordance with the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement. According to Shao Huan, Secretary of the Relief Organization, he has come to Hangzhou specifically to inquire about the needs of the Seawall Engineering Bureau. According to the Bureau's five-year plan, it is necessary to repair 3,300 meters of collapsed stone seawall, complete navigation, and expand land by 400,000 mu, which will cost approximately US$6.5 million. After negotiation, US$2.5 million has been allocated, and the organization has decided to use US$1 million for navigation expenses and US$1.5 million to repair the collapsed stone seawall. The technical issues of the allocation of funds will be discussed by the Secretary and Mr. Mei, the engineer stationed at the Seawall Engineering Bureau by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, in the next few days. It is reported that, with the exception of a small amount of fuel, the remainder will be in cash.

### China's Existing U.S. Dollar Reserves Total Approximately US$340 Million; Report by the World Food Conference

[United Press, Washington, 4th] The World Food Conference, which began its first meeting on the 4th, has had a research report prepared by representatives from eighteen countries. The report points out that the funds immediately available to China amount to only US$87 million, plus other officially held gold dollars and dollar securities, amounting to no more than US$340 million. The report indicates that China has a monthly shortage of US$3-4 million. The study, which includes most countries, was prepared by members of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and its estimates of the gold and dollar positions of each country are as of November 1. The estimates are based on a country's actual trade balance with another country, or a country's trade with the United States, or a country's individual balance of payments with certain specific countries. The report specifically points out that China's existing funds available to pay for all imports are only sufficient for three months, and that other available funds are only sufficient for a few more months. The report estimates that China's monthly food imports amount to US$2 million, which can be covered by existing funds for 42 months, while other funds can only provide for 170

### Congressman Judd Returns to the U.S. via Japan; Talks About Japanese Security in Tokyo; U.S. Newspaper Praises Senator Vandenberg's Call for Aid to China

[Our Newspaper Report] U.S. Congressman Judd, having completed his data collection trip to China, took a Northwest Airlines flight yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. to return to the U.S. via Tokyo. Mr. Judd stayed in China for over ten days and had extensive contact with both public and private sectors. The individuals he met with in Shanghai were all introduced by the U.S. Consulate General, and their names were kept strictly confidential. However, it is understood that in addition to U.S. business leaders and Chinese financiers, there were also many people from the church and medical communities, as Mr. Judd himself is deeply interested in these areas.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th] U.S. Congressman Judd, returning to the U.S. from China, made a brief stop here today and made a statement saying, "If Japan's security is threatened by the Soviet Union, it will have no chance to become an independent and democratic country. We should enable Japan to become an independent, self-sufficient, and democratic country. This is what the American people want."

[United Press, New York, 5th] The Howard newspaper group praised Senator Vandenberg's view that world problems should not be treated separately, only providing aid to Europe without considering aid to China. The newspaper said, "We have repeatedly reminded the government authorities that avoiding publishing a plan to aid Britain is shortsighted and may even hinder their Marshall Plan. Obviously, Congress will demand that Truman and Marshall determine a proactive policy before allied China is completely destroyed by Red aggression."

[U.S. Information Service, New York, 5th] The New York Herald Tribune commented on the situation in China, saying, "Although the government army's sabers are superior to those of the Communists, they have still not been able to win a single victory. The main reason is that the government is unpopular in most areas. The reason for the government's defeat in the Northeast is not the strength of the Communist Party, but that the people of the Northeast see no reason to show enthusiasm for the Nanjing government. However, this fact does not mean that China has no hope of escaping the Communist dictatorship, nor does it mean that everything in the current government is bad. There are also some in high positions in the government who are first-class in all aspects and undoubtedly honest. If all the corrupt officials in the government can be imprisoned and the virtuous and honest people are given more power, then the threat of the Communist Party in China will not be as serious as it is now."

### Hu Shih on U.S. Aid to China: Says Willkie's Attitude is Serious

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] Former Ambassador to the U.S. Hu Shih recently published an important commentary in Beiping, reminding the U.S. that loans and aid to China should not harm China's national and ethnic dignity, and opposing MacArthur advising on Chinese affairs. Finally, he suggested that Chen Guangfu, trusted by the U.S., should be in charge of the management and distribution of the loan, instead of other guarantees. Mr. Hu said, "Willkie believes that China should be helped and is worthy of help, and his attitude can be described as extremely serious. As for whether the amount of the loan he proposed is sufficient, it remains to be studied by experts."

### National Judicial Administration Review Conference Opens: He Chongshan Reads the Chairman's Instructions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The National Judicial Administration Review Conference opened at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th in the auditorium of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Over a hundred members, officials, and guests attended. Before the meeting, President Zhang Qun delivered a speech, saying that he had been in politics in the central and local governments for more than ten years and had always encouraged his colleagues to "respect the law and be pragmatic." Now that the country has embarked on the path of democracy, the rule of law is indispensable. The government's responsibility lies in implementing and enforcing the law, and the cultivation of the spirit of the rule of law throughout the country depends on the efforts of judicial colleagues. Since the abolition of consular jurisdiction, we have been completely equal in law externally, but in reality, China's judiciary is still backward. The organization, equipment, and prison management of courts at all levels are inferior to others and need to be reviewed and improved. Mr. Zhang praised the dedication and integrity of judicial personnel and repeatedly expressed his encouragement and wished the conference success. After Mr. Zhang's speech, he left the meeting to attend the Central Political Committee.

### Xie Guansheng's Opening Speech Encourages the Spirit of Service

Minister Xie Guansheng chaired the review meeting and delivered an opening speech, first expressing his condolences, encouragement, and welcome to the heads of the high courts from various regions, and then expressing his respect for the legal personnel who had died in the war. He then discussed the purpose of the conference, which was to bring together experts engaged in judicial practice and theoretical research to jointly review the past successes and failures of judicial work and the reforms that should be carried out in the future, based on the principle of considering both ideals and facts, and to discuss and decide on practical and feasible plans. This is the second national conference related to the judiciary, the first being the National Judicial Conference held in the autumn of 1935. The five goals listed in the declaration at that time have been largely achieved after twelve years of effort: Judicial independence, fully funded by the national treasury since 1941, with a proportional increase in the budget each year; The establishment of a legal research institution, the Legal Research Committee of the Judicial Yuan, has been established since the last meeting; The improvement of court organization, with more than 400 courts and more than 600 county judicial offices established in the past ten years; The improvement of legal education, with almost all universities in the country having law departments, and restrictions on student quotas have long been lifted; The abolition of consular jurisdiction, which has been gradually abolished since 1943 to the present. He believes that these gains are still far from ideal, and due to changes in the times and the destruction of war, new shortcomings have also been discovered. This conference should collect opinions from all sides on trials, procuratorates, administration, and prisons, and jointly seek to increase efficiency, make up for shortcomings, and strive to move forward. Finally, he emphasized the encouragement of the spirit of service and encouraged his colleagues to pay attention to the four things: the spirit of revolution, integrity, research interest, and diligence. After Mr. Xie's speech, Secretary-General He Chongshan of the conference read Chairman Chiang's instructions (see lower right corner).

### Ju Zheng and Xu Shiying Call for Pay Raises for Judges

Subsequently, Ju Zheng, Wang Yunwu, Jiang Yong, Xu Shiying, Lou Tongsun, Zhang Zhiben, Xia Qin, and others delivered speeches, all emphasizing the importance of the judicial undertaking and making various suggestions. Ju Zheng and Xu Shiying both called for the status and treatment of judicial personnel to be improved. Mr. Xu also suggested that the judicial authorities should ensure that the salaries of judicial officials are higher than those of administrative officials when formulating the budget for the coming year. He will do his best to support this, as those who cannot guarantee their own livelihoods cannot wholeheartedly guarantee the safety of the national human rights, lives, and property. Wang Yunwu suggested paying attention to prison labor, which can save national funds and enable prisoners to acquire life skills to rehabilitate themselves. Jiang Yong called on judicial personnel to automatically unify their steps, not to be afraid of the strong, and advocated expanding the powers of high courts and high prosecutorates, paying attention to assessment, improving the system, and increasing efficiency. Lou Tongsun, representing President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, asked judicial colleagues to pay attention to legislative obstacles they encounter at any time with a spirit of courage and assist the legislative authorities in formulating and passing applicable laws. Finally, Zhu Xianwen, a consultant to the Ministry of Justice, who was present as a member, gave a reply, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. Minister Xie hosted a banquet for all members at noon.

### First General Assembly in the Afternoon: Consultant Pound Delivers a Speech

The first general assembly was held at 2:00 p.m., with 105 members present. Chairman Xie Guansheng first decided to divide the 552 proposals into four groups for review: System, Law, Personnel Accounting Statistics, Prisons and Others. Then Consultant Pound was invited to deliver a speech on "Modern Judicial Problems," which was translated by Yang Zhaolong, Director of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Law. However, due to time constraints, only about half of the entire topic was covered. Then the heads of the four high courts of the capital, Sichuan, Liaoning, and Jilin made work reports, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.

### Chairman Chiang's Instructions to the Judicial Administration Review Conference: Points out that a Country Ruled by Law Must Have Three Basic Conditions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The original text of Chairman Chiang's instructions to the Judicial Administration Review Conference is as follows: To implement constitutional government, the rule of law is of paramount importance, and the promotion of the rule of law should be centered on the judiciary. At a time when the new constitution is about to be implemented, it is necessary to gather senior judicial administrative personnel from across the country in one place to review the past, plan for the future, and seek reforms in the judiciary. In the past, our country suffered from the constraints of consular jurisdiction by the great powers, which led to the obstruction of the exercise of judicial power and the infringement of national sovereignty. After 1933, legal rights were fortunately recovered one after another, and our government's many years of movement to recover legal rights finally succeeded. This has special significance and is very gratifying in the judiciary. However, we should also reflect on the fact that the reason why legal rights could not be recovered for so long in the past was that the great powers always used the poor judicial system and prison system of our country as an excuse. Regardless of whether their criticism is correct, now that legal rights have been completely recovered, we must make the greatest determination and the best efforts to seek thorough reform of the judiciary, so as to adapt to the needs of national construction internally and refresh international impressions externally. Our country was founded on the Three Principles of the People, and the implementation of the Three Principles of the People must rely on the law, and the execution of the law must rely on the judiciary. Therefore, the judiciary is the most important department for promoting the rule of law and implementing the principles. We can also say that the purpose of the National Revolution is to build a country ruled by law based on the Three Principles of the People. The construction of a country ruled by law must have three basic conditions: First, there must be a perfect law. Since the establishment of the National Government, various laws and regulations related to the judiciary have been promulgated one after another, in a comprehensive and grand manner. However, whether they fully comply with national conditions and social needs, and whether there are any inconsistencies or difficulties in implementation after implementation, judicial personnel should use their professional expertise and practical experience to study their advantages and disadvantages, and put forward concrete opinions for the reference of legislation, so as to make the spirit of legislation and the judiciary consistent, and achieve the effect of promoting and maximizing benefits. Second, there must be sound law enforcement personnel. If there is a law but no one to govern it, even if there are good laws and good intentions, they will not be put into practice. Therefore, Mencius said: "A law cannot be enforced by itself." Judicial personnel are responsible for enforcing the laws of the country and must be prudent and fair, based on impartiality and sincerity, and sincerely relieve people of pain and reduce litigation burdens. In hearing cases and dismantling prisons, they must be reasonable and reasonable, and in line with the provisions of the law, that is, take into account the three aspects of reason, emotion, and law. It should be known that the highest ideal of the Three Principles of the People is the harmony of emotion, reason, and law. Nationalism is based on emotion, democracy is based on law, and people's livelihood is based on reason. Only when the three are mutually harmonized can a perfect and ideal society be created. Knowing this, and then applying the law, can the most just judgment be obtained. Third, there must be law-abiding citizens. In the past, our country was bound by unequal treaties, which caused great damage to national laws and social order, which led to the weakening of the general social concept of the rule of law and the spirit of law-abiding. This is a major obstacle to building the rule of law. Eliminating this obstacle depends on the efforts of various departments of the country and all aspects of society, and judicial personnel are always close to the people and solve disputes for the people. They should pay special attention to publicity, subtle influence, and make the general society develop the habit of the rule of law, and everyone regards respecting the law as an obligation and abiding by the law as morality. Only then can the promotion of the rule of law be expected to be rapid and widespread.

### Announcement of the Democratic League (Continued from page 1)

The China Democratic League has consistently advocated democracy, peace, unity, and unification. Unfortunately, the war is escalating, and its members are deeply saddened and have no room to serve the country. Recently, the government declared the Democratic League an illegal organization and banned its activities. Its members are unable to carry out any activities. Huang Yanpei, a standing committee member, has been publicly recommended to represent the members and go to Nanjing from Shanghai to negotiate with the government on the aftermath. The government has proposed the following measures:

The government has declared the Democratic League an illegal organization and hopes that the Democratic League will end itself and release the persons in charge from responsibility.

Regarding real estate: 1. The houses and properties managed by the Democratic League on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party should be immediately handed over to the government for reception; 2. The houses owned by the Democratic League can be received later; 3. The houses allocated to the Democratic League by the government should be returned. If they cannot be moved out temporarily, they can be borrowed temporarily; 4. The personal residences of the members will not be interfered with; 5. The houses on Zhu Bao San Road in Shanghai, which the Democratic League held in trust for the CCP, will also be received by the government. If the schools cannot move out temporarily, other methods for borrowing should be discussed.

Standing Committee member Huang replied as follows:

Since the Democratic League has been regarded as an illegal organization by the government, it can only notify its members to stop their activities. After this notification, if any members make any remarks or actions, they shall be responsible for their own actions.

Regarding the points on real estate, we will comply with them, but it should be supplemented that the Democratic League has no property of its own. If there is any property owned in common, please allow the Democratic League to handle it itself.

In addition, there are two requests:

All members of the League in various places shall be exempted from registration and shall enjoy all legal freedom.

If the government considers that members of the League in various places have engaged in illegal acts, and those who have been arrested for cases, shall be dealt with by the government in accordance with the law. If there is no factual evidence of Communist Party membership, the "Measures for the Disposition of Communists in the Rear Area" will not be invoked.

The feasibility of the above points is requested for instruction. As for the various documents published in the newspapers, some of them severely criticize the Democratic League and distort the facts. We will not elaborate on this matter at this time.

The government's response is as follows:

If the Democratic League can declare its own dissolution and cease activities in accordance with the official announcement made by the spokesman of the Ministry of Interior, the registration procedures for members of the League in various places can be exempted, and legal freedom will be guaranteed. However, if anyone uses the name of the League to engage in illegal activities in the future, the local security organs will still handle them in accordance with the law. All League members who have been arrested for cases, if the judicial organs, based on factual investigations, determine that they are not members of the Communist Party or are not working for the Communist Party, the provisions of the "Measures for the Disposition of Communists in the Rear Area" will not be invoked.

In addition, regarding the various points concerning real estate, they can all be handled accordingly, etc. The progress of the consultations will be announced to the public, and members will be notified that they will cease political activities from this date. All members of the League's headquarters will resign from this date, and the headquarters will be dissolved on the same day. We hope for public understanding. Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, November 6, 1947.

### Executive Yuan Makes Important Revisions to the Measures for the Disposition of Communists in the Rear Area

[Our correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] The Executive Yuan recently made important revisions to the Measures for the Disposition of Communists in the Rear Area, which were promulgated last month. There are two main points of the revision: 1. The original provision that those who leave the party should be placed under supervision for one year has now been revised to state that if there is a reliable guarantor, they may be granted freedom and exempted from supervision. 2. The original provision that communists who are approved for registration may be subjected to ideological training and labor service has now been revised to remove the provision for labor service. The revised articles have been approved by the National Government and promulgated for implementation. The revised articles are as follows:

Revised Articles 3, 7, 10, and 11 of the Measures for the Disposition of Communists in the Rear Area:

Article 3: Persons who leave the Communist Party in accordance with the provisions of these measures shall be properly supervised by the local government and security organs. After one year, if the assessment confirms that there is no illegal or treasonous conduct, their previous conduct may be exempted from investigation. If a person subject to supervision under the preceding paragraph has a reliable guarantor responsible for guaranteeing their conduct, they may be granted freedom and exempted from supervision.

Article 7: Persons approved for registration in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article may be subjected to ideological training, but if a person meets one of the following conditions, they may still be exempted from part or all of the period of ideological training: 1. They joined the Communist Party or worked for the Communist Party before the promulgation of the Mobilization Order for Suppressing the Rebellion, and after the promulgation of the Mobilization Order for Suppressing the Rebellion, they have not made any statements or taken any actions that violate or hinder the mobilization. 2. They held a substantial position in the Communist Party and have voluntarily ceased activities after the promulgation of the Mobilization Order for Suppressing the Rebellion.

The measures for ideological training will be determined separately.

Article 10: Persons who have been approved for registration after leaving the Communist Party may, during the period of mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, be granted special permission by the competent authority to hold public office, but those who are required to undergo ideological training in accordance with the regulations may not be granted special permission unless they have made special achievements or have special reasons.

The special permission referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be jointly approved by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of National Defense.

Article 11: Any existing organs or organizations in various localities that were established by the Communist Party, or that are found to be related to the Communist Party, shall be closed down. Their houses and all property shall be handed over to the local government for disposal in accordance with the law, except for those that have been proven to be owned by others, which may be returned.

### Zhu Kezhen Arrives in Nanjing to Discuss the Yu Zisan Case

Security Police Have Three Points of Responsibility

[Our correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] Zhu Kezhen, President of Zhejiang University, arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 4th and met with reporters from this newspaper on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss in detail the case of Yu Zisan, Chairman of the Student Self-Government Association of the school, who was arrested and died tragically. Zhu told reporters that he had spoken to Hangzhou by telephone on the morning of the 5th, and the students had decided to suspend the strike for five days from that day to await the results of the court's handling of the matter. Zhu said: The primary suspect in Yu's death and the origin of the weapon used to injure him still need to be investigated, and the cause of his death may become an eternal mystery. However, even if it is assumed that Yu committed "suicide," the security police have at least three points of responsibility: 1. Failure to transfer him to the court within the statutory time limit of 24 hours. Yu was arrested late on October 25 and died tragically on the 29th. During the four days of his detention, the Zhejiang University authorities repeatedly requested that he be transferred to the court in accordance with the law, but the security police repeatedly delayed. 2. Failure to prevent the deceased from "committing suicide." Judging from the environment at the time, the source of the weapon is highly suspicious. 3. Creating reasons for the deceased to "commit suicide." After Yu was arrested, some students went to visit him, and Yu burst into tears. Regardless of Yu's crime, the security police cannot evade their responsibility for these three points of illegality and dereliction of duty. Zhu said: Whether Yu and others are communists or are related to the Communist Party can be determined by evidence. However, in any case, according to the Outline for Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion, the means of handling it must be carried out in accordance with the law. In short, the school's position is that this is a legal event, and its final outcome will determine whether the government's spirit of the rule of law is fully demonstrated and whether it is willing to protect human rights. Zhu said: Yu is from Shandong, and the school has notified his family, but there has been no reply. He was studying agriculture at the school and was scheduled to graduate next year. Zhu met with Minister Zhu Jia-hua at 11:00 AM on the 5th to explain the incident, the school's position, and the students' wishes. He will also call on the ministers of the judicial and political departments within days. In addition, he will contact the Executive Yuan to request that Zhejiang University faculty and staff receive additional benefits in kind and will return to Hangzhou in two or three days.

### Zhejiang University Professors' Association Declaration Acknowledges Two Points of Suspicion in the Yu Case

Demands Thorough Investigation to Reveal the Truth

[Our correspondent in Hangzhou, 5th] The Zhejiang University Professors' Association issued a declaration on the Yu Zisan case, stating that there are two suspicious points about Yu's suicide: 1. When Chief Instructor Gu went to visit the student, he saw that the glasses he usually wore had been removed, and a pack of cigarettes was sent in. According to the guards, eyeglasses are made of glass, and matches are used for smoking, which are all not allowed. This means that the prevention of his suicide was quite strict, so why did he allow him to use a piece of glass five or six inches long to commit suicide? 2. When President Zhu arrived at the Security Command on the evening of the 29th, the person in charge showed a piece of glass. President Zhu asked where the piece of glass came from, and the answer was either "I don't know" or "It's the window glass in the room," but the remaining broken glass in the window in the room cannot be pieced together with the bloodstained glass. Therefore, they demand that the government investigate the matter thoroughly to reveal the truth.

### Student Strike Trend Spreads

Yanjing University Professors Issue Written Statement

[Our correspondent in Beiping, 5th] Following Tsinghua University, Yanjing University began a two-day strike today. The Sino-French University began a strike this afternoon. As a result of student signatures at Peking University, 75% approved the strike. Therefore, it will be decided at a meeting tonight whether to strike tomorrow for one day. Chaoyang University is also signing names to decide whether to strike. Yanjing University professors held a meeting this afternoon and decided to issue a written statement on the Yu Zisan case to express their attitude. Hu Shi summoned representatives of Peking University students for talks at 4:00 PM this afternoon and declined to explain the content of the talks. The students only said that Hu expressed his sympathy to them. In addition, the students also visited professors to ask them to express their attitudes. Among them, Ji Yuan, Chief Prosecutor of the Hebei District Court, who also teaches at Peking University, said that the soldiers guarding Yu Zisan were negligent and should not be held legally responsible. He had other opinions on the matter of suicide by glass. Hu Shi is trying to prevent the situation from escalating in many ways.

[Another dispatch] Peking University students requested to visit the arrested students Meng Xian-gong and Li Gong-yi. Zheng Tian-ting, Secretary-General of Peking University, and Zhao Nai-bo, Director of the Department of Economics, will go to the Garrison Command today to negotiate and request their release or transfer to the court. The Garrison Command did not allow students to visit due to military relations, and the transfer to the court has been requested from the central government for approval. However, Zheng and others happened to see Meng and Li passing through the courtyard at the time.

[United Press, Beiping, 5th] It is reported that Yanjing University faculty and staff, in the midst of a two-day student strike, wrote to US Ambassador Stuart on the 5th to protest the Hangzhou incident. It is claimed that only three teachers did not participate in the protest.

### Fujianese Criticize Philippine's Absurd Attempt

Taiwan and Ryukyu Are Inseparable

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 5th] After the Manila Bulletin revealed that the Philippine government opposed the return of the Ryukyu Islands to China and would seek to determine the political status of Taiwan through "national self-determination," it aroused strong anger and antipathy among the people here. People generally criticized the Philippine government's attempt, regardless of its motives, as an unfriendly gesture toward its close neighbor. Some people pointed out that Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands are inseparable, both being parts detached from the Chinese mainland, just like Hainan Island and the Xisha Islands. Moreover, the people of Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands are all Chinese people, belonging to the same bloodline and the same culture. Where does the so-called national problem come from? The population of Taiwan is 8 million, and the Gaoshan ethnic group accounts for only 130,000 people. They live in harmony with the more than 5.8 million Han people. This minority ethnic group has no problems of any kind.

[Our correspondent in Taipei, 5th] Qiu Niantai, Chairman of the Kuomintang Department, told reporters that Taiwan province and the Chinese nation cannot be separated. The Taiwanese are all people from Fujian and Guangdong. It is no different from asking Fujian and Guangdong to determine their own destiny. This is either the Manila Bulletin's insensitivity to the situation in Taiwan or an intention to insult, which is absurd. Provincial Senator Huang Chunqing said: I dare to guarantee that the Taiwanese people have no such intention and will always be descendants of the Yellow Emperor. It is by no means something that the insane theory of the newspaper can shake in the slightest.

### Zhudong Branch Line in Taiwan Opens to Traffic

[Our correspondent in Taipei, 5th] The Zhudong branch line in Taiwan was built and opened to traffic. The Zhudong district town in Hsinchu City is presenting an unprecedentedly lively scene today. Weng Wenhao, Wei Daoming, Chen Qingwen, Fei Hua, and more than 300 guests from the Railway Commission, after riding a special train and nailing a road spike at the starting point of the new road, arrived in this small town in forty minutes. Welcomed by thousands of people, the opening ceremony was held next to the station. Weng encouraged fellow countrymen to work together to ensure the smooth flow of goods and the development of transportation. Wei said that the provincial government not only restored the old but also did not forget the new construction and guaranteed the extension of the line. Speaker Huang said: We can be confident that we can still engage in construction in the midst of destruction. The Taiwanese people are willing to thank Director Chen Yi, Chairman Wei, and those who are dedicated to this work, and Mr. Weng will definitely provide assistance in development. After having lunch at the Cement Factory, they left Zhudong at 2:00 PM amidst the cheers of the people. The second phase of the project will cost 1.5 billion, and Finance Director Yan Jiagan said that there were no difficulties, but the materials were a problem, but the line must be extended 12 kilometers to Neiwan to have economic value.

### Taiwan's Fourth Steel Plant to Hold Furnace-Opening Ceremony Today

### Culprit in Guangzhou Import License Case Apprehended

Corruption Reaches Over 20 Billion

[Our correspondent in Guangzhou, 5th] The case of the import license, which caused a sensation in the Guangzhou market a few days ago, has now been solved by Yong Jiangshi, after a merchant made a secret report. The persons who forged the licenses were Zhong Yaotian, Secretary of the South China Branch of the Import Management Committee, Xie Zhaofen, Consultant, and Huang Wenguang, Clerk. They have now been detained and interrogated by the court. It is reported that Zhong and others made a profit of over 30 billion yuan from forging the licenses, which is the largest corruption case in South China. It is also learned that in addition to the licenses forged by Zhong and others, the licenses issued by the former Guangzhou office of the Provisional Import Management Committee are also without legal basis and have been sent to the court for handling by the South China Branch.

### Offspring of Wealthy Family Murders for Money A Tragic Murder Case Occurs in Hankou

[Our correspondent in Hankou, 5th] A sensational murder case occurred in the business district here on the morning of the 3rd. The deceased, Wang Shaobo, was a yarn merchant broker. The murderer, Liu Youfang, is the descendant of Liu Youyu, a wealthy man in Wuhan, and owns several yarn factories and silver shops.

Editorial

### The Convening of the Judicial Administration Conference

The Judicial Administration Conference was convened yesterday in the capital. The convening of this conference, closely following the annual meeting of the Chinese Society of Jurisprudence held in Shanghai, is of great significance for promoting the rule of law and laying the foundation for China's new legal system. Our Chairman attaches great importance to the judiciary and has issued a special instruction to encourage it. We have written an article on the occasion of the annual meeting of the Chinese Society of Jurisprudence in Shanghai. Now, when the Judicial Administration Conference is convened, we would like to express our views briefly.

In the Chairman's instruction, we see that the Chairman pointed out that the purpose of the National Revolution is to establish a legal state based on the Three Principles of the People, and that good laws must have sound law enforcement personnel and law-abiding citizens in order to be effective. This indeed points out the crux of the current problem. The laws we have already formulated, in theory and technology, have indeed caught up with Western Europe and other countries, but we seem to be still a long way from achieving the ideal realm of the rule of law. In the past, we had the traditional system of "punishment does not extend to high officials," which has now collapsed. High officials have neither "etiquette" to follow nor fear of "punishment," so we have not yet developed the spirit of the rule of law. To this day, high officials are still the ruling class in China. In the past, their behavior was constrained by traditional "etiquette" and they placed themselves outside the scope of criminal law. At present, "etiquette" is out of order, and they still place themselves outside the law. This cannot but be said to be a major reason why China has failed to achieve genuine rule of law. Now that we want to establish a legal state based on the Three Principles of the People, one principle that the people of the whole country must abide by is that everyone is under the law and no one can be allowed to be above the law. To achieve this goal, on the one hand, citizens should abide by the law, and on the other hand, the law should be strictly enforced. Since we are talking about the rule of law, these two aspects are interrelated. If the law is not strictly enforced, why should the people bother to abide by the law? Because there is no need to abide by the law, it will inevitably affect the strict enforcement of the law. Frankly speaking, the law-abiding spirit of the average Chinese citizen is quite admirable. The problem lies in the special individuals who do not consider themselves to be among the common people. From this point of view, the primary task of rigorously implementing the rule of law lies in the strict enforcement of the law, so that our sound and progressive laws can be effective.

Speaking of judicial administration, it is better to expand the scope of legal education than to improve the level of legal education. It is true that the level of legal education should be improved, but in a country that rigorously implements the rule of law, most people must be able to understand their laws. Today, the number of current laws in China is quite large, and how these laws bind individual behavior should be necessary common sense for the general public. At this time, it seems better to devote ourselves to the general popularization of legal knowledge than to the in-depth study of law. We should certainly cultivate legal experts, but we should also promote the legal knowledge of the general public. Only by making the people aware of the law can we expect them to abide by the law. As for the judicial system, we also believe that raising the powers of prosecutors is an urgent task at present. Prosecutors have the responsibility to enforce the law, but at present, the power to enforce the law that they have is limited and they often cannot take action on their own initiative. Therefore, they must work closely with the military police in order to achieve the goal of discovering crimes, searching for evidence, and arresting criminals quickly and promptly, and the country's laws can be effective.

At the annual meeting of the Chinese Society of Jurisprudence in Shanghai, we said: "Speaking of the judiciary, in the past year, under the situation of rising prices and turbulent living conditions, the national judicial personnel have been loyal to their duties and have won general praise. In terms of China's judicial system, thanks to the efforts of the President of the Judiciary to adapt to the needs of the times, there have been constant improvements. In the future, after the implementation of constitutional government, the dignity of the judiciary will be further enhanced. The establishment of a legal system requires not only complete legislation, but also enlightened judicial administration. We observe how the precedents of the United States Supreme Court affect the growth and development of American jurisprudence, and we believe more in the importance of the position of judicial administrators. In the establishment of China's new legal system, we also hope that China's judicial circles can make contributions like those of the Anglo-American judicial circles." Now, when the Judicial Administration Conference is convened, we can also encourage each other in this way. However, there are two points that should also be mentioned: 1. The salaries of judges must be raised by any means possible, and their positions must be permanent. At present, materials are fluctuating and unstable, and judicial personnel are paid poorly. We must find ways to improve it. Diplomats have special treatment. Why can't judges also have special treatment? 2. The level of judges must also be raised by any means possible. Only in this way can the dignity of the judiciary be maintained.

### Cheers Echo in the Legislative Yuan Auditorium

President Sun Fetes Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] President Sun, along with his wife, hosted a small banquet at noon on the 5th in the Legislative Yuan Auditorium to welcome the Xinjiang Song and Dance Visiting Troupe.  Present were all members of the Xinjiang Troupe, Government Committee Member Bao Erhan, Director of Xinjiang Construction Ting, Yi Min, Deputy President of the Legislative Yuan Wu Tiecheng, Legislative Committee members Lou Tongsun, Sun Jiulu, Liu Butong and over a hundred others. President Sun first delivered a welcoming speech, stating roughly: China is a multi-ethnic country, and although the languages and customs of each ethnic group are different, the spirit of mutual love and sincerity is evident everywhere.  Today, young men and women from Xinjiang Province are participating in this welcoming reception with joyful singing and dancing, which serves as proof of this.  This visit to the capital by the visiting troupe is of extraordinary significance and importance. They bring to compatriots in the interior of the country the unparalleled sincere affection of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province towards the nation, the central government, and the Chairman. It is hoped that when they return to Xinjiang, they will also bring to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang the warmth and sincerity of the people throughout the country towards them, so as to enhance the exchange of feelings and cultural communication.  Furthermore, it is hoped that they will be able to visit major cities in the interior for sightseeing. President Sun went on to state the importance the Legislative Yuan attaches to border regions and democracy, saying: Since its establishment in 1928, the number of Legislative Committee members has increased from forty-nine to one hundred and forty-nine.  Discussion of proposals has always been extremely democratic.  After the Kuomintang and Youth Parties joined, the consistent democratic style has become even more pronounced.  In addition to democracy, the Legislative Yuan also represents various regions.  In the past, Xinjiang Legislative Committee members included Ai Sha and Zhang Fengjiu, and currently there is Yi Simuguanglu. In the future, the Legislative Committee will increase to over seven hundred members, and the number of representatives from Xinjiang Province will also increase. The Xinjiang Provincial Government has been working towards improvements, and the people's hardships are deeply felt. Furthermore, Xinjiang is moving forward on the path of autonomy. County magistrates and commissioners are all popularly elected, and the election process is more fair than in the interior, serving as a model for the interior. The current situation in Xinjiang has not yet reached its most perfect state. It is hoped that local autonomy can be further advanced, and that all ethnic groups can be more united.  May we encourage each other to build a new democratic China based on the Three Principles of the People. After the speech, the entire venue responded with enthusiastic applause. Deputy President Wu then delivered a speech, pointing out that the new situation in Xinjiang is more stable than in the interior, and hoping that they can work together to create a new trend. He also hoped that the visit of the song and dance troupe could promote cultural exchange between them. When Mr. Wu, in an enthusiastic tone, loudly proclaimed that today's Xinjiang is the Xinjiang of the great Chinese nation, the entire venue erupted in cheers. Bao Erhan and Yi Min and others applauded for an especially long time. Then, Bao Erhan introduced the members of the troupe to the meeting. As each member of the troupe stood up, applause immediately followed. Then, Bao Erhan gave a speech in response, concise and powerful, repeatedly emphasizing that the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the interior are one family, and that the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang sincerely support the central government and the leader. Yi Min gave a speech, stating roughly: Xinjiang was particularly inappropriate in the past, but since Zhang Zhizhong took charge of Xinjiang, everything has changed. The harmony and unity between the various ethnic groups is unprecedented. Mr. Zhang can be said to be a fair statesman, but unfortunately his goals have not yet been fully achieved. Mr. Yi finally put forward his hopes for the election aspect, and said that when the visiting troupe left Xinjiang, Xinjiang Secretary-General Ai Sha (former Legislative Committee member) had entrusted him to express his greetings to the President of the Legislative Yuan and all his colleagues. After the speeches, Xinjiang dancers Kangbala Khan and others performed impromptu performances, and the gathering dispersed happily around 3 o'clock.

### UN Committee Votes on Korean Issue, US Proposal Passes, Soviet Union Declares Refusal to Participate in Committee, China States Right to Speak on Measures for Troops Stationed in Korean Territory

[News from our paper] Lake Success, May 5th (Radio Broadcast): The UN Political Committee today rejected the Soviet Union's proposal that US and Soviet troops withdraw from Korea before January 1st of next year, by a vote of twenty to six. After suffering this defeat, Soviet representative Gromyko immediately declared that he would not participate in the vote on the proposal by US Secretary of State Marshall to hold elections in Korea under UN supervision before March 1st of next year. This statement shows that the Soviet Union is unwilling to participate in the UN Committee established by the UN Political Committee last week, which is preparing to go to Korea. During today's vote, the countries that supported the Soviet proposal were only the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Byelorussia, Ukraine, and Egypt. The representative of Czechoslovakia was not present at the meeting when the vote was taken. Disregarding the opposition of the Soviet bloc, the UN Political Committee continued to vote on the US proposal, which passed with forty-six votes to zero. The countries of the Soviet bloc refused to vote, and even refused to abstain. The declaration of the Soviet bloc's boycott of the UN Committee was announced on the spot by the representative of Ukraine.

[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] The UN Political Committee today debated the Korean issue. The US-proposed amendment was opposed only by five countries: the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Ukraine. They unanimously condemned this plan as "a smokescreen to cover up the US's transformation of Korea into a target of its expansionist policy," while the two major Asian countries, China and India, supported the US proposal.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, West 5th] Our country today proposed that the measures for the withdrawal of occupying forces from Korea should be consulted and determined by the four major powers that signed the Moscow Agreement. This proposal was submitted by our country to the UN Political Committee this afternoon in the form of an amendment to the US draft resolution. The US draft resolution originally briefly prescribed a plan for rebuilding Korean independence with the assistance of the Korean Committee established in the United Nations. When submitting this amendment, our representative Gu Weijun explained that China should have the right to speak on the measures for the occupying forces stationed in Korea, or at least should receive sufficient information about these measures. This matter is very important because these measures may have important repercussions within the Chinese territory adjacent to Korea. Mr. Gu stated that about a week ago, in a statement, he explained that the Chinese people are very concerned about Korea obtaining true independence, because any events that occur in Korea in the future will have immediate repercussions on the northeastern provinces of China adjacent to Korea. Directly referring to the Soviet proposal on the immediate and simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea, Mr. Gu expressed doubts about the effectiveness of this proposal. He said, "We are deeply aware of the principles in the Soviet proposal, but we believe that the proposal is too simple. In this situation, we believe that the withdrawal of the occupying forces can only be implemented after the Korean people are truly able to rebuild their independence and create conditions for maintaining this independence." Subsequently, Mr. Gu cited evidence to support his views, stating that according to the information he had, there were 150,000 armed troops from North Korea, and these troops were all trained and equipped by the Soviet Union. On the other hand, it is heard that there are no comparable troops in South Korea. He continued, "If these North Korean troops are incorporated into the Korean national army with the consent of the South Korean people, China will have no objection. But if the South Korean people object, this will cause a serious situation, which will inevitably have repercussions on the adjacent Chinese territory." US representative Dulles asked whether the Chinese delegation would consider abandoning the amendment requiring the four major powers to consult each other before the withdrawal of the new occupying forces if China was part of the United Nations Korean Committee. Gu et al. stated that the duties and powers of the Korean Committee have not yet been formulated. However, he continued, the Chinese delegation will consider this matter, although any strict reply to this important question must naturally await consultation with the national government. Mr. Gu concluded by stating that, for these reasons, the Chinese delegation supports the US proposal on the conditions modified above.

### US and Soviet Views on Palestine Partition Plan Moving Closer, Britain Hopes the Soviet Union Can Provide Supplementary Explanations

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 4th] The US and the Soviet Union have now reached a stage of coordination on the Palestine partition plan, as the US and the Soviet Union have held informal small-group meetings with Canada and Guatemala in an effort to eliminate major differences in the plans of both sides. After the secret meeting, US representative Johnson said that the small-group meeting had exchanged views between the two sides, and they were getting closer to each other.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 5th] British representative Martin stated in the Palestine Partition Sub-Committee that Britain hopes the Soviet Union can provide supplementary explanations before expressing its views on the Soviet proposal to implement the partition. Britain's position has been repeatedly explained in the past, so it does not intend to raise any questions at the current stage. According to the Soviet proposal, Britain should end the trusteeship of Palestine before January 1, 1948, and British troops should withdraw within three to four months after that date. At the same time, it advocates sending a Security Council committee to Palestine immediately to prepare for the establishment of temporary government committees for the Jewish and Arab states, and to elect constituent assemblies within six months to carry out the tasks of drafting constitutions and establishing formal governments.

### Soviet Bloc Urges Discussion of the Franco Issue

[United Press, Lake Success, 5th] Authorities today claimed that the Soviet bloc countries will recommend that the United Nations Security Council immediately discuss the issue of the Spanish Franco government threatening world peace, and demand that all countries sever diplomatic relations with Spain and implement economic sanctions.

### Allied Headquarters Releases Statistics on Japanese Foreign Trade

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] The Foreign Trade Section of the Economic and Scientific Bureau of MacArthur's Headquarters announced that in the first two months after the start of limited private trade, 371 export contracts were authorized by the Headquarters, amounting to approximately US$4,072,249, including 15 import contracts amounting to US$4,104,480.

The countries of trade representatives licensed to Japan are the United States, Britain, India, Australia, France, Canada, New Zealand, the Philippines, Sweden, and Iran.

### Japanese Prime Minister Dismisses Hirano, All Parties Express Understanding, Katayama Claims Cabinet Strength Increased

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] All Japanese opposition parties are not making direct and forceful criticisms of the Hirano incident, as they still want to wait for the development of the split within the Socialist Party. The Liberal Party criticized Katayama for creating this bad precedent in Japanese political history. The Communist Party believes that during the parliamentary session, the Prime Minister should consult the Parliament before the appointment and removal of cabinet members. This implementation of the power of dismissal is inevitably suspected of being "dictatorial." Although most members of the House of Councillors acknowledge that Prime Minister Katayama's dismissal of Hirano was legal, they feel regret that he did not give careful consideration to the first use of this power stipulated by the new constitution. After Katayama attended the meeting on the 4th to explain the difficulties of using the power of dismissal, he seemed to have been understood.

### Communist Bandit's Huge Supply Organization Uncovered, Materials Worth Tens of Billions Seized in Shanghai, Ningbo, and Qingdao, Communist Side Shocked, Hua Zhong Cadres Detained to Investigate Responsibility

[Central News Agency] The First Pacification Zone Command uncovered a shocking major case involving the Communist Bandit's general supply organization in Shanghai, which has been sparsely recorded in various newspapers in the city. However, in view of the large scale of the Communist Bandit's organization in Shanghai, with branches and sea transportation routes extending to Shanghai, Qingdao, Yantai, Ningbo, Dinghai, Zhapu, as well as Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau, the authorities in charge have maintained strict secrecy in order to catch all the bandits in one fell swoop. The details of the successful seizure have not yet been publicly announced. The Central News Agency reporter has now obtained the actual situation from reliable sources, as follows: Commander of the First Pacification Zone, General Li Mo'an, has repeatedly received reports from Director Jiang Jianmin of the Second Department that the Communist Bandit authorities in the Hua Zhong, Su Zhong, and Su Bei three military regions, as well as the Communist Bandit "Hua Zhong Political Bureau," "Su Wan Border Region Government Office in Shanghai," "Hua Zhong Bank Su Bei First Branch," "Hua Zhong Su Zhong Goods Administration," and "Cotton and Salt Management Committee" and other institutions have established a "Joint Office" in Shanghai to handle military supply and material dumping and purchasing matters. They have also established a "General Logistics Supply Station" in Hede Town Port, Sheyang River Estuary, Su Bei Bandit Area, listing all Communist Bandit official companies and firms in the Hua Zhong, Su Zhong, and Su Bei areas as branches of the station, and appointing Feng Changbo, the Communist Bandit financial tycoon and former General Manager of the Communist Bandit Profit Company, as the "Station Master" to be unified under the command of "Director of the Hua Zhong Goods Administration" and Communist Bandit logistics tycoon Yi Mou of "Su Bei Bank." Communist Bandit Yi himself secretly came to Shanghai in October last year to personally deploy.

Disguised Arrival in Shanghai for Deployment of Activities, Discovered and Secretly Investigated

According to senior Communist Bandit cadre Li, who has turned over a new leaf, and reports from anti-Communist comrades, Communist Bandit Yi, under the alias of Liu Ming, was a senior cadre of the Communist Bandit's logistics base station while working in southern Anhui. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was stationed in Shanghai by the authorities of the "New Fourth Army" in southern Anhui to rush to transport military supplies and supply the Communist Bandit side. After the victory, he withdrew to northern Jiangsu with the army, and successively held Communist Bandit positions such as Director of the Goods Administration, Bank Manager, and Party Affairs Commissioner. In July this year, the Communist Bandit was suddenly encountered in Shanghai's Gordon Road, Central Road, Yuanmingyuan Road, etc., which was very suspicious. After tracking and secretly investigating, it was learned that Communist Bandit Xin had come to Shanghai to represent the areas in northern Jiangsu to prepare for military supply institutions and transportation matters, and to establish an office in a certain place, dispatching a batch of Communist Bandit financial and cargo transportation cadres to Shanghai, mostly using unscrupulous merchants to organize companies and firms, using northern Jiangsu cotton, salt, grain, fur, etc. to come to Shanghai and other places for dumping, purchasing military supplies, with copper, iron, machinery, telecommunications equipment, medical supplies, cloth, and dyes being the main items, and foreign goods being the secondary items, and also engaging in black market buying and selling of gold US dollars, speculating on financial markets, hoarding commercial goods, purchasing foreign exchange, printing counterfeit currency, publications, books, and other illicit activities, on a large scale, with strong funding, etc. After receiving the report, Commander Li, in addition to strictly ordering the maritime and river defense forces to effectively arrest the Communist Bandits, also appointed Director Jiang to order the Communist Bandit rear work personnel and coastal intelligence team to continue the investigation, so as to uncover and smash their conspiracy.

### British Embassy Staff Performs Electroluminescent Advertising Machine Activity

[Our Newspaper] Li Jingkui, a staff member of the British Embassy, has developed an electroluminescent advertising machine through two years of dedicated research. The advertising board used is four to six feet long, eight and a half feet high, and suitable for heights of 100 feet. There are 7,000 light bulbs on the advertising board, and the advertising movement flow rate is as high as 10,000 words per hour, which can be used to show news and commercial advertisements. Mr. Li brought a model machine to our newspaper for trial screening yesterday. According to him, this machine has two advantages: one is that the cost is low, with only 150 million yuan to install one unit, and the other is that it saves time. After receiving the manuscript, it can be shown in two hours. Mr. Li is about to apply for a patent from the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the successful experiment. He also hopes that someone will invest, so as to establish an electrical advertising company for further large-scale experimental work. In addition, Mr. Li has developed an automatic switch for neon lights, a slide advertising smoking device, and a three-purpose slide projector, all of which have models available for experimentation.

### The Body of the American Sailor Who Fell into the Water Has Been Dissected. It Was Determined That He Was Beaten and Injured Before He Fell into the Water and Drowned. The District Prosecutor's Office Will Conduct an Investigation to Reveal the Truth

[Our Newspaper] Robert Wdward Bouer, an American sailor, went ashore from the Kailin Wharf at 11 PM on the 26th of last month, accompanied by two other sailors, Panl and Powell. They went to the Jimei Tavern to drink. Because Bauer and others got drunk and beat people, the owner and waiters in the tavern all left. Bauer and others rushed outside, where there were many tricycle drivers, and a conflict broke out. The two sides fought. Paul rushed out to report to the police, who dispersed the tricycle drivers. Paul and Powell returned to the tavern, but Bauer was gone. According to two other sailors, Balia and Woods: They witnessed Bauer jump over the wharf fence, fall into the water, and drown. On the 30th, the body of Bauer was found in the Huangpu River after a search by the Maritime Inspection Bureau. At 11 AM on the 31st, the District Prosecutor's Office sent Inspector Ding Chuanen and forensic doctor Shen Dajun, translator Xu Shaoyong to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall at the South Wharf to examine the body. American Vice-Consul Olifu, the captain, and others were present to observe. After forensic doctor Shen examined the body, he found several wounds on Bauer's body. Since a dissection was required, the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall in Dongxinqiao at 3 PM that afternoon, where four forensic doctors Shen, Wang, Wei, and [unclear] began the dissection. American military forensic doctor Evans was also present to watch and record the key points in detail. While the forensic doctor was performing the dissection, Inspector Ding interrogated witnesses, including Paul, Powell, Balia, Woods, Warner (the chief mate on the ship), the director, patrol officer, plainclothes police officer of the Maritime Police Bureau, and the person who discovered the body, in great detail.

### Qiantang River Flood Disaster Alleviated

[Special Report from our Newspaper in Hangzhou] Last August, Mao Yisheng led the Qiantang River Seawall Project Inspection Team. After inspecting the entire seawall, he said to the accompanying reporters, "The first step in controlling the Qiantang River is to make the river flow straight." Now, the Seawall Project Bureau has been established for more than a year. During this time, Wang Huzhen, the deputy director and chief engineer stationed in the bureau, has worked very hard. When he first took over the seawall project, it was like being besieged, with losses occurring in the east, and then losses in the west after emergency repairs. Despite complaints, they didn't give up on their tireless travels on the seawall day and night. They finally managed to keep the seawater more than seven miles away.

Sand Accretion on the South Bank First, their engineers discovered a sandy accretion shaped like an olive in the Qiantang River, from Xiaojian Mountain to Haining. This sandbar divided the river flow into two, causing the tidal waves to be more turbulent and surging. This sandbar was formed during the occupation period, and no one paid attention to the seawall at that time, so it collapsed year by year, becoming unmanageable by the 33rd and 34th years of the Republic. In the 25th year of the Republic, the only way to defend against the flood was to use wooden dikes everywhere for emergency repairs, but that was not a fundamental solution. So, twelve water diversion dams were built in Chenwengang, the area with the most severe collapse. These twelve water diversion dikes were like injecting twelve powerful injections. The water flow gradually stabilized, and the sandy accretion in Haining expanded straight to Qiaosi in Hangzhou due to the water diversion dams, reducing the severity of the seawall collapse. On the other hand, because the Qiantang River's flow was divided into two, the south bank was eroded at Nansha, and the riverbank collapse became increasingly severe. In fact, Nansha was also formed by accretion, with the seawall far behind Nansha. At the people's request, Nansha was urgently rescued, and water diversion dikes were made of unworked stones. Now, the riverbank is no longer collapsing, and sand has even started to accrete.

Wooden Dikes on the South Bank In the north bank, from Xiaojian Mountain to Qiaosi in Hangzhou, the sand has formed a continuous line. The water near the seawall is also gradually silting up. On the south bank, new sand has also accreted in front of Nansha. The new sand accreted on the north and south banks is each five or six li wide, thus directing the water of the Qiantang River into the middle of the sand accreted on both sides. The Qiantang River is flowing straight.

Regarding the collapse of the Sibao Seawall, the entire stone seawall on the north bank was only lacking from Fort One to Fort Seven, which were built with stone strips. Because the construction of the seawall coincided with the Taiping Rebellion, Zuo Zongtang used wooden dikes to replace them during the Tongzhi reign to repair the seawall. After many years, the wooden dikes naturally collapsed. Now, the Seawall Project Bureau is working hard to use wooden piles and sheathing to defend against the collapse and using water diversion dams to silt up new sand. When we passed by, Deputy Director Wang invited us to see the wooden branches exposed by the tidal waves, which were still clearly distinguishable.

Building water diversion dams The only current problem is how to preserve the accreted sand to protect the stone seawall and make the Qiantang River flow straight permanently. Therefore, it is necessary to build water diversion walls on the sand or even to the appropriate place outside the sand. We went to Chenwengang and saw many Chinese and foreign technicians working hard on this task.

Deputy Director Wang told reporters: "Originally, new accreted sand after building a water diversion dam had to accrete once a year, but because the Qiantang River has two tides every day, the sand accretion is faster. This is truly 'Heaven fulfilling human wishes.' Now, we must protect against collapse on one hand and repair the dilapidated stone seawalls on the other."

Jue-Numbered Seawall We then went to the most dangerous Jue-numbered seawall and saw that it had been repaired into a very good concrete seawall. This large block of concrete bedrock was made in the first year of the Republic. It was originally intended to be used to repair the seawall, but local people opposed it because they considered it "foreign goods." It was not until the 36th year of the Republic that the Seawall Project Bureau used it. We also went to Xiaojian Mountain, where the stone was quarried. Various newspapers in the past, such as those in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing, have recorded plans to destroy the Shizi Men with guns. (The Shizi Men they were referring to was probably Xiaojian Mountain. In fact, the Shizi Men is between Kanshan and Gaoshan, close to the south bank.) They said that destroying the Shizi Men would allow navigation and prevent tidal flooding. Now, engineering experts have proven that this is completely unfounded.

At Xiaojian Mountain, they said, "We are only removing a surface layer by blasting the mountain like this. How can we blast it completely? Moreover, Xiaojian Mountain has nothing to do with tidal flooding and navigation."

Xiaojian Mountain was originally a desolate place, but now hundreds of technicians and workers are working there. There is a 15-kilowatt generator, an air compressor, and compressed air hammers and drills to drill the mountain. After drilling, gunpowder is injected and ignited to explode into large blocks of stone. After the large stones are blasted out, small locomotives (called Pony engines, equivalent to a Ford horsepower) pull dozens of bucketloads of stone to the stone crushing machine, pour it in to be crushed into small pieces, pour it back into iron buckets, and transport it to Chenwengang on a small light railway to make water diversion dams.

No Worries About Floods We were very happy to learn that there is no need to worry about the Qiantang River floods and further wanted to know how to use the Qiantang River to prosper our land. On the way back to Hangzhou, I talked to Deputy Director Wang about the issue of Qiantang River navigation. They estimated that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway transports about 1,500 tons of cargo per day, and other local goods and timber transported by various means account for about 3,000 tons. If Qiantang River shipping accounts for 1,000 tons, it can support three 300-ton ships and two 500-ton ships. Now that the Qiantang River is flowing straight, the riverbed has not yet been determined, and the depth is unknown. Therefore, surveying is needed, markers are needed, and more water diversion dams are needed to fix the riverbed. According to their plan, a wharf is planned to be built in Sibao, but a railway connection to the train station is required to facilitate transportation. The funds needed for such procedures and engineering, calculated before the war, would be 10 million yuan, equivalent to 5 million US dollars. Such a project needs to be completed within five years. To ensure the prosperity and safety of Jiangnan, the reporter believes that there can be no further delay. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### The Great Legacy of Taiwan Province

[Report from our Newspaper in Taipei on the 2nd] The most valuable aspect of Taiwan Province is the legacy received after the recovery, left by the Japanese after fifty years of hard work. Minister Bai and President Zhang, who recently visited Taiwan, have both clearly pointed out that the recovery in Taiwan Province was the most effective and the most rapid. But what are the exact numbers, and what was the process of receiving such a large legacy? People are eagerly hoping to understand. The concluded Japanese Assets Processing Committee will provide a 100,000-word report: a beautiful booklet.

The total "book value" of houses, land, ships, vehicles, forests, machinery, furniture, and cash is 15,665,351,808.37 Taiwan dollars, including public property, private property, and business property. However, the quantity and value are calculated according to the lists of received items, and those not included were omitted, and some numbers, especially those received by military agencies, are not included.

The Japanese Assets Processing Committee, led by Yan Jiaju and He Xiaoyi with 200 staff members, began receiving work in January of the 35th year of the Republic and ended at the end of April this year. This organization cleanly completed the most basic work of recovering Taiwan and recorded the history of Japanese colonial exploitation in Taiwan over the past fifty years in numbers.

The Japanese Assets Processing Committee handed over the received items to the provincial government, which was then handled by the relevant departments of the provincial government. The provincial government requested that the assets originally from Taiwan Province be returned to the provincial government for handling. President Zhang has given his principal agreement to this principle, but it still needs technical research before a decision is made.

The numerical value of the assets at the time of acceptance is already considerable. If calculated at the current price index, it is indeed a very large legacy. We should cherish this number and use it well.

### Solving the Four Difficulties of Chinese Characters and Eliminating Illiteracy in Fujian Province - Institute Director Huang Juemin Implements New Literacy Technology

[Report from our Newspaper in Fuzhou on the 4th] Huang Juemin, the Director of the Fujian Provincial Research Institute, has been devoted to the work of Chinese character reform for many years and has now achieved preliminary results. According to Mr. Huang, people generally lament the four difficulties of Chinese characters (difficult to read, difficult to recognize, difficult to write, difficult to look up), but these are technical problems that can actually be overcome. Chinese characters have fewer characters than English characters. According to the Kangxi Dictionary, which has the most characters listed in existing dictionaries, the number is more than 51,000 characters. The Cihai has more than 13,000 characters, the Ciyuan has 12,000 characters, and Zhu Yunwu's Small Dictionary has more than 6,000 characters, while the number of characters generally used is only about 5,000. However, due to unreasonable literacy technology, the current literacy standard in our country is: about 1,300 characters for elementary school graduates, 1,800 characters for middle school students, and 4,500 characters for university students, which is shockingly different from the standard of more than 5,000 characters that children in European and American countries can recognize by the age of ten. According to Mr. Huang's research results, as long as one recognizes the 4,000 characters that are most needed for daily use, one can understand 99.8% of general reading materials. If combined with reasonable teaching methods, fourth-grade elementary school students can fully recognize and write documents. He is currently negotiating with the Fujian Provincial Department of Education to implement pilot programs, which are expected to greatly help eliminate illiteracy.

### The Silk Merchants Association Held a General Meeting Yesterday to Discuss How to Maintain Business and Resolved to Send Ten Representatives to Petition the Authorities

The local Silk Merchants Association held its second general meeting of members at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. More than 300 member representatives attended, and representatives from the Social Bureau and the City Chamber of Commerce were also present to provide guidance. First, Chairman Tang Zhiliang reported on the association's work and the situation of the industry. Subsequently, proposals were discussed. The association stated that since the government implemented the cotton yarn control policy, its members' businesses have encountered difficulties that have become increasingly serious. Recently, the Textile Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated the "Implementation Plan for Adjusting the Supply and Demand of Commercial Yarn and Cloth for the Development of the Textile Industry." The joint cotton yarn allocation method and the licensing and distribution system do not directly allocate yarn to silk merchants. This will inevitably lead to a crisis of nominal existence but actual demise. Therefore, it was proposed to request the government to protect the industry's business. After discussion, it was resolved that five representatives each from the general meeting and the board of directors would be sent to the relevant agencies to petition. A petition was submitted to the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Municipal Government, the Textile Adjustment Committee, the National Yarn Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the industry's legal and legitimate business be maintained after the implementation of the joint cotton yarn allocation, and that the industry's cotton yarn inventory be legally regulated. A letter was also sent to the National Silk Merchants Association to respond. During the discussion of the temporary proposal, it was decided that in order to avoid suspicion when selling cotton yarn to complex businesses, the industry should unanimously refuse to make purchases. The 45-day limit for cotton yarn inventory regulation should be reformed by the authorities; otherwise, cotton yarn below 10 counts and above 60 counts should be exempted from restrictions. It was also proposed to establish a silk merchants' fellowship, and a request was submitted to the Social Bureau for approval. The general meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

### Actual Sales are Stagnant, and People's Hearts are Floating, Leading to a Uniform Decline in Japonica and Indica Rice

Oil Cakes from Miscellaneous Grains Fell More Than They Rose

Yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of 10,100+ shih of rice. Digestion was weak, and people's hearts were floating. The market situation took a sharp turn for the worse. Japonica rice fell by 20,000-30,000 yuan, and Indica rice also fell by more than 10,000 yuan. White rice fell by 20,000 yuan, and early thin rice fell sharply by 30,000-40,000 yuan. The North market recovered slightly at the close, but the South market remained sluggish. Flour from Wuxi continued to flood the market, coupled with the influx of miscellaneous brands, resulting in stagnant sales and a sharp drop of 6,000-7,000 yuan. Bran sales were sluggish, and actual sales were cold, resulting in a sharp drop of 5,000-6,000 yuan.

The demand for soybean cakes from the Hakka traders was flat, resulting in a further drop of 2,000-3,000 yuan. Soybeans remained lackluster, weak and stagnant. Oil mills were very sluggish, with very few local transactions and very few Hakka traders, resulting in a further drop of more than 10,000 yuan. Kidney beans from Shantou weakened, falling back by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Red beans from the Guangdong traders were stagnant, gradually falling by 20,000 yuan. Broad bean sales remained thin, weak and sluggish, gradually falling by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Red sorghum followed suit, falling by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Corn from the Northern traders was cold, with little demand, falling back by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had balanced arrivals and sales, remaining mediocre. Sesame oil mills were selling short and making small purchases, with very little demand throughout the market, resulting in a further drop of 10,000-20,000 yuan. Yuan wheat also followed suit, falling by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Wheat sales were stagnant and lacked transactions, also falling by 10,000 yuan.

The oil market was mixed. Raw oil was strong, while soybean oil remained weak. Clear oil rose by 10,000-20,000 yuan, raw vegetable oil rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan, cooked vegetable oil was flat, and sesame oil from Hankou remained abundant, resulting in a further drop of 20,000-30,000 yuan.

### The Ratio of Raw Cotton to Rice Prices Has Increased Compared to Before

[Report from this newspaper] The Pricing Subcommittee of the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs discussed and decided on the method of purchasing raw cotton. It was tentatively determined that one shih of seven-eighths-inch fine velvet white cotton should be equivalent to four shih of local rice or seven shih of wheat for reference. The local pricing committee should still refer to the local supply and transportation to determine the purchase price, and it is not a rigid regulation. According to old customs, three shih of rice were commonly exchanged for one shih of cotton. This time, the committee specially increased the ratio to protect cotton farmers and encourage production.

### Second Estimate of Cotton Production

The second estimate of cotton production is based on the cotton situation before mid-October in the fifteen provinces and cities of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Liaoning, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Tianjin.

The national cotton field area is 38,528,000 mu, a decrease of 545,000 mu from the previous estimate; the seed cotton production is 10,563,000 dan, a decrease of 528,000 dan from the previous estimate.

The national cotton situation this year is generally good, with few pests and diseases. Spring droughts and autumn floods are relatively common. The water disaster in the Subei Xuhai area is quite serious. However, the disaster of soldiers and bandits is everywhere, and only Hunan, Zhejiang, and Sichuan are fortunate to be spared. If the war is quelled and cotton farmers can live and work in peace, the increase in cotton fields will be considerable.

### Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Rose Slightly

Public bonds rebounded yesterday. Unified C opened at 19,400 yuan and rose from 19,300 yuan to 22,200 yuan before leveling off slightly. Room 503 and Room 552 bought in, while Room 614 and Room 555 all sold out. As a result, A and B bonds rose by 1,800 yuan compared to the previous closing, Unified C rose by 2,500 yuan, and D and E bonds each rose by 2,000 yuan. The turnover was approximately 7 million.

Foreign stocks also turned stable yesterday. Ewo Silk opened highest at 184,000 yuan, reached a high price of 188,500 yuan, and finally struggled at 185,000 yuan. The note securities group had supply, while the Guangdong traders and foreign firm group sold. The Hong Kong Shanghai telegram contracted, and there was news of shipping companies selling ships. People's hearts were still good, and the trend was very stable. As a result, Ewo Telephone and Cultivation were flat compared to the previous close. Ewo Silk, British Allied, Hui De, Dou Ye, Guangdong Paper, Shipping, and Steel all rose slightly.

Guangdong traders absorbed Yong Silk for immediate delivery again yesterday in the market. The situation of receiving goods outside the market was good. There was a slight rebound in the middle, but because people's hearts were scattered, many large households in the industry closed their positions, and the stock fell again after stabilizing.

### Many Large Households Still Closed Their Positions, and Chinese Stocks Were Initially Stable But Then Fell

Initially, because Yong Silk for immediate delivery opened at 275 yuan and Shanghai delivery opened at 277 yuan, there were immediate delivery closures, with supply and sales being delivered, forcing the price down to a low of 265 yuan for immediate delivery and 267 yuan for delivery. Yong Gong was lowered to the limit down. Liang Guang and Shanli purchased Yong Silk for cash, and those receiving goods outside the market were extremely active. The interest rate was slightly lower, at 1 jiao 8 and 2 jiao 2 and a half fen, and gradually rose to a high price of 276 yuan for immediate delivery and 277 yuan for delivery. After the buying interest of the Guangdong traders stopped slightly, there were sales at high prices, and there was a slight decline. Although there was a recovery afterwards, it was difficult to break through the opening line in the morning. At the close, there was a sudden large sell-off outside the market. Hengshu quickly sold to cash out. The noon close for Yong Silk for both cash and delivery was 29 yuan. Except for Zhongfang and Yaxing, which rose by half a percentage point in the midst of sluggish turnover, Wuhe continued to fall by 10 percent, and Yong Gong fell to the limit down again. Except for Zhabei New Asia Underwear, which rose slightly, and Hengfeng, which was flat, immediate delivery stocks all fell slightly. Delivery stocks included Qinxing, which fell by half a percentage point, and the rest fell slightly.

In the afternoon, only immediate delivery was done. Yong Silk was forced down to a low price of 264 yuan due to the news that the overnight report said that the US loans to China would be advanced, but the number of loans was negligible. Guangdong traders and small financial shops helped to absorb at low prices and recovered to 271 yuan. However, large households, such as Ye, closed their positions outside the market, and Wang sold in the market. The state bank's exchange difference was also unable to support the price. It became weak again before the close. However, there were also many who maintained at low prices and turned to consolidate. The three small hot stocks all worked hard themselves and showed stability. As a result, compared to the last close, Yong Silk, Xinhe, and Lilian in immediate delivery stocks fell slightly. Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, Zhonghai, Huaxin, and Zhongsheng rose slightly. Zhabei America saw stability. Old Huashang and Da Sanze recovered slightly.

The stock exchange will be closed for one day on November 12th, the birthday of Sun Yat-sen. The 53rd term of delivery will be done until the 10th.

Money Market Eases

[Report from this newspaper] The money market, which was tight in recent days, suddenly eased yesterday. The overnight interest rate fell to 1 jiao 7-8 fen, the interest rate for long and short positions in Chinese stocks was 2 jiao 3, and cash also gradually became abundant because the pay period had passed. Yesterday, the four banks and two bureaus had an exchange difference of 26.8 billion yuan, the large exchange bank had an exchange difference of 40.3 billion yuan, the foreign merchant bank had 13.6 billion yuan, the small exchange bank had an exchange difference of 27.1 billion yuan, the Bank of China had an exchange difference of 11.1 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications had an exchange difference of 13.2 billion yuan, the Agricultural Bank of China had an exchange difference of 8.1 billion yuan, the China Trust Bureau had an exchange difference of 32.7 billion yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau had an exchange difference of 2.7 billion yuan, and the Cooperative Bank had an exchange difference of 100 million yuan.

### The Promotion Office for Export Visa Measures is Under Study

[Report from this newspaper] When the Import and Export Management Committee was ordered to merge and establish on August 19th of this year, it was stipulated that export visa matters would be handled by the Export Promotion Office. However, since the visa methods and implementation procedures were still under study, they were not implemented for some time. Exporters still went through customs clearance and release after foreign exchange settlement by designated banks as in the past. It is now heard that the visa procedures are being drafted by the Export Promotion Office in conjunction with relevant parties, and will be announced and implemented once preparations are complete. It is reported that the significance of implementing this method is to provide the authorities with accurate and clear overall information as soon as possible, and to prevent the export price from being reported too low. The handling procedures will strive to be simple and fast, and will not deliberately create difficulties or delay the shipment of export goods. However, it is heard that exporters have expressed opposition to the export visa method, believing that it will only increase trouble and easily lead to abuses, which is harmful and not beneficial to export trade.

### The Deadline for Registration of Manufacturers for the Distribution of Yarn and Cloth by the Textile Construction Company Has Passed

[Report from this newspaper] The deadline for the registration of manufacturers for the distribution of yarn and cloth by the Textile Construction Company was originally set for February 15th of this year. However, due to requests from various parties, it was reopened in June. As of now, more than 200 manufacturers have registered. It is now heard that the company authorities believe that the source of cotton yarn is difficult, the number of new registrations is large, and there is not enough to distribute. Therefore, they have to restrict it appropriately. Therefore, it has been decided that only those who started production before the end of May of this year and have been in production for more than one month with supporting documents will be approved, and those after June will be processed later. The company has closed new registration applications on the 4th of this month.

The Textile Adjustment Committee Discusses Labor Costs

[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee is scheduled to hold a regular committee meeting at 4:00 PM today to discuss the issue of labor costs for spinning. The issue of joint distribution of cotton yarn with certificates will be discussed after the National Economic Commission makes a decision and will not be discussed for the time being. It is heard that General Chen Cheng, the Director of the Northeast Headquarters, in view of the lack of yarn and cloth in the Northeast, has specially dispatched Yang Chuoan, the Chairman of the Materials Adjustment Committee of the Headquarters, to Shanghai to ask the Textile Adjustment Committee to find a way to allocate 3,000 pieces of yarn and tens of thousands of bolts of cotton cloth to the Northeast to meet urgent needs. This matter will also be discussed at today's meeting.

### Artificial Silk Initially Weakened But Then Strengthened

The artificial silk market weakened at the beginning and then strengthened yesterday. No. 120 Asahi A-grade bright silk opened at 74 million yuan. The midday close rose to 5 million yuan again. In the afternoon, various parties frequently had purchasing interest, so it was raised by another 2 million yuan, and the final price was 75 million yuan. 4A goods were quoted at 63 million yuan, all up 2 million yuan from the previous day.

The factory-managed market remained quiet. The market situation continued to weaken yesterday. All grades of student goods were inactive.

The negotiated price for Hiranoshi goods was around 61.5 to 6.2 million yuan, also down 500,000 yuan from the previous day. The decline in ordinary Hiranoshi goods was the largest, while the asking price for Tokujo Hiranoshi goods remained firm.

The price of silk goods was slightly firm yesterday, up 200,000 yuan from the previous day. Dachang and Huaqiang goods opened at 24.45 million yuan, and buying interest was strong, so it rose gradually. The spot price at the close was 600,000 yuan, and the forward date was 750,000 yuan. The price of plaid crepe did not move, but the turnover was very low. All other goods were stable yesterday.

The Sugar Market Was Unstable

Yesterday, the sugar market slightly recovered due to rumors that the allocation price would be adjusted. The guild's quoted price for No. 24 coarse white small bags was 928,000 yuan, 6 bags were 945,000 yuan, No. 20 medium sand white was 880,000 yuan, and Taiwan red was 945,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the allocation price was rumored to be unchanged, and the market showed a loosening trend again. Shantou green was 720,000 to 718,000 yuan, Xinghua white was 915,000 to 910,000 yuan, Xing red was 800,000 to 789,000 yuan, Diaogreen was 730,000 yuan, and the second grade was slightly lower by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

### Overbought Positions Were Mostly Liquidated, and Selling Pressure Eased. Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Stopped Falling and Rebounded

No. 42 Blue Phoenix Rose by 1 Million Yuan

The cotton yarn market situation was mediocre at the beginning of yesterday's trading. Afterwards, due to the excessive decline caused by the Japanese invasion, overbought positions were mostly liquidated. There were not many sellers in the market. Moreover, with the easing of the money market, various retail investors and dyeing and weaving factories saw low prices and absorbed them. Therefore, the market price of No. 42 Blue Phoenix fine yarn finally rebounded by 1 million yuan compared to the previous day, reaching 33.3 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by 300,000 to 800,000 yuan.

In the cotton cloth market, the morning opening saw a large number of liquidations of overbought positions on the table, and asking prices fell. However, at 10:30 AM, due to the easing of the money market, the industry took action to buy, and the market rebounded after falling. However, the Hakka traders remained inactive, so as a result, 12-pound fine cloth only rebounded by 13,000 to 5,000 yuan for the top three or four grades. The price of Four Gentlemen Poplin fell by 50,000 yuan because the Textile Construction Company's supply and sales were very smooth, and people in the industry were less inclined to buy. The prices of other cloths rose and fell in turn.

Spot Cotton Turned Prosperous. The spot cotton market situation was stable yesterday. Yarn mills' buying interest turned healthy. Sellers, due to the urgency of the money market, were eager to sell, and prices softened instead. Yarn mills also absorbed at low prices, so transactions turned prosperous. The total turnover for the day was 3,100 bales, and the factory turnover was 2,800 bales. The stack exchange price turnover was 300 bales. The opening prices for each grade were 4.01 million for Middling, 4.01 million for Texas, 2.563 million for Haiti Tip, 3.55 million for Shashi, 3.7 million for Lingshi, 3.37 million for Liukou fine velvet, and 4.01 million for Uruguay.

### China Flying Wheel Thread Factory's Share Subscription Successfully Completed

[Report from this newspaper] Our country's thread manufacturing industry was dominated by foreign goods 20 years ago, which greatly affected the national economy. In the spring of 1929, Mr. Luo Liqun invested solely to establish the "China Flying Wheel Thread Factory," and its "Flying Wheel" wood yarn balls began to compete with foreign goods. After operating with difficulty for many years, it was recently reorganized into a joint-stock limited company. The prescribed capital is 24 billion yuan, 20% of which is publicly solicited. It is heard that most of it has been subscribed and is about to be successfully completed.

### Tea Market's Actual Sales Are Not Declining

Various types of domestic tea that have been active for a long time continued to maintain their popularity on the market yesterday due to continued appetite absorption in this area and other places. In the foreign-traded tea market, the large traders of Wuyuan, Tunxi, and Suian, etc., after discussing a batch with the French firm Yongxing the other day, although the firm still has purchasing interest at the moment, the sellers, in view of the lack of inventory in the market, have continued to develop the idea of firm sales, and transactions have turned inferior again. The prices are harder than before. As for Qimen black tea, the market remained calm due to the lack of compromise in the intake and output.

### Land Economics

— Yang Wu

Zhang Pijie, Introduction to Land Economics, published by Zhonghua Book Company, priced at 3.5 yuan, one of the Social Science Series of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center

Among the various social sciences, land economics is one of the last to be established. Moreover, the academic circles in our country have paid attention to this science later than those in Europe and America. Therefore, there are particularly few works on this topic. Before the war, there was only one book on land economics published in Chinese, which was a translation of Land Economics by the American Richard T. Ely. Another book was a translation of Land Economics Theory by the Japanese Tsuguro Kawada. The former focused on American-style land use, while the latter discussed land rent, land price, and land area in more detail. Each book has its own focus, and neither of them is a research work by Chinese people with China's land problems as the object. This is not only a shortcoming in our country's social sciences, but also a weakness that must be remedied for our country, where land problems are very serious and land reform is urgently needed. In this book, Introduction to Land Economics, which is just over 100,000 words, we can clearly see the author's efforts on this point, and it proves that his efforts have indeed yielded considerable results.

According to the author's preface, the original plan was to have 15 chapters, about 150,000 words. In addition to the existing 10 chapters, there are also chapters on land price (upper and lower), land rights (upper and lower), and land finance. There are only 10 chapters in the book, and the remaining 5 chapters have not been added to the re-edition this year, which is a pity. This situation is exactly a common problem in our country's writing circles: there is an upper volume but no lower volume, there is a preface but no postscript, there is an upper volume but no lower volume, which often stops many more promising studies halfway. This book is also inevitable, so it is not enough to criticize deeply, but this phenomenon is really a sad situation for the progress of our country's academics.

In addition to the general narrative, each chapter of the book expresses the author's unique insights into land economics. The first chapter, Introduction, points out that the research object of this science is "the relationship between people and land, people and people, and land and land that arise due to human economic behavior," and determines its nature as "empirical science, human science, and social science," and especially emphasizes the distinction between laws and trends to strengthen the social science nature of land economics. This chapter's discussion of research methods is generally quite satisfactory. The second chapter, Definition, Classification, and Characteristics of Land, is nothing special, but the land definition item can show the author's attention to this issue and his humble attitude. But the third chapter, Land and Population, is even more brilliant. There is a series of novel insights here, such as the relationship between people's dependence on land, the carrying capacity of land for people, and finally the two principles of countermeasures for our country's land and population problems. This section can be used as a reference for our country's population policy:

"First, if the land's carrying capacity cannot be significantly expanded, and the total population of our country is not less than that of any country in the world, we should no longer adopt a positive population increase policy, but should pay attention to improving the living standards of the people and improving the physical quality of the people, so as to replace the planned population policy with blind policies.

"Second, before the quality of the population is significantly improved and the quantity does not change greatly, we should actively expand the land's carrying capacity for the population. The conditions are as follows:

Adopt scientific and technological techniques to increase the planting index and expand the space base of the national economy, especially agricultural production;

Promote the industrialization policy, absorb a large amount of labor from the agricultural sector as much as possible, so as to reduce the pressure of the agricultural population on the land, which is a prerequisite for improving agricultural production;

Agricultural production should be changed from one-sided labor-intensive and manual operation to capital-intensive and scientific, rationalized, and light operation, so as to increase the agricultural capacity for population;

Domestic transplantation and foreign transplantation should be carried out simultaneously to thin out the population of the country and at the same time increase the space on which the people rely to survive." (Page 36)

Chapter 4, On Land Use, Chapter 5, On Agricultural Land, Chapter 6, On Urban Land, and Chapter 7, On Rich Resource Land, the contents of these four chapters are closely related, equivalent to a divided writing of one chapter. The central discussion object is completely focused on the power of land use. After careful research, the historical development of land use has advanced along the following four major trends: the trend of expanding the area of land use, the trend of intensifying the degree of land use, the trend of complicating the content of land use, and the trend of socializing the nature of land use. The establishment and recognition of this trend is the author's most successful achievement in land use theory.

Chapters 8, 9, and 10 are the upper, middle, and lower articles on land rent. According to the author's preface, "they occupy the most space. The materials and arguments in these three chapters are mostly taken from Land Rent, Volume 4 of Theoretical National Economics, written by my teacher Mr. Thiel, and other works he has written on land rent." According to him, Thiel was one of the most influential economists on the European continent who recently passed away, and his thought was the famous "Social Legal System School." The extent to which the author of this book was influenced by Thiel is not obvious in this book; on the contrary, in the discussion of land rent on taxation of land rent, it can be seen that he has a unique insight into this issue. The author declares his position, and in principle still supports the land rent tax policy and equal land rights, but in theory, he repeatedly points out that this policy and the taxation of land rent without labor cannot be as simple as imagined. That is, the result of implementing the taxation of land rent cannot "be taxed 100% without discount." It is possible that it will be less than enough or too much.

Judging from the theory and research attitude of the entire book, the author's characteristics are cautious and faithful, and his unique insights are also very obvious. It is quite suitable as a reference for beginners and a reference for studying land economics. However, what makes readers regret the most is that the whole book is incomplete, the whole picture is difficult to see, and it is only an introduction. There are still too few explanations and elaborations.

### Gandhi and Stalin

— Yang Shi

The leftist journalist Louis Fischer once stood at the crossroads of the world, looking up at what he thought were two stars—Gandhi and Stalin; in reality, he was walking the path of Stalin. He lived in the Soviet Union for fourteen years and had a group of children there. He wrote many dispatches praising Stalin for the "Nation" newspaper in Manhattan. However, by 1938, he could no longer tolerate the dictatorial style of communism and resolutely left the Soviet Union. His wife and children did not come out until later, with the help of Mrs. Roosevelt, they returned to the United States. In 1941, in his book "Men and Politics," he praised democracy and freedom, and exposed the secrets behind the Iron Curtain. Therefore, the publication of his "Gandhi and Stalin" is logical. Fischer admired Gandhi, praising Gandhi's "integration of the hesitations of the idealist and the impatience of the revolutionary into a non-violent revolution." Like Gandhi, he advocated "transforming people before transforming the system." However, Gandhi did not accept his suggestion to take action against Western countries many years ago. The little old man said, "How can I ask Westerners to adopt a non-violent policy before I persuade the impatience of the Indians?" Gandhi's down-to-earth approach made the author even more respectful.

After the author leaned towards Gandhi, he sharply criticized Stalin. In the book, he said, "Political warfare is clear and complex; the daily newspaper is the war report in this war... Undoubtedly, we hope to wage 90% of our political warfare against the Soviet Union, but they are unwilling to use this method... Therefore, the fundamental problems between the United States and the Soviet Union, or between dictatorship and democracy, cannot be solved by diplomatic means... The struggle between these two major forces will never end unless one side wins completely." However, Fischer believed that "Stalin does not need a third world war or a world violent revolution. His strategy is to maintain his rule and expand his sphere of influence as much as possible by using nerve warfare to confront Western countries." But according to the author, the Soviet Union can support a ten-year war.

To avoid this new crisis, the author suggested forming a new United Nations outside the Soviet Union, "abolishing the veto power because this veto power has been used by the Soviet Union to alienate the democratic countries. This new United Nations is not like an international government, but a whole." This is only passive, and this alone cannot save democracy and peace. The author believes that the active aspect requires a great price.

In this way, Fischer believes that capitalism cannot counter communism. He believes that a system similar to socialism with a "planned economy" can compete. He imagined, "State-owned capital and private capital can compete freely... If the British Labour Party fails, the future of the democratic world is very bad," "Farmland is like air, free for people to cultivate, without buying or selling, people's economies are equal... Marxism and Gandhism are mixed to benefit every people." This may be his illusion, just as he once imagined Stalin and Gandhi cooperating. (Louis Fischer's recent book "Gandhi and Stalin," a book review published in the October 6th issue of Time Magazine, translated to readers.)

### New English Dictionary

— Tong Fang

Compiled by Ge Chuanzhu, Gui Shaoyu, Wu Tiesheng, and Wu Mengtai

Published by Jingwen Publishing Bureau, first edition in July of the 36th year

The creation of words is based on the evolution of society. The more society evolves, the more new words are created, and old words that are outdated and unsuitable are unconsciously eliminated. The Second World War was an important turning point in modern history. The entire world has undergone great changes, reflecting the birth of new ideas and the abandonment of old traditions in military, political, economic, cultural, and educational fields. The English vocabulary, which represents the "universal language of the world," has also produced many new words and phrases with this war.

As long as we read books, newspapers, and magazines published in the United States and the United Kingdom, we will find many new words and phrases that cannot be found in ordinary dictionaries. Many readers are troubled by the difficulty of reading new newspapers and periodicals. It is not that they do not understand grammar and sentences, but that they encounter many new words and phrases that they do not understand. These new words and phrases affect our speed of reading newspapers and periodicals and hinder our understanding of the various things described in the books. Unless a new dictionary is published, we will not be able to break the barriers of thought.

This is a very useful new tool for the current book world. Recently, after reviewing it, I found it to be quite unique, so I will introduce it to readers. The words included in this dictionary include new words, new idioms, new meanings of old words, new usages of old words, and new slang, nearly 10,000 entries, all of which cannot be found in the most popular English-Chinese dictionaries on the market.

There is a convenience in checking, that is, words and phrases are arranged in alphabetical order, and phrases are not attached to any words. The part of speech will also be recorded in detail, and all phrases are treated as words. For example, allveryfine if auything should happen to on, etc. It seems that many new words in the fields of science and war have been collected, which should be of great help for reading scientific newspapers and periodicals. In addition to new words in English and American, general terms of other countries that have been recognized by the world are also collected. Many new slang and colloquialisms produced in English and American are adopted in this dictionary, which may be very convenient for us to read novels and general popular periodicals.

According to what the editors said in the preface, compiling this dictionary did take a lot of effort. In addition to referring to dictionaries of the same nature in English and American, they also extensively searched for modern readings (newspapers and periodicals), which shows that the compiling attitude of this dictionary is very cautious and different from copying and translating the original English and American dictionaries and appearing in China with a changed face.

### The Travels of Marco Polo

— An Shou

Translated by Feng Chengjun. Published by Commercial Press

Looking at "The Travels of Marco Polo" as a historical record can provide two important benefits.

First, we can get a glimpse of the living conditions of the people in China during the Song and Yuan Dynasties. Originally, Chinese historical records (in fact, Western history was the same in the past) had a huge shortcoming, which was to emphasize political activities and ignore social conditions. Therefore, we can see many unimportant royal family affairs, but there is no way to see more systematic descriptions of people's customs. "The Travels of Marco Polo," however, pays great attention to this aspect. For example, religious beliefs, food and clothing conditions, and marriage and funeral customs are all recorded. Although they are inevitably fragmented due to the limitations of the style, they are undoubtedly a valuable material for people studying Chinese history.

Second, we can use this to supplement some records of the "History of the Yuan Dynasty." The "History of the Yuan Dynasty" was hastily completed, and there are many fallacies. The records of political conditions in "The Travels of Marco Polo" are not many and not very accurate, but the reference value is still there. For example, in the second volume, it is recorded that the Yuan army's capture of Liyang was due to Western firearms, which is very believable. There are also many records of the killings of the princes of the Yuan Dynasty in the early Yuan Dynasty and the foreign wars of Yuan Shizu, which have differences from the "History of the Yuan Dynasty."

The original book is divided into four volumes. The first volume records the situation in northern West Asia and northwestern China, which is what Marco Polo saw and heard along the way from Europe to Mongolia at that time. The second volume records the court life of the Yuan Emperor and the situation in various provinces of China, which is the most important. The third volume records the situation in Japan, Vietnam, India, and the Nanyang regions. The fourth volume records the historical facts of the killings of the princes of the Yuan Dynasty in West Asia. What was the situation in ancient Asia? Even people who do not specialize in the history of the Yuan Dynasty want to know a little bit.

This translation provides many conveniences for readers because it has been annotated twice by Sha Haiang (A J H Chatignon, a Frenchman who became naturalized in China at the end of the Qing Dynasty) and the translator, correcting many errors and providing many necessary reference materials.

### Dostoevsky's "Poor People"

— Xiang Xiu

Almost including Gorky, many people have a terrible misunderstanding of Dostoevsky, even calling his genius "cruel genius." Adding the word "cruel" to "genius" can easily make people feel gloomy about his character.

Was Dostoevsky really cruel? Let's see how Lu Xun explained "cruel genius":

"All great inquisitors of the human soul must also be great criminals. The inquisitor exposes his evil in the courtroom, the criminal states his own good under the steps, the inquisitor exposes the filth in the soul, and the criminal illuminates the buried glory in the filth that is exposed. In this way, the depth of the soul is revealed.

"In the deepest soul, there is neither 'cruelty' nor mercy; but what reveals this soul to people is a 'realist in the highest sense'." (See the preface to "Poor People")

Here, not only is it a fair judgment on Dostoevsky, but also a profound confession of his own works. In the sense of a deep soul, Lu Xun and Dostoevsky actually have similarities. Moreover, both of them were most influenced by Gogol's works.

In his works, Dostoevsky specializes in showing us those who are suffering from diseases, and have abnormal, criminal, crazy, decaying, and mysterious characters. Those characters are always combined with exile, poverty, staff, hunger, disasters, diseases, and death sentences. The atmosphere in his works is also full of terrifying pressure. When reading them, it often leads you into a bleak and dark, hell-like gloomy realm, making you tremble with fear, as if you are standing in the criminal court being tried, someone is questioning your soul, and you will not dare to hide your sins. The so-called sin here is often moral, not necessarily legal, and related to Christian SIN.

The best explanation for Dostoevsky's works is still in his own words borrowed from Zossima:

"Don't be anyone's judge: humble love is a terrible force that is more powerful than violence. Only this meticulous love can give birth to deep hearts. You have to love people, don't be afraid of their sins; love those who fall into the pit of sin; love all of God's creators. You also have to be happy like children and birds.

"Life will give you many unfortunate things, but for these, you still have to be happy, you must bless life, and make other people bless life."

In fact, this so-called "cruel genius" is full of bright hope and joy of life. In those humble characters, he constantly discovers their lofty love and life, and the true meaning of his works is to show us the lofty humanity of the "insulted and injured."

"Poor People" is Dostoevsky's first work. The whole police are written with quotation marks. There is no linked story, the letters talk about daily life trivialities, each other's inner pain. An aging accountant in middle age, who has been poor for a long time, is like a small grass that never sees the sun, growing in the cold world, one is a sick girl, an orphan who has lost her parents, like a remnant flower that has been blown down by the autumn wind, drifting everywhere. They are all penniless poor people, but God arranged for them to live in a place far away from each other. Because "they are all fallen people in the world," they secretly protect each other, conveying love in letters, that kind of spiritual union that transcends their flesh, clinging tightly to each other in extremely difficult and distressed lives. Struggling in despair, seeking survival in struggle, although it is painful, there is a kind of great happiness. But this kind of happiness does not continue for long, and the poor girl is forced into marriage by a middle-aged landlord. She has no power to resist. In the last letter, she said, "Now you must get used to living without me! How will you argue! Lonely, who will I throw you to here, my kind, precious, only friend..."

In this desperate cry, the old man's heart broke. What was left to him was a blank life!

Everything is written so sincerely and movingly. In their correspondence, various secret characters are also engraved around them, some scolding them, and some sympathizing with them.

Mr. Ju said this about Dostoevsky's works in "Russian Literature":

"His works are very similar to Greek tragedies because they express the adventure of solemn spirit, but not in the Christian faith and hope. Like Greek tragedies, they give readers the fearless courage of inspiration, never disappointing; although Dostoevsky faces evil face to face, he never hides or avoids those dangers, but the only purpose is to seek good souls in ugliness and sin..."

Now, we can easily understand the true meaning of the so-called "cruel genius." (This book is published by Wei Yuye, Wenguang Bookstore)

### Listening to the Voice of Humanity

— Lun

––On the Origin and Theory of Speech

The question of the origin of human language has long interested people. For centuries, countless scholars have created countless theories, all trying to explain how the language of primitive people originated, and why there are so many languages ​​in the world.

The ancient Greek scholar Meto. Schechiriski said: "People initially lived a life similar to that of wild beasts. They gathered together out of fear of wild beasts and began to recognize each other. But their pronunciation was still meaningless and unclear; this sound was not a language at first. Like this, there are groups of people all over the world, so the basis for each different language was established."

Many philosophers speculate that primitive people used spontaneous, involuntary sounds to express the feelings and impressions they had when they first saw something or a phenomenon. Gradually, these natural cries became fixed names for this phenomenon or object, and thus became single words in the language.

Nuyale believed that language was produced at the same time as the joint labor of the most ancient people. Therefore, verbs were the first words to appear in the language. Von's opinion is that the language of sound and human consciousness occur at the same time. Soviet scholar Nikolai Yakovlevich Ma'er determined that the development of human language is: people talk in countless languages. After that, people have combined sound and sign language.

Not long ago, Dutch scholar Wang, Jinnaigen explained that the earliest sounds of human beings developed from the sucking movements of the tongue and throat that every baby understands. From here, the oldest sound of pulling the tongue from the teeth appeared in the writing, and even now, we can hear this sound in many primitive tribes. The original language is composed of complex ten-syllable sounds, and the appearance of vowels is much later. The language of sound started very late and was immediately composed of single words. However, Wang, Jinnaigen's dogmatism cannot be agreed upon.

American scholar Sandak determined that the ancestors of people had involuntary movements of the vocal organs from the earliest times. This movement produced ambiguous sounds that accompanied the emotions and experiences of human ancestors, even when they were alone in natural conditions. Single words appeared from this involuntary ambiguous sound and sounds with specific things or the meaning of actions. Later, these single words were used by this person's companions and became the heritage of the entire primitive tribe. Sandak's theory is still important because it shows that the development of language is a regular natural process that is not interfered by any supernatural forces.

The whole story takes place in a standard British-style hotel. Coward introduced the British people who were intently listening to the United Nations war reports broadcast on shortwave radios, their tense emotions, and their eager moods; he also introduced a vision of a British female spy being tortured and abused to death by Nazi stormtroopers. An underground military leader said to the captured Nazi special agent: "If you are leaving this world with resentment that the British are too inhospitable, please think about the British houses that you burned, the British property that you robbed, and the British people that you tortured, tormented, and killed. You have taken too much, and even paying back with blood is not enough!"

### The Face of Hitler on the British Stage - A New Drama Sweeping the British People

— Liangzai

"If Hitler lands in England," what a terrible fantasy, how did the artillery fire collapse the grand buildings of London? How did the bright red flames devour the British families and properties that have been treasured and preserved for centuries? How did Hitler's Gestapo run rampant in Britain, murdering, looting, oppressing, tormenting, and treating those gentlemanly British people like cattle and horses? Recently, a new scene of "Peace! Peace in our Time" was staged in London. It is the latest masterpiece of the famous playwright Noel Coward. The people of London flocked to see it, and when the show was over, most of the audience bowed their heads, and some even had tears that had not dried. They seemed to have personally experienced this great disaster in their imagination in a short period of two or three hours.

Coward's rich imagination has created such a powerful story that many people believe that if London really fell into the hands of the devil, the actual situation would be similar to this.

In the plot, Churchill, the British prime minister of the war of resistance, was assassinated. Hitler actually convened a parliament and organized a puppet government, with all kinds of ugly monsters jumping out and ghostly shadows looming. But on the other hand, these kind British people put down their top hats and stood up stubbornly. They gathered all available weapons and organized a powerful underground army to deal with the Nazis.

### Anecdotes on Couplets

— Wang Baili

When Yongle was in the Yanwang's mansion, one day it was very cold. He warmed himself by drinking wine. During the banquet, he accidentally got a sentence: "The weather is cold and the ground is frozen, water cannot be water without a point." At that time, the monk Tong Yan was present, and he immediately responded: "The country is in chaos and the people are worried, who is the master if the king does not come forward?" They laughed together.

When the country is prosperous and the people are happy, celebrities and elegant scholars often have the act of drinking wine in the snow. According to legend, one day, Mr. Sun Yiyan of Ruian was drinking with his disciples. Seeing children piling up Guanyin, he suddenly felt and said: "The snow accumulates Guanyin, and the sun transforms the body and returns to the sea." After thinking for a long time, he could not get its matching sentence. A disciple said: "I have a pair, I don't know if it is possible?" Then he read: "Clouds become Arhats, the wind blows and walks up to the Western Paradise." Mr. Yi Shou kept his belt on.

There was a Xiucai who set up a museum to teach Meng. One day he thought of wine. There was a vegetable vendor at the door. Xiao Kangman ordered a pot to sell it. The vegetable vendor thought for a long time and said: "I have a couplet, can the gentleman answer it?" Xiucai said: "Try to say it." He said: "A long-necked tin pot has a mouth on its waist." Xiucai stared blankly and could not answer. He hurried to the room to prepare his luggage for his return plan. He accidentally realized when he opened the box and said: "A square-headed iron lock has a beard on its belly." He hurried out to look for the vegetable vendor, but the vegetable vendor was nowhere to be found.

### Entering and Leaving the Netherworld

— Hulu

French archaeologist Martin discovered the skull of a human being 150,000 years ago - see this newspaper on November 3.

Isn't it like a disease? What do archaeologists say? How strong is the skull of the primitive man? It has not rotted for 150,000 years, an unprecedented miracle

I often see it reported in newspapers, researching history, the dry bones of the ancients were wronged! Now that the time has come, ghosts should cry: death is also difficult.

### Retreating Bird

— Lin Mei

People, beasts, and insects can walk forward, but they can also retreat to the left, right, and back. But have you ever seen a bird fly backwards? Your answer is often no. However, the Spring and Autumn Annals clearly records "six yiyi retreated and flew, and meteorites fell in Song." The yiyi is a bird, isn't this a clear proof of the retreat of birds? Because we have never seen a bird flying backwards, we have to suspect that this may be an absurd record; because there is often an unscientific absurdity in ancient books.

In fact, there are birds that retreat and fly. The name of that kind of bird is called "hummingbird." The "yiyi" mentioned in the Spring and Autumn Annals may be this kind of hummingbird.

The hummingbird is the bird with the strongest flying ability among birds. Its body is considered the smallest among birds. The feet of other birds on the ground cannot move from one in front of the other, so they also flap their wings when walking. Because it has been using its wings, its chest muscles are very developed, which is unmatched by any bird.

The legs of hummingbirds are very short, and the elbows are deeply embedded in the muscles. Because they cannot move freely, they cannot walk. In order to make up for this defect, it has the ability to fly in any direction. It can fly forward, sideways, up, down, and even backwards. No bird other than the hummingbird has ever flown backwards. Not only can it fly backwards, but it can also stay in the air, allowing it to consider the direction of flight.

Why do hummingbirds fly backwards? Because it is like a bee, it has to go to the heart of the flower to collect eggs. When it uses its slender beak to pierce into the heart of the flower to take honey, and then pulls its long beak out of the heart of the flower, it has to retreat backwards. Sometimes, it finds small insects that it can eat in the upside-down heart of the flower. It has to use its slender beak to peck, but it cannot hide the flower branches and scare away the small insects, so it has to fly and stop in the air and peck at its snack with its long beak. For this reason, it has developed the ability to retreat and stay in the air.

### Talking about T-Junction Traffic

— Wu Daquan

After paying attention to the command of traffic at T-junctions many times, I found that there are two major schools of command methods: one school does not prohibit the vehicles of the same direction of "one horizontal" when the vehicles of the T "one straight" make a big turn; the other school prohibits it. The advantages and disadvantages of these two schools are not obvious at T-junctions where the traffic is not dense, but at T-junctions where the traffic is dense, the inappropriateness of the former school's command method is immediately revealed, as shown in the figure on the left:

According to the figure on the right, if vehicles in the same direction of "one horizontal" are allowed to continue to move forward, then four "motor vehicles" must be embedded in the line, and two or three "human-powered vehicles" must also be embedded in the line. The four that want to insert into the line must cut off the line that is making a big turn. As a result, in the triangle area, a traffic jam is caused. In the triangle area, there are many and mixed human-powered vehicles making a big turn and human-powered vehicles moving in the same direction. Vehicles often collide, forming a difficult situation to resolve. In this situation, traffic falls into extreme chaos, so horns sound in chaos, quarrels arise, hands are used to fight, and order is immediately destroyed. Therefore, I feel that when making a big turn at a T-junction, vehicles of "one horizontal," regardless of the opposite direction or the same direction, must be prohibited from moving forward. This aspect of the command method should be unified.

### Strange Occupations

— Lin Lin

Among insects and plants, some are indeed very peculiar; and their peculiarity is often unnoticed by the average person.

Plants, for example, are even stranger; and most of these plants grow in the tropics.

"Orphan Grass," as its name suggests, has no mother because it is a rootless plant that parasitically grows on tree trunks.

"Hundred-Year Grass" never dies; if it is not taken by humans, when you crush a leaf of "Hundred-Year Grass," its needle-like leaves are connected to many thin and tough fibers; therefore, the Native American Indians of Central and South America use these fibers to weave very strong fabrics.

There is a type of palm tree that stores a hidden water tank at the base of its leaves; cutting open the end of the leaf reveals about a pint of clear water. "Lianas" also flow with a stream of clear white water after being cut open. There is also a more magical type called "Cow Tree," cutting open its trunk actually makes it flow with a sweet and delicious liquid that tastes almost the same as cow's milk.

There is a kind of vine that grows with two sharp small leaves, which can be used for shaving and trimming beards.

There is also a "Rape Tree" in North Africa, which will "rape" people to death alive, because when people touch the "stimulating part" of its branches, they are wrapped by the roots of the "Rape Tree" and then die.

### Bernays Reveals the Secrets of the Four Powers' Diplomacy

— Shan

We have received reports that Song had informed his government that the Soviet Union had made demands beyond the Yalta secret agreements. Since the negotiations were conducted according to President Roosevelt's instructions, I became interested. Fearing that Mr. Song might not be able to withstand Soviet pressure and might make further concessions before understanding our attitude, I notified the Chinese government, with the President's approval, that we did not advise China to make any concessions beyond the terms of the Yalta secret agreements.

China and the Soviet Union eventually concluded a treaty, but the facts revealed that our concern for Dalian was correct. Two years after Japan's defeat, Dalian was still not a free port. Before a ship could enter this port, it had to obtain permission from Moscow, not only for the ship but also for the people on board.

In a later meeting, Stalin told the President and me that the Japanese ambassador in Moscow had inquired about the Soviet Union's willingness to serve as an intermediary to end the war. Stalin said that this request did not indicate that Japan was willing to surrender unconditionally as demanded by the Allies; the tone was very vague, so Mr. Molotov only told the Japanese ambassador that the matter would be discussed with him again soon. Stalin said that later the Japanese ambassador sent another official document. It stated that Japan was willing to send Duke Konoe to Moscow to show Japan's intention to end the war, but if it were required to surrender unconditionally, Japan would definitely fight to the end with all its strength. Stalin added that he had therefore sent a letter to the Japanese ambassador, explaining that because this point was very vague and there was no specific proposal, it was impossible to give a definite reply. President Truman expressed his approval of Stalin's actions.

At this time, Secretary Stimson told us that he had received a report on the atomic bomb test in New Mexico on July 16. The bomb had been as successful as desired, and if used, it would surely annihilate the already unstable enemy in one fell swoop. Before the test, we agreed that if it proved successful, we would first give the Japanese a final stern warning and then use it.
