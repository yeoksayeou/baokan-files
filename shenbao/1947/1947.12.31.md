### Overseas Chinese Rice Merchants in Siam Request Relaxation of Food Control

[Central News Agency Bangkok, 30th Dispatch] According to the most reliable sources, representatives of our overseas Chinese rice merchants met with Siamese Prime Minister Nai Khuang Aphaiwong on the 27th of this month and presented a petition requesting fair treatment for overseas Chinese rice mills. Nai Khuang's reply was: "I am willing to help you, but I am powerless." The Siamese government's rice control plan was originally scheduled to be implemented on New Year's Day, but it has actually been implemented. When the Siamese Prime Minister received Chinese reporters on Christmas Day, he promised to make changes to the above plan, but the Siamese Minister of Commerce ignored this promise of the Prime Minister at a cabinet meeting. He also stated that the reason why the Siamese authorities handed over the right to purchase rice to the Siamese Rice Company and other small rice mills was to reward these companies and factories for their faithful service to the government. Recently, some newspapers here reported that some giants among Siamese rice merchants (including the assistant manager of the Siamese Rice Company) were arrested for smuggling rice, which surprised all foreign observers. Representatives of our overseas Chinese rice merchants are now making a final effort for their survival. Representatives of our overseas Chinese merchants visited the Siamese Minister of Commerce again on the 30th, hoping that the Siamese government would make a minimum concession on the rice control law.

U.S. Aid to China Plan Expected to Be Approved by Congress, Candidates to Host the Plan Undecided

[United Press Washington, 29th Dispatch] Senior officials told United Press on the 29th that General Wedemeyer had not been mentioned for the position of hosting the U.S. aid to China plan in the future, and was not under consideration. As for discussing and deciding who will host this plan, it will not happen until the aid to China plan is submitted to Congress. All parties suggest that the aid to China plan will be approved.

[United Press Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Regarding the aid to China plan being drafted by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, which is preparing to submit it to the U.S. Congress in January next year, there is no news from the Chinese and American officials here. It is said that the plan is expected to include both economic and military assistance. The U.S. Embassy here has not had any discussions with the Chinese government, and the Chinese Embassy in Washington has discussed it. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of National Defense also know nothing about it. Some parties here believe that it is "unusual" for the U.S. State Department to draft an important aid to China plan without contacting the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing or the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Perhaps Marshall believes that all the information he currently has is sufficient to cope with it. Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan told United Press reporters last week that the Chinese Embassy in Washington and the U.S. government have discussed the aid to China issue, but it is not known whether it is about Marshall's so-called long-term plan or the 18 million emergency plan recently passed by Congress.

### New Year's Eve and Compassion

--On the Student Fundraising Movement to Relieve Refugees

The eve of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, today, is upon us. In these difficult times, those who are fortunate enough to sit comfortably at home celebrating family reunions, amidst the atmosphere of lights and feasting, if they think of the countless compatriots who are still waiting for help in the cold and at the end of the year, as long as their conscience has not been extinguished, will surely be inspired by innate compassion. We only need to look at how young students have been running around and appealing for refugees these past few days to believe that all people share the same heart and the same principle. It is truly the so-called "a heart of compassion is something all people possess!"

This year's winter relief efforts in Shanghai were initiated early by the municipal government in October, followed by the municipal council's decision to raise funds. Various sectors of society then followed with a well-organized winter relief committee. Since its promotion, it has shown considerable results. It is said that the target of 60 billion in relief funds, due to the enthusiasm of all parties and the effectiveness of the methods, will not be difficult to raise in full within a short period of time. According to the original plan, setting up office accounts, providing porridge, distributing winter clothing, and establishing shelters are being carried out one by one. The 200,000 refugees in this city who urgently need relief will certainly be comforted and able to overcome their difficulties. This is truly a special event in this city this year, worthy of being prominently written about when settling accounts on New Year's Eve.

On the streets, in residences, in restaurants and hotels, and in government agencies and organizations, one can see groups of three or five students everywhere. They hold small flags, carry the symbols of "Save from Hunger, Save from Cold," and reach out to the citizens to solicit winter clothing and cash. They have keen awareness, so they can immediately accept and respond to the municipal government's call to relieve refugees. Before the social mobilization had become widespread, their activities had already quickly unfolded. They did not wait for others to persuade them or for others to urge them, but immediately and voluntarily engaged in the work. They have sincere compassion, so they see the hunger of the refugees as their own hunger; they see the cold of the refugees as their own cold; they see the refugees sleeping on the streets, without beds or blankets, with many turning into corpses overnight, and they can no longer comfortably stay in their own dormitories without coming out to lend a hand to the refugees. These tens of millions of refugees came from bandit-controlled areas, having suffered the hardships of "struggle," "liquidation," and "massacre." Under the Communist bandits' "Three Alls" policy, these victims are experiencing the same fate as the elders and brothers in many of the students' own hometowns. This has sparked the compassion of young students, who see relieving refugees as relieving themselves. On the 28th, at the awards ceremony for underprivileged students held at the gymnasium, more than 2,000 students generously donated their 20,000 yuan refreshment allowance each, preparing to send it to the winter relief association for distribution to refugees. When this act of righteousness was announced, thunderous applause erupted. Only the poor truly understand the poor; underprivileged students relieving refugees is precisely the highest expression of compassion. The Chinese people are often seen as a cruel and selfish nation, and the saying "each sweeps the snow from his own door, and does not care about the frost on another's roof" is often taken as a portrayal of the Chinese people's selfishness. Originally, in the context of ten years of internal and external troubles, with murder as commonplace, it is sometimes inevitable that people become numb and lack the heroic spirit of public service; however, this is ultimately only a temporary and accidental phenomenon, and cannot be used to explain the Chinese national character. The vigorous development of the Shanghai winter relief movement and the spirit of selflessness shown by young students are both powerful rebuttals to this misconception.

Due to the simultaneous mobilization of students from various schools in various places, the fundraising movement is quite widespread, and its impact will also be very profound. If the citizens rise up and respond to and support this movement, the fundraising results may be excellent. Those in charge of relief may be encouraged by the youth and work even harder, quickly and effectively, so that the cash and goods donated by the citizens are all used for the benefit of the refugees. As for the tens of thousands of refugees, they will certainly benefit from it, take it as comfort, and reduce and overcome unnecessary troubles that may arise in the relief process--such as refugees not wanting to enter shelters, fake refugees taking the opportunity to profit, and unscrupulous people using the good name of fundraising to enrich themselves.

Regarding the students' refugee relief movement, in the sense of human compassion, we not only have no reason to criticize it, but we should also encourage it. However, in order to truly relieve refugees and reduce unexpected malpractices, we would like to offer three points of technical advice regarding the fundraising work of various organizations:

First, our relief movement must be unified under the Winter Relief Association. The Winter Relief Committee is a comprehensive social organization responsible for hosting this relief effort. It includes all sectors of Shanghai, with fundraising, distribution, auditing, and an accountant's audit report, which can be trusted. Any organization should establish close contact with the association and be guided by it. Any organization's fundraising booklet, whether for goods or cash donations, should be obtained from the Winter Relief Association; the donated items, unless otherwise specified by the association, should also be submitted to the association for unified distribution work. This has two advantages: 　The items raised and distributed can be absolutely audited. In this kind of big city, malpractices are often unavoidable in the fundraising process. We cannot bear to see the pure enthusiasm of student fundraising sometimes suffer unjust accusations due to negligence in handling. If all fundraising work of various organizations is unified under the relief association, then this kind of possible error can be avoided. 　If all items raised by any organization are handed over to the relief association, then they can be distributed evenly and according to needs when distributed to refugees, so that there will be no duplication of supplies, and those who impersonate refugees to take advantage of the situation will inevitably know to restrain themselves.

Second, fundraising must be divided into districts for distribution. Most of the schools in this city are located in the North and West districts. If each school fundraises nearby or enters the downtown area for fundraising without a plan, it is inevitable that some areas will be heavily solicited while others will not be. This will not only affect the results of fundraising, but also make those who have been solicited repeatedly feel troubled, while those who have not been solicited feel that they still have items that cannot be donated. The other day, at a press conference, the mayor advocated that the collection of winter clothing should be carried out by district and distributed by district. This is a good decision, and we should do it this way.

Third, the wording of fundraising should be pure and simple; the fundraising methods should especially avoid harassment. Originally, "saving from hunger and saving from cold" stems from human compassion. Conscience and ability are triggered at the slightest touch, and there is no need for lengthy speeches. And what must be especially noted is that the psychology of Chinese philanthropists is that as long as the recipients of charity benefit, the donors can be comforted. It is absolutely impermissible to solicit donations from people on the one hand, while on the other hand saying that the view that former landlords in northern Jiangsu are becoming refugees is most likely to hinder fundraising efforts. Today, we only ask whether they are refugees, and we cannot ask about their past circumstances. If a small landlord of the past is now "struggled" to utter ruin by the Communist bandits, can it be said that he is not a refugee? As for soliciting donations along the road, asking for money from door to door, again and again, with one group going and another group coming, with endless solicitors and limited respondents, will it not make the general public feel harassed? It is permissible to donate willingly, but not to donate by coercion! Peaceful donations are permissible, but harassing donations are not!

Students' primary responsibility is to study. This time, being moved by compassion, they have stepped out of the school gates to engage in fundraising and relief efforts, which is highly commendable. However, as the winter vacation is approaching and the final exams are imminent, the students' fundraising work cannot last long. We hope that due to the students' enthusiastic fundraising this time, it will inspire more widespread and profound compassion among the citizens, and that they will continue this relief work until the expected goal is achieved. As the weather is cold and the year is coming to an end, we sincerely appeal to philanthropists on behalf of the tens of thousands of refugees!

### Sun Yueqi Arrives in Shanghai

Discusses Issues such as Industry and Mining in the Northeast

Will Return to the Capital to Report on the Inspection

[Our Newspaper] Sun Yueqi, Deputy Chairman of the National Resources Commission, inspected industry and mining in the Northeast some weeks ago and flew back to Shanghai from Peiping yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. He will return to the capital to report within days. According to Mr. Sun, Director Chen and others have stationed heavy troops in the key industrial and mining areas of the Northeast. Although the situation in Shenyang is quite tense at present, the various industries and mines are still operating normally, and no preparations for retreat have been made, because suppressing rebellion is different from resisting aggression, and it is not feasible to consider relocating production. However, due to insufficient power fuel, many of the industries and mines in the Northeast have not been able to produce to their full capacity. For example, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant originally planned to export 200,000 tons of steel this year, but this work has gradually stagnated since mid-May. The environment in North China is more stable than in the Northeast, and the various industries and mines are actively increasing production, with no other plans. As for Japanese reparations materials, the first batch is more than 9,000 sets of machine tools, totaling about 4,000 tons. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will send ships to Japan to pick them up early next month. These machines have been largely allocated, with 2,500 sets sold by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to private factories, 3,000 sets to the Ministry of National Defense, 500 sets each to the National Resources Commission and the Ministry of Communications, and 500 sets to the Ministry of Education. There was a previous proposal to relocate the Sino-Indian oil pipeline to the Yumen Oilfield, but it was abandoned because it was considered that the oil pipeline was too thin, with a working life of only two years, and it had already been used for more than a year in the past, so it would be worthless to relocate it again. China's uranium mines are located in Guangxi, the Dashiqiao area south of Shenyang, and the Beidaqingshan Mountains in Baotou, but given the current state of industry and science in China, it is still difficult to exploit them. I am unaware of the US plan to send an airborne uranium prospecting team to China. The National Resources Commission has agreed to return the generator of the Jiang Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to the Shanghai Huashang Electric Company, and to supplement it with the 5,000-kilowatt generator that will soon be transported from Tianmei.

### Spokesperson of the Ministry of Education Speaks on Regulations of Student Self-Government Associations

Believes Criticism in a Certain Newspaper is Inappropriate

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] According to a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education: the active significance of this revision of the regulations for student self-government associations by the Ministry has already been discussed by Counselor Liu Yingshi (that is, the remarks of the education authorities published in this newspaper yesterday). On the 29th, the editorial of a certain newspaper criticized the regulations, saying that the Ministry was preventing student activities. If students do not use their status to engage in illegal activities, the Ministry has no intention of preventing them. On the contrary, the youth's patriotic ideas and spirit of service are precisely what the Ministry pays attention to and cultivates. As early as the 19th year of the Republic of China, the central government promulgated the general outline for the organization of student self-government associations, which was suspended after the 24th year. Later, the Ministry of Education believed that self-government associations could train students to learn democracy, and in the 32nd year, it revised and promulgated the regulations for student self-government associations. This year, with the implementation of constitutional government imminent, there were some places in the original regulations that were no longer appropriate. For example, the original regulations stipulated that the directors of the association must report whether they were party members or group members, and that the general assembly should be replaced by the representative assembly. All of these required revision, and were therefore revised. The prohibition of participating in various extracurricular group activities mentioned by a certain newspaper was originally contained in Article 2 of the original regulations, and was not added this time. Because the student self-government association is a student organization, and the student's status is actually derived from the school, if they leave the school, they are no longer students. If the self-government association is allowed to participate in extracurricular group activities, it will be no different from ordinary civic groups, and should be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and its regulations should also not be formulated by this Ministry. Regarding the stipulations that the student self-government association should be responsible for guiding the school authorities, and that its purpose is to promote virtue, intelligence, physical fitness, and aesthetics, and that there should be five departments: learning, health, service, discipline, and affairs, all of these were clearly stipulated in the original regulations, and have been implemented for many chapters. However, a certain newspaper referred to them as newly created clauses and rashly commented on them, indicating that it had not carefully investigated past and current education laws, and was merely making inferences based on available materials, as a theory catering to young people. As for the section that student self-government association officials should be elected from those who have excellent academic performance and leadership ability, the newspaper would probably not advocate that those with poor academic performance and conduct be elected as any officials. In short, youth should be guided according to the situation, and they should also be trained to learn, so they should not be over-indulged. If they are allowed to be accustomed to manipulating, controlling, disobeying discipline, not respecting others, pleasing only themselves, and disliking those who oppose them while they are in school, and they develop habits, they will only reverse right and wrong and confuse black and white when they enter society in the future, and increase the source of social chaos. What kind of education would such education become? I am afraid that it will be deeply hated by the newspaper.

### Strike Wave Spreads at National Central University

School Administration Meeting to Have Important Decisions Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The problem of student strikes at National Central University continues to expand. As of the 30th, 33 departments in the five colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, Science, Engineering, and Agriculture, totaling 107 grades, have gone on strike. At 2 PM, they gathered in the dormitory, formed a team, held flags, shouted slogans, and marched to the university's Academic Affairs Office to petition. Then, they sent representatives to meet with Acting President Qi Shounan. The representatives put forward four demands and waited for the President's response. At that time, the petitioning students stood quietly in the square in front of the auditorium, waiting for news. After a long time, President Qi addressed the students, asking why the student self-government association, which opposed domination, wanted to dominate the university administration. All the students were extremely dissatisfied when they heard this, and immediately rioted and made a lot of noise. President Qi then declared that everything would be decided at the school administration meeting on the afternoon of the 31st, and the students began to disperse. The four demands of the students are: A. Withdraw the order to dissolve the department representative assembly and the standing committee. B. Withdraw the order to punish the standing committee members and department representatives. C. The school must not interfere in the election of the board of directors. D. Dean Sha Xue Ling should resign for dereliction of duty.

From now on, relief work has been transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs in accordance with the Executive Yuan's order, and post-war work will be taken over by the newly established Post-War Reconstruction Committee. In accordance with the above provisions, the ERA should be abolished immediately, and it has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be concluded at the end of this year."

However, if the two men are still in Nanjing and unable to return in time, the farewell meeting will be changed to tomorrow.

[Another Report] All vehicles from the ERA's South China, Central China, and North China branch offices have now been fully allocated, totaling 2,890 vehicles, including 27 in Kowloon, 340 in Guangdong, 384 in Guangxi, 463 in Hunan, 210 in Hubei, 258 in Jiangxi, 39 in Fujian, 128 in Anhui, 159 in Jiangsu, 463 in Henan, 245 in Beiping and Tianjin, and 173 in Qingdao. 1,045 vehicles are awaiting distribution in Shanghai, and the Ministry of Communications has taken 217 vehicles from the items stockpiled in Shanghai.

Content of Rooks' Letter to the President

To President Chiang Kai-shek: Before the UNRRA's China Office closes, on behalf of UNRRA, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Your Excellency and the people of your country for your past cooperation with UNRRA in promoting UNRRA's work. Especially because your country has encountered numerous difficulties in the eight-year war of resistance, it is even more commendable to be able to cooperate in this way.

We believe that the US$133,251,000 worth of food that UNRRA has provided to your country can alleviate the famine. We are also pleased to hear that although your country's food situation is still difficult, it has improved greatly compared to 1945 and 1946. We hope that future rice and wheat harvests will be able to further reduce the degree of famine under the compensation of agricultural machinery and fertilizers.

Regarding medicine, we have also done our best to transport and aid your country in order to save lives. In terms of post-war reconstruction, UNRRA will provide US$166,742,000 for industrial and transportation purposes, and US$72,460,000 for agriculture. I am pleased to hear that your government has decided to organize a Post-War Reconstruction Committee to continue to promote reconstruction work.

The staff of our office in China and the people in Washington have all found it very pleasant to work with your government and the ERA, especially admiring the arduous work of Chiang Tingfu and Huo Hezhu, the two Directors. Finally, I and all my colleagues wish your country the early achievement of reconstruction and nation-building.

### Wallace Announces Presidential Candidacy as Independent Candidate - Delivers Speech Attacking Current US Policy

[United Press, Chicago, 29th] Former US Vice President Henry Wallace delivered a nationwide radio address tonight, declaring, "I am running for president in 1948 as an independent candidate." Wallace said, "Today there is a greater threat than ever before, the seriousness of which is unprecedented in human history. This threat can be overcome with a new political lineup. The new political lineup requires the organization of a new party. I hereby announce that I will participate in next year's US presidential election as an independent candidate."

Wallace also announced his platform, stating, "Universal military training is the first step towards fascism. We will do our best to fight it, and we will fight against all congressmen who support it. The new party must implement a vigorous plan for abundance and security, not a plan for poverty and war. If we can prepare for peace on the same vast scale as we prepare for war, we can prevent economic decline and war. Countless Americans have asked me to engage in this great struggle. The more votes for peace in 1948, the more the world will understand that America does not support the bipartisan reactionary warmongering policy that is dividing the world into two armed camps, which will inevitably lead to American soldiers lying sideways in the Soviet snow in cold-weather clothing."

[Associated Press, Chicago, 29th] Neutral political observers believe that the main result of former US Vice President Henry Wallace joining the presidential race will be to greatly reduce President Truman's chances of re-election. Wallace attacked military aid to China and Greece as contributing to the high cost of living in the United States. He said: "The American people have already read in the newspapers about Congress passing absurd appropriations for military adventures in Greece and Turkey, and billions of appropriations for arming the United States. This is gradually making us realize that these newspaper headlines have become a part of our daily lives. We suddenly realize that we cannot involve the people of the world in the next great war, and we must enjoy less food, clothing, and housing conveniences in our daily lives."

[United Press, Chicago, 29th] Henry Wallace is 59 years old and from Ohio. He was originally a Republican, but he supported Democrat Al Smith in 1928 and the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Wallace served as Secretary of Agriculture in Roosevelt's first two terms and then as Vice President and Secretary of Commerce in Roosevelt's third term. In 1946, he was dismissed by Truman for publicly opposing former Secretary of State James Byrnes' hardline policy towards the Soviet Union.

### Truman Feels Threatened After Wallace Joins Race - Democratic Party Political Machinery Shaken

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] President Truman's hopes for re-election have been dealt a major blow after Henry Wallace decided to run for president. Wallace intends to work for Wallace in industrial areas, and Truman cannot afford to lose votes in industrial areas. Wallace plans to run in New York, California, and Illinois, which account for 90 votes in the national electoral votes. Only 266 votes are needed to win the presidency. However, not all of Roosevelt's New Deal faction support Wallace, and labor unions do not support him either. So far, only the Communist and Illinois Progressive parties are supporting Wallace. However, Wallace does not hope to win next year, but has a long-term vision for 1952. [United Press, Chicago, 30th] The Democratic Party's political machinery has been shaken after former Vice President Henry Wallace declared yesterday that he would run for president as an independent candidate. According to political figures, since Wallace has criticized the so-called "bipartisan reactionary warfare policy," presidential candidates from the Democratic and Republican parties will have to respond during the campaign.

### Wallace Resigns as Editor of The New Republic Weekly

[Reuters, New York, 29th] After resigning as editor of The New Republic Weekly, Wallace will continue to be a contributing writer for the weekly, writing one page each week. It is reported that before Wallace resigned, Michael Straight, the publisher of The New Republic magazine, had a disagreement with the magazine's editor, Henry Fairlie, over Wallace's future position, and Fairlie also resigned.

### Democratic Party Still Supports Truman's Re-election

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] It is generally estimated here that Truman's chances of being elected next year have improved over the past twelve months. This change is partly due to Americans' satisfaction with foreign policy. The results of the election on November 2 next year cannot be predicted until the Republican Party puts forward its candidate. However, Truman has clearly secured the Democratic Party's nomination, which is almost certain. Before 1947, the Republican Party, which was defeated by the Democratic Party in the elections to both houses of Congress, was generally believed to be able to maintain its advantage until 1948, and Truman's political outlook was extremely pessimistic. In the face of congressional hostility, Truman won the assistance of Marshall and implemented a foreign policy that the people loved. On domestic policy, he vetoed congressional bills and fought with the Republican Party, and in other matters, he made it his top priority to win the hearts of the people. Truman further improved relations with Mexico, Canada, and Brazil, reorganized the Western Hemisphere defense, and responded to Europe with the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. The American people feel that the policy towards the Soviet Union has become "tougher," and both parties support "anti-communist actions."

### Michael Abandons Throne - Romania Declared a Republic with Government Completely Controlled by Communist Party

[Our Report] London, 30th Broadcast: Reports from Romania state that King Michael of Romania announced his abdication on Monday, and the Communist-controlled cabinet immediately declared Romania a "People's Democratic Republic." Michael delivered a radio address, stating that he was abandoning the throne for the benefit of the people, because the changes in the situation had made it necessary to amend the constitution, and the people must have the right to choose their own form of government. All cabinet members signed the declaration announcing the Romanian Republic, and Parliament is meeting to approve it. It is reported that after King Michael fell in love with Princess Anna of Switzerland, he asked the Gheorghiu-Dej government for approval, but Gheorghiu-Dej refused, because the Romanian Communist Party clearly did not want Michael to marry a member of a foreign royal family. The main reason for the King's abdication is probably this. It is widely believed that Michael will soon announce his engagement to Princess Anna.

### Britain and the United States Exchange Views on German Reparations - First Batch of Goods from Soviet Zone Distributed to Ten Countries

[Reuters, London, 29th] Britain and the United States will soon exchange views on the US plan to stop supplying reparations materials from West Germany to the Soviet Union. Although Britain will not affect Washington's decision on this matter, it is expected that Foreign Secretary Bevin will still adhere to the statement he made in the House of Commons after the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, that is, Britain should continue to pay reparations materials from the British zone. Although the United States has not asked Britain to change its position, since the economic policies of the British and American zones are already cooperating to a certain extent, the two countries should first reach an understanding on the adoption of different policies on the issue of reparations.

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The French Foreign Ministry announced that the Allied Reparations Commission in Brussels has distributed the first batch of goods from the German territory under the Potsdam Agreement, which are nominally called exports, to ten countries: Britain, France, the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Egypt, and India.

### Britain and the United States Confer in Washington to Deal with Situation in Greece

[Associated Press, London, 30th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that British and American negotiations on the Greek situation are underway in Washington in a "formal manner." It is claimed that the Washington talks may prompt Britain to reconsider its policy, as the deterioration of the situation in Greece has caused deep concern in London.

[Reuters, Athens, 29th] Reliable sources here say that if the rebel government in northern Greece is recognized by any foreign government, Greece can immediately obtain foreign military aid for self-defense, as stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter. The British, American, and Greek governments are actively consulting in an attempt to prevent the rebel government from being recognized by foreign countries, as they believe that this recognition will be the first major step towards escalating the conflict. Greece will regard foreign recognition of the Greek rebel government as equivalent to an armed invasion of Greece.

[Reuters, Athens, 29th] The United Nations Balkan Commission today passed a resolution stating that any foreign government's recognition of the government led by Greek guerrilla commander Markos will be a threat to international peace and security. The Finance Committee today announced that France plans to expand its army to 323,800 men next year, an increase of 39,200 men compared to this year.

### President Truman Signs Anti-Inflation Bill

[Our Report] New York, 30th Broadcast: Washington Dispatch, President Truman today signed a copy of the bill on reducing US anti-inflation.

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] The White House announced that the original anti-inflation bill, which was scheduled to be signed by the President on the 29th, suddenly went missing mysteriously. After Truman severely criticized the bill on the evening of the 26th, it could not be found anywhere on the 29th when it was supposed to be signed. The White House immediately ordered secret agents to investigate. At the same time, it ordered the preparation of a copy so that the President could sign it before midnight on the 31st. The copy has now been sent to Senate Speaker Vandenberg and House Speaker Martin for signature.

Television technology will definitely develop practically before the election, which will have a greater revolutionary impact on politics than broadcasting.

### Deteriorating Soviet-Iranian Relations Show Possibility of Diplomatic Rupture

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 29th] The "Republic Daily" here believes that diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Iran will be severed, because Soviet-Iranian relations are deteriorating and Iran will never be able to meet the Soviet Union's demands. The "Portrait Daily" claims that the re-appointment of Hakimi as Iranian Prime Minister under Soviet threat has greatly disappointed the Soviet Union. The newspaper also believes that the subversive actions currently being carried out by the Comintern, including the establishment of a puppet government in Greece, can be called the second international Communist offensive after the general strikes in France and Italy. Under Hakimi's leadership, the Iranian government maintains its consistent resistance to Soviet annexation.

### Henderson to Burma - Britain Sends Personnel to Train Burmese Army

### Katayama Broadcasts to the People - Determined to Establish Democracy and Resist Communism - Says Japan Will Take At Least Fifty Years to Recover

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] Japanese Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama recently assured the Japanese people in his new message that he will fight communism to the end, and will strive to expel capitalism from Japan and establish a democratic socialist weapon. According to Katayama, democratic socialism does not allow capitalism to coexist with it. He continued that it will take at least fifty years for Japan to recover from the destruction of the war. He encouraged the Japanese people to seek self-reliance before seeking foreign assistance. A Chinese sage said, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." Katayama refuted the conservative slogan that "the Conservative Party is the only organization that can defeat the Communist Party," and said that the new Conservative Party's attempt to subdue the Communist Party is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Finally, Katayama warned the Japanese not to cherish the glory of the past victors, but to recognize the fact that Japan has been completely defeated.

### Spain May Be Included in US Aid to Europe

[Reuters Correspondent in Washington, 29th] According to authoritative sources, although the claim in the London newspapers that the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and France have agreed to allow Spain to participate in the Marshall Plan for European aid cannot be confirmed, there is actually no reason not to allow Spain to participate. However, the sixteen European countries participating in the Marshall Plan must first accept Spain's participation, and Spain must guarantee its determination to participate in the joint effort to rebuild Europe. People here believe that the more trustworthy countries that participate in the European Reconstruction Plan, the greater the hope of success for the plan. If Spain participates in the European Reconstruction Plan, its contribution and its gains will be equally significant. Due to Spain's political relations with most other countries, it does not seem that the outside world will advise Spain to participate in the Marshall Plan, but Spain's political philosophy is not more repulsive to the United States than that of certain two or three Central European countries, and the United States has already expressed its hope that those two or three countries will participate in the European Reconstruction Plan.

[Reuters, Madrid, 29th] Informed observers here believe that the recent turmoil in France and the United States, as well as the UN General Assembly's decision not to take any action on the Spanish issue, have greatly strengthened General Franco's position in the country.

### 海關員工絕食為了年獎問題全體力爭

[Reported by this newspaper] All employees of the Shanghai Customs, including tax commissioners, deputy tax commissioners, field staff, laborers, port police, and port firefighters, totaling over 3,000 people, began a "hunger strike" yesterday afternoon, collectively awaiting orders, demanding that the authorities approve the issuance of year-end bonuses equivalent to two months' salary and a cold weather allowance of four million yuan per person.

Customs employees had previously dispatched representatives to present this matter to Chief Inspector of Customs Li Du a week ago. Li Du went to Nanjing the day before yesterday to seek instructions from the Ministry of Finance.

### 銀樓刦綁案獲犯單身大盜首度受審足跡遍大江南北·起解曾脫逃追獲

[Reported by this newspaper] Yan Xiongfei, the lone bandit who committed a robbery and kidnapping at a jewelry store, was brought to court for his first trial yesterday. Yan, 25 years old, is from Qiqihar in Northeast China. He has traveled extensively throughout the country. He rented Room 2 at the Asia Hotel, using the alias Yang Haitao, and also posed as Cheng Wei from the Second Section of the Economic Investigation Division of the Police Bureau. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, he falsely claimed to be an economic investigator checking for black market gold and currency. He went to Fang Zijin Jewelry Store at 386 Henan Road, brandished a gun, and demanded four gold bars. Zheng Yuxiang, the store accountant, told him that there was only 2 million Legal Tender in the safe. Yan took the Legal Tender and, still unsatisfied, kidnapped Jin Chuxiang, a store employee, as a hostage, instructing them to prepare the gold bars for ransom. Shortly after Yan left, he contacted Fang Zijin by phone and negotiated the ransom down from four gold bars to six taels of gold. Yan instructed them to exchange the gold at the entrance of the Great World. Fang Zijin Jewelry Store then reported the incident to the police. The police apprehended Yan at the entrance of the Great World. After being taken to the police station for investigation, Yan confessed that he was also responsible for the robbery of three gold bars from Fang Jiuxia Jewelry Store on Henan Road. He was directly transferred to the District Court on the 26th of this month for trial on charges of special criminal banditry. Presiding Judge Wu Shaochang ordered him to be detained. At around 7:00 PM, when the bailiffs were escorting Yan and over 40 other prisoners to the detention center on Sinan Road, Yan broke free from his handcuffs as the truck was leaving and attempted to flee. However, the bailiffs bravely pursued and recaptured him. Yesterday, Yan was brought to court in handcuffs and shackles. Judge Wu Ronglin presided over the trial. Yan claimed that he came to Shanghai from the Northeast and intended to start a business with a friend, but lacked capital. He then went to Nanjing to visit friends and seek employment, but was unsuccessful. He sold his wedding ring and returned to Shanghai, still unable to find a solution. He was forced to resort to this desperate measure. On the night of the 12th, he initially planned to rob Qiu Tianbao Jewelry Store, but the store manager was not present, and no one was in charge. He then went to Fang Zijin Jewelry Store to rob it. After the interrogation, he was returned to custody and the trial was adjourned to a later date.

### 錢江通航前夕　一個可喜的展望

The Eve of Qiantang River Navigation: A Delightful Prospect
Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Chu Yusheng

[Reported by this newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] Hangzhou, this city, will soon leap to an important position, thanks to the full opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the navigation of the Qiantang River. Since the establishment of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, the first step has been to keep the tides eight li outside the seawall, the second step has been to stabilize the riverbed, and the third step is the upcoming navigation of the Qiantang River. This is truly good news for Zhejiang, and even for the Southeast and the whole country. The navigation of the Qiantang River was planned by people long ago. As early as the West Lake Exposition in the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the Nanyang Promotion Association had a ship that sailed from Shanghai along the Qiantang River to Hangzhou, but it almost ran aground several times. Since then, people have not dared to try to navigate the river. It was not until January 1, 1947, when the Pine (潘恩號) of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA) sailed from Shanghai to Hangzhou, followed by the Tugger (脫格號) on January 24th of the same year, that people's interest in the navigation of the Qiantang River was rekindled. Thanks to the Seawall Engineering Bureau's continuous efforts to stabilize the riverbed and keep the water flowing, on August 21st of that year, 20 wooden barges were towed from Shanghai to Zhapu by the No. 8 tugboat of the ERRRA Water Transport Brigade, and then taken back to Hangzhou by the Tugger, including three wooden barges, one iron barge, and two small motorboats.

The Seawall Engineering Bureau has again used water diversion to prevent the water from flowing away. As a result, when the tide is low,

The Qiantang River's water level

is 6 meters from the riverbed, and even near the shallowest Tashan (誤稱　子門處), there is a permanent water level of 2 meters. According to the water level statistics of Fuyang and Haining counties, the low water level has negative values, and the negative number of the riverbed is even doubled. Therefore, as long as the draft of the ship is less than 2 meters, it can navigate the river. Now, a 5,000-ton ship requires a draft of 24 English feet, and a 300-ton ship requires a draft of 51 English feet. In this way, the 300-ton ship can navigate immediately, which is no problem. The 5,000-ton ship can also navigate when the water level is high. As long as the riverbed of a 3,000-ton ship is continuously stabilized, navigation will not be a problem. Now we want to study

What are the benefits

of navigation after it is opened? After navigation, the rice, porcelain, and water products produced in Jiangxi, the rice produced in Hunan, and the timber, rice, cotton, tea, cloth, and medicinal materials produced in the upper eight prefectures of Zhejiang can all be transported to Hangzhou via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and then transported to Shanghai and other places by water. Originally, many goods were transported to Hangzhou by wooden boats and rafts, and then transported to Shanghai and other places by train, or still by rafts and wooden boats. Now, the Qiantang River's navigation has been opened, which can quickly and in large quantities

Facilitate the flow of goods

without the need for such long and troublesome journeys. Similarly, many products from Shanghai and other ports can also be transported to the interior for exchange.

According to statistics, in August 1947, 1,629,754 kilograms of rice, 155,000 kilograms of cotton, 976,040 kilograms of vegetables, 952,935 kilograms of tobacco leaves, 567,798 kilograms of tea, 20,020 kilograms of medicinal materials, 218,500 kilograms of paper, 367,480 kilograms of cotton fabrics, 52,490 kilograms of silk fabrics, 550,092 kilograms of cotton yarn, 197,020 kilograms of cigarettes, 535,571 kilograms of sugar, 175,783 kilograms of fish and seafood, and 1,258,710 kilograms of wood were transported via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Including all other goods, the total amount transported was 8,782,723 kilograms. According to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's transport capacity to Hangzhou, the number is said to be 3,000 tons, so the combined number is quite large. Moreover, there are many goods that are not transported by rail. Therefore, if the Qiantang River is navigable, its economic value is particularly large. At the same time, because of the navigation between Hangzhou and Shanghai, it can also be navigable between Hangzhou and Wenzhou. In this way, we do not have to transport many goods through Shanghai, and its value is even greater. At present, the problem of navigation lies in the people who implement it. The China United Company is willing to invest

to operate navigation

, and the Asia Industrial Company will invest with two 3,000-ton ships. If the operation is fast, we can do it in the spring of 1948. The reporter specially interviewed Zhu Zushun, the person in charge of China United Company in Hangzhou, about this matter. He told the reporter that he is now investigating the value of freight and the amount that must be invested. In his opinion, if the Qiantang River is navigable, the goods can be placed in the warehouse at the dock, and the bill of lading can be used for mortgage financing. This is a convenient and very economical thing for business. According to his rough estimate, the initial investment will be 20 billion yuan. He plans to set up a dock in Xixing, because there he can transfer the goods transported by water from the upper reaches to the outside. He plans to go to Wenzhou. Assuming that the Shanghai-Hangzhou route is 300 kilometers, it will take 20 hours. The two ships will travel back and forth every day, that is, from Shanghai to Hangzhou, to Wenzhou, and then from Wenzhou to Hangzhou and Shanghai, for handover in Hangzhou. He said: "This is a very interesting thing. However, it is bound to lose money to open up Zhijiang Bay. The freight must be cheaper than the railway freight. If the navigation goes quickly, it can be implemented in two months." We are very happy to look forward to the navigation of the Qiantang River in the shortest two months, because this can connect the blood vessels of the south and make Hangzhou's economic status particularly high!

### 吳興菱湖鎮一角　教育的綠洲

A Corner of Linghu Town, Wuxing: An Oasis of Education

[Reported by this newspaper, Wuxing, 26th] Zhejiang's agricultural education is developing rapidly, especially at a time when education is feeling difficult, and a small oasis has been discovered. In Linghu Town, a small town of only 8,000 people in Wuxing, a commendable central model primary and secondary school has emerged, and they are intensifying

the work of eradicating illiteracy.

Chairman Shen of this province has always attached great importance to education. In April of this year, when Chairman Shen inspected Linghu, he greatly praised the agricultural construction of Lingzhen, but at the same time, he earnestly pointed out that education cannot be ignored. Linghu originally had a Qingshu Primary School, which was unfortunately dissolved during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, Mr. Zhang Rongchu, the original founder, resolutely took on the economic responsibility of its restoration alone and specially hired Mr. Pan Gongzhan as the chairman to actively carry out the school's reconstruction, which has reached its current scale. Linghu is a water town,

the soil is fertile and the water is beautiful. Although the place is small, it should also be prosperous. Qingshu Primary and Secondary School is located in the south of Lingzhen, with a good environment, surrounded by water on three sides, covering an area of more than 40 mu. As soon as you enter the school gate, you can see neat trees and newly built school buildings, which are clean and spacious. The school's auditorium is quite large and magnificent, and can accommodate more than 1,000 people. It is said that more than 3 billion yuan has been spent on building these school buildings in February this year. The students who come here to study

are completely free, and many come from other towns as boarders. The total number of students currently is more than 1,200, and the total number of school-age children in Linghu Town is now about 3,000, which means that almost 50% of the children have books to read. In the neighboring villages of Linghu, there are also 13 branch schools, with a total of more than 1,000 students.

On the 13th of last month, educators Hu Huaitian and Pan Botang from Shanghai visited the school. They were surprised by the completeness of the equipment here, which is not inferior to the best primary schools in Shanghai. In addition to the sports fields for basketball, volleyball, and track and field, there are also four special classrooms for science, art, music, and manual labor. No one would believe that there would be a new-style large grand piano in this Popular Music Room. The school's library now has

a collection of tens of thousands of books, and there are also the Complete Library and the Siku Quanshu for teachers to use for further study. In addition, the children's science and plant and animal laboratories are also very interesting. The school's infirmary is quite complete, specializing in checking the physical condition of students and teachers, treating diseases, and carrying out vaccinations on time.

Qingshu currently has 45 teachers, most of whom are graduates of universities or normal schools. In addition to teaching, they also focus on cultivating children's practical abilities and noble styles, leading students to run self-government associations, and often holding speeches, calligraphy, and cleanliness competitions. Because this is a rural school, and most of the students are children of farmers, the atmosphere is very simple and honest.

The founders of Qingshu and the staff of the school are not satisfied with the existing scale, and they are carrying out an extremely large

development plan. They are preparing to build new secondary school buildings and plan to run vocational schools to train junior technicians in sericulture, silk weaving, and accounting. In this way, the number of primary school students can be increased to 2,500 or 600. In this way, almost all the children in the town can have books to read. We sincerely hope that this school will continue to develop in the future. For the construction of a town school, although it only benefits one place, we hope that this trend of promoting education will spread widely, so that the blessed are not only this town, but the whole province and even the whole country.

### Twelve Experts from American Overseas Consultants Arrive in Shanghai to Inspect Water and Electricity, Chemical, and Textile Plants; Industrial Association Holds Reception to Welcome Them

[Our Newspaper] A group of twelve experts (and four women) from the American Overseas Consultants and a liaison officer from the Chinese Compensation and Return Committee arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo at 1:30 PM yesterday. The Overseas Consultants, composed of thirty engineers and experts from New York and New England, are commissioned by the U.S. Army Department and the State Department to investigate the Japanese reparations issue and study how to revive the Japanese economy. Under the leadership of Group Leader Schrick, they have been stationed in Japan since August of this year. Four months of investigation work has given them sufficient data to submit reports and recommendations. These recommendations carry a lot of weight and will affect the overall U.S. attitude towards the Japanese reparations issue.

Yesterday, they will take the route through South China, passing through the Philippines and Pearl Harbor to return home. However, they also have an incidental mission to see if Chinese industry has the ability to absorb Japanese reparations materials, so their observations are very relevant to our national interests. The twelve guests include electricity experts, steel experts, shipbuilding experts, chemical experts, and coal and iron ore experts. One is the chairman of the Allocation Committee under the Far East Commission.

Inspections in Groups After Lunch

The leader is Mr. Wysor (R.J. Wysor), the retired president of the Republic Steel Company in the United States, who has worked in the steel industry for 43 years. He is very familiar with the steel situation in any country in the world except the Soviet Union. They took off from Tokyo at 8:00 AM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM. After being treated to lunch by the Compensation Committee, they immediately split up into groups for inspection. One group visited the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, another group inspected the Tianyuan Chemical Factory, and the third group visited the Shenxin No. 9 Factory. The fourth group consisted of a group of ladies who visited the city of Greater Shanghai, which may have been of great interest to them! The cocktail reception was also delayed.

Japan's Recovery: Not Fast

From 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM in the evening, the Industrial Association held a cocktail reception at Rong Hongyuan's house on Seymour Road to welcome them. In addition to Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, about 60 well-known figures from the steel, electricity, chemical, petroleum, machinery, shipbuilding, transportation, textile, and financial industries were invited. The atmosphere was very harmonious. Mr. Wysor seemed to have a good attitude towards Shanghai, saying that everything here was much better than he had expected. When talking about the speed of Japan's recovery, he repeatedly shook his head, saying that it was not fast because of the coal shortage, which is a global problem.

Going to Beijing by Train This Morning

The guests will travel to Beijing by train this morning and have an important conversation with Mr. Weng Wenhao. On New Year's Eve, they will make a special trip to Shanghai day and night. On the morning of New Year's Day, the whole group will visit the Central Shipbuilding Corporation and the Zhanghuabang Wharf. Their short visit will end like this, and if they have time in the afternoon, they may visit several companies and shops to learn about Shanghai's prices. If the weather is good on the morning of the 2nd, a special plane will take them to Hong Kong and then return to the United States. What is the impression of these guests on Chinese industry? What are their own opinions? These are all unknowns. Mr. Wysor made it clear: "I personally have no opinion to express on this matter. Our report will only be drafted after returning to the United States and submitted to the U.S. government for reference." This is also the only answer that can be obtained.

### Arrested for Stealing and Selling Military Uniforms; Wang Deyun and Others Suspected of Corruption; District Attorney's Office Files Indictment

[Our Newspaper] Wang Deyun (also known as Wang Xiaodi), Zhou Yangting, Wang Zhaomei, and others were indicted by the District Attorney's Office yesterday on suspicion of corruption. According to the indictment, Wang Deyun's sister is the stepmother of Gu Zhuoxiang (also known as Gu Yuexian). Gu held a military supply position at the Taiwan Air Force Command. In mid-September of this year, he was ordered to go to Nanjing to collect military uniform material. Gu entrusted Wang Deyun to deposit the material in the Dalai Huaji Nanhua Bank in this city. Then, in late September, Gu colluded with Wang Deyun and went to the bank to take out two bundles of the military uniform material, which Wang sold, and handed over more than 20 million yuan to Gu. Later, the Taiwan Air Force Command discovered the matter and detained Gu Zhuoxiang. Gu then committed suicide out of fear of punishment. The command telegraphed the Air Force Supply Command, which in turn asked the city court to send police to arrest the accomplice Wang Deyun. Wang Deyun's father, Wang Zhaomei, and Zhou Yangting jointly hid Wang Deyun. Zhou Yangting also issued a certificate stating that there was no such person as Wang Xiaodi and handed it over to the bailiff to mislead the court. Later, the District Attorney's Office arrested Wang Deyun and detained him. After investigation by the District Attorney's Office, the defendants were charged with violating Article 1, Paragraph 1, Section 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption and Article 3, Paragraph 1, Section 2 of the same regulations as accomplices. The military uniform material was embezzled and is to be recovered or confiscated in accordance with Article 7 of the same regulations. The actions of the defendants Wang Zhaomei and Zhou Yangting clearly constituted the crime of being accomplices to Article 164, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and an indictment was filed according to law.
