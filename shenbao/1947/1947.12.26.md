### Hong Lanyou Discusses the Prospects for Constitutional Governance: Building the Nation Amidst Suppression is of Even Greater Significance

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, spoke to reporters on the 25th about the memories of the Constitutional National Assembly and the prospects for constitutional governance, stating: Today is the date on which the Constitution passed by last year's Constitutional National Assembly comes into effect. From today onwards, our country has begun to enter the grand domain of democratic constitutionalism. Since the Constitution was promulgated by order of the National Government on New Year's Day this year, the government has, on the one hand, suppressed chaos and removed obstacles to constitutional governance, and on the other hand, enacted laws and regulations and devoted itself to preparations for constitutional governance. Now, the National Assembly representatives elected through universal suffrage have reached the statutory number, and the date of the meeting has also been clearly announced. The election of legislative and supervisory members is also being actively handled separately. All preparations for constitutional governance are being accelerated to ensure that this complete democratic constitution can be implemented in accordance with the established track. Hong further stated: When we recall the difficulties of the constitutional drafting work, we are even more aware of the importance of the responsibility of constitutional governance, because constitutional governance is the beginning of political reform in our country and the start of democratic nation-building. First, from today onwards, our country's politics will achieve the great task of 50 years of revolution. Constitutional governance begins today, and saving the country while suppressing chaos to realize constitutional governance makes its significance even greater and its appointment even more arduous. In the future, civil rights will be further developed so that the country gradually protects human rights through the rule of law and seeks unification through constitutional governance. Second, in terms of political construction in the future, the people's representatives elected by the whole country will be the central driving force for political advancement, which will inevitably lead to political clarity. The head of state is elected by the National Assembly, which is composed of the general will of the people, and will inevitably be fair and wise. The policies decided by the legislators directly elected by the people will inevitably reflect the public opinion of the people and be supported by the people and effectively implemented. The supervisory members elected by the provinces will be able to effectively clarify politics. As for the three branches of administration, judiciary, and examination, they will also be supervised by the people and achieve virtuous and capable governance. Third, in terms of the political system, we hope that under the principle of checks and balances, the implementation of national policies can be flexibly applied, and the harmony and cooperation between political parties are essential preconditions for the smooth implementation of nation-building in the future. Fourth, economic policies must be aligned with the interests of all levels and without bias. The new Legislative Yuan will be able to concentrate its will and generate the economic policies implemented throughout the country, seeking to solve the current economic problems. (The Youth Party's Propaganda Minister and prominent figures from all walks of life in Shanghai's thoughts on constitutional governance are printed on the first column of the second page.)

### Zhou Yide's Speech: Celebrating Our Constitutional Governance

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th, United Press] On the occasion of China's constitutional rule, US Congressman Zhou Yide stated: "This new constitution is a milestone for China. However, it seems that it will take considerable time for this constitution to achieve its full effect. The Chinese people had planned to implement constitutional democracy in 1937, but it was not achieved due to the Japanese invasion. The Japanese invasion delayed China for a long time, but we must congratulate China on moving forward. The implementation of the constitution can show China's determination to achieve democracy and give people civil rights." He also said: "The Congressional emergency relief appropriation of 18 million US dollars to China will help China's democratic efforts. This appropriation makes the Chinese people understand that the American people are very concerned about them."

Two Movements in the Capital: Defending the Constitution and Defending the Party and Protecting the Law

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] At the beginning of constitutional rule, two opposing movements are unfolding in the capital: one is the movement to defend the constitution, and the other is the movement to defend the party and protect the law. The former was initiated by the candidates nominated by the National Assembly signatories. Because they were not nominated by political parties and were only elected according to the National Assembly Election and Recall Law by submitting 500 signatures, after the State Council passed a supplementary regulation for political party nominations, most of them were Kuomintang members, and they could not be elected due to the supplementary regulation. They had to take the method of withdrawing to protect themselves, and those with fewer votes were dissatisfied with this supplementary regulation, which led to the unfolding of the movement to defend the constitution. The latter was initiated by the National Assembly representatives nominated by the central government. They were the candidates proposed by the central government. Because they were often influenced by local forces or the time was too rushed and preparations were inadequate, they received fewer votes. They also formed a Liaison Association in Beijing. On the morning of the 25th, they appointed a delegation to visit members of the National Government and the Central Standing Committee to state their purpose of obeying the President's telegram, the central government's regulations on party members running for elections, and defending the party and protecting the law. It is learned that all parties replied that the central government would handle matters in accordance with the original plan of the party. The supplementary regulations for political party nominations passed by the State Council take effect on the same day as the National Assembly Election and Recall Law.

### Ma Hongkui Arrives in Shanghai from Beijing: Said to Be Here for a Physical Examination, Plans to Return to Beijing Next Week; Strong Military Strength in Northern Shaanxi, the Overall Situation is Still Stable

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Ningxia Chairman General Ma Hongkui, in order to have a physical examination, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the express train attached to the Qiantang at 2:45 p.m. When a reporter visited, it was reported that he would return to Beijing after completing the physical examination and could fly back to Ningxia within the new year. The military strength of the communist bandits in the Northwest is difficult to accurately estimate due to their constant wandering. Their tactics are also to attack where defenses are weak, and their movements are difficult to predict. In general, areas where the bandits have been entrenched in the past are easily infiltrated by them, while areas that have not been entrenched are easier to defend. To eliminate the communist bandits in the Northwest, his personal view is that military affairs are very important at present, but the fundamental is still politics. Ten years ago, during the suppression of the communists in Jiangxi, the Chairman had the instruction of "30% military, 70% politics." This principle still applies today. Therefore, in the Northwest provinces, we should strengthen the organization of the masses and enhance local self-defense forces to cooperate with the actions of the national army. Ningxia has not done enough in this regard, but it has made it difficult for the communist bandits to operate in the province, and even intelligence work is difficult to carry out. During my time in Beijing, the Chairman repeatedly summoned me and instructed me to make great efforts in politics and military affairs. The establishment of the Northwest military affairs is generally still in accordance with the old rules, but adjustments will be made based on the lessons learned in recent days. The various rumors that have been spread in recent days are quite exaggerated. After the victory in Yulin, Shaanxi Province, the overall situation is still stable, and the national army's military strength is very strong. Due to the needs of the environment, I will stay in northern Shaanxi more often in the future to command military affairs, he said.

The Legal System Committee's opinions are as follows: A. Those who participate in the nomination of signatories without party affiliation should not be subject to this regulation and should retain their right to be elected. B. If party members who have not been nominated by political parties and then have legal proceedings and are judged by the court to be eligible for election, they are also not subject to this regulation and are granted eligibility for election. Also, Zhang Lisheng, chairman of the election committee, submitted a statement to the National Government based on the facts and asked the government to maintain the right of election of the signatory representatives.

[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch, 25th] The Pingbao Line officially opened to traffic on the 25th, with one passenger and one freight train departing from each side.

The military has strengthened its preparations for this. A strong cavalry brigade has opened to Xushui on the afternoon of the 25th and ordered the Road Bureau to be prepared for repairs with the army.

[Further Telegram] The Pingbao Line is on the eve of a major war. 50,000 Communist bandits are gathered on the west side of the railway in the area near Xushui Caohe, only a few miles away from the railway.

### The Pingjin Reporters' Delegation Returns from Visiting: The Situation in Taiyuan is Extremely Stable; Bunkers are Like Stars, Highways are as Dense as Spiderwebs

[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch, 25th] The Pingjin reporters who visited the isolated island of Taiyuan have returned to Ping on Christmas Day. According to the reporter's six-day observation, although the national army currently occupies only 30 of the 106 counties and cities in Shanxi Province, due to the implementation of the integration of soldiers and farmers and the organization of mass self-defense in the 16 counties in the central Shanxi plain centered on Taiyuan, bandits have disappeared throughout the area, and the national army's power is becoming increasingly consolidated. The situation in Taiyuan, which is regarded as an isolated island, is extremely stable. Due to the implementation of the civilian economy, most civilians can enjoy the cooperative's low-priced ration of grain, cloth, and salt, and the minimum living standards are worry-free. Bunkers made of foreign cement and reinforced steel bars in the suburbs are as dense as summer stars. A railway around the city has been completed, and another one surrounding the airport will be completed soon. Highways connecting various strategic strongholds are as dense as spiderwebs, with a total length of 600 li. In addition, there are two moats outside the city. Today, Taiyuan can be called the most fortified city in the country. However, people in Taiyuan are watching Yuncheng with a worried gaze, deeply concerned that if Yuncheng falls, southern Shanxi will never be restored. Although Director Yan is 65 years old, his spirit is still very strong. He believes that North China should first seek to consolidate the strongholds of Beiping, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Guihua, Baotou, Taiyuan, Baoding, and Tangshan, and then seek to expand the surface. Regarding the suppression of bandits in the country, he believes that relying solely on military suppression of bandits is like "touching a boat with a boat" and will be difficult to defeat the CCP's political strategy of "overturning a boat with water." Only by using political and economic methods throughout the country to maximize the people's strength can the CCP's mad strategy of "overturning a boat with water" be curbed. In this isolated island, the chimneys of dozens of factories of the Northwest Industrial Corporation are still billowing black smoke, producing large amounts of steel, cement, caustic soda, wool textiles, and paper to exchange for large quantities of raw materials and consumer goods, becoming the blood vessels of this isolated island. All land transportation to and from Taiyuan is cut off, relying only on air transport by air transport teams and China Aviation Corporation. In addition, Director Yan Xishan expressed in Bing that he advocated convening reporters from national newspapers to hold a national affairs discussion meeting.

### Fierce Battles in Western Liaoning Proceeding: Communist Bandits Attacking Xinlitun Repeatedly Fail; Elite National Army Heads to the Northeast at Full Speed

[Our Newspaper's Panyang Dispatch, 25th] The battle in the northwest Panyang area has been underway in Zhangwu, Xinlitun, and Faku for the past 24 hours.

On the Xinlitun front, the bandits attacked for a long time from the east, south, and north without success, and changed to a fierce attack from the northwest on the 25th, but still did not succeed. Another group of bandits has been fiercely attacking Xinminxi Baiqibao since the 23rd. The national army retreated after gaining a price. The bandits continued to attack Raoyanghe Station and set fire to it.

[Our Newspaper's Tianjin Dispatch, 25th] The situation in the Northeast war is tense. According to observations by authoritative military experts here, the current main attempt of the Communist bandits is still to thoroughly destroy the Yupan Railway, isolate Panyang, and seizing Panyang is a secondary goal. It is learned that the elite national army inside the Customs has been heading to the Customs at full speed, and decisive battles will soon unfold in the Jinxi area.

[Central News Agency, Panmost 25th] The long-brewing Battle of Western Liaoning has vigorously launched in the three regions of Xinmin, Zhangwu, and Xinlitun. The Communist bandits who fled to Zhangkai were head-on by the National Army with heavy casualties for days. The center of the war has now shifted to the Zhangwu suburbs. The bandits besieging Xinlitun pounced on the northwest of the station on the morning of the 24th. The national army responded calmly and concentrated fierce artillery fire and bombarded the bandit army. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and retreated.

[Further Telegram] The National Army reinforcements went out of the Pass overnight. When the news came, the morale of the people here was greatly boosted. The National Army on the northern line has launched a mobile sweep of Kaiyuan and Chengling for days. The National Army has successfully met in Zhonggu on the 23rd. There are no large groups of bandits in the Changtuan Kaiyuan area.

[Our Newspaper's Beiping, 25th] Zheng Dongguo's flight on the 25th failed. The flight was temporarily stopped due to a malfunction in the aircraft radio station and changed to the 26th.

Editorial

### Economic Suppression of Rebellion, but Don't Forget Production!

Economic suppression of rebellion is a very attractive term! But the important thing is; economic suppression of rebellion is construction and not destruction, it is increasing production and not reducing production. Otherwise, it will be suppression of rebellion in name, but chaos in reality!

Why? Because food, clothing, housing, and transportation are the four basic necessities of life, and none of them can be obtained without materials. Therefore, only materials are the true needs of the people's livelihood; in other words, only increased production is the greatest goal of national economic policy. This is true in peacetime, and especially so in wartime. What is commonly referred to as poverty, in the final analysis, is the lack of materials. Not to mention raising the living standards of the people, even if we want to maintain the living standards of the people without further lowering them, we must increase production and increase wealth. This is common sense in economics, and it is a principle generally recognized by everyone.

In any country, in any era, the goal of economic policy is originally the same: first is production, second is production, and third is still production! However, the approaches adopted in implementation often vary greatly. But regardless of whether one takes active measures, or chooses passive methods, or follows a roundabout route, or uses a direct approach, it is nothing more than adapting to the time and place, and carefully using them, always with the aim of achieving increased production as the only destination. The direct and active methods have more obvious effects, and the cause and effect are easy to understand, so there is no need to describe them in detail. As for all passive and roundabout methods, because the situation is more complicated, and the techniques seem to be more advanced, they are easily misunderstood by the general public; even those who are in the midst of it, participating in it, are often dazzled and unknowingly lose their original direction, and sometimes even go in the opposite direction, contrary to the original goal of "increasing production."

For example, let's take economic control. Economic control, also known as planned economy, its motivation lies in the obvious goal of increasing production, that is, to plan all kinds of conditions related to production in a comprehensive way, in order to make up for shortcomings, increase efficiency, which is originally very clear. But for the sake of comprehensive planning, in many places, it is necessary to cut the long to make up for the short, and adjust the surplus to help the deficient, in order to make a reasonable distribution. For the sake of making up for shortcomings, in many places, it is necessary to weigh the pros and cons, abandon one and take the other, and implement means of banning, and when it is unavoidable, even to impose restrictions, constraints, suppression, and warnings, in order to carry out the plan thoroughly. From the surface or partial view alone, these seemingly passive methods, with the intention of restriction, seem to run counter to the goal of increasing production, but in fact they abandon the small for the sake of the large, and move the east to make up for the west, what is called waving five strings and watching flying geese, is originally no different from direct assistance and encouragement.

To give a more concrete example: such as banning hoarding and speculation, this is bound to be a serious blow to those in the industry, thereby destroying their financial path and eliminating their business practices (such as the recently banned money exchange groups), which seems to have nothing to do with increasing production. However, if the trend of hoarding is curbed, the black market disappears, prices gradually stabilize, and life is temporarily peaceful, and if the capital of tour guides is returned to production, then it may not be impossible to consider it as an indirect method of increasing production.

Another example is the unified control of finance, the unified control of cotton yarn, the unified control of daily necessities, etc. From the perspective of those who are involved, there will always be some inconvenience and disadvantage, at least in the process of adjustment, the difficulties and losses will inevitably be unavoidable, thus hindering their original operation and production. However, if the unified control is truly appropriate, and the coordination is indeed effective, then after the implementation of the unified control, the effect of its operation and production may very well be strengthened instead. The key lies entirely in whether the unified control is appropriate and effective.

Therefore, the most important economic issue at present is not whether or not to implement unified control, but whether the consequences of these unified controls or regulations can truly contribute to increased production. In other words, under the major premise of increased production, are these means of unified control or regulation necessary? Are they excessive? If there is too much interference, which does not help production, or as a result of excessive restriction, it only leads to reduced material production, factory closures, stagnant freight, smuggling at checkpoints, and economic depression in all industries, thus leading to the first serious consequence of worker unemployment and material shortage, and further causing the second serious consequence of social and economic problems, then these policies may have committed the serious mistake of losing their original direction, which is naturally not the original intention of the state to implement unified control!

We do not wish to re-examine these policies here, but we must solemnly point out that the goal of increasing production must not be ignored in the slightest under any circumstances or in any name. Because modern countries, all their economic facilities and efforts are concentrated on this direction of increasing production. On a large scale, such as the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe, MacArthur's policy towards Japan, and the economic cooperation of the United States, Britain and France with Germany, their goals are all to revive the economy and increase production, which is obvious and does not need to be said more. On a small scale, such as the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, Britain's expanded export plan, and Japan's "export to relieve hunger" slogan, is their energy not also focused on reviving the economy and increasing production? Frankly speaking, the only ones in the world who do not want economic revival and increased production are the Communist bandits in our country! They are destroying roads, factories, mines, cities, and rural areas everywhere, as well as destroying fields, destroying houses, burning, killing, looting, and using all means to the extreme. Their only role is to do their best to destroy all production and eliminate all materials, in order to persecute all compatriots in the country without a way out, thereby disrupting the entire Republic of China. From these vicious means, we can increasingly know the importance of earnestly increasing production. Only by earnestly increasing production is it an effective countermeasure against all the destructive means of the Communist bandits; only by earnestly increasing production is it the fundamental method to stabilize people's livelihood and stabilize the national foundation.

Military suppression of rebellion and economic suppression of rebellion are the two major paths to save the critical situation at present. Naturally, they should support each other and advance together, in order to quickly overcome the difficulties and suppress the rebellion. But we must know that these two things are nominally called suppression of rebellion, but the severity and urgency of the means must be distinguished. Because military affairs are inherently destructive, they are rigid and passive. Only by killing the enemy and achieving results, destroying and clearing the area, can complete victory be achieved. Economic affairs, on the other hand, are constructive, they are flexible and active, and even a single hair can move the whole body. When implementing this economic suppression of rebellion plan, in order to make up for shortcomings and kill one to warn a hundred, it is not impossible to adopt considerable compulsory and restrictive means, but it should not be forgotten that the goal is still to increase production rather than reduce production, that the nature is still construction rather than destruction, and that the effect is actually to support the industrial and commercial circles, and should never be to suppress industry and commerce, and regard all industrialists and businessmen as merchants to be killed! Therefore, when implementing economic suppression of rebellion, although severe punishments can be imposed on those who deliberately seek personal gain and engage in corruption, it is ultimately necessary to be considerate of the difficulties of business, comply with public sentiment, in order to reduce their suffering to the minimum, and it is best to avoid unnecessary interference and excessive restrictions. Even the way of implementing suppression of rebellion does not necessarily have to imitate the posture of the military, because after all, the objects of suppression are different, and the power and form used naturally do not have to be completely the same. The most important thing is that in the current economic problems, we want to suppress rebellion, but we definitely do not want to create chaos invisibly!

Why do we say this? Because now many emergency measures seem to be excessively general and severe, resulting in a scene of panic, and many measures such as restricting remittances and tightening money supply are inevitably too strict, and sometimes even violate laws and regulations and common practices, so that finance loses its flexibility, and currency cannot circulate, making goods lose their function of exchange in various places. This method of economic suppression of rebellion, in the short term, may have a temporarily stabilizing effect if it is carried out vigorously, but the situation is prohibitive, and it is like giving up eating because of choking, and over time, it will inevitably lead to a contraction of production, a scarcity of materials, and brewing endless hidden worries for the future. It must be known that the current deposits of commercial firms and shops across the country are less than one-thirtieth of what they were before the war, and 90% of the inflated currency is no longer in the hands of commercial firms and shops. If the reserves are further depleted, the currency becomes less liquid, the banks fail, and the factories stop production, just as the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce said that procurement and transportation are stagnated, and goods flow backwards, what are the advantages and disadvantages for the future of commerce and finance? It seems that it is also worth serious discussion. Is the final goal of those who advocate economic suppression of rebellion to create such a phenomenon to show their determination regardless of everything? It is really worthy of the attention of mature strategists. Our view is that increasing production is the only proper way to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood. Whether it is treating the root cause or the symptoms, whether it is strengthening or intensifying, anything that hinders or even contradicts the major premise of increasing production must be quickly improved!

Youth Party Propaganda Minister Wang Shizeng Comments on Constitutional Rule

[Central News Agency] Yesterday (the 25th) was the historic anniversary of the entry into force of the Constitution of the Republic of China. Wang Shizeng, Minister of Propaganda of the Chinese Youth Party, made the following remarks to reporters: "The implementation of the Constitution, apart from the Communist Party, which has other backgrounds and intentions, all Chinese people unanimously express their joy. As far as the content of the Constitution is concerned, it is indeed a progressive and democratic constitution that can take into account both ideals and reality, reconcile the opinions of all parties, and is suitable for China's national conditions and the world trend. The key to how to implement the Constitution effectively and smoothly in the future is, first, that people in the upper echelons of politics and society can develop law-abiding, democratic habits and spirits, abide by the Constitution, practice what they preach, and serve as a model for the people. Secondly, the various political parties can strengthen their organizations, restrain their members, and fully exert the effectiveness of guiding the people and promoting democracy, because democratic politics cannot be separated from the use of political parties. If political parties cannot restrain their members, then having a party is equal to not having a party, and democratic politics cannot be promoted. Especially under the current situation in China, it is even more necessary for all political parties to share the difficulties, abandon small differences and seek common ground, and achieve mutual supervision through coordination, so as to establish a brand new and good example for multi-party democratic politics. Whether the Constitution can be implemented smoothly is quite important in this regard. I believe that people from all parties also feel the same way."

Famous Figures from All Walks of Life in Shanghai Talk About Their Thoughts on Constitutional Rule

[This Newspaper] Yesterday was the day when our country implemented the Constitution. Our reporter specially visited well-known people from all walks of life to inquire about their thoughts and hopes. Xi Yushu said: "Constitutional rule is the general hope of the people of our country. In this election, there were some places that could not be held due to objective circumstances, which is a pity. The Constitution was promulgated last year, but it has not been implemented. When I traveled to Taiwan this time, some people in the Provincial Assembly mentioned what kind of freedom they should enjoy under the Constitution, but they did not know that constitutional rule had not yet begun. This kind of misunderstanding can be avoided in the future. Also, the position of the Legislative Yuan is the most important when constitutional government is implemented, because the election of legislators has been postponed, and there is no popularly elected Legislative Yuan at this time. As we said: True constitutional rule must wait until a popularly elected Legislative Yuan exists, which is correct. One thing that is worth mentioning is that the general public's understanding of the Constitution is too little, so the propaganda work for constitutional rule in the future is very important. Also, the local officials in various places do not have enough understanding of the Constitution themselves, and some even do not feel the need for constitutional rule."

In the industrial and commercial circles, Wu Yunchu believes that the articles of the Constitution should be implemented in accordance with the spirit of its constitution in order to be meaningful. Wang Qiyu, a giant in the textile industry, said: "After the implementation of constitutional government, the people should enjoy freedom in body, spirit, and property. However, during the suppression of the rebellion, according to the General Mobilization Law, the government can strictly implement control over everything, which is not without conflict in spirit. But this is a major national plan, so it should be discussed separately. There are still more than three months before the National Congress is convened. I hope that officials and the people can do more research on the Constitution so that the implementation of constitutional government can be a success."

### Free Circulation of Grain, Absolutely No Prohibition of Transportation, Grain Department Management Aims to Understand Dynamics

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] News from the Executive Yuan Information Bureau: According to the Grain Circulation Management Measures, grain in all provinces and cities in the Yangtze River Basin should circulate freely. Those who transport it out of the Yangtze River Estuary to the coastal provinces and regions must be approved by the Grain Department and inspected by the Customs. The application procedure is also extremely simple. All legitimate grain merchants can apply to the Grain Department for purchase and transportation in accordance with the regulations. If government agencies purchase and transport food for employees and the people, they can also freely purchase it after the Grain Department approves it. The aim is to understand and inspect its circulation dynamics, not to prohibit external transportation. Therefore, there is no prohibition of grain transportation. Recently, in order to unblock the source of grain, assist commercial transportation, and improve transportation, the Grain Department has requested the Ministry of Communications to issue an order to its affiliated water and land transportation agencies to prioritize the transportation of rice and grain, and to appropriately reduce transportation costs. As for the grain between provinces, it should originally be done in accordance with the principle of free circulation. If there is any prohibition of grain transportation out of the province, the Grain Department will immediately send a telegram to correct it, so that the surplus and deficiency can be mutually compensated.

Capital Flight Flows South Again, Silver is Tight and Large Banknotes are Scarce

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The money market is tight again. It is reported that the exchange difference has increased to more than 52 billion. Affected by the current situation, the trend of withdrawing cash and stocking up is increasing. It is difficult for silver houses to cope. Because the price of goods in Shanghai is lower than in Beiping, a large amount of capital is flowing south. The Shanghai exchange rate has reached 210 yuan. Because merchants are mostly carrying cash to the south, there is a severe shortage of large banknotes in the market. The relevant parties are discussing countermeasures. Also, the price of grain in the Beiping market is skyrocketing. Merchants and people are competing to buy and store it. Rice is 19,000 per catty, and a small bag of flour is 880,000, showing an uneasy phenomenon. Other things are still stable.

### Sino-US Air Trade Research, Very Few Finished Products Exported from Our Country to the US

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] After the US Department of Commerce conducted research on the possible development of trade between China and the United States by air, it made a prediction: the freight rate of 65 cents per ton per mile for ordinary goods will not be reduced for a while. It is said that DC/4 cargo planes flying between San Francisco and Shanghai must be calculated at a rate per ton per mile in order to absorb direct operating costs. After airplanes with lower costs are added to the flight, the current freight rate is expected to be reduced. Department officials emphasized that the long-distance freight rate between the two countries is expected to be set at 20 cents per ton per mile. The research on this issue in the current issue of "Foreign Business Opportunities Weekly" shows that the value of goods exported to China by air is 115,279,000 US dollars, while the total value of China's exports to the United States is 60,215,000 US dollars. The report analyzes the trade between the two countries in the first quarter of this year and considers the form and value of the goods. Its conclusion is: the most popular goods exported from China by air are metal minerals, including precious stones and semi-precious stones, textiles (silk and hemp), artwork and fur. The materials transported from the United States to China are more suitable for air transportation. The Ministry of Commerce also put forward the following three major production categories: (1) Machinery and vehicles, (2) Chemical products and related items, (3) Other items. The latter accounts for 85% of the weight of export goods in the first quarter of this year, and 86% of the value. Moreover, the number of manufactured products transported from China to the United States is very small, making it difficult for transport aircraft to load enough goods when returning to the United States from China.

### Constitutional Government Association Held Tea Party Yesterday - Sun Ke Spoke on the Procedures for Implementing the Constitution - Constitutional Provisions Gradually Begin to Take Effect

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] To celebrate the implementation of the constitution and the anniversary of the constitution's enactment, the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association held a tea party at the National Assembly Hall at 3:00 PM on the 25th. Chairman Sun Ke, Vice-Chairmen Xu Chuanlin, and Mo Huijun attended. The hall was decorated like a festive occasion. In his address, Sun Ke stated: "Recalling the past year, we held the National Constitutional Assembly here. Through everyone's efforts over the past year, the Constitution of the Republic of China has officially come into effect today. Over the past year, various parties and members of this association have prepared extensively, but some aspects may not have met our ideals. However, time waits for no one, so we have decided to begin implementation today. Furthermore, we would like to clarify the following: First, regarding the session of the National Assembly, although the announcement of the constitution a year ago did not specify that it would be convened today, the general expectation was that it would be for this day. However, due to various issues such as elections and voting, there have been delays. As of yesterday, the National Government has received election reports covering more than two-thirds of the total, meeting the legal quorum. Therefore, it has been decided that the National Assembly will be convened on March 29th of next year. In the coming three months, we still need to complete various unfinished procedures for implementing the constitution, and the members of this association still have unfinished tasks. Second, although the constitution is being implemented starting today, it does not mean that all 175 articles will take effect simultaneously. Instead, those articles that can take effect immediately will do so. For procedural issues, we will expedite the completion of the procedures. Third, we hope that everyone can understand the significance of implementing the constitution and understand the duties and responsibilities of the people. Only then can the new constitution be effective and allow the people to enjoy long-term stability and peace." Xu Chuanlin stated in his speech that the constitution promulgated on New Year's Day this year is a significant improvement over the constitution promulgated in the 12th year of the Republic (1923). Mo Dehui stated: "Over the past year, the government has prepared for the implementation of the constitution as scheduled. In particular, the efforts of the members of this association to promote constitutional government have completed the tasks of investigation, research, and promotion, enabling the preparatory work to be completed during the period of suppression of the rebellion. However, we still need to seek international sympathy and make concrete efforts to complete democratic politics." Subsequently, Committee Members Duan Jianmin and Wang Huamin delivered speeches. Duan's speech focused on opposition to the supplementary election provisions passed by the State Council, and he stated: "Last year, when we completed the constitution, the people entrusted us with two powers: one to create the constitution and one to implement it. Now, our power to implement the constitution has been deprived, and the original five-year term has also been curtailed. We hope that the government can be worthy of us." Wang Huamin proposed a new suggestion at the meeting, advocating that the association express its attitude to the US Congress in its name to seek foreign aid and become the greatest force for world peace and stability.

Constitutional Government Association's Mission Accomplished - Committee Members Request Reorganization

[Another Telegram] Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association committee members recently expressed that since the implementation of the constitution has begun and the mission has been accomplished, they urgently hope to reorganize the association into a permanent institution. Representatives were previously dispatched to explain their views to various parties. During the association's celebration tea party on the 25th, the committee members again petitioned Chairman Sun Ke and Vice-Chairmen Mo Dehui and Xu Chuanlin. Chairman Sun and others immediately stated that they would make a decision after consulting with each other.

### Truman's Christmas Message - Advocates Aiding European and Asian Peoples to Restore Their Confidence - Pope's Broadcast Expresses Deep Sympathy for China

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] On Christmas Eve, President Truman delivered a moving appeal while lighting the Christmas tree at the White House, advocating for aiding the starving people of Europe and Asia to restore hope in their hearts. Only after hope is restored can confidence be rebuilt - confidence in individual dignity and human fellowship. The President also said: "Many of our fellow human beings in Europe and Asia are suffering. This Christmas, many are homeless, impoverished refugees, unable to reunite with their families, with very little joy. We, in this prosperous country, are preparing to celebrate Christmas. If we are indifferent to the unfortunate people abroad, we would be betraying our conscience. Our aid to the less fortunate will restore hope in their hearts. The American people have been moved by the suffering of our fellow human beings abroad due to hunger and cold. Thanks to our efforts, people elsewhere have a hopeful view of the future and will not starve."

[Reuters, Vatican City, 24th] Pope Pius XII, in his Christmas broadcast message, expressed deep sympathy for the suffering currently experienced by China. He said, "Europe and the whole world, including faraway and deeply wounded China, are further away from true peace, complete and certain recovery, and a new order based on principles of justice. Those who sow denial and discord are confident that their day is drawing closer, while friends of peace and promoters of lasting harmony, comparing the spirit of Christ with the distress of today's world, which is far from the spirit of Christ, cannot help but feel deeply saddened. But the true power of Christ can better than anyone understand the meaning of the times we are in. In today's world, where two major forces compete for mastery, hatred has a greater attraction for mankind, and all signs seem to point towards division. But true love of mankind can complete the unity of the world. On this day, we send out our heartfelt appeal to all those in the world who believe in the true Lord and peace."

At the same time, US authorities are negotiating with France to ensure that the reduction in aid does not severely affect general economic welfare. As for Italy and Austria, agreements are already in place, so no further negotiations are needed except for some details. Lovett anticipates that everything can be resolved within a few days.

### Guerrillas Announce Establishment of New Regime - Greece Asks the US to Expedite Aid - Also Cables the UN to Pay Attention

[Reuters, Athens, 24th] A broadcast received from the guerrilla zone here confirms that the "First Provisional Democratic Government of Free Greece" established by the Greek guerrillas has been established, and its first action will be to establish diplomatic relations with friendly governments. The goals of the government also include organizing a powerful army, navy, and air force to resist any foreign aggression and to reorganize the Greek state in a democratic manner. The Secretary-General of the Greek Left-Wing League and Minister of Justice of the new government, Bofilogenis, broadcast that the new government should pay particular attention to developing friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the Balkan democratic countries, and said that due to Anglo-American imperialism in Greece, the new government of General Markos, the guerrilla commander, had no choice but to establish a new government.

[United Press, Athens, 24th] In direct response to the announcement by Greek guerrillas of the establishment of a new regime, the Greek government has appealed to the United States for more and faster military aid. Greek Army Minister Stratos and Chief of Staff Yeangis, after holding an emergency meeting with senior cabinet officials, requested US Chargé d'Affaires Rankin and Aid Mission Chief Griswold to increase the number of Greek National Defense Battalions to at least 140, which had previously been approved by the United States. Rankin told reporters that any changes to the Greek military organization must wait until the head of the military delegation, Leaversay, returns to Greece from Washington.

[Reuters, Athens, 24th] The Greek government today notified the Secretariat of the United Nations at Success Lake about the establishment of a government by Greek guerrillas. Foreign Minister Tsaldaris stated that the matter would be formally presented to the United Nations organization, as it concerns the United Nations Balkan Committee. Greek government officials believe that the next action will be the recognition of this guerrilla government by the Slavic countries. Military officials believe that the headquarters of the guerrilla government is located in the Grammos Mountains in northern Greece, near the borders of Yugoslavia and Albania. In addition to guerrilla commander-in-chief Markos serving as prime minister, the government includes Kokalis, a former professor at the University of Athens and leader of the 1944 resistance government, former Labor Minister and current Secretary-General of the Left-Wing League Bofilogenis, and Greek Communist Party leader Stirlingkos. The Secretary-General of the Greek Communist Party, Zarkarias, had predicted last week that a guerrilla government would be established soon.

They want the United States to be responsible for global strategic bases in order to secure world peace. Anyone who uses war as a tool to promote policy is an imperialist. There are many who are now talking about war against the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union takes the offensive, we may not be able to avoid it, but every peace-loving person should oppose the use of war as a weapon of foreign policy.

### Recent Economic News from Britain

-- Ben Geng

[Our London Correspondent] The main point of Britain's economic problem is that the country's production cannot maintain the daily life of its people. As a result, some things, such as food, must rely on "imports," and when most parts of the world are experiencing economic problems, Britain not only needs to "import" but must also buy from so-called "hard currency" countries, mainly the United States. This has caused a continuous drain on Britain's "gold" (unless Britain's exports can exceed imports, but this is currently out of the question). Britain's gold consumption in the last three months is as follows (in millions of pounds):

[Table showing gold consumption figures]

As shown in the table above, Britain consumed 263 million pounds in three months. According to the figures for August this year, at the end of August, Britain's gold reserves were approximately 600 million pounds. If the above-mentioned three months' consumption is deducted, the gold reserves will fall to just over 400 million pounds. However, it is estimated that during these three months, Britain purchased some gold from South Africa, plus new gold from gold mines. The current gold reserves are approximately over 500 million pounds, but the consumption rate is already quite considerable. The sale of these gold reserves is mainly to the United States, with a small portion transferred to Sweden and Switzerland. The reason for this, of course, is to offset the trade deficit caused by necessities. Buying US dollars from the International Monetary Fund is naturally for covering debts. Not only that, during these three months, Britain also used 22 million pounds under the Canadian loan, so the actual consumption for the three months should be 185 million pounds.

This situation certainly did not begin today. Some economists in Britain believe that the main problem is economic policy. As early as July last year, Professor Alan (Prof. R.G.D. Allen) believed that there were problems in the industrial sector. He pointed out that at the time, "war" industries (machinery, hardware, and chemical industries) retained 16% more labor than before the war, while all other industries retained 30% less labor than before the war. This indicates that there are problems with the distribution of labor in British industry. Some also believe that the problem with British economic policy is that "too much money is chasing too few goods," so it is necessary to find ways to reduce everyone's income. Although these discussions have been around since last year, they have attracted more attention this summer due to the increasingly serious depletion of gold reserves.

The main point, according to some, for the problems in Britain lies in inflation (here, inflation refers not only to the simple increase in the amount of currency but also includes credit inflation and the increase in the rate of currency circulation). The social purchasing power has been excessively expanded, and inflation is related to the government's large amount of capital outflow. Recently, Mr. Roy Harrod of Oxford University, in his newly published book discussing the British economic problem (titled "Are There Hardships Necessary?"), believes that the failure to increase exports and balance foreign accounts is only a byproduct of excessive capital expenditure. He advocates that the government can reduce its annual capital expenditure by 500 million pounds (the British government's capital expenditure includes the construction of housing and various facilities for the people). These opinions represent the view that the government should tighten its belt because, in the eyes of some, at least some officials in the British government are advocating for a large amount of capital outflow.

Recently in Britain, judging from the budget discussed by the current parliament, increasing tax rates and raising prices seem to be aimed at reducing the purchasing power of the people, while also increasing government revenue to reduce currency issuance. On the 2nd of this month, the British government released a white paper on capital for 1948, also announcing that capital expenditure in 1948 would be reduced by 20 million pounds compared to the original plan. Generally speaking, if the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Cripps, is any different from the previous Chancellor, Dalton, it seems that Cripps is an even stronger advocate of tightening the belt to solve Britain's economic problems. Therefore, it is likely that the rise in prices in Britain is only just beginning, and the quantity of rationed goods will be further reduced. Last week, Cripps stated in his speech that if production cannot increase by 12% more than it is now, the current allocation of clothing cannot be maintained (currently, the allocation of clothing in Britain is 20 "points" per person in five months, while a suit requires 26 "points").

There are two other points to be mentioned in passing here: First, in last month's British local council elections, the Labor Party suffered some setbacks. Some believe this is because the Labor government has lost the hearts of the people, but in the recent consecutive by-elections for parliamentary seats, the Labor Party has not lost a single seat, suggesting that the people still hope that the Labor Party will continue to test its policies. Second, some with old-fashioned liberal ideas believe that the economy does not need to be regulated and should be allowed to develop naturally, thus opposing the Labor Party's current approach, but this view does not seem to have attracted much attention in Britain. Even the leader of the Conservative Party, Churchill (the wartime British Prime Minister), although he criticized the Labor government in his public speeches, did not completely abandon economic controls.

### Over 30,000 Christians Held Worship Service at the Racecourse

Mayor Wu Curses Strife and Praises Peace

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was Christmas Day. The Christmas Music Worship Service, jointly sponsored by the Chinese Christian Reconstruction Association and the Shanghai Christian Teachers United Committee, was solemnly held at the third grand field of the racecourse yesterday morning at 10 o'clock. Those who attended included church leaders Bishop Jiang Changchuan, Bishop Ward, Pastor Snarfson, Pastor Zhuxinsheng, Pastor Lin Tianduo, and more than 30,000 Christians such as Ding Guitang, Tu Yuqing, Li Zhaohuan, and Zhao Jinqing. The grand occasion was unprecedented. Mayor Wu also attended the service with his wife and three sons and daughters. Christmas trees were arranged around the podium in the center of the lawn. In the middle was an oak cross and an olive tree symbolizing peace. A black velvet table cloth was draped over the table in front, adorned with the three yellow words "Holy. Holy. Holy." On both sides of the podium were the U.S. Navy Band and the sacred music groups of various churches and schools in the city. The sacred music group had more than 200 people, and Professor Ge Chaoshe from the Conservatory of Music conducted the chorus. It was solemn, quiet, and deeply moving.

Not Destruction, But Practice

The meeting was presided over by Zhao Jinqing. After giving a speech, Bishop Jiang Changchuan and Pastor Snarley recited scriptures, and Pastor Xinsheng and Ward gave prayers in Chinese and English. After the congregation sang "New Life Father Song," Mayor Wu delivered a sermon. The mayor listed Jesus's records in the Gospel of Matthew, saying: "I come, not to destroy, but to practice." Although reality is often not as good as the ideal, success is not achieved by random criticism. Some people think that improving reality requires struggle, which violates the spirit of Christ. The improvement of the world needs to start with introspection of the world itself. "Matthew" also said: The Pharisees once asked Jesus Christ which was the most important of the sincere laws. Jesus replied, "Serve God with your whole soul" and "Love your neighbor as yourself." If we always remember this most important commandment, and all actions are clear conscience, clear to God, we will be able to eliminate selfishness and dedicate our lives to universal love and peace, and promote the world to the best possible state. The mayor encouraged the audience to take this as the true meaning of life, curse strife, and praise peace. Subsequently, the Lingdong Church Orchestra played sacred music, Dr. Xiang Lie preached, the United Nations Sacred Music Group sang in chorus, and the Navy held rituals and other construction programs. Finally, the conference adjourned in the blessings of Pastor Zhu Guishen and Pastor Shen Deng. It is also known that when the Joint Committee of the Christian Church held a music worship service yesterday, they donated all the donations from the believers in the field, except for various expenses, to the sick prisoners of the Shanghai Prison for medical purposes.

Singing Hymns in the Detention Center

[Our Newspaper's Report] Shan Xianlin, the director of the Detention Center of the High Court, is a devout Christian. He uses religious methods to influence the great traitors in the prison. Therefore, the order in the detention center has been exceptionally good recently. Yesterday was Christmas Day. Director Shan gathered more than 100 Christian prisoners among the Han, such as Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Old Men of the Sea," and Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University. He held a service at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. Zhang Tianfu, director of the Personnel Office of the High Court and person in charge of the literary and art work of the institute, also participated. Director Shan led the whole group to sing hymns and pray, and then quoted the Bible to teach the prisoners, briefly describing the principles of being a human being, and it ended at about 11 o'clock.

Ye Zaizhou, Director of the Prison Department of the Judicial Administration Department, went to the High Court Detention Center for inspection at 3 pm yesterday, and inspected the prison cells on each floor. He was very satisfied with the internal facilities.

300 Million Refugee Children Urgently Need Relief

The United Nations Advisory Council for Relief of Refugee Children has nearly 300 million refugee children. This situation is nothing less than a challenge to the conscience of the world. The greatest expression of the spirit of Qiu is the human concern for the same kind, and the highest expression of this concern is that we all want to protect and help the most helpless children of mankind. Jesus Festival has always been a festival for children. Regardless of the race and nationality of the children, all children are helpless, have no right to speak, need people's utmost care, and should be helped urgently.

The recruitment of deserters will be handled separately.

### The Executive Yuan Approved Duty-Free Imports of Japanese Reparations Materials

The China Merchants Bureau previously requested the Ministry of Communications to submit a request to the Executive Yuan, requesting that all Japanese reparations materials be exempt from tax when imported, because the Hai Kang and Hai Zhe ships would go to Japan to transport reparations materials to Shanghai. It has been learned that the China Merchants Bureau has received instructions from the Ministry of Communications that it has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and has been sent to the Ministry of Finance to instruct the customs to comply with it.

According to a report on the 25th, the first batch of materials Japan compensated to China was originally scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai in mid-December, but due to lack of ships, it is still piled up in Yokosuka. It is also said that it will not be possible to start shipping until mid-January next year at the earliest. The person in charge of the supervision committee of the Japanese Compensation Committee in Shanghai stated yesterday: The above news does not conform to the fact that the reason why the Japanese compensation materials have not been shipped is not because of the lack of ships, but because the other party's preparation for shipment has not been completed as scheduled. It is said that the China Merchants Bureau has ships that can be transferred to Japan at any time.

Movie Ticket Price Increase Is Not Far Away

[Our Newspaper's Report] Movie ticket price increases are expected to be implemented on New Year's Day. As early as the beginning of this month, theater operators had applied to the Social Bureau for permission to increase the price by double from the 15th of this month. Later, it was shelved because the Social Bureau had to investigate the business situation of the industry. Recently, due to the approaching end of the year, employees had to be paid double salaries. Foreign film merchants and domestic film merchants in the film industry used this as a reason to send representatives to consult the mayor on the 23rd. The mayor promised to notify the Social Bureau to discuss the adjustment. The chairman of the industry association told reporters: It is imperative to implement the price increase, but the amount of the increase is still to be discussed.

### Council Tea Party Hosts Senators from the Democratic and Youth Parties

The Speaker Outlines the Council's Past Work

[Our Newspaper's Report] Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Vice Speaker Xu Jiyu of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a tea party at the Council on Tanggu Road at 10 am yesterday to host the recently selected senators from the Democratic and Youth Parties in the city to welcome them. The senators from the Democratic Socialist Party who attended were Mao Jiahua, Lu Bingkun, Wang Junjian, Gao Junxiang, Jiang Haoran, Zheng Dingjie, Yang Gongmou, Chen Youou, Jiang Fulin, Ni Buwei, He Pinheng, Yan Qingxi, Zheng Wenshu, Jiang Henghao, Jin Wanfan, Zhang Ji and others (16 people), and the senators from the Youth Party who attended were Wang Xingguo, Zheng Shouzhi, Yi Shixian, Yi Kenei, Yang Gongshu, Shen Binzhang, Yin Jiru, Chen Deying, Mei Jiannong, Wang Zonghao, Cui Chonghan, Wang Yuqi, Yang Zhengxin, Jin Junli and others (14 people).

After the senators took their seats, they were first nominated and introduced by Secretary-General Xiang Luquan of the Council. Then, Speaker Pan gave a speech, saying, "Since the central government selected you senators to participate in the work of the people's organization in our city, several senators have notified me to meet with me regularly. I also feel that it is necessary to meet with the senators, so I decided to invite Vice Speaker Xu to make a brief reception today. I am deeply honored that you have taken the time to participate. There are a total of 181 colleagues in this council. Because it is the end of the year and everyone is very busy, they could not all participate today. I and Vice Speaker Xu represent all the colleagues to express our heartfelt welcome to you. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly describe the past situation of this council.

The Municipal Council is legally required to convene a general assembly every three months, and the fourth general assembly has just concluded. The fifth general assembly will be convened in January of the new year. The exact date depends on when the municipal government can complete the re-compiled budget. The main task of the next general assembly is to review the re-compiled budget. In order to assist the work of the general assembly, the implementation has been beneficial and harmless to both the municipal government and this council. However, the central government's interpretation is that it should not be convened at ordinary times, but the city has a large population and numerous government affairs. In order to adapt to the environment, the result of consultation with the municipal government is still that it is necessary to retain it. You can start participating in various committees after the closing of the fifth general assembly. I hope you will participate in the work of various departments according to your interests. Each session of the council has a journal printed. Except for the fourth one, which is still being printed, there are four journals from the Provisional Council to the third general assembly. They are specially distributed to you to understand the general resolutions of this council in the past. This council is a people's organization, and we hope that citizens can deeply understand all its activities. However, due to the limited venue, only senators can introduce a small number of citizens to attend, so a radio station is specially set up so that the whole city can listen.

Secondly, this council has been established for a year and a half. I think you must know a lot about how the outside world criticizes this council and what their views are. I sincerely hope that you can give us your advice, and this council will humbly accept it so as to give play to the functions that a people's organization should have. Today is the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, and it is a coincidence to welcome the senators from the Democratic and Youth Parties. Although the Constitution has been implemented, the citizens' implementation of autonomy is still pending. During this period, we should take on the task of promoting democratic constitutionalism. Now that you senators from the Democratic and Youth Parties are participating in this council, with the joint efforts of all parties, I sincerely hope that our work will be more perfect."

After Speaker Pan finished speaking, Secretary-General Xiang explained the procedures for electing the Supervisory Committee of the Council today. Then, senators Jiang Haoran, Yang Gongshu, and Yi Yaonie from the two parties spoke successively, expressing their willingness to work together with the seniors of the Council, unite sincerely, and complete the mission of building a new Shanghai. They also thanked the Speaker and Vice Speaker.

(2) All factories of the same nature that are jointly organized and have fewer than 200 people should be named "Limited or Unlimited Liability某地某番號某业务各工厂员工消费合作社." (3) All factories of different natures that are jointly organized and have fewer than 200 people should be named "某责任某地某区某番號各工厂员工合作社." Regarding the funding issue, it is advocated that: in addition to the employees of each factory subscribing for shares, the Cooperative Bank should lend as much as possible, and credit lending or mortgage lending should be the main method. The Social Bureau should also order the factory owners to subscribe for promotional shares and withdraw the original employee welfare fund of each factory. It is heard that the association has sorted out the records of the symposium and sent them to the Social Bureau for adoption and implementation.

### A Tragedy Occurred During a Family Visit, the Father Played with a Gun and the Younger Brother Died

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Qihong, 57 years old, a native of Yancheng, lives in a garage at No. 7, Sanyifang, Fanhongdu Road, Xuhui. His wife, Xia Aqiao, remarried Zhao because her husband, Wu Xilin, died early and she had no way to make a living. She also brought "oil bottles" Haibo and Haiyan to Zhao's place. Zhao had no children, so he treated them as his own. Haibo is now 23 years old and serves as a second-class soldier on the Xun 120 boat of the 9th Naval Gunboat Fleet, stationed at the Jiangdi in Paotaiwan, Wusong. His second son, Haiyan, 20 years old, is a worker in a dye factory. The day before yesterday, Haibo came to Shanghai from Wusong to receive his salary and went home to visit his relatives. He wore a pistol and planned to return to the team the next morning. Unexpectedly, at around 9:30 yesterday morning, Haibo's pistol was placed on the table. Zhao saw it by chance. Out of curiosity, he took it and played with it. He didn't know that there were bullets in the barrel. Zhao accidentally turned the button, and with a loud bang, the bullet came out of the barrel and hit Haiyan's abdomen, penetrating his back. He fell to the ground injured. Zhao also fainted when he saw the tragic situation of the accident. After receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Police Station immediately ordered Inspector Meng Ruisheng and others to rush to the scene to investigate and summoned an ambulance to send the two to the Red Cross Hospital. Haiyan died shortly after due to his serious injuries. After Zhao woke up, he was taken to the police station for questioning. As for Haibo, the naval authorities were notified and the gunboat squad leader Yang Yishu was sent to take the gun back for verification.

### Xiangxi Shipping Company Employee Embezzles and is Arrested in Shanghai

[Report from this Newspaper] Yang Huisong, a 24-year-old from Zhejiang, was a cargo escort for the Xiangxi Shipping Company in Changde, Hunan. At the end of October, he was escorting 198 barrels of tung oil (worth 180 million yuan) downstream. Unexpectedly, when the ship reached Hankou, he stole and sold all of it. He then changed his name to Zhou Dehua and, with the help of a friend in Shanghai, opened a room at the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road. He gradually remitted the funds to the China Farmers Bank for storage. After the company discovered this, they reported it to the police bureaus in Changde and Hankou. The Hankou police bureau learned that Yang had secretly arrived in Shanghai and sent a letter to the Shanghai Police Bureau. Director Yu assigned Liu Shaokui, chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, to instruct Wu Yongsheng, chief of the Investigation Unit, to investigate. They learned that there were indeed some deposits under the name of Zhou Dehua in the China Farmers Bank, and also that Zhou was Yang's alias, but his address was unknown. Therefore, they sent clerk Wang Bingyuan to guard the bank. At around 10 a.m. yesterday morning, Yang was seen coming to withdraw funds, dressed in a brand-new Western suit and behaving lavishly. They stepped forward and apprehended him, and found 3 million legal tender, a diamond ring, and half an ounce of gold on his person. He was taken to the bureau for interrogation and confessed to stealing and selling the tung oil. After the investigation is completed, he will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for prosecution.

### Supervisory Committee Election Today; Jiang Hao Explains Reason for Voluntarily Withdrawing from the Election

The city should produce two members of the Supervisory Committee. The City Council will vote today. Yang and Jin are not City Council members, while Jiang and Tao are City Council members. According to the election law, only one of the City Council members can be elected. Therefore, the competition between Jiang and Tao is the most intense. However, Jiang has recently voluntarily withdrawn. According to Mr. Jiang's statement to reporters yesterday, he said that political reform cannot be achieved without establishing the authority of supervision. Moreover, the people's hatred for corrupt officials has reached its peak. Therefore, representing the people to carry out supervisory work should first of all have the enthusiasm and courage to fight. However, due to my limited ability, I am afraid that even if I do something, it will be better to withdraw and give way to more capable people before the election, so as not to fail the public's expectations after being elected.

### "Gift" from Santa Claus to Hong Kong

[Hong Kong Dispatch from this Newspaper, 23rd] It is said that foreign wines are taking the lead in the "Christmas Shopping Rush" in Hong Kong these days. On this rare island where foreign exchange shortages have little impact, Christmas gifts can be described as "all-encompassing." The reporter need not elaborate here. However, according to qualified merchants, the purchasing power of Hong Kong people this year is 20% to 30% lower than last year. Some goods on the market are being sold at prices close to cost in order to ease the tight money supply in the market. The turnover of large companies has not exceeded 100,000 yuan per day in the past two or three days, while smaller companies have only earned 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Merchants are frowning over the prospects for next year! Since the Hong Kong government promulgated new regulations for managing banks last week, speculators have gradually felt the pinch. The price of gold has fallen below the 300 yuan mark per tael and continues to fall below 280 yuan. According to foreign observers, "hardly a shadow has run to Taiwan!" for the first tranche of 50 million yuan of Reconstruction Bonds (redeemable after 30 years) issued by the Hong Kong government! Contrary to this bleak scene, the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which sells spring lottery tickets to be drawn on January 19 next year, is crowded with people, as if they are crazy. If Santa Claus really has a "gift" to give to Hong Kong, it may be the future first prize of 500,000 yuan! (Special correspondent of this newspaper, Zijian)

### Face Up to Northern Jiangsu, Grasp Abundant Materials, Disdain Meager U.S. Loans

[Report from this Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 22nd] The Northern Jiangsu Local Association, in order to rescue Northern Jiangsu, protect the provincial capital and the area around the capital, and cooperate with the suppression of rebellion and mobilization, held a

Northern Jiangsu Public Security Symposium

in Yangzhou on the 20th. More than 100 representatives from [illegible characters] and Huai [illegible characters] and other places, and a reporter from this newspaper were invited to participate. Important decisions were made on consolidating Northern Jiangsu and eliminating scattered bandits. Representatives from various counties unanimously emphasized the recent dangerous situation in Northern Jiangsu and made painful statements, which can be described as tears in every word, and should arouse the vigilance of the people of the country.

Feng Zhuhou, with his white hair disheveled, and temples full of grey, attended the meeting of the Northern Jiangsu Local Association as a representative of Yancheng. The pain of the fall of his city and the destruction of his family made the old man's eyes glisten.

Everyone listened with trepidation, and felt an unusual heaviness in their hearts. Mr. Feng also

presented specific figures.

He said that everyone is currently focusing on the issue of U.S. aid to China, but let's take a look at the statistics of materials in Northern Jiangsu. Northern Jiangsu can produce 2 million shi of cotton per year, worth 50 million U.S. dollars; 50 million shi of rice, worth 175 million U.S. dollars; 5 million shi of peanuts, worth more than 20 million U.S. dollars; 20 million shi of soybeans, worth 80 million U.S. dollars; 40 million shi of wheat, worth 160 million U.S. dollars; 20 million shi of barley, worth 40 million U.S. dollars; and 8 million shi of salt, worth more than 30 million U.S. dollars. The above annual output is worth more than 550 million U.S. dollars. May I ask, if we can grasp these materials, what kind of loan do we need? Finally, I would like to remind you that

pay attention to the target of the Communist bandits

. The Communist bandits have long shouted the slogan "Northern Jiangsu is the second Yan'an" and believe that Northern Jiangsu is the "Ukraine of China." If we want to save China, we must first rescue Northern Jiangsu...

Another report: The Fifth District Commissioner's Office also held the first administrative and security conference in Yangzhou on the 20th and 21st.

### Changzhou Butchers Detained for Tax Resistance

[Report from this Newspaper, Wujin, 24th] The slaughter tax in this county has been openly levied and secretly pocketed for years, enriching individuals. When Director Dong of the Finance Department inspected Changzhou last time, he saw the pig slaughter tax and it became a laughing stock for a while, and the [illegible character] of tax leakage was fully exposed.

### Journey to Southwestern Shandong

[Report from this Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] I, as a reporter, set off from Jinan on the 15th of this month to inspect southwestern Shandong. Three days before, Mayor Li Xianliang of Qingdao came to Jinan to慰勞 the troops. We had a deep conversation one night, which helped me understand the current situation in eastern Shandong. Since then, I have traveled all over Tai'an, Yanzhou, Qufu, Tengxian, Lincheng, Xuzhou, and Pukou, and once detoured to Jining and Zaozhuang. Wherever I went, I traveled nearly two thousand miles, and I experienced hardships. Now, I will choose the main points to report to the readers of this newspaper. Except for the north bank of the Yellow River, Jinan, Qingdao, Yanzhou, and LinYi are the

four strategic strongholds

of Shandong, [illegible character] the four supports of a great building. With Jinan as the center, west to Dong'a, south to Tai'an, and east via Zhangdian, Zibo to Weixian Fangzi, the west section of Jiaoji on both sides has always been in the hands of the national army under the direct command of Commander Wang Yaowu for more than five months. The Gomik, Jiaoxian, and Shandong Peninsula's Changyi, Pingdu, Yexian, Zhaoyuan, Huangxian, Penglai, [illegible characters], Muping, and even Weihai City, were [illegible character] because the national army's regular army was gradually transferred south to the Dabie Mountains, and had to automatically abandon them one after another. Under the same circumstances, the counties west of the river in southwestern Shandong, except for Heze, Shanxian, Jinxiang, and Yutai, the remaining [illegible character] city, etc., although have been under the pressure and trampling of the Communist bandits in countless tug-of-war, the Zhucheng and Juxian in southeastern Shandong, and even Feixian, have also been forcibly taken away by the bandits recently (45 counties and two ordinary cities in the 107 counties and three ordinary cities in Shandong are currently under the control of the national army), however, [illegible character] because the strategic strongholds of Qingdao and Jiaodong, Longkou, Yantai, Weihai, coastal villages along the coast, and Liugong Island, Laiyang, Haiyang, and Jimo are still in the hands of the national army (especially important are the important ports along the coast). [illegible character] because Jining, Tengxian, Qufu, etc., which are strategic strongholds on the periphery of Yanzhou, are always under the control of the national army. [illegible character] because Tancheng, Rizhao, and Shijiusuo, which are strategic strongholds on the periphery of Linyi, are still guarded by the national army. Although the Communist bandits can

take some small advantage

for a while, as long as the Shandong local team is formally established, the Shandong Communist bandits will still not be able to escape the tragic fate of their destruction.

The city defense works in Jinan are being actively strengthened. The outer periphery of Qingdao, from Chengyang via Jimo, Laoshan to the coast, has long had a permanent fortification praised by foreigners as an "iron city", which was completed this summer. Yanzhou was besieged by bandits for more than 20 months. Although it benefited from the isolated and bitter defense of Wu Huawen's troops, its strong fortifications should not be ignored. Linyi was originally the political, military, and economic center of the Shandong Communists. Its city defense works were originally the worst, because the Communist bandits never paid attention to building fortifications. However, since the national army recovered from this year's March, under the personal design and supervision of Commissioner Wang Hongjiu of the third administrative district of Shandong, since this year's May, every day

mobilized five thousand workers

consumed more than one million man-days and more than 3.5 million dan of lime. By the beginning of this month, it has been formally completed. The circumference of the entire city is 4,338 meters, the height is 8.9 meters, the thickness is 4 meters, the height of the [illegible character] is 1.9 meters, the thickness is 0.9 meters, and the city wall is surrounded by [illegible characters]. Every 1.2 meters on the wall has a shooting hole, and every 7.8 meters has a machine gun shooting position. There are three city gate towers, two inside and outside the west gate, and one south gate, with attached artillery observers. Tancheng has 150,000, and Linyi has 300,000, totaling more than one million. The increase in refugees makes us happy and afraid. We are happy that the Communist bandits are brutal and unpopular, so the people run to the government's area. We are afraid that the refugees themselves are also a "burden" to the government, which is adding an unparalleled heavy burden to the government.

This year, the common disasters in Shandong Province are drought [illegible character] and war. In addition to these, there are also so-called floods and typhoons in western and southern Shandong. Among them, Jining and Linyi have been most severely affected. The flood in Linyi is unprecedented in 20 years. This year, no grain was harvested. The people cannot even make pancakes with sorghum. From now on, most of them have been forced to cook sweet potato stems and eat them. In addition to staple food, fuel has become the most serious problem in Linyi. In the spring and summer of this year, 300,000 troops and more than 20,000 horses passed through the city, which not only made

thirty miles around the city

devoid of grass and trees, but even the wood of the coffins was dug up to burn as firewood. Because the horses did not have enough feed to eat, they even ate the tails of other horses. In addition, there are enlistments, requisitions, military food, security food, conscription測所 and 指探所. In addition, there are arsenals and repair shops in the city. Therefore, Peng Guodong, director of the southwest administration of the Shandong provincial government, said well: The city defense works of Linyi are excellent and can be called the Maginot Line of the East. The timely establishment of this core fortification in the Yimeng Mountains can save troops and prevent the Communist bandits from returning and rebuilding their base in the Yiyan Mountains, which is related to the safety of the entire central and southern Shandong.

But it is precisely because of the solid establishment of the above-mentioned city defenses that, before the fortification of the township 保据点 and the local teams are generally established, the people in various places have voluntarily fled to the above-mentioned places. According to official estimates, 山东

refugees displaced inside and outside the province

originally numbered about 7 million. Now, after removing half of them who have resumed their business and returned home, and a quarter of them who have been tragically killed by the Communist bandits or starved to death due to the war in Jiaodong, central Shandong and southwestern Shandong, the rest, except for those displaced outside the province who are not included, only the larger towns within the province have statistical figures, such as Jinan with 70,000, Weixian County with 50,000, Qingdao with 250,000, Yantai with 60,000, Longkou with 60,000, Liugong Island with 30,000, Jining抽丁. The problem of the common people is no longer a painful problem, but a problem of survival. Therefore, it has caused a大 [illegible character] "famine" and "exodus" of the people in the area. In fact, it is also a problem of "escaping death." The cowardly ones could not bear [illegible character] starvation, and mostly committed suicide individually or even [illegible character] family suicide. Some, in order not to escape and die, also returned to the bandit area at all costs to be killed by the bandits. All these situations have reached the most tragic extent that is "eat children and analyze the corpse to [illegible character]." (Special correspondent of this newspaper, Li Tian)

### There is no Shortage of Rice Supply in this City; Rice Price Fluctuations Will Soon be Stabilized; Citywide Rationing is Being Carefully Planned

[Report from our newspaper] The recent rice price fluctuations have greatly affected the lives of middle and lower-class citizens. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that there is no need to worry about the future rice supply in this city. After the end of UNRRA, there will be 20,000 tons of grain, of which 10,000 tons will be allocated to charitable relief organizations and 10,000 tons will be handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for distribution. Shanghai can be allocated a portion. The United States has allocated 125,000 tons of surplus relief supplies to our country, which will be distributed in five cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Sui. The first batch of 20,000 tons will arrive in January next year. The city will establish a committee for the distribution of US relief supplies. Before all the members of the committee are appointed, Mayor Wu has instructed the Civil Food Allocation Committee to handle the business temporarily. The grain purchased by China from the world grain market has already shipped 4,000 tons to Shanghai, and another 40,000 tons will arrive in January next year. The supply of this grain to Shanghai will greatly help stabilize rice prices in Shanghai. Director Wu also stated that because the Civil Food Allocation Committee has a heavy responsibility in the future, he will ask the mayor to reorganize it in order to shoulder the important responsibility of allocating food to the citizens of Shanghai.

Regarding the implementation of a citywide rice rationing system, Director Wu said that this is the trend, but it is still waiting to be discussed and decided.

[Another report] Since the establishment of the Civil Food Adjustment Committee, the rationing work has begun. According to the person in charge of the Civil Food Adjustment Committee, the monthly rice ration in this city is 200,900 shi, with 22,000 shi for public education personnel and 187,900 shi for workers, students, and the poor. After the rice from the US relief supplies arrives, it will also participate in the rationing, and the amount will be set at 200,900 shi. Together with the existing ration, the total will be increased to 418,800 shi. Based on a population of 4.4 million in this city, the average monthly rice ration per person is 1.5 dou, requiring a total of 660,000 shi per month. With the exception of 418,800 shi, there is a shortage of only 242,200 shi. There is a difference of about 8,000 shi per day, but the average daily arrival of rice in the north and south cities is 15,000 shi, totaling more than 400,000 shi per month, which is still 200,000 shi more. Flour is not included in this, and this city can produce 450,000 bags of flour per month. At 2.5 bags per shi of rice, this is equivalent to 220,000 shi of rice. Even if there is no rice grain in the market, there is no problem with the rice supply in this city, and there is no need to panic.

### The Stock Market is Prosperous; Closing Prices are Firm

Yesterday, the Hua stock market was bullish due to news that the shorts had Yong Sha chips. Major players in the industry wanted to catch them before they got away, so they sold at high prices, and there was inevitably a pullback in the middle. However, small stocks were still profitable. The securities firms worked together, and the closing prices were firm again.

At the morning opening, it was found that Yong Sha opened at 505 yuan and 515 yuan. After the opening, it was handed over and the election saw 513 yuan. Small stocks were exciting again, and Lian An, Zhongfa, and Xinhua hit the limit. Yong Sha gradually rose to 521 yuan and 536 yuan, and then fell back to 515 yuan and 530 yuan. Huafeng, Rongfeng, and Qinxing were also forced to rise to the limit. The interest price opened low, and Yong Sha's high price reached 526 yuan and 543 yuan. Near noon, it reported a setback, falling to 506 yuan and 513 yuan, and the closing price at noon was 510 yuan and 521 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the spot stocks Xinhua, Zhongfa, Huafeng, Lianan, and Rongfeng rose to the limit and then pulled back, with gains of 0.5% to 1.5%. Wuhe rose by 10% after falling to the limit. Jingfu, Xinguang, Zhabei, and Xinhe each rose by 0.5%, while Business, Datong, and Zhongni declined slightly, and the rest rose slightly. In the deferred stock market, Huafeng rose to the limit and then pulled back, and Qinxing rose by 10%. Meiya was the only one to remain flat, Xinguang rose by 0.5%, and the rest rose slightly.

In the afternoon, Huafeng, Lianan, and Xinhua hit the limit, and Yong Sha rose to 521 yuan and 553 yuan. Then it fell back to a low price of 510 yuan and 521 yuan. Although the National Bank entered the market, it was still difficult. Zhongfa was raised to the limit by Qinxing, Jinglun, and Zhabei. Rumors that Hua stocks could get loans and large-denomination deposit certificates, which were beneficial to the stock market, arose again, and Yong Sha was raised to a high price of 533 yuan and 542 yuan at the close. As a result, compared with the morning closing, the spot stocks Huafeng, Lianan, Xinhua, Zhongfa, Qinxing, Jinglun, and Zhabei rose to the limit. Meiya, Jingfu, Tongyi, and Zhongsheng each rose by 10%. Xinguang, Huaxin, Xinhe, Underwear, Business, Match, and Zhongni rose by 0.5%, and the rest rose slightly. In the deferred stock market, Huafeng and Qinxing rose to the limit, Jingfu rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly. Off-market old stocks remained stable, and public utility stocks rose by another 10%.

Broker Wu Wenhui, number 38, who was engaged in off-market transactions, has been transferred to the court for handling. Before the ruling is made, the Securities Exchange Public Notice should suspend his entry into the market.

As the end of the year approaches, the Securities Exchange has decided to suspend trading from the afternoon of the 29th of this month to January 4th due to bank closing and New Year holidays, for a total of six and a half days of rest. In addition, the sixth-first term deferred delivery of the Exchange will start trading on the morning of the 29th and will be delivered on January 6th.

### National Bonds See Lows; Foreign Stocks Turn Upward

As a result, compared with the previous closing, Class A and B were down 400 yuan, Class C was down 600 yuan, Class D was down 700 yuan, and Class E was up 300 yuan. The transaction volume was only around 3 million.

Yesterday, foreign stocks rebounded slightly. Hong Kong Shanghai Electric still reported 3.5 yuan, and the market was stable. With the exception of Yibie, which was slightly weak, there were more gains than losses. Yisha opened at 400,000, rose to 420,000 on the market, and closed. The securities firms' entries and exits were inconsistent. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yisha and Steel rose by 0.5%, Ken Zhi rose by 10%, Paperboard, Xiangtai, and Telephone were still flat, Yibie was slightly weaker, and the rest rose slightly.

### Cotton Yarn Rises; Cloth Rebounds

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was mediocre at the morning opening. Then, due to buying by customers, the cloth price rose, and the dyeing and weaving factories in this street also took action, and transactions became more active, and the market rose. Finally, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose to 49.5 million yuan, an increase of 1.3 million over the previous day. Other coarse and fine yarns also rose, ranging from 560,000 to 1 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was initially opened for sale by Fangjian Company, and the number of chips increased. The industry's intention to enter was lax, and there were frequent liquidations. The asking price was soft. However, after 11 o'clock, all parties sought stomach recovery, and the Shanxi gang received many notification forms for Sijunzi Serge. The market was slightly firmer. The asking price for Sijunzi Serge off-market increased by 1.3923 million yuan, and someone entered the market.

### Investment in Production Enterprises by Money Shops Should Be Handled in Accordance with Banking Law; Securities Trading Should Not Exceed Limits

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the investment in production enterprises by banks and money shops, as well as the trading of marketable securities, and trust companies concurrently operating commercial or savings bank businesses, all should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law. It is recently interpreted by the Ministry of Finance as follows: "Upon investigation, when banks and money shops invest in production enterprises as limited liability shareholders, they should be handled in accordance with Article 20 of the Company Law and Article 11 of the Ministry's promulgated Measures for the Management of Banks, which was previously issued by the Ministry on October 14 of the 35th year (1946), with order number 京錢庚三字第三一三一, for compliance.

Since the promulgation and implementation of the Banking Law, the Ministry's previously promulgated Measures for the Management of Banks have been abolished by order, and all banks and money shops should comply with the provisions of the Banking Law when investing in production enterprises. However, before various banks adjust their business and determine their nature in accordance with the law, the investment limit should be temporarily based on Article 53 of the Banking Law (investment limit for commercial banks). (The purchase price of stocks in each company should not exceed 2% of its total deposits, and the total amount should not exceed 20% of its total deposits.) As for the investment limit for provincial and county banks, it should be temporarily based on Article 63 of the Banking Law (investment limit for industrial banks).

All of the above-mentioned banks, if their previous investments have exceeded the limit, should adjust them within one year. Furthermore, banks and money shops handling investment in production enterprises and trading marketable securities should strictly differentiate them in accordance with Article 50, paragraphs 7 and 8, and Article 59, paragraphs 5 and 7, of the Banking Law (i.e., trading marketable securities should not be mixed with purchasing company stocks).

Their accounting treatment should be in accordance with the unified accounting system for banks, with separate accounts established and no confusion allowed. Furthermore, upon investigation, trust companies concurrently operating commercial or savings bank businesses before the implementation of the Banking Law should strictly differentiate the commercial or savings bank portions they operate in accordance with Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Banking Law and handle them in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 of the Banking Law.

### Money Market Continues to Ease

### Severe Coal Shortage in Qingdao; Textile and Construction Factories Completely Shut Down; Shu Yunzhang Issues Emergency Appeal

[Our Newspaper] Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of the China Textile and Construction Corporation, yesterday issued an emergency appeal to the media regarding the serious situation of the shutdown of various yarn factories in Qingdao under the corporation, hoping that the relevant authorities of the central government would provide a reasonable solution as soon as possible. According to him, the various yarn factories in Qingdao under the corporation have a total of about 350,000 spindles. However, since the 28th of last month, due to the shortage of coal, most of them have been shut down. The factories took turns to operate, with only 80,000 spindles operating per day. Later, with only 2,000 tons of coal arriving, all the existing coal was used up by the 22nd of this month, resulting in the complete shutdown of yarn spindles in various factories. Currently, there are more than 20,000 workers and more than 1,000 staff members in various factories in Qingdao. During the shutdown period, half-pay must be paid, with monthly expenses of more than 30 billion yuan. Furthermore, the influx of refugees in Qingdao has affected local public security. However, the coal shortage problem is not absolutely unsolvable, and it can be solved by borrowing coal. The corporation is also in contact with the national banks, hoping to export 5,000 bales of yarn produced by the factories in Qingdao in exchange for 50,000 tons of Indian coal. Indian coal has strong heat, and this amount of coal is sufficient for the factories in Qingdao for six months. Within six months, the factories in Qingdao can produce 90,000 bales of yarn of various counts, excluding 5,000 bales for coal exchange, 20% of the yarn will be exported, totaling 15,000 bales. Therefore, we hope that the relevant authorities will weigh the pros and cons and find a reasonable solution for the coal needed for production enterprises as soon as possible.

### Appeal Filed by Interested Parties in the Case of Forced Exchange of Privately Held Silver; Seven Reasons Listed to Request the Return of the Original Silver

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of the forced exchange of privately held silver that occurred in this city a month ago, it is heard that the interested parties in the case have had a letter of appeal drafted by lawyer Zhou Yizhi, listing seven reasons to request the Central Bank to return the exchanged silver. The main points of the reasons are recorded as follows:

The method of issuing legal tender (法幣) announced and implemented by the Ministry of Finance on November 3, 1935, is no longer compatible with the current domestic and international economic environment. The method is not as permanent as other laws and regulations. Moreover, the value of the legal tender itself was equal to silver coins at that time. Now, the legal tender has devalued excessively. At that time, 100 yuan of legal tender was equivalent to 29 and a half US dollars. Now, even according to the exchange rate listed by the National Bank, the market value is only a little more than one cent of a US dollar. Therefore, the old method cannot be applied.

The above-mentioned disposition of the Central Bank claims to be in accordance with the Measures for Exchanging Silver Coins and Silver into Legal Tender announced by the Ministry of Finance on September 23, 1943. However, this decree is an administrative order of an administrative organ, not a law, and should be revised or abolished by the competent department at any time according to the actual situation and economic changes to suit the current situation.

The fines and forfeitures imposed by the National Government have been increased to 1,000 times the original amount. As for the government's collection of land tax, taking Shanghai as an example, including advance payments, the total amount is more than 30,000 times the pre-war amount. Bank deposits before the war have also been repaid at twice the amount. Only the forced exchange of silver must refer to the old law of twelve years ago, which is unreasonable.

Articles 1, 4, and 6 of the Regulations on Punishing Those Who Hinder National Currency promulgated and implemented by the National Government on October 18, 1943, emphasize the punishment of those who intend to profit or smuggle, as well as those who counterfeit, alter, or destroy. It has been clearly stipulated. There is no explicit punishment for mere storage. Even in terms of the spirit of the regulations on the control of gold promulgated by the government this year, it is indicated that the special possession of gold and silver is not illegal. Furthermore, according to the Ministry of Finance's reply to the Kaifeng telegram number 21951, those who collect silver coins without the intention of selling them for profit are not subject to confiscation.

The government has never announced that silver will be nationalized. Storing silver is not illegal, and silver shops are allowed to sell silver items, but the public is not allowed to store it, which is not fair.

According to Articles 12 and 13 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery promulgated by the National Government on December 8, 1945, it is a supplementary method for rescuing economic changes in time between people to maintain the principle of fairness. However, the method between the government and the people is obviously unfair.

After the war, the people of our country have suffered greatly, and their vitality has not recovered. They need stability and conservation policies. Now, this unfavorable treatment of silver storage makes the people who have a little silver feel cold and causes social unrest. Before the victory, Chongqing heavily deducted 40% from gold savings, which greatly discredited the government. This can be taken as a lesson.

### The Alarm Bell of Health—Pain

— Su Fu

The Christmas bells are ringing in the church, telling us that all those who believe in Jesus should go to worship. The air raid siren is ringing in the trees. It tells us that we should escape to the air raid shelter. All bells are a kind of report, some with joy, some with fear. In our human body, there are also alarm bells, warning us that a certain organ is beginning to become diseased, and we should pay attention to it and treat it. The most common of these alarm bells is pain.

Generally speaking, one of the greatest troubles in life is pain. Whether it is a hero or a good man, there is always a limit to the endurance of pain. No one is not afraid of pain, and no one likes pain. Pain is the enemy of mankind and the enemy of health. But I say that pain is the savior of the human body and the guarantee of health, because it is pain that makes us pay attention and seek treatment early. Pain is not a disease, it is just a harbinger of disease. In medical terms, this should be a symptom. On the surface, it is a malicious attack, but in reality, it is a well-intentioned warning. If we only pay attention to the superficial pain and try to stop it, while ignoring the real root cause of the disease, it will not only be unhelpful, but also harmful. If a person with a gastric ulcer only uses painkillers to temporarily relieve the pain, without paying attention to improving their diet, the result will be a terrible stomach perforation. A patient with appendicitis only seeks pain relief and misses the opportunity for surgery, resulting in a terrible peritonitis. What is the difference between this and quenching thirst with poison? Before we find the real source of the disease, if we eat painkillers in a self-righteous way, it is like treating enemies as friends and friends as enemies. It is not only unwise, but also extremely foolish.

In the human body, there are a few organs that do not have pain as a warning when they become diseased, such as the lungs. Although there is already pulmonary tuberculosis, and there are cavities, they only have cough, excessive phlegm, emaciation, or night sweats, but no pain. Because there is no pain, many people cannot discover it early and lose the opportunity for treatment. Fortunately, pulmonary tuberculosis also has the alarm bell of coughing up blood. However, many tuberculosis patients do not cough up blood. At this time, we should hate it. Why not give us the feeling of pain earlier, like a stomach disease? Only then do we realize the value of pain and realize the true meaning of pain for health protection.

There are many pains that do not necessarily mean that the place where the pain is located is the location of the disease. There are also many diseases that cause pain in the same area. At that time, we cannot use intuition to judge. We still have to ask for advice from experts and use various tests to find the correct source of the disease. For example, when acute appendicitis first starts, most of the pain is in the stomach. If we judge it by routine, it should be a stomach disease. However, it is not. In this way, if there is stomach pain, we should first think of appendicitis, but it is also not. Pleurisy can also cause dull pain in the stomach. As for the pain in the lower abdomen, there are even twenty or thirty possible diseases. We cannot make arbitrary judgments with ordinary common sense. We must use science to distinguish them in order to get to the root.

Truth is always worth exploring. For example, a child's cry is also an alarm bell. Many mothers only hug and coax them. But have they noticed that maybe the child's diaper is wet, maybe a small needle is pricking them, or maybe their arm is hurting? We cannot scold them for crying. There are many reasons for a child's cry, not to mention the very delicate human body structure. How can we treat it as a child's play and dispose of it casually?

In addition to pain, other alarm bells for human health, such as fever, vomiting blood, coughing, vomiting, etc., are all harbingers of disease. We cannot ignore and abandon the alarm bells of health that the Creator has given us. Therefore, we must:

Examine the alarm bells of health.

Study and distinguish its cause and effect.

Before finding the real source of the disease, do not treat the alarm bell yourself, such as giving painkillers.

### Introduction to Biological Products

— Wang Meixian

Diagnostic products: Bacterial suspensions for agglutination tests for diagnosing typhoid fever (Widal test) and typhus (Weil-Felix test); various standard diagnostic serums for identifying bacterial species and types; old tuberculin for measuring human allergic reactions to tuberculosis; and Wassermann test antigens for syphilis, etc.

Biological products are essential for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. For example, cowpox vaccine is used to prevent smallpox, cholera vaccine is used to prevent cholera, and rabies vaccine is used to prevent—actually, it is used for treatment after being bitten by a rabid dog, so it is called "curative vaccination." Diphtheria is universally recognized as the only effective method for treating the disease. Among them, diphtheria is the most effective and controllable. Determining whether humans are susceptible to diphtheria (resistance) can be done by performing the Schick test—using Schick test toxin. A positive reaction indicates susceptibility to diphtheria and no resistance, which means that the individual can be infected. Therefore, diphtheria alum-precipitated toxoid should be preventively injected to automatically generate resistance. If there is concern that the person being preventively injected may have too strong a reaction to the toxoid, the Moloney test can be performed in advance to determine whether there will be adverse reactions to the injection of diphtheria toxoid. When diphtheria has already spread, the above-mentioned method of injecting toxoid to automatically and slowly generate resistance is too late. For emergency, diphtheria antitoxin can be injected to passively obtain resistance immediately. However, this method lasts for a very short time, and there is a risk of allergic reactions (prophylaxis) after injecting antitoxin in the future. If diphtheria has already been infected, an adequate amount of diphtheria antitoxin can be injected immediately. Therefore, from the perspective of biological products, diphtheria is a relatively manageable disease.

### What is Angina Pectoris?

— Xie Yunshou

Mr. Zhang Ji, a member of the National Government, passed away due to angina pectoris. Many people do not understand the name angina pectoris very well. Many people come to ask me, so I will briefly explain it now.

The State of Angina Pectoris Attack

The most important symptom is severe pain in the heart, similar to traction, puncture, and squeezing. This pain is not only in the heart but also spreads to the left upper limb, left shoulder, left wrist, left elbow joint, and left fingertip, especially on the ulnar side, which is the little finger side, the pain is even worse. When the pain occurs, the patient's face is pale, the pulse is weak, and the breathing is shallow and quiet. When walking, they stop immediately; when talking, they stop talking and become silent. The duration of the attack varies. It can last from a few seconds to a few minutes, or even more than an hour. Sometimes there is also vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, incontinence of urine and feces, increased urine output, and erythema. The number of attacks is also not fixed. Some people have repeated attacks in a short period of time, while others have one attack every few weeks or even years. Some people only have one attack in their lifetime. At the beginning of the attack, there are sudden occurrences, and there are also prodromal symptoms; such as a mild chest tightness. After the arm is pulled, sweating, and suffering, the attack comes again. The prognosis of angina pectoris is difficult to judge. There are many attacks without danger to life, and there are also cases of sudden death with only one attack.

Why Angina Pectoris Occurs

The heart needs nutrition. The coronary arteries are the arteries that nourish the heart. If the coronary arteries become hardened, the blood flow to the heart will be transiently poor, resulting in this disease. When the aorta is hardened, it can also cause this disease. People with the above-mentioned lesions may experience physical and mental fatigue, cold skin, satiety, sexual intercourse, etc., which can cause this disease. As for the causes of coronary artery and aortic hardening, there are many: such as genetic predisposition, diabetes, gout, obesity, physical fatigue, mental excitement, excessive smoking and drinking of alcohol and tea, lead poisoning, articular rheumatism, typhoid fever, malaria, syphilis, etc.

Nursing Care During Angina Pectoris

During the attack, the first thing to do is to rest quietly in bed. Place a slightly warm wet cloth or ice pack on the heart. Rub the limbs with lukewarm water. Drink a small amount of coffee and wine. At the same time, immediately ask a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. In normal times, diet should be moderate, not too full. Spices, cigarettes, and alcohol should all be prohibited. Bowel movements should be smooth, and physical and mental fatigue should be reduced. These are all things to pay attention to.

### A Dwarf Lacking a Thyroid Gland

— Liang Junqing

There is a thirteen-and-a-half-year-old girl who has become severely underdeveloped due to congenital defects. She suffers from myxedema throughout her body. Her body and limbs are not in line with the length they should have. She weighs only fifteen kilograms and is only eighty-one centimeters tall, making her a true dwarf (see Figure 1). This child's mental capacity is very slow. She lies in bed all day long, neither crying nor laughing, neither speaking nor making a sound. She does not respond when called and does not see when looking at things. She is indifferent to everything. She cannot walk or stand up. So, she was sent to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. After detailed examination, it was considered that she was suffering from congenital thyroid deficiency. Her bloodline has a severe genetic factor for mental illness, and her thyroid gland cannot be confirmed to exist. Moreover, her whole body's bones are also completely underdeveloped, like an infant in the breastfeeding period. The core of the bone tissue that forms is also very degenerate (see Figure 2). This child's hand and arm X-rays show the blurring of the bone joints and the degeneration of the bone lines. In addition, the bone sutures of her fontanelle are still open and have not healed. The saddle condition at the base of the brain. There is a rupture between the fifth lumbar vertebra and the first pelvic bone (Spina bifida). In terms of blood, it was found that she had common anemia, and there was a slight increase in lymphatic leukocytes. Cholesterol in the blood increased significantly. When bone marrow was extracted from her thigh bone for examination, there was degeneration of the red blood cell-forming tissue and incompleteness of the white blood cell-forming tissue. This child's metabolism was reduced by 30%. All tendon reflexes were increased. The Babinski reflex of both great toes was also positive.

In short, the reason why this child became a dwarf and the various pathological conditions of her whole body are all symptoms of congenital thyroid deficiency. Therefore, her attending physician gave her 0.00003gm of thyroxin (Thyroxin) five drops daily, or half a tablet of Thyreoglancol daily, and sometimes combined with vitamin B1 (two tablets three times a day). This lasted for about a year. This child's body has improved greatly (see Figure 3). She can now sit up and play with toys. She also has feelings about the surrounding things. Her intelligence has also improved significantly. With the support of her hand, she can actually walk. The myxedema of her whole body has completely disappeared. Her face also has various expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. As for the bones, there is an even more significant improvement. As evidenced by X-rays, they are like the bones of a five-year-old child (see Figure 4). Her original height was 81 centimeters, and now it is 93 and a half centimeters. Her previous hemoglobin was 58%, and now it is 83%. Her previous red blood cells were 2.7 million, and now they have increased to 4.07 million. If this treatment can be continued in the future, there will definitely be greater improvements in her body. (This matter is seen in the Swiss University Medical Journal and the Helvetica Pediatric Medical Journal (Helvetica Paediatrcia Acta (Series D) 2, No. 2, 154-173 (1947). It has been reviewed by physicians Franceschetti, F. Bamatter, and D. Klein and reprinted by the Swiss Roche Medical Digest. The matter is indeed accurate and is absolutely not made up).

### Remembering Song Zheyuan: One of the "Low Eaves" Memories

—

Since the "September 18th" Incident, when the four northeastern provinces fell, the Japanese atmosphere was pressing inward, and its arrogance was soaring. North China, especially Tianjin and Beijing, was already under strict walls, and the people were under "low eaves." The Japanese were causing trouble everywhere, and the successive authorities found it difficult to support themselves. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council of General Song Zheyuan, facing internal and external condemnations and dealing with all parties, truly had "sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy" experiences, which are hard to describe.

The Japanese wanted him to "clarify" (clarify to the extent of the puppet Hebei-East government of Yin Rugeng), and the Chinese also disliked his lack of clarity (clarify to the appearance of the former Hebei Political Council of Huang Fu). Old Song's idea was that he could not learn the "Hebei-East style" of clarity from the Japanese, and used "not too clear to the Central Government" to block the Japanese's mouths. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council, with the attitude of "clarifying itself," struggled, using methods of dodging left and right, enduring the time of one year and eight months. (The Hebei-Chahar Political Council was established on December 8, 1935, until the Lugouqiao Incident broke out on July 7, 1937.)

On January 7, 1936, "Hebei-Chahar" demanded that the puppet "Hebei-East" cancel "autonomy" and return more than 20 counties. The puppet "Hebei-East" replied that it "could not," and the Japanese garrison also warned against oppressing "Hebei-East." Military Attaché Isogai of the Japanese Embassy also declared that "Japan's clarification of its demands on North China means complete detachment from the rule of the National Government." This is the "clear talk" of "clarification." Isogai was the guy who suffered a defeat in Taierzhuang and later became the puppet governor of Hong Kong!

"Hebei-Chahar" suffered a lot from the puppet "Hebei-East," such as taking over land assets in the Tanggu area, intercepting ticket money from the Pingdong Railway, and all public tax revenues. The "Hebei-Chahar" territory was originally pitifully small (unlike the previous political councils that governed the provinces of Shandong and Shanxi). The "Hebei" was divided into "half the country" by old Yin's Hebei-East. The name was two provinces, but one province was not enough in reality.

There were also many frictions with Japan, such as the Chaoyangmen Incident, the Fengtai Incident, the Sheng Nong Yuan Incident, and the intrusion of Japanese police into the Tianjin Provincial Government Office. In several conflicts, "Hebei-Chahar" settled them through negotiation. Although they made concessions, they expressed their stubborn attitude of "clarifying themselves." The Japanese side's intention was that as long as you were not "clarified" to the Central Government, it could be treated as a local incident and settled as it was. The reason why it rubbed so many times without breaking down lies here.

Later, when Tianjin and Beijing held the National Assembly elections, the Japanese once clamored, believing that it was "centralization." However, their only concern was not here. They thought that "Hebei-Eastization" would be able to completely "clarify" the situation, and all friction would naturally disappear into Japanization.

Japan insisted on its so-called "clarification," forcing old Song to move from "clarifying himself" to "clarifying" in the direction that Japan opposed. When the "July 7th" Incident broke out, old Song finally expressed his intentions with facts. Did he truly "clarify" himself?

Half a year after "Hebei-Chahar" withdrew its troops, the puppet "Provisional Government" appeared. "Hebei-East" still wanted to retain its territory, but the Japanese did not allow it and ordered it to dissolve and merge. Thus, "puppet clarification" occurred in "Hebei-Chahar," and "puppet clarification" occurred in "Hebei-East."

For eight years, Japan surrendered, the puppet government collapsed, and the Chinese "truly clarified North China"!

### Sleeping Through a Lifetime

— Luo Ta

It's rare to live to seventy years old. The first twenty years are too young, the last twenty years are too old, and the middle period is just right for sleeping, sleeping, sleeping, sleeping away a lifetime.

The Chinese are the most prone to sleep in the world. No, they should be said to be the easiest nation to fall asleep. You can find compatriots napping in any corner. Westerners invented spring beds, Simmons mattresses, down quilts, wool pillows, various pajamas, and even sleeping pills for sleeping. To the Chinese, who can snore loudly in minutes after sitting down, these are all superfluous and overly elaborate. Tram cars, theaters, parks, classrooms, offices... where can't one sleep? We can fall asleep peacefully in any environment and are too lazy to put on so many airs with Westerners just for sleeping. That's why I say the Chinese are the easiest to fall asleep, not the most adept.

More than ten years ago, a German scholar came to China and stayed in a hotel where he couldn't sleep all night due to the noise. Later, he wrote an article saying: "...The shouting, yelling, quarreling, and many sounds I still can't figure out what they were, in the hotel I stayed in, almost made me believe that a revolution was about to break out. What's especially surprising is that everyone else was sleeping soundly. I think the structure of Chinese people's ears must be somewhat different." Although no anatomist has yet proven this, the Chinese people's astonishing environmental adaptability to sleep is an undeniable fact.

Of course, I am not praising insomnia here. Being able to fall asleep easily is indeed a blessing, but the Chinese transitioning from "easy sleep" to "chaotic sleep" is a great misfortune, which has stagnated our culture for hundreds or even thousands of years. In China, a clerk is always a clerk, a typist is always a typist... because they just go to sleep after getting off work. Two or three months ago, I read a passage in a foreign newspaper about a British thief's criticism of the contemporary literary scene in his country. He spoke eloquently and familiarly, showing that this robber did not just eat and doze off after each "burglary and murder" with a full load. He sometimes read books and wrote articles in his den.

The initial idea or motivation for great scientific inventions and literary creations in ancient and modern times often comes from a moment of inspiration. At that time, they didn't consider themselves scientists or writers. They just didn't sleep randomly in their spare time and were willing to sit down and think. If Watt had been sleeping next to the boiling kettle, how could he have "seen the lid open by itself, and wondered about the common meaning" and invented the steam engine?

Why talk about "it's rare to live to seventy years old"? According to statistics, the average lifespan of Chinese people is only forty! If you dig out the "middle section," there is little left before and after. Have we ever had a lively and dynamic youth and a quiet and contemplative old age? Haven't we long since merged into the "middle" to sleep?

### Why Not Open the School Gates Wide?

— Ze Shi

When the Legislative Yuan discussed the University Law and whether there should be equivalent academic qualifications for university admission, some people said: "According to reports from various sources, most of those causing student unrest are first-year university students. Therefore, the entrance exam must be strict, and those with equivalent academic qualifications should not be allowed to apply to universities." Others believed: "The door for those with equivalent academic qualifications to apply to universities must never be opened. Otherwise, those who rely on connections to enter will use this as a shortcut in the future." Both of these gentlemen's remarks made me "very dissatisfied."

The argument that "most of those causing student unrest are first-year university students, therefore the entrance exam must be strict, and those with equivalent academic qualifications should not be allowed to apply to universities" is about as logical as saying: "Most of those crying and making noise in a family are newborn babies. Therefore, we must strictly prevent our children from crying before they are born, and those with organs that have the same potential to cry should not be allowed to be born." Student unrest has no relationship with the strictness of the entrance exam. Because the strictest exam can only come up with difficult questions that even the principal and professors would have difficulty passing, it can never guarantee that students will not cause unrest. Suppose we set an exam question like: "Could Zilu's courage be enough to be a Japanese suicide bomber?" or "Was Bo Niu's disease dengue fever or malaria, and what was the temperature, pulse, and breathing rate when he was dying?" If the examinees could cite scriptures and answer fluently, who would dare to guarantee that this student would not cause student unrest? As for student unrest and equivalent academic qualifications for university entrance exams, they are even more irrelevant, because what they have is academic ability, not the ability to cause student unrest.

The argument that "the door for those with equivalent academic qualifications to apply to universities must never be opened. Otherwise, those who rely on connections to enter will use this as a shortcut" assumes that the goal is to cultivate talents for the country. Is there any reason why the fewer talents, the better? Young people with equivalent academic qualifications who apply to universities rely on "academic ability," not "connections." Why can't this door be opened? Moreover, in reality, not only do students who graduate from middle school and apply to universities based on their academic qualifications often rely on connections because there are too many students and not enough places, but even students who want to enter lower-cost elementary schools also have to rely on connections from their parents because Chinese people only know how to control the number of nuclear weapons and not how to control fertility. It should be known that even if young people rely on connections to seek education, the authorities should always consider their eagerness to learn, and as long as they have the academic ability to pass the exam, they should open the school gates wide. Why hang up a tiger-headed sign saying "Youths, do not enter this important school property!"?

The door that should be closed tightly is the yamen (government office), because those who enter officialdom often do not have certain abilities and rely solely on connections. It's a pity that the bricklayers and carpenters who build the yamen have always been negligent in their work, always leaving a big crack in the door for people to squeeze through!

### Relative

— Ding Zhong

In Shanghai, on the nights of the first and fifteenth of the lunar month, there is always the sound of people selling long ingots (incense). Now, I hear a string of "Want long ingots" outside the window. I really don't understand why old habits are so difficult to change? And the so-called "abolished" lunar calendar never seems to have any hope of being "abolished," probably because it is related to this kind of "serving the dead" thing.

Originally, most things in the world are relative. There must be disadvantages to advantages, and there must be advantages to disadvantages. Taking the two words "life and death," their weight and gain seem to be quite difficult to say. Confucius can be said to be the most practical. He did not advocate mysterious talk, so "the Master did not speak of strange phenomena, feats of strength, disorders, and spiritual beings." He also said, "If you do not yet know about life, how can you know about death?" This practical attitude of paying attention to "living people" and not flattering "dead people" has dominated Chinese politics and society for thousands of years without the slightest change, and has become Confucianism. But people cannot but have ideals in their thoughts, because reality is sometimes unsatisfying; thus, the thoughts of Buddhism infiltrated, and with the later input of Western culture, some people shouted to overthrow the Confucian shop. Buddhism initially seemed to be about self-cultivation and self-certification, but later, someone started offering chanting scriptures and repentance ceremonies to help people transcend death; this reversed the Confucian style, and the so-called pursuit of ideals became a situation where they didn't care about "living people" and only cared about "dead people." Thus, it was again criticized by society as superstition. Placing too much emphasis on "life" has its shortcomings, and focusing solely on "death" also has obvious drawbacks. How to balance "life and death" is worth considering.

Recently, I saw in the newspaper that refugees in Shanghai occupied various coffin depositories. After moving the coffins out, they moved in. It is said that there are five or six coffin depositories occupied in the Yangshupu area. This is indeed a difficult question. Taking care of "life" means not being able to take care of "death," and taking care of "death" means not being able to take care of "life." It is really difficult to satisfy both. Are "dead people" more important or "living people" more important? If there were no coffin depositories to plan for "dead people," the refugees would have no place to occupy; originally, it was for "dead people," but now it has become a way to provide for "living people."

There are countless examples of this kind of relativity. Don't we often see the phrase "imprisonment in taxation"? Then what is the difference between "imprisonment" and "taxation"? Humans are rational animals, and humans are also emotional animals. Both statements are correct. The more I think about it, the less I understand, and the sound of "Want long ingots" comes again.

### Class Reunion Yearbook

— Li Li

At the end of the year and in the cold weather, I suddenly received a class reunion yearbook from Hong Kong. Having been away from school for eight years, with frequent turmoil and separation, news of classmates has long been cut off. I am grateful to the classmate in Hong Kong who actually investigated in great detail. Under the dim light of the cold night, I faced this booklet and couldn't help but feel a thousand emotions!

Our country emphasizes "togetherness," so there are names like "fellow villager," "same year," "same school," and "colleague." This "classmate" combines the meanings of "same year" and "same school" from the past. Eight years of turmoil and still as down-and-out as before, I can't help but feel a lot of "many classmates were young and not humble, riding fat horses in Wu Ling." There are quite a few in the booklet who boast high titles such as "Doctor" and "Professor," but what I care about is that nine out of ten of these "Doctors" and "Professors" are abroad, and the one who came back is in a similar situation to me!

What is even more lamentable is that after eight years of hardship, unexpectedly, so many classmates have died? Apart from one who was bombed to death in an air raid in Guiyang, almost all the others died of lung disease. Even the strong and tall ones who were good at baseball and basketball in school also died of lung disease. Being an impoverished civil servant, with insufficient nutrition and an unstable life, is often the main cause of disease. Looking back on the past, it is truly tearful. Could it be that my classmates were particularly weak and let the country down?

Unexpectedly, the number of classmates who have come to this prosperous city has gradually increased, which I wouldn't have known without the yearbook. The world is full of changes. Those who died have died, those who are overseas are overseas, and what contributions have this group of us who stayed behind made? I am ashamed to say that I seem to be experiencing some middle-age feelings.

### Zhang Pu's Last Work: Poem "Night Mooring by Maple Bridge"

— Shi Chongpeng

Hanshan Temple in Suzhou is famous for the poem "Night Mooring by Maple Bridge" by the Tang Dynasty poet Zhang Ji ("The moon sets, crows caw, frost fills the sky; River maples and fishing lights face my sorrowful sleep. Outside Gusu city is Hanshan Temple; Midnight bells reach the traveler's boat.") Wen Zhengming of the Ming Dynasty once recorded Zhang's original poem on a stone in Hanshan Temple to highlight the scenic spot. Later, due to years of peeling and erosion, Cheng Xuelou repaired Hanshan Temple at the end of the Qing Guangxu period and commissioned Qu Yuan to rewrite the poem "Night Mooring by Maple Bridge" and erected a monument as a memorial. After the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders not only seized the bell of Hanshan Temple (an antique from before the Tang Dynasty), but also moved the stone tablet written by Qu Yuan elsewhere. After the victory, the people of Wu planned to re-engrave the poem to enhance the old system, or planned to ask Shen Yinmo of Wuxing to write it. Only Wu Hufan advocated that Zhang Puquan, a veteran of the Republic of China, write it, because the name of Pu Lao happened to be the same as the original poet Zhang Ji. Therefore, through the introduction of Liu Yusheng and Pu Yicheng, Pu Lao was asked to write it. However, there was no news for a long time, and bad news came that Pu Lao had suffered a stroke and passed away. Hufan was very disappointed, thinking that Hanshan Temple had no chance. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, he suddenly received a letter from Pu Yicheng, and when he saw it, it was indeed Pu Lao's last work, the poem "Night Mooring by Maple Bridge." The brushwork is elegant and vigorous, and the postscript says: "I have long admired the scenic spot of Hanshan Temple. I have traveled to Wu many times, but I have never visited it. Mr. Hufan in Shanghai said that my name is the same as the person who wrote the poem 'Night Mooring by Maple Bridge' in the Tang Dynasty, and asked me to write this poem to be engraved on stone. However, my name takes the meaning of a long-lasting value, not rashly imitating the poet. Zhang Ji of Cangzhou in December of the 36th year of the Republic of China." Among the veterans of the Party and the country, Yu Youren, Wu Zhihui, Li Shizeng, and Zhang Jingjiang are all famous for their calligraphy in the world, and Pu Lao's cursive script is unique among them. The National History Museum believes that since this poem "Night Mooring by Maple Bridge" is Pu Lao's last work, it wants to keep the original work in the museum for memorial after it is engraved on stone. It is said that Hufan has replied to Pu expressing his consent, which is not only a national document, but also a good story in the art world.

### Wandering Flower

Chapter Five: Unexpected Calamity (25)

In the blink of an eye, that Doctor Wei came out wearing a snow-white coat. Zhu Zhai shook hands with him, and pointed to Qi Huan saying, "This is my relative, Miss Li. She had a car accident on the way here, and she is a little injured. Please check her." Doctor Wei led Qi Huan into the house. Two nurses helped to examine her. It was just skin damage on her face and arms, and it wasn't a big deal. Immediately, they washed, disinfected the blood stains on her face and hands, and then applied ointment and wrapped it with bandages. Zhu Zhai asked for a sick room and helped Qi Huan to rest in the bed inside. At this time, Qi Huan's mind was slightly settled, and the pain was slightly lessened. Thinking about it, she felt sad again, and tears kept falling. Zhu Zhai diligently comforted her, "Why do you have to be so pessimistic! The matter has already passed, don't think about it anymore." Qi Huan sobbed, "If I hadn't seen you, I would have drowned myself. I really have no face to live, it's better to die clean!" Zhu Zhai said, "Don't think like that. Tonight, besides you and me, no third person knows. I can swear that no matter what the content of this matter is, I will never ask or mention it, and I will never reveal a single word to others. Do you believe me?" Seeing that he said it so sincerely, Qi Huan was very moved, and couldn't help but hold Zhu Zhai's hand tightly and say, "Before, I only respected you, but now I not only appreciate you, but also..." Saying this, she choked again, and tears continued to flow from her eyes. Zhu Zhai quickly took out the handkerchief that Qi Huan had given him in the park from his suit pocket and gently pressed it on Qi Huan's face. Qi Huan continued, "My temper is very stubborn. I didn't expect to fall into someone else's hands today!" Zhu Zhai said, "You don't have to think about this anymore!" Qi Huan said, "How can I not think about it! I will never forget the shame of today, and I will definitely avenge this! I hate that man named Lin, and I will settle the score with him one day." Zhu Zhai said, "Why do you have to be so knowledgeable with this kind of person! With your identity and future, it's not worth it to associate with this kind of person. Let's not talk about this!" Qi Huan said, "If I don't say it, you won't understand. I'm not a confused person. I wanted to add some stage costumes because I'm staging two historical plays, and this man named Lin promised to provide me with costumes, so I was just perfunctory with him. I originally wanted to take advantage of him, but I didn't expect to suffer a big loss." Seeing that what she said was exactly the same as what Little Wang's mother had told him, it showed that she was struggling for art, and she had no choice but to take this risky and opportunistic behavior due to environmental pressures. He felt both pity and respect in his heart, and squeezed the hand that Qi Huan was holding tightly. He said, "I understand your hard work, and I respect you very much. You are very pure, and you are worthy of admiration for your hard work for the sake of your artistic future. Everything is the sin of society, and it has nothing to do with you. It is the evil society that caused your misfortune, and you fell into this trap. You are so pitiful!"

### Dongpo Pork

— Wang Baili

The Tianxiang Restaurant, a Hunan cuisine restaurant on Guangxi North Road in this city, is famous for its braised "Dongpo Pork." According to the origin of the name "Dongpo Pork," it has been around for a long time. Liang Zhangju's "Continued Talks on Wandering Footprints" also has a record of "Dongpo Pork": Today's food has the name "Dongpo Pork," which means braised pork. Any chef can make it. Some say that we should not insult Dongpo like this. I say that this slope (Dongpo) took it upon himself. Dongpo Gong (Su Shi) has a poem about eating pork, saying, "The pork in Huangzhou is good, and the price is as cheap as dirt. The rich are unwilling to eat it, and the poor don't know how to cook it. Cook it slowly over a low fire with little water, and it will taste delicious when the heat is sufficient. Get up every day and have a bowl, and be satisfied. Don't let anyone else care." When Dongpo was demoted to Huangzhou, he was very poor, but because the price was cheap, he could still eat meat every day. Today, even the cheapest belly pork costs more than 30,000 yuan per catty. If Dongpo were alive today, even if he liked to eat meat, he wouldn't even think about "getting up every day and having a bowl!"

Illustrated Chongqing Storytelling

### The Face of the Sacred Site Map

— Bai Wuwen, Painting by Long Sheng

If it is said that Chongqing in the past few years was a representative work of a sacred site—a sacred anti-war map woven with the sweat and blood of the people of the whole country, it can be said today that this representative work has not only faded, but has also become tattered.

After the restoration, some schools were left here. During the most difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War, although the students ate rice full of impurities, barnyard grass, bran, and sand, they were full, and the calories could still maintain their minimum physical strength; although they used "bright oil lamps" for self-study, the minimum light was still enough to see the mimeographed handouts on Jiale paper; and the tattered cotton-padded jackets and quilts could still cover the strong wind of the mountain city. Today, the students eat red porridge soup, and the monthly lighting fee is only enough for one and a half to two nights, so they have no choice but not to turn on the lights. As for clothes, only 30% of the students in a normal school wear cotton-padded clothes, and 40% huddle in their classmates' quilts and sleep. However, if A is covered, then B cannot be covered, and every night they pull back and forth, like dancing Qing lions during the Lantern Festival.

Many factories were also left after the restoration. Their national industrialists run emergency alarms every day, borrowing money to buy rice for the workers. If not, they implement "robbing the factory,"—searching their own factory for tools or things that can be exchanged for money, and selling them to second-hand stalls. As for the shops that were left behind, let's take an example: you always remember the "369" soup noodle shops that were almost everywhere on the streets back then, right? Most of them have been changed to furniture stores and porcelain shops, selling furniture and bowls and plates piece by piece.

Not to mention the newspapers that were left behind. Some haven't paid their employees for three months, and the white-collar workers waste lead type day after day while starving.

This sacred site map has been smeared with many ink stains. In short, the face is completely different!
