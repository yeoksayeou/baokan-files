### The National Government Proclaims a General Amnesty Order on New Year's Day; Specifies Scope That Arch-Criminals and Heinous Offenders May Not Be Spared Lenience; Measures for Commutation of Sentences to Be Determined by the Judicial Yuan Jointly with the Executive Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] On January 1st, the 36th year of the Republic of China, the National Government issued an order stating that modern criminal policy emphasizes the environment and motives behind a crime. Ordinary cases are the main reason for reducing punishment. Our country's eight years of resistance against Japan were exceptionally difficult, and the people lived in instability, easily violating the law, which is clearly different from peacetime circumstances. Now, after victory, on the day when the Constitution of the Republic of China was formulated and promulgated by the National Assembly, the foundation of the nation is permanently laid, and construction is in full swing. It is appropriate to issue a general amnesty in accordance with the law to initiate opportunities for renewal and improvement. However, amnesty should have a scope, and commutation of sentences should also be implemented to ensure that arch-criminals and heinous offenders are not spared lenience, and that all types of crimes and punishments are reduced or exempted accordingly. Therefore, after being instructed by the Legislative Yuan, the following four items of the bill on amnesty and commutation of sentences for criminals were decided: A. Criminals who committed crimes before December 31st, the 35th year of the Republic of China, and whose heaviest original sentence is imprisonment or less, are all pardoned. B. War criminals and the following crimes are not pardoned or have their sentences commuted: (1) Crimes under Articles 2 to 4 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors; (2) Crimes under Articles 2, 3, 5, and 8 of the Regulations for Punishing Corruption; (3) Crimes of killing direct lineal ascendants; (4) Crimes under the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Offenses that are specifically sentenced to death, or sentenced to death or life imprisonment. C. Except for the crimes in item B, criminals who committed crimes before December 31st, the 35th year of the Republic of China, and whose heaviest original sentence is life imprisonment or more, will have their sentences commuted according to the following standards: (1) Death penalty is reduced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 15 years; (2) Life imprisonment is reduced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 10 years; (3) Imprisonment or concurrent fines are reduced by one-half of the term or amount. D. Detailed measures for commutation of sentences shall be determined by the Judicial Yuan jointly with the Executive Yuan. The above regulations should be implemented immediately by the Judicial and Executive branches respectively. From now on, it is hoped that offenders will deeply understand the normalcy of amnesty and abide by the correct path of the law, cleanse their past misdeeds, and strive to become new citizens. If they dare to harbor resentment and retaliate, the law will still be enforced to punish them. Officials at all levels should especially assist the people, rectify customs, and prevent them from lightly violating the law, in order to fulfill the government's utmost intention of showing compassion and granting amnesty. This is the order.

### Promulgation of the New Constitution Marks the Beginning of Democracy; National Celebration of Universal Renewal; Central Leaders to Pay Respects at the Mausoleum and Hold a Group Greeting Today

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Chairman Chiang and the heads of the Five Yuan signed and promulgated the New Constitution of the Republic of China at the National Government Auditorium at 4:00 PM on the 31st. The ceremony lasted from 4:14 PM to 4:30 PM. The ceremony was simple and solemn and was a great event in Chinese history. The National Government gate and archway were hung with party and national flags, flying in the wind under the sunlight. In the corridor, green palace lanterns and red silver walls reflected each other. The auditorium was decorated solemnly and beautifully, with red cotton palace lanterns hanging from the top, surrounded by colored paper drawings of cotton and the words "Celebrating the Founding Anniversary" and "Celebrating the Promulgation of the Constitution." A platform was set up in front of the center of the hall, with a huge book containing the full text of the Constitution placed on a wooden frame next to the platform. Two drafts of the signing text were prepared on the table, stating as follows: (1) Order of the National Government: The National Assembly has formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China, and it is scheduled to be promulgated on January 1st, the 36th year of the Republic of China, and implemented on December 25th of the same year. Now it is promulgated, this order. (2) Order of the National Government: The National Assembly has formulated the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, and now it is promulgated, this order. The pen prepared on the chairman's table was engraved with "Pen used by Chiang, Chairman of the National Government, to sign the Constitution of the Republic of China, respectfully made by the Civil Affairs Department of the National Government," and the paperweight was engraved with "Savoring plum blossoms lightly while reading." On the right side of the hall were 36 seats for the presidium of the National Assembly, and on the left were seats and desks for the heads of the Five Yuan, arranged in the order of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan. The pens, ink, paperweights, etc. were also specially made. The lower part of the hall was the seating area for 54 Chinese and foreign reporters. At 4:00 PM, Wu Jingheng, Bai Chongxi, Chen Guofu, Yu Bin, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Wang Yunwu, Mo Dehui, Zhang Lisheng, Tian Lan Jin, Liu Hengjing, Hu Shuhua, Zhu Jiahua, Zeng Kuoqing, and other members of the presidium of the National Assembly, as well as Chinese and foreign reporters, arrived one after another. At 3:14 PM, Chairman Chiang, wearing a general's uniform with the Blue Sky White Sun badge, entered the hall amidst music. Everyone stood at attention. The Chairman smiled and nodded frequently, and then took his seat with the heads of the Five Yuan: Song Ziwen, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Dai Jitao, and Yu Youren. Wu Dingchang, the chief of civil affairs, and Wu Siyu, the chief of staff, stood on either side. Under the mercury lights and the sound of cameras, the Chairman and the heads of the Five Yuan signed the Constitution in turn, which took three minutes. The Chairman then flipped through the Constitution once, and then took a group photo with the presidium, exchanged brief greetings, and enjoyed some refreshments before leaving one after another amidst music. The time was exactly 4:30 PM. This grand event in the history of the Republic of China was thus completed.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] On the first day of the year, the capital city celebrated New Year's Day and the completion of the New Constitution. The whole city was decorated with flags and colorful decorations, and all government agencies and schools were closed for three days. In the morning, government leaders paid their respects to the Founding Father at the Mausoleum for the promulgation of the New Constitution, and the public was free to visit the Mausoleum. At the same time, a grand review of the city's defense corps and fire and police drills were held in front of the National Assembly Hall, and a public celebration was held inside the National Assembly Hall. All entertainment venues offered special prices for three days to benefit the public. At 2:00 PM, the Lishi Society held a group wedding for 96 couples.

All civil and military officials will participate in the grand ceremony.

### Welcoming the New Year by Getting Rid of the Old; Chairman Addresses Fellow Countrymen, Promulgation of the Constitution Fulfils the Long-Awaited Wish of Constitutionalism

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Chairman Chiang gave a radio address to fellow countrymen across the country at 8:00 PM on the 31st, titled "Broadcast to Fellow Countrymen on New Year's Day of the 36th Year." The full text is as follows:

Fellow Countrymen across the country: Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China in the 36th year, and it is the first New Year's Day after the victory of the War of Resistance and the return of the National Government to the capital. Every year on this day, we commemorate the grand vision of the Founding Father in revolution and nation-building and the difficult history of establishing the Republic of China. We examine the current situation of the country, hope for the bright future of the nation, and everyone has an excited and inspired mood to welcome the first festival of the year. But this year there is one more thing to especially commemorate, that is, our National Assembly has formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China, and has stipulated the date of implementation and the order of preparation. The National Government today promulgates this Constitution, completing the long-awaited wish of implementing constitutionalism in the country, and realizing the legacy of the Founding Father and the revolutionary martyrs. This Constitution was made after countless difficulties and thousands of twists and turns to convene the National Assembly. The content of the Constitution takes into account both ideals and reality. It has clear provisions for the equal equality of all ethnic groups in the country, Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups, the equal equality of all political parties under the law, and the active protection of the rights and freedoms of the people. The spirit of this Constitution is to gather the opinions of all parties across the country, based on the principles set by the Political Consultative Conference. It can be said that the success or failure of the implementation of this Constitution is a test of whether China can implement democracy, and it also determines the future of national security and survival. From now on, democracy and freedom are no longer empty slogans, but require our countrymen across the country to earnestly exercise their civil rights and fulfill their obligations, and to promote the implementation of the Constitution as scheduled, in order to ensure the long-term peace and stability of the country. This is an epoch-making event since the establishment of the Republic of China, and I would like to especially announce it to my countrymen and express my congratulations to all my countrymen.

Regarding the real difficulties the country has encountered and the suffering the people have experienced in the past year after the victory of the War of Resistance, our government has always regarded it as its own responsibility and has tried its best to find solutions, without ever ignoring it. But there is one important significance that must be pointed out to all our countrymen, that is, we are currently transitioning from the post-war period to the period of restoration and rehabilitation, and from the destruction of war to the period of reconstruction. If any country in the world has suffered such brutal aggression and has undergone such a long and arduous war of resistance for eight years, it cannot immediately restore its pre-war state; this is inevitable and unavoidable. Moreover, before the War of Resistance, China was a country that had not yet completed its nation-building and was backward in everything. After such a long-term war of resistance, the casualties and transfers of population, the depletion of materials, the shaking of the economic foundation, the exhaustion of the financial situation, the destruction of rural and urban areas, the disconnect between production and consumption, and the severe damage to education, culture, and social morality, are not comparable to other countries with solid foundations. During the War of Resistance, I repeatedly expressed to our countrymen the determination to resist Japan and build the nation, to build a completely new China with prosperous and happy Three People's Principles from the ruins, which of course cannot be done within a year and a half. What we regret and are ashamed of today is that after the War of Resistance, we still have to suffer many unnecessary destruction and obstruction within the country. But fellow countrymen must know that the country is owned by our 450 million people, and the times are advancing rapidly and do not allow us to survive by procrastination and delay. We don't need to go back and trace the past year's delay. From today onwards, both the government and the people must work hard with the four words "remove the old and bring forth the new" and work together to innovate day by day. We are now going to implement constitutionalism. The people are the main body of the country. From now on, the fate of the country depends entirely on the people of the country today. Therefore, the government should not shirk its responsibilities, and the people should also fulfill their obligations to the country. Today, I would like to point out the following points to our countrymen across the country:

### The Constitutional Promotion Association May Be Established Next Month

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The organizational measures for the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee are expected to be announced early next month and are currently under negotiation, and it should be established within the next month.

### The Government Exerts the Greatest Patience, Seeking to Achieve Unity and Peace

First, I want to tell our countrymen that the government's policy of maintaining peace and unity will never change. If China is not unified, it cannot survive, and if it is not unified, it cannot revive. The government must guarantee national unity and social peace, and also has the responsibility to protect the safety of the people's lives and property. But the realization of unity must be achieved through peaceful means. In the past year, the government's painstaking efforts and concessions to seek peace and stop conflicts have been witnessed by the people of the country. Our allied friend General Marshall's efforts over the past year have not only helped us complete the work of sending back 3 million Japanese prisoners and expatriates and recovering lost land and restoring sovereignty, but also, with his extraordinary patience, facilitated our peace and unity in many ways. This pure and just friendship is worthy of our national admiration. Now that the Constitution has been promulgated, the country will quickly enter the open road of democratic constitutionalism. We will expand the foundation of the government, enlist the joint participation of various parties and non-party people, and promote the implementation of politics and strengthen the effectiveness of politics in accordance with the Peaceful Nation-Building Outline decided by the Political Consultative Conference. Although the Chinese Communist Party has refused to participate in the National Assembly and abandoned its responsibility for nation-building, I can simply explain the government's handling of the Communist Party issue, and still adhere to the policy of resolving political issues through political methods. If there is any opportunity to enable the government's political solution to be realized, the government will never give up that opportunity. What the government hopes from the Communist Party is that it will sincerely implement the various agreements that have been established, implement the cessation of conflict, abide by the established plans for restoring transportation and reorganizing and unifying the army established by the Three-Person Conference, and no longer attempt to seize power by force, so that the country can have the opportunity for peaceful construction, and so that the fellow countrymen who have survived the disaster will no longer feel the pain and threat of destroying peace. Apart from this, there is nothing else to ask. The government will never close the door to peaceful negotiations, and also expects the Communist Party to participate in the government, follow the path of democracy, and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. As for promoting constitutionalism, completing restoration, carrying out construction, relieving the suffering of the people, and other things that any government must be responsible for doing, the government will never delay them because negotiations with the Communist Party have not yielded results. In short, the government will, on the one hand, do its utmost to realize democracy and constitutionalism, and on the other hand, exert its greatest possible patience to seek unity and peace. This is the main policy of the government this morning, and it must first be announced to our countrymen across the country.

### May Our Countrymen Correct Perverted Habits

Second, I hope that our fellow countrymen will correct the perverted habits after the war. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the countryside has been desolate, transportation has been blocked, the urban population has increased, and urban society has shown a perverted prosperity, and the urban atmosphere has exposed endless shortcomings. The most common and dangerous phenomenon in our domestic cities is the complete loss of national morality. In terms of industry and commerce, normal operations are precarious, and speculative and adventurous behaviors are increasing day by day, either evading taxes and smuggling, or deceiving and profiting. In a short period of time, one can become extremely rich, and others follow suit, forming a common practice. The prevalence of usury and the fluctuations of prices are all caused by this kind of profiteering hot money. The impact is that everyone regards getting something for nothing as omnipotent, and has cultivated a mentality of complacency and luck, so that etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame are swept away, this is one. In terms of the general atmosphere, extravagance and waste are unrestrained, and cunning and plunder have become a common practice. Honesty is considered pedantic, and self-respect is ridiculed as backward. The atmosphere of speculation and opportunism has spread from cities to general society. In order to deceive the ignorant masses, some people do not hesitate to reverse black and white, confuse right and wrong, in order to achieve their personal unspeakable purposes. Benefiting oneself without caring for harming others, and even not caring about harming the country, this is two. In terms of the current labor-capital situation, our pre-war construction foundation was already very weak, and national industry was originally very immature. After this war, it was severely damaged. Since the restoration, the good relationship of labor-capital cooperation has been agitated and destroyed by the selfish and self-serving trend in cities. Mutual encroachment and plunder, disputes have arisen every day, and the future of industry is already worrying. If both labor and capital only care about their own interests and cannot cooperate sincerely to maintain the life of this little remaining industry, once factories close down and the economy goes bankrupt, not only will labor and capital perish together, but production will be stagnated, which will inevitably affect the survival of the entire society. Then our economic foundation, which was spared from the enemy's destruction during the war, is instead destroyed by ourselves after the war, wouldn't it become a sinner of the War of Resistance, this is three.

### One Should Be Greatly Ashamed of Luxury and Debauchery, and Regard Speculation and Opportunism as Utterly Evil; Hope Our Countrymen Will Establish a New Atmosphere

In short, the decline of morality and the degeneration of the spirit, no country or era has ever exposed the phenomenon exposed in our urban society after the war today. This phenomenon is really not what the people who won the eight-year war of resistance should have. When I say this, I not only feel heartache, but I really feel chilled for our country. Cities were originally the gathering place of culture, economy, and outstanding essence, and should be a model for the inland countryside, and also related to international image. But the current situation is like this, how can our country not be ridiculed and despised? The formation of this phenomenon is actually due to the residue of the enemy's and puppets' enslavement influence during the period of occupation, but some people also believe that it is the influence of the endless internal strife. The country cannot be peacefully unified, so the economy cannot be stable, life cannot be stable, and the social people's hearts cannot have a place to rest. Regardless of the reason, I always hope that our urban compatriots, especially the leaders of the industrial, commercial, and cultural circles, will set an example and reverse the declining trend, and must regard luxury and debauchery as great shame and speculation and opportunism as utterly evil, persuade each other, encourage each other, and jointly create a new atmosphere for our country's nation-building. In this time when human desires are rampant and society is floating, everyone should have the determination to reverse the tide and the spirit of changing customs to correct this shameful and sad bad habit. We must not lose heart because of the temporary phenomenon of domestic turmoil. On the contrary, we should be more cautious and firm because of the existence of the internal crisis, and respect and cherish ourselves. We must think of our heroic achievements in the War of Resistance. Even with such a powerful enemy as Japan invading our country for eight years, we finally defeated him. Then, now that the War of Resistance has been victorious and the external troubles have been eliminated, if our people can all give full play to the inherent morality of our nation, be responsible, abide by our duties, understand etiquette, know integrity, correct people's hearts, and promote justice, have a forward-looking goal, and have the courage to move forward, then self-improvement and restoring order from chaos will be as easy as turning one's hand. As the saying goes, "It is up to people," no matter what obstacles cannot hinder our national revival, nor can it prevent us from completing the common cause of building the country.

### Young People Should Understand Right and Wrong and Not Be Swayed by Others

Third, I hope that our youth across the country will attach importance to the contribution of nation-building. Young students are the masters of the country's future and the hope for the nation's safety and survival. The rise and fall of the country depends entirely on the ambitions and actions of the youth. During our eight years of War of Resistance, the number of young people entering school increased year by year, and talents emerged in large numbers. This is the best phenomenon in the country, but I have observed that the current knowledge youth are often too sensitive to the environment, too demanding of reality, lack self-control, and lack confidence in the future. Therefore, they are easily incited and manipulated by politicians and ambitious people who have ulterior motives. They are influenced by their propaganda and seduced by their temptations. Some are depressed because they are dissatisfied with the status quo, and some are extreme because they have lost hope in politics. In any case, they are all great losses to the country. In fact, in the past year, the government has tolerated how much in order to seek peace, and after eight years of resisting Japan, when our country is working hard to recover, who is it that is allowing our fellow countrymen to suffer such unprecedented pain, misery, displacement, casualties and tragedies again? The facts are there, and they are very clear. Now that the National Assembly has been closed, and the Constitution has been formulated and promulgated, whether the government has the intention of one-party dictatorship and monopoly can be clearly seen. Today I want to especially remind our young people across the country that you must not be swayed by propaganda with ulterior motives and mislead your whole life. When the Founding Father was alive, he once told our revolutionary youth that young people who are determined to revolutionize must first "understand right and wrong and distinguish between interests and harms." Today, our standards for determining right and wrong and interests and harms are very clear. We must support everything that is actively enterprising and helps national construction. Conversely, we must oppose everything that destroys society, disrupts the country, and causes our nation to regress. Isn't this very simple and clear? Young people, you must especially cherish the time of youth, cherish your hard-won and fleeting time, and do not waste your years and wait until you are old to grieve. You must know that what China urgently needs today is nothing more than construction. To improve the lives of our countrymen lies in construction, to overcome economic difficulties lies in construction, to eliminate the pain of unemployment lies in construction, and to consolidate the foundation of the country and to preserve the fruits of victory also lies in construction. Our pre-war construction plans and the only construction achievements were delayed and destroyed by more than eight years of War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the unequal treaties have been abolished, it can be said that all factors hindering construction have been completely cleared. And now is exactly after the Second World War, and the allied countries are mostly willing to actively help us revive and build, how can we give up this rare opportunity that is difficult to obtain and easy to lose.

### Abandon Past Daydreams and Choose the True Path

Four years ago, when the unequal treaties were abolished, in the book "The Destiny of China," I drafted a statistical table of the ten-year construction plan after the war. Just in terms of senior cadres, it would require 550,000 university graduates. I hope everyone will take another look at this statistical table, and you will know the greatness of our country's construction future and the infinity of contributing opportunities. You have rich knowledge, a good youth, and strong physical strength. Why should you be wandering in boredom and indignation, and consuming yourselves in empty and useless political struggles, instead of contributing to the great cause of nation-building and creating practical benefits for our countrymen across the country? Young people must know that if China continues to be in chaos and destruction, you will suffer the most, and if it is stable and progressing, you will enjoy the greatest honor and happiness in the future. You are in your prime, and you must recognize your responsibilities to the country and the nation, have absolute confidence, and be sure that our success in nation-building after the victory of the War of Resistance is inevitable. No matter what sabotage, it cannot hinder our great cause of construction, and after the construction is successful, our China's future will inevitably be very bright. Only with confidence can you face the facts squarely, only then can you endure hardship, and only then can you work together to fight for a clear China. Young people, abandon your daydreams, choose the true path you should take and move forward, only then will you not fail your life.

### Common Sincere Cooperation to Lay the Foundation for Long-Term Peace and Stability

My fellow countrymen across the country, our past year can be said to be a year full of worries and a year of missed opportunities. Let's take a look at how many countries in the world that fought side by side with us have already sorted things out and completed their recovery. We must also see how many allied countries with a more abundant material base are still controlling consumption and practicing economy after the war, and how many countries are mobilizing and increasing production to make up for the losses of the war and create post-war prosperity. Even many defeated countries are struggling to survive and develop. Compared to them, we cannot practice economy, nor can we strive to produce. Even our domestic order cannot be universally stabilized. Thinking about this makes me wonder how we can strive to improve ourselves and be ashamed and self-reliant. At this time of the year, I sincerely hope that my fellow countrymen will make a common and consistent effort with the determination to get rid of the old and bring forth the new. Our Constitution has been promulgated, and democratic constitutionalism will be implemented within a year. The realization of peaceful reunification has a common path to follow. As long as everyone cooperates sincerely, assumes responsibility, and lays the foundation for our long-term peace and stability, and promotes the work of our Three People's Principles construction, then our Republic of China's future will inevitably be bright. I sincerely wish our countrymen across the country a happy New Year! (End)

### On the Question of Preparing for Constitutional Implementation, the Youth Party Issues a Declaration

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Youth Party recently issued a declaration on the question of preparing for the implementation of constitutional government, hoping that the whole country will cherish this constitution, which has finally been achieved after much hardship. It also offers three points of opinion, hoping that all people will share a sincere spirit and strive to move forward. (1) Truly disseminate the essence of the constitution so that all people can generally understand it; (2) During the transitional period between the end of political tutelage and the beginning of constitutional government, the people should exercise their power to supervise the government; (3) During the transitional period, the government should reform practical political measures.

### Zhang Qun Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing for Talks: Government is Preparing for Reorganization, Hoping All Parties Participate So Constitution Can Be Implemented on Schedule

[Our Newspaper's Report] Discussions on the reorganization of the government were active on the 31st. Zhang Qun arrived on the 31st and held talks. Later, he discussed with Huang Yanpei at his Shanghai residence at 11:00 am, and Lei Zhen returned to Nanjing that night.

[Central News Agency, this city] Zhang Qun arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by night train from Nanjing. In the afternoon, he met with reporters at his private residence and answered questions as follows:

(1) He has met with Mr. Huang Yanpei, Zhang Lan, Zhang Junmai, and others this time, facilitating contact with all parties.

(2) The government is now preparing for reorganization in accordance with the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) to broaden the base of the government, hoping that all parties will participate together so that after the Constitution is promulgated, all constitutional preparatory work can be completed in order and the constitution can be implemented on schedule. Regarding this matter, opinions have been exchanged with all parties.

(3) He hopes and welcomes the CCP's participation in the government.

(4) The government has repeatedly expressed its intention to resume peace talks. Not only has the policy never changed, but it also hopes that peaceful unification can be achieved as soon as possible so that reconstruction work can be actively carried out.

(5) Since last year when Japan surrendered, and I was appointed to represent the government in the peace talks, I have been determined to work tirelessly. I have done my best for anything conducive to the peace talks. There is no new news to report recently, but as long as the CCP is willing to talk, the government is always waiting.

(6) The government did consider sending a representative to Yan'an. If it is truly beneficial to the peace talks and requires me to go, I will not hesitate to go. Finally, the reporter asked: It is rumored that Chairman Zhang will not return to Sichuan and will take up an important position in the central government. Is this true?

Zhang said: Recently, newspapers often "appoint officials" for people casually. I am not the only one who has been appointed. Such rumors are completely unfounded and not worth paying attention to. With that, Zhang bid farewell to the reporters with a smile.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Recently, discussions on the reorganization of the government have moved from Nanjing to Shanghai. Nanjing is in a festive mood. Jiang Yuntian, who had just returned to Nanjing from Beiping, went to Anhui Province at 11:00 am on the 31st. The Democratic League's office was empty, and no one was at the Youth Party's office either. The reporter met Wang Bingnan and Mei Yi at the CCP Liaison Office. Mei Yi gave a few words as a New Year's greeting: "Peace talks may not necessarily have a hopeful outcome, but peace talks will definitely reopen."

### Universities in Beiping Resume Classes Yesterday; Slogans on Peking University Walls Have All Been Removed; Tianjin Mayor Sends Letter to Students of Various Schools Encouraging Resumption of Classes

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 31st] Universities in Beiping City have resumed classes today. Only the Beiping branch of Peiyang University held a supplementary parade today. The reporter visited Peking University, Sino-French University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Chaoyang University and other schools in the city. Students at each school were carrying books and going in and out of classrooms, attending classes as usual. The colorful slogans on the Democracy Wall of Peking University have all been removed, leaving only scattered remnants of slogans. The Dongjian incident, which caused a great uproar, has come to an end. It is reported that Xiang Da, an authority on the history of Sino-foreign transportation, was insulted yesterday for advising some people not to tear down slogans. Xiang Da has therefore submitted his resignation to the school. This afternoon, students of the Department of History held a meeting to resolve to ask President Hu Shi to retain Professor Xiang. In addition, they also questioned Dean Chen Xueping. The Beiping branch of Peiyang University did not participate in the big parade yesterday. Today, in response to the call of the students at the Tianjin headquarters, all students also set off on a parade in the afternoon. More than 300 students distributed leaflets along the way through Xisi, Xidan, East and West Chang'an Street, Wangfujing, and East Jingshan Street, shouting slogans. The content was the same as yesterday. Police were present to protect them along the way, and the order was good.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 31st] The ripple effect of Tianjin students protesting the atrocities of American soldiers continues to expand. On the evening of the 30th, students from Nankai University, Peiyang University, Institut des Hautes Études Commerciales et Industrielles, Jizhong Institute of Technology, and 11 public and private schools held a joint meeting overnight, deciding to unanimously support the protest. The order at the meeting was quite good. On the 31st, Jizhong Institute of Technology followed Peiyang University and Nankai University in going on strike. Mayor Du Jianshi issued a letter to the students of Nankai and Peiyang Universities today, with sincere and earnest words, gently encouraging them to resume classes. The authorities of each school are very cautious about the current situation.

### Zhejiang University Students to Parade Today

Suzhou School Authorities Express No Opinion

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 31st] The Beiping American soldier atrocity incident has caused fluctuations in Hangzhou. Zhejiang University students have all asked for leave to strike today and held a general meeting to decide to launch a parade at 1:00 pm tomorrow. Upon hearing this news, Chairman Shen immediately met with Director Li of the Department of Education and summoned the principals of various middle schools in the city to talk, stating that the American soldier atrocity is a legal issue and has nothing to do with the government. The actions of Zhejiang University students are making a mountain out of a molehill and have deviated from the topic, inevitably being used by others. Therefore, the principals of various middle schools stated that the students of their respective middle schools would not participate in the parade. Hangzhou High School also asked for general leave at one point today.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 31st] Some students of the National College of Social Education in Suzhou, in response to the Beiping students' protest against the rape of a Peking University female student by an American soldier, organized a support association for the Beiping students' protest against American soldier atrocities, which led to a strike. Today, student representatives from various schools in the city, such as Soochow University and Suzhou Women's Normal School, went to the College of Social Education to contact each other, preparing to jointly send a telegram to the whole country to support the government and serve as a diplomatic backing. However, the authorities of each school have not yet expressed any opinion on this movement.

### Japanese War Criminal Tsurumaru Executed by Firing Squad; Refused to Kneel Stubbornly Before Execution; Only Completely Died After Twenty Shots Were Fired

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Japanese war criminal Kōkichi Tsurumaru was executed in Nanjing on the 31st, dying after twenty shots. The criminal was 49 years old and previously served as a sergeant in the Kempeitai. He illegally killed our soldiers and civilians in the occupied areas and abused cruel torture methods such as waterboarding and feeding to dogs. The evidence of his crimes was clear and obvious. He was arrested in Shanghai after the victory and escorted to Nanjing on February 21 of the 35th year to be tried by the War Crimes Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. On December 18 of the same year, he was sentenced by the tribunal, and on the 30th, he was approved for execution by a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. At 10:50 am on the 31st, the supervising officer Chen Guangyu, accompanied by the clerk Ding Xiang'an and translator Huang Wenzheng, went to the Xiaoying war criminal detention center to open a temporary court. The criminal was brought out, his identity was verified, and he was instructed to arrange his belongings and prepare his will. Then, he was handcuffed and escorted to the Yuhuatai execution ground at 11:40 am. Unexpectedly, after the criminal got out of the prison car, he stood in the middle of the road and refused to move forward. He also insisted on asking for a cigarette. After the supervising officer agreed, he greedily smoked it. Then, the escorting soldiers pushed him to the execution site and ordered him to kneel facing south, but he smirked and refused, shouting three times wildly. The escorting soldiers then blindfolded him with a white cloth. The supervising officer ordered the firing squad to fire, and the execution was carried out by Zhao Xiaozeng, the platoon leader of the guard regiment of the Ministry of National Defense. Amidst the thunderous drumbeat-like cheers of more than a thousand spectators on the hillside, he fired two bursts of submachine gun fire at his back. The criminal remained standing and did not fall. He was struck by a third shot before he fell, but he still did not die. The executioner then fired six more shots, but after a minute, the criminal still struggled to raise his head. At this point, the executioner continued to fire twelve shots, and only after the last three shots hit his head did he finally die. After the autopsy was completed, the local guard dragged him to the back of the mountain for burial.

### Shen Honglie Returns to Hangzhou After Completing Inspection Tour of Wenzhou and Taizhou; Says the Security Situation in Various Places is Still Good

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 31st] Shen Honglie, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, returned to Hangzhou at 2:00 pm today after inspecting Wenzhou, Taizhou, and 19 counties in the fourth district for more than a month. He immediately met with our reporter and talked about his impressions of the tour. He believes that the finances of various counties are difficult, and the funding of township offices is even non-existent. The treatment of staff needs to be improved. Fortunately, the county councils are cooperating with the county governments to resolve many difficulties. The collection of land taxes is generally poor due to unclear land registers and slow collection, but there are no irregularities. Education in various counties is also limited by funding, so it is generally felt to be insufficient, especially national education. In the future, the abstract methods of the past should be corrected. In terms of construction, water conservancy projects have been widely launched, but they are still in the initial stages. They will be completed by the end of March next year and will be able to irrigate more than 10,000 acres of land. Regarding road traffic, the roadbed is no longer a problem, but the funding for bridges is not available. No cases of robbery of fishing boats have been heard on the coast of Ningbo and Wenzhou. Fishermen are safe and secure. A fishery loan of 1.4 billion yuan has been approved by the central government, and the only question now is how to distribute it. In terms of security, Taizhou is the best. The road conditions are poor on the border between Wenzhou and Yongle, and there are no bandits in Fuyang and Lishui.

He specifically requested the central government to provide assistance. Bei agreed to this opinion and stated that the provisional measures for foreign exchange control may be revised to meet the needs of domestic industrial construction. According to Xie's estimate, it will be possible to absorb 10 million US dollars in foreign investment, and the province intends to request the central government to borrow 2 billion yuan for the repayment period, which Bei has gladly accepted.

### Loan Applications for Newspapers in Various Places Should First Be Made to Local Branches

Responsible Person of the Four Joint Offices Speaks

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Newspapers in various places, due to the need for working capital, have been asking the Four Joint Offices to request loans from national banks and bureaus. According to the person in charge of the office: The economic difficulties of various newspapers are indeed a fact. Many have come to negotiate loans. Recently, the loan applications of various newspapers in Nanjing have been made individually by the newspapers to national banks. If newspapers in other cities need loans, they must first apply individually to the local branches of the Four Joint Offices or the local national banks. If they apply directly to the headquarters of the Four Joint Offices, they must still be sent to the local branches for investigation of their business and financial situation, as well as their asset and liability status, before they can be approved, which will take time and delay the process.

### Reorganization of Administrative Divisions in Yunnan Province

Editorial

### Welcome to the Start of the Year of Democratic Constitutionalism - New Year's Message, Year 36 of the Republic of China

Today is New Year's Day of the 36th year of the Republic of China, which is also our nation's greatest national founding anniversary of democracy. The new Constitution of the Republic of China, after being signed by Chairman Chiang, was also solemnly promulgated today, bringing the democratic nation-building history of the Chinese nation to a conclusion. From today onwards, we begin to enter a new era of true democratic constitutionalism. Therefore, at the beginning of the year 36 of the Republic of China, looking back and forward, we can prove that the history of the Republic of China over the past 36 years has been a most important period from decline to revival, from darkness to light. Now that this new page of history is being written, we should accept all the painful lessons we have suffered since the Republic of China, and we should strengthen the confidence we have gained in the process of revolution and resistance against Japan. Starting this year, starting today, let us work together to implement party politics and achieve the final success of democratic nation-building.

We believe that the Xinhai Revolution, the eight-year War of Resistance, and today's nation-building are absolutely one and the same thing. The Xinhai Revolution was based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of the Three Principles of the People, the eight-year War of Resistance was the activation of the nation's self-defense instinct, and today's nation-building is even more the result of the people's desire to build a new independent and autonomous Republic of China. Therefore, although the process can be divided into hardship, resistance, and nation-building, in reality, it is absolutely one and the same thing. The War of Resistance and nation-building are actually an extension of the Xinhai Revolution. At the same time, we deeply believe that the real difficulty of democratic nation-building lies in ourselves, not in the outside world. Looking back at the history of the Republic of China over the past 36 years, on this day in the first year of the Republic, the cornerstone of nation-building planted by Dr. Sun Yat-sen only lasted for a little over a year before it began to shake, and in the fourth year of the Republic, the change of Hongxian occurred. For the ten years from the fifth year of the Republic onwards, warlords were in chaos, the north and south confronted each other, and it was impossible to achieve unification. Later, thanks to Chiang Kai-shek's leadership of the National Revolutionary Army in the Northern Expedition, China was unified under the National Government in less than two years, and it has been nearly 21 years now. During this period, on the one hand, disagreements within the Kuomintang led to several changes; on the other hand, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established a Soviet government in Jiangxi, attempting to seize power by force, and after ten years of conflict, the situation began to improve, but foreign troubles followed one after another, eventually evolving into a full-scale war of resistance. Fortunately, our soldiers bravely resisted, day after day for eight years, and finally achieved an unprecedented victory in our history, making our country's international status leap from a semi-colony to one of the five great powers. However, the fruits of victory soon began to rot, and the emotions of the people of the whole country changed from jubilation to astonishment, to sighs, to frustration.

Now, looking back on the past, since the 36th year of the Republic, the country has been in turmoil almost every day. Only a solid and powerful central force, representing the interests of the nation and the country, struggling for survival, can turn danger into safety, transform peril into peace, and finally overcome any difficulties it faces. Taking the domestic situation after the victory as an example, after the Japanese army surrendered, the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party followed. The Communist army not only "competed to accept surrender" with the government everywhere, but also destroyed transportation in various places, preventing the work of repatriation and reception from proceeding. Later, the CCP willingly took the lead in openly expanding its territory by force, fighting for cities and land, which led to the outbreak of a war of all evils. The flames of war spread from North China to Northeast China to northern Jiangsu, burning half of China. The government, knowing the people's urgent desire for peace, repeatedly engaged in peace talks with the CCP and issued ceasefire orders, but it was never able to achieve domestic peace. Even today, as we celebrate New Year's Day, celebrate the new Constitution, and commemorate the Xinhai Revolution, the wars in various places have not abated under the CCP's offensive. The severity of this situation is truly unimaginable. At the same time, because the war has not stopped, national transportation is blocked, industry and commerce are depressed, prices are soaring, and the people are living in misery, the Republic of China has once again encountered an unprecedented difficulty, the severity of which even exceeds that of the War of Resistance.

However, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the government fully demonstrated the spirit of doing its best. No matter how difficult the environment, it still moved step by step towards the two major goals of "political democratization" and "nationalization of the army." Although the National Assembly was repeatedly postponed due to the demands of factions, it finally opened in late November of last year and completed the great task of writing the constitution. Although the content of the new Constitution is not perfect, it has lofty ideals and takes into account reality. It can be said to have been created by synthesizing the opinions of various parties in the country. The British and American media have praised it. Today, the National Government solemnly promulgates it. All people who truly love the country and the nation should warmly celebrate it, wishing it to become the code of conduct followed by the 400 million people of the Republic of China, and wishing it to truly promote China's entry into a new era of peace and democracy.

Therefore, the 36th year of the Republic of China is our nation's year of democratic constitutionalism. Standing at the beginning of this year, looking forward to the future of the Republic of China, our belief that nation-building will surely succeed is even stronger, and our eyes are filled with the light of hope. However, "be cautious in planning the beginning of things." We should make even greater efforts and be even more cautious at the beginning of this year of democratic constitutionalism. The National Assembly representatives who will implement the constitution will be elected this year, and the first president will also be elected this year. How closely related this year is to the future of democratic nation-building! We only hope that the wars and sufferings of the 35th year will be like yesterday's death, and that the peace and democracy of the 36th year will be born from today. Finally, we respectfully wish the success of the year of democratic constitutionalism!

### Atomic Energy Commission Report Passed - US Wins Major Moral Victory - Baruch Says the Day of Achieving Atomic Control is Still Far Away - Future Development Depends on the Security Council

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 30th] After the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission passed the draft report with ten votes today, US representative Baruch, the drafter of the draft, said that the passage of the report was a moral victory, but because the Soviet Union still opposed some parts of it, it is expected that the day of realizing the prohibition of atomic weapons is still quite far away. Baruch also said that the next stage will be the drafting of an international convention on the control of atomic energy by the Security Council. The convention will be discussed chapter by chapter in detail, and all countries can raise objections as much as possible.

[United Press, Lake Success, 30th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a meeting today. Despite strong opposition from the Soviet Union, the US atomic energy control plan was passed by a large majority of ten votes to zero and immediately transferred to the Security Council for discussion, but there is still a possibility of being vetoed by the Soviet Union. The final form of the US plan is included in the interim report of the commission. When voting, the Soviet Union and Poland abstained, and China, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands enthusiastically supported it. French representative Parodi declared that he agreed with the substantive aspects of the case, but wished to remove the words "no veto power" in the section on punishing the treaty. Soviet representative Gromyko, although he did not vote, strongly attacked the US plan, predicting that the Soviet Union may use its veto power in the Security Council to strike down the report, or at least strike down the provision that the five major powers should waive their veto power in punishing countries that violate the atomic energy control agreement. Polish representative Lange publicly expressed this concern, saying that his abstention was due to the feeling that the report contained provisions that the five permanent members could not accept. The United States has made every effort to fight for the section that no veto power should be used for punishing countries that violate the atomic control code. The report, which is 89 pages long, has established a foundation for the US advocacy of a complete system of international control and supervision. All the issues have been included in the report and passed section by section by the plenary meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission. Except for the provision on the veto power, which was fiercely debated, at least ten of the twelve members of the commission fully supported it. US representative Baruch was determined to request that the words "no veto power" be specifically included and submitted for a vote. The report is generally in accordance with Mr. Baruch's proposal of June 14, advocating the implementation of an international control and supervision system. The main points of the agreement are as follows: (1) Prohibit the manufacture, storage, or use of atomic weapons; (2) Existing atomic weapons should be disposed of; (3) Stipulate the complete freedom of implementation of supervision; (4) Establish institutions to promote the exchange of basic knowledge about atomic energy; (5) Specifically stipulate the acts of sabotage that constitute international crimes and the methods of punishment; (6) Serious acts of sabotage must be immediately reported to the signatory countries of the agreement, the United Nations General Assembly, and the Security Council of the United Nations; (7) No veto power is allowed to protect those who deliberately violate the agreement. Gromyko once again used English to refuse the US request to abolish the veto power for atomic energy control, and suggested that the plan be discussed item by item. It is said that this is the most urgent meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Soviet government believes that all the shortcomings in the US draft should be removed.

### French Reinforcements Arrive in Vietnam - Viet Minh Determined to Resist Long-Term - French Side Claims Confidence in Restoring Order

[United Press, Saigon, 30th] French military commander in Vietnam, Leclerc, declared today that the war with the Viet Minh forces may not end quickly. French reinforcements have arrived and order can be expected to be restored, but the situation may not be calm within a few days. Leclerc plans to go to Tokyo soon.

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 31st] The governor's office and the vicinity of the train station here were shelled by Viet Minh troops last night, suffering slight damage, but there were no casualties. At dawn this morning, French artillery returned fire on the Viet Minh positions on the sea embankment. At the same time, aircraft were dispatched to bomb them. In the Hue area, the Viet Minh forces continued to exert strong pressure on the city. The battles in other areas are calm.

[United Press, Paris, 30th] "Paris Soir" published Overseas Minister Moutet's remarks in Vietnam, saying that France is prepared to negotiate a solution to the Vietnam issue, but France intends to ensure the safety of its military and civilians in Vietnam before considering the details of a political agreement with the Viet Minh. France has never rejected any suggestions or reviews that may be helpful in resolving the issue.

At the same time, former French military commander in the Far East, Leclerc, declared in Saigon that French reinforcements are heading to Vietnam, and France is confident in restoring order. Leclerc is now personally leading the French troops. The new war in Vietnam is mostly concentrated near Nam Dinh, where the Viet Minh forces are attacking fiercely. The siege of the two ports of Hue and Do Son is becoming tighter. The Viet Minh radio broadcast that the Viet Minh army counterattacked the French army positions south of Hanoi and recaptured a police station. The Viet Minh artillery continued to bombard the French army positions. The Viet Minh artillery fire destroyed the top floor of the Banque de l'Indochine building east of Nam Dinh, causing many French casualties. French aircraft strafed a local Viet Minh civilian hospital with machine guns. Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh recently convened a cabinet meeting in a certain place, reaffirming his determination to resist indefinitely.

### Montgomery's Trip to the Soviet Union - Very Profound Intentions - Insightful Views of British Military Figures

[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] Regarding British Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery's visit to Moscow, British military figures neither confirmed nor denied whether a staff meeting was held before Montgomery's departure. According to well-informed sources, the purpose of Montgomery's trip is to study the trip of transportation and supply experts Generals Roberts and Gartson to Moscow. If studying military strategy issues, he will request his most capable assistant, air force strategist General Simpson, to accompany him. It is heard that the main purpose of Montgomery's trip is to ease the rift within the Labour Party and those who oppose Foreign Secretary Bevin's foreign policy. According to reports, after Montgomery successively made speeches in the United States, Canada, and Austria, there were widespread rumors that the United Kingdom and the United States would conclude a military alliance, which led to an increasing number of people in the United Kingdom opposing Foreign Secretary Bevin's policy. Therefore, after Montgomery returned to the country from Austria, he remembered that Soviet leader Marshal Stalin had invited him to visit the Soviet Union during the Potsdam Conference. Judging from this, Montgomery's trip to Moscow was actually initiated by himself.

### Japanese Discovered Uranium Ore in the Northeast

[United Press, New York, 30th] According to a Tokyo dispatch from Huo Cheng, it has been confirmed by the Resource Group of the MacArthur Headquarters that the Japanese discovered uranium ore in the Northeast during the war. It is said that "the uranium ore is located 150 miles northwest of Lushun, which is now under Soviet military control. As of today, American experts have not been able to determine how much uranium ore was mined in Poland during the war, but they believe that a large amount of iron was moved for other purposes."

### Peking Opera Program Performed in London

[Reuters, London, 31st] The son of the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Zhang Tianlong, has formed a Peking Opera troupe and is scheduled to perform at the Westminster Theatre in London on January 20. This is the first time that Peking Opera has been performed in England.

### MacArthur Issues New Year's Message to the Japanese - The Future of Japan Depends on Repentance and Reform

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] Allied Supreme Commander General MacArthur issued his New Year's message to the Japanese today. The content is as follows:

"In the past year, all parties have deeply believed that Japan's social system has made considerable progress. This progress is along the most progressive and free path, and is based on the concepts of equal opportunity and personal freedom, thereby enhancing the dignity, welfare, and joy of the people. In 1946, what we have accomplished is numerous, and what remains to be completed is also not small. 1946 can be called the year of reform. The Japanese government representing the people has been established, and the Japanese people have also obtained the right and opportunity to live freely. Many Japanese leaders are able to devote themselves to solving Japan's problems, and most Japanese people are also determined to abandon the past and create a better future. Everything in Japan in the coming year will further affect the welfare of the Japanese people in the next generation. The new Constitution will come into effect next year, and land reform will also be implemented successively. The Japanese people will also have the opportunity to elect new leaders using their own will. Reform and freedom will be immortal, or the problems that need to be solved urgently will become a fleeting moment. This depends on the Japanese people to decide for themselves. The Japanese people are now facing a lot of everything in Japan today, and will affect the future of Japan. The Japanese people will understand and uphold this opportunity, and resolutely deal with various problems. This is my wish and my firm wish. Japan's recovery depends on this, and the Japanese people's future opportunities for peace and happiness also depend on this, and the hopes of the people of the Far East to strive for civilization also depend on this."

### Rumor Has It That the Soviet Union Agrees to the Establishment of a Federation in Germany - The Establishment of a Central Government Is Problematic

[Reuters, London, 30th] The rumor that the Soviet Union intends to support the proposal to establish a federation in Germany at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March next year has surprised well-informed diplomatic circles here. The Soviet Union's most recent statement on the German issue was the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference in New York in early December. The future administrative issues of Germany were listed as the second item on the agenda. Until now, it has generally been expected that the Soviet Union will support the establishment of a central government when discussing the political system of Germany. Well-informed sources believe that this is actually a matter of degree. Therefore, although the Soviet Union will support the federal system, it will not oppose the establishment of a central administrative system. It is expected that the Foreign Ministers' Conference will determine the powers of the central and local governments when discussing this issue, and when should a central government be established. The main factor that is not suitable for the establishment of a central government system is the disparity in the opinions of political parties in the occupied areas.

This statement was resolutely denied by the French authorities today. It is said that Bidault's representative, Muville, revealed the French intention in this regard at the Four-Power Conference in New York.

[Reuters, London, 30th] Reliable sources say that after the French authorities in the Saar area established a tax inspection system at the border between that area and other parts of Germany, the British government has asked the French government to inform it of the various administrative orders regarding this matter. The French representative only informed Bevin of the general situation in New York, but the details have not yet been known to the British side.

### Possible Release of Japanese War Criminals Shigemitsu, etc.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] When the Far East Military Tribunal opened today, the prosecutor continued to state the defendants' atrocities of abusing prisoners of war, but the court seemed to no longer feel interested in this. It is now eagerly awaiting the return of US Attorney General Keenan from the United States in mid-next month. Because reliable sources believe that Keenan may agree to release three or four defendants, especially former Governor-General of Korea, General Minami, former Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, and former Minister of Finance Kaya.

### Dissolution of the Western Republican Government Inaccurate

[Reuters, London, 30th] The representative delegation of the Spanish Republican Government in London has seriously denied the claim that the government may be dissolved.

Yesterday was New Year's Eve. Commander Xuan Tiewu issued a public security plan, saying that this year's plan has not yet been formulated. The work of the garrison headquarters should be determined according to the changes in the social environment. The economic recession in Shanghai is enough to affect the social order.

### Municipal Government Receives Car Embezzlement Case Indictment of Chen Wusong and Feng Peifang

### Prosecutors Continue to Survey the Site of the Plane Crash

[Our Newspaper] Three prosecutors from the District Prosecutor's Office, Cao Hong, Wu Qihua, and Ji, continued their investigation into the tragic plane crash yesterday. At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, they went to Longhua Airport to meet with Chen Wenkuan, the chief of the flight group of the China National Aviation Corporation, to inquire about the radio communication between the crashed plane and the ground. According to the response, Flight 49 maintained good communication with the ground after taking off from Nanjing at 3:23 PM, and lost contact only after receiving its last communication at 5:27 PM. The plane was said to have crashed at Zhanghuabang, Jiangwan, at 5:58 PM. It was also said that the company authorities are also investigating the issue of responsibility, but the pilot and telegraph operator of the plane have died or been injured, making the investigation quite difficult. The three prosecutors then met with Chen, the deputy director of the Flight Group of the China Aviation Corporation, and Du Weidi, the representative of the Yellow Society stationed at the airport. According to the discussion, the personnel on the two crashed planes had all received telecommunications training. As for why they could not use radar at the time, it was thought that it was due to the influence of the weather, which hindered the radio waves. The three prosecutors were then led by Chen and Du to survey the terrain at the crash site of Flight 140. They also went to the crash site of Flight 115 at Heta Temple in the fifth district of Shanghai County, where they saw that the body of the plane was not completely destroyed, but the main hall and pagoda of Heta Temple had been demolished. The prosecutors questioned nearby residents about the situation before and after the accident, and returned to Shanghai at 5:30 PM. After the three prosecutors completed the on-site survey, the second step will be to summon the company负责人, the families of the victims, and the injured passengers on the plane for questioning.

### Murder for Money on New Year's Eve A Prostitute Dies Tragically, the Patron Flees

[Our Newspaper] On New Year's Eve, a murder for money case occurred at the Zhang Apartment Brothel, No. 49 Zhucun, Liulu, Baxianqiao. The deceased was a prostitute named Wu Lingdi, 20 years old, from Suzhou. At about 7:00 PM last night, a patron, about 30 years old, wearing a blue long gown and cotton shoes, had a change of heart after the entertainment, and strangled the prostitute with her own waistband and handkerchief, robbing Lingdi of a gold ring with her name on it (weighing three maces) and a gold chain bracelet (weighing about seven maces), and moving the body under the bed before calmly escaping. At 8:00 PM, another prostitute in the brothel, Zhu Eryuan, entered the room and saw that the bedding on the bed was messy and there was a large pool of water stains in the center. She called for Lingdi but received no response, which aroused suspicion. Later, she saw the corner of a purple camel hair coat peeking out from under the bed. She lifted the edge of the bed and saw Lingdi's gruesome corpse. The prostitute witnessed the tragedy and immediately screamed for help. The madam, Jiang Jiangshi, telegraphed the Taishan Police Sub-bureau, which sent officers to investigate and took photos of the body before sending it to the morgue for examination. The person in charge of the brothel was also taken to the bureau for interrogation last night. According to Zhu Eryuan, the murderer had stayed at the brothel with the deceased the night before, paying 40,000 yuan for the night. This was his second time, so she did not suspect anything. The deceased currently lived at No. 74 Guian Lane, Xibinan Road, and is survived by an elderly mother, who is over 70 years old and has recently been bedridden.

### High Court Summons Film Industry Figures Only Mei Xi Arrives at Court Questioned for Half an Hour Released on Bail of 20 Million

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the High Prosecutor's Office summoned the fourth batch of nine film and drama figures who had collaborated with the enemy, including Zhang Shanxian, Chen Yunshang, and Mei Xi. It was not until 10:20 AM that only Mei Xi, the male lead of "Spring River Regret," arrived at court. Mei wore a brown old wool felt hat, a floral checkered scarf around his neck, a faded blue cloth robe, and a pair of black felt tongue shoes. His face was long and slightly weathered.

Before being questioned by the prosecutor, Mei Xi spoke eloquently to reporters about his opinions and feelings. He said, "The reason why I did not comply with the summons in the first three times was because I was preparing a "Yin Yuan" movie theater in Jiujiang, specializing in domestic films. It took five days to return to Shanghai from Jiujiang. This accusation is justified, and whether I am guilty or innocent should be clarified. He joined "China Film" because he was originally in "China United," and "China Film" was reorganized from "China United." The original contract was still valid, so he continued to work for "China Film." He made many films in the past, but the problematic one was "Spring River Regret." The film was directed by Yue Feng, and the script was also modified by Yue Feng. Before filming "Spring River Regret," the Japanese had offered five scripts, asking us to film them, but we refused. If we didn't film this film, "China Film" would have been completely taken over by the enemy. Zhang Shankun, in order to persuade us to film this film, said that he was willing to write a guarantee to us, guaranteeing that he would be solely responsible, but our relationship with Zhang was too deep, and we didn't want him to write a guarantee. Mei Xi also admitted that "Spring River Regret" was an anti-British and American historical drama, violating the national policy of resisting Japan, but claimed that it was forced by circumstances. According to him, Yue Feng is probably in the Northeast, and Zhang Shankun and Chen Yunshang are still living in Hong Kong. After the interrogation, he vowed not to return to Jiujiang and will wait for news from the High Prosecutor's Office in Shanghai.

He was summoned for questioning at 10:50 AM, which lasted about 30 minutes. The prosecutor ordered him to be released on bail of 20 million, available at any time. When he came out, in order to avoid being photographed, he pressed his wool felt hat down. A bailiff followed him to find bail. Looking at the back of his swaying old blue cloth robe, I felt some sorrow for this declining artist who lacked clear understanding and had an unstable will.

Social Service

### May Everyone Demonstrate a Spirit of Service

— Editor

The beginning of a new year marks a new beginning for everything. The year 35 has passed quickly, and the year 36 is coming. We are full of infinite hope at this beginning of the year, and we would like to offer a word of encouragement to our beloved readers.

"The purpose of life is service." Everyone knows this truth, and everyone can say it, so everyone takes the word "service" for granted, and as a result, they let it pass by lightly. Service, service, merely becomes a slogan, a facade with a name but no substance!

Service does not have to be ambitious or based on profound theories. It only requires facing reality, accepting it with humility, practicing it physically at any time and in any place, doing as much as one can with one's ability, not caring about rewards, not complaining about labor, not distinguishing boundaries, and not harming others for personal gain. It also requires courage and perseverance, which is the true meaning of "service."

Baden-Powell founded the Boy Scouts, and his vow included: first, to fulfill national responsibilities; second, to help others at any time and in any place; and third, to abide by Boy Scout rules. These three items seem ordinary and insignificant, but if you experience them carefully, which one does not contain the meaning of service? Therefore, if someone has received Boy Scout training and can truly abide by it for life, he is always a practitioner of "social service."

In China after the victory, political struggles have not ended, everything has not entered the right track, people's livelihoods are becoming more and more haggard, and there are many difficulties! But we must not be discouraged or passive. Everyone should have the mentality of sharing joys and sorrows and helping each other, seeking welfare for the public, and serving the people. The colleagues in this column are weak and have little ability, and are ashamed of not making contributions. They are willing to offer a single idea and do their best. We hope that everyone will supervise and teach us at any time, so that we can see the results.

### U.S. Marines in Beiping Insult Female Student: Student Protests from Various Schools in the City

Following the incident of U.S. Marines stationed in Beiping insulting a female student from Peking University, the Beiping Municipal Government immediately lodged a serious protest with the U.S. military authorities, proposing four demands: (1) The offending criminals should be swiftly and publicly tried and punished in China; (2) The U.S. authorities should apologize to and console the victim, and compensate the victim for all losses to her body, reputation, and mental well-being; (3) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future; (4) The local U.S. military authorities should seek closer cooperation with the Chinese authorities to maintain the traditional friendship between China and the United States. The U.S. military authorities indicated that they would fully accept the above points once the two detained U.S. soldiers were tried and their guilt was established, and expressed their deepest apologies. It is expected that the U.S. military authorities stationed in Beiping will be able to handle this unfortunate incident according to law and seek a reasonable solution in the shortest possible time.

Law School Held Classes as Usual Yesterday

After this incident occurred, students in Beiping were filled with righteous indignation and went on strike and demonstration to protest. Students in our city also expressed their indignation. However, apart from Jinan, Jiaotong, Fudan, Shanghai Law School, and others that responded to the strike, the rest adopted a calm and composed attitude. The majority of students believe that although this incident is a great misfortune, it stems from the illegal actions of one or two soldiers and is purely a legal matter, with no direct relationship to the issue of the stationing of U.S. troops in China, and should not be exaggerated excessively, so as not to affect the traditional friendship between China and the United States. Therefore, most school students, in addition to expressing anger or issuing declarations protesting the atrocities of the U.S. military, did not take actions such as strikes and demonstrations. The Shanghai Law School, which went on strike the day before yesterday, resumed classes yesterday. Although Jinan, Fudan, Jiaotong and other schools continued their strike yesterday, today is New Year's Day, and all schools will be closed for three days starting today. After the holiday, they will prepare for the semester exams, so schools that went on strike from the fourth will be able to resume classes as usual.

Conflict at Jinan University Over Resumption of Classes

This time, the strike action taken by some schools in the city was instigated by one or two professors who used the issue to achieve their political propaganda goals. For example, Jinan University, which was the first to implement the strike, had already decided to resume classes yesterday and held classes as usual at 8 a.m. However, during the class, a small number of students made a commotion and continued the strike, resulting in several conflicts. Three students who opposed the strike, Tan Liyan, Pan Rong, and Dan Jiarui, were assaulted and injured one after another. Tan and others have decided to file a lawsuit according to the law. Pan Xingzhao, an employee of the school's counselling office, and some other students were also押至 the auditorium for a "public trial." The director of student affairs, Wang Yingsan, was also severely humiliated for protecting the assaulted students, and the detained students were not released until around 3 p.m., when order gradually returned.

Schools Support Student Union Declaration

The Student Union of this city issued a letter to all students the night before last to protest the atrocities of the U.S. military, and continued to request the government to lodge a solemn protest with the U.S. military, while opposing strikes and逃行. This attitude has been widely supported by the student community in this city. It is learned that the student unions of Datong, the College of Political Science and Law, Tongde Medical College and other schools have risen to express their support for the Student Union's declaration.

In order to protest the atrocities of the U.S. military in Beiping, students of Datong University convened a meeting of the Standing Committee of the school's student union and decided on two basic attitudes: 1. Launch a joint protest by all students; 2. Decide not to take strike action. After the meeting, Standing Committee members Lin Jiping, Ni Wenjiong, and Chen Guangde jointly posted a notice explaining the reasons for adopting the above attitude and put forward specific demands and protests to the government: 2. Punish the U.S. military who caused the trouble; 3. Ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. All students in the school unanimously supported the resolution of the student union.

The student union of Shanghai College of Political Science and Law sent a letter to the Student Union yesterday, expressing their support for the union's declaration.

The class union of Zhoude Medical College held an emergency meeting yesterday and unanimously passed the following points: (1) Regarding the atrocities of the U.S. soldiers, please the government lodge a serious protest; (2) Sympathize with the victimized students and send a telegram of condolences; (3) Demand an apology and compensation from the U.S. side, and guarantee that the same incident will not happen again in the future; (4) Support the Student Union's declaration on the incident; (5) Strictly prevent conspirators from taking advantage of the situation and expanding the situation; (6) Resolutely oppose strikes and demonstrations that affect students' studies. All students in the school supported the resolution.

Shanghai Business College held a general student assembly at 3 p.m. yesterday, with more than 300 people attending. It was resolved that "on the principle of not going on strike, we will take concerted action with students from various schools."

### Goods with Consular Visas Do Not Guarantee Importation. Importers Responsible for Damages if Goods are Shipped Without Permits.

[Our Newspaper News] The Executive Committee of the Temporary Administration Committee for Imports and Exports, because of the public's lack of clarity regarding the import of goods, issued a statement yesterday stating that, regarding the import of goods, at the beginning of December of this year, the Committee had sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to re-advise Chinese consulates abroad to continue issuing consular visas according to past practice. However, the issuance of a consular visa does not guarantee that the goods in question will receive a permit at customs. According to reports from various parties, there have been several instances where overseas consulates have failed to comply with the telegram order. The Committee has already sent another letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urging them to pay attention.

In addition, the Committee issued a notice to importers on the same day, stating that, according to Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for Amending Import and Export Trade, all imported goods, except those prohibited from import and those stipulated in Article 14, must apply for an import permit. If an importer ships goods before obtaining the import permit and damage occurs as a result, he shall be responsible.

Furthermore, Chen Changtong, the Chief Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Committee, has recently hired Yu Yingjie, an auditor from the Bank of China stationed abroad, to assist with affairs due to his busy schedule. Mr. Yu has returned to Shanghai from the United States and will now be stationed in the office on a permanent basis.

An Official from the Import Management Committee Told Reporters: The Committee has begun the process of reviewing applications from various importers this week, starting with the limited allocation of important imported oils and rubber, and then proceeding in an orderly manner. However, this review process is based on the number of imported goods from each importer according to the letter of credit from the 29 designated banks at the time. Currently, banks are in the midst of year-end settlements, so the number of letters of credit and importer data submitted to the Committee is quite small. Therefore, the review work cannot be actively promoted. It is hoped that the designated banks and relevant agencies will provide full cooperation, so that this review work can proceed smoothly in the short term.

### Importers Reduce Orders

[Our Newspaper News] Sources familiar with the matter report that, due to the implementation of the import permit system, most of the orders placed in the United States by Chinese importers recently have been for small amounts of less than US$2,000, and large orders are rare. People in the import and export industry say that, based on the current situation, the goods coming from the United States this year will mainly be essential industrial raw materials, and the proportion of finished products will decrease. Regarding the issue of Japanese goods entering China, people in the industry believe that all Japanese industries have resumed production this year, and production has surged. Inexpensive daily necessities are bound to be imported into the markets of Southeast Asia and China in large quantities. Especially since there is a shortage of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in our country, prices are high, and it is difficult to request aid from the United States, it may be difficult to prevent the import of Japanese goods in the future. As for goods from the United Kingdom, the quantity is currently small, mainly due to the lack of materials in the United Kingdom. However, its large-scale export plan will also have an impact on our country in the future. It is also learned that ships coming to China after the U.S. seamen's strike is resolved will be arriving in an endless stream.

According to 据, the缠之不缠 after the war has made the operation of exported goods difficult, and it is not only our country that has been affected in this way among the countries of the world, there are many others. However, most of these countries have implemented a government-subsidized policy. A few months ago, the U.S. side needed a large number of maltose and ordered it from the Czech Republic. However, Czech businessmen calculated that the price on the domestic market would result in a loss of two-tenths per unit, so it could not be exported. Subsequently, the U.S. side inquired about purchasing from South America. The Czech government did not want to sit idly by and watch巨颇 foreign exchange will 数业, so it商 with businessmen. The government subsidized one and a half, the factory subsidized three-tenths, and the broker subsidized two-tenths to make up for the loss and complete the transaction. For example, the current request of Chinese tea exporters for the government to purchase is nothing more than a desire for government subsidies. In addition, the current sausage casing industry is also eagerly awaiting government subsidies to restore pre-war production levels, because the industry is affected by low international market prices. In order to reduce production costs, the purchase price of fresh pig intestines is suppressed and cannot be increased, resulting in a decrease in goods.

If the price of fresh meat rises again, the intestines will inevitably be sold to food households and no longer to intestine factories. At that time, the factory will completely stagnate. Therefore, people in the industry believe that government subsidies are a remedy policy for foreign exchange.

### Excavation Record of Ancient Han and Jin Tombs on Niutoushan Mountain in Qingjiang

— Lujiang, 24th of the month. Yimin

The appearance of the ancient tomb, in the Hongyang era, was regarded by the local villagers as an ancient kiln, and it became a safe haven for refuge. Only after a certain Huiyuan, an expert, conducted research, did it attract the attention of many archaeologists!

Cui Silang

A rubbing of an ancient tombstone (sent by Yimin)

After the news of the discovery of the Han and Jin ancient tombs spread [Central News Agency, Nanchang, Shen Bao, December 9, first edition news], many scholars who were concerned about antiquities and those with archaeological quirks were attracted to pay attention. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the reporter specially visited the discoverer Rao Huiyuan—Yizhen—Mr. In a carefully arranged room, he娓娓 (wěiwěi: patiently and thoroughly) told the story of the discovery of the ancient tomb. Mr. Rao is an artist who has taught at the Provincial Zhangshu Middle School for ten years. He graduated from Xinhua Art College in Shanghai in his early years. In addition to his superb accomplishments in Western art, he also has a strong interest in epigraphy and archaeology in his spare time. This discovery of the Han and Jin ancient tombs is indeed a valuable and worthy of reporting.

### Jin Bricks are Antiquities from the Ningkang Era

He first talked about the detailed circumstances of the discovery of Jin bricks:

"The Jin bricks were discovered on Niutoushan Mountain. This place is 20 li away from Zhangshu and belongs to Qinhu Township in the county. The local villagers said that during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi years of the Qing Dynasty, due to mountain floods and rainwater erosion, the tomb chambers gradually collapsed and were exposed. When the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army passed through, the villagers, both old and young, regarded it as an ancient kiln and used it as a safe haven to avoid the war. In July of this year, Mr. Xu Yuanyu and I from the same county made a special trip to visit there. This is a location in a desolate wild mountain. Although the tomb chamber was exposed, it was overgrown with thorns and weeds blocked the path. The entrance of the cave was dark and gloomy, making people feel scared. We felt that since we had made a special trip to visit, we would inevitably be disappointed if we gained nothing. So, we summoned up our courage, pushed aside the weeds, crawled into the tomb chamber, and sure enough, we saw a tomb chamber shaped like a well, made of tomb bricks. The tomb was built with three layers of stone bricks, which were very solid. Due to the accumulation of mud, the height could not be seen clearly. The area of the tomb surface was probably about five or six feet. It was impossible to go any further. We groped and scrutinized the entrance of the tomb for a long time before crawling out!"

Mr. Rao spoke quickly and excitedly. Then, he took out a white cloth bag from a dark lacquer camphor wood cabinet. He took out two large celadon-glazed bricks, still covered with yellow earth. He explained with a smile:

"These are the two tomb bricks we picked up when we came back. The bricks are 36.3 cm long, 3.43 cm thick, 18.5 cm wide, and weigh 7.5 kg. The part without patterns is 6 cm thick. On the surface of the brick, there are eleven characters: 'Gui's tomb, Ningkang Second Year, Ninth Month, Fifth Day'. At the other end of the brick, there are also three characters: 'Gui's', and a cloud-shaped pattern."

Then, he expressed his opinions on his research: "Ningkang was the reign title of Emperor Xiaowu of the Jin Dynasty, about 1,500 years ago, so I determined that it was undoubtedly a Jin tomb. However, who exactly was Gui? I checked the county annals, but there was no record. However, judging from the grandeur (more than two zhang long) and solidity of this structure, it can be determined that it was not an ordinary tomb. The simple and vigorous handwriting on the brick is also similar to Jin inscriptions. Moreover, judging from the completeness of many tomb enclosures that have been exposed on the surface nearby, its cloud-shaped and cloth-patterned patterns are not products of modern times. In addition, I also discovered several ancient bricks with the characters 'Chuping'. According to my research, they will be Han tombs from the Three Kingdoms period. However, due to various environmental constraints, if excavation is possible, there may be newer and more valuable discoveries."

His words seemed filled with regret. After I finished smoking a cigarette, I asked him about his discovery of Han tombs on Dagu Mountain. He said even more excitedly:

Patterns Very Similar to Han Basins: Brick Flowers of the Han Tomb

"In the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931), because enemy planes bombed the city indiscriminately, the Provincial Zhangzhong moved to Xiangxi. This is a large market town 15 li away from Zhangshu. It is a very famous place for Qingtang -. During my spare time after class, I would walk around the nearby wilderness and collect many patterned tomb bricks, quite similar to Jin bricks, but I didn't pay much attention to them at the time. This November, I returned to my hometown for business -Mr. —Mr. Yuan's hometown - and specially invited Mr. Chen Runyu and Mr. Yang Qiqin from the Cultural Middle School to Dagushan Mountain near the country. This place is twelve li away from Zhangshu, and there are many desolate tombs. We collected many tomb bricks, and their patterns are equally exquisite and vigorous, with double coins, cloud shapes, squares, diagonal lines, , fish shapes ... more than a dozen kinds. I researched epigraphy and fish-shaped patterns, and the Han wash on the surface of him is very similar. There are two types of this, one is rectangular and the other is conical. The length, width and thickness are slightly smaller than Jin bricks, but the brick quality is more delicate than Jin bricks. The collapsed soil surface of the tomb is the same as that of Niutoushan Mountain, and the bricks are scattered around. According to my speculation, the time of its unearthed also has one or two years of years.'

As he said this, he also took out a few bricks from another cloth bag, some with money patterns and some with fish patterns, but all were incomplete. Another more complete piece shows:

'Tomb of Cui Silang's wife, Nie Siniang'

The script is simple and ancient, and the characters "Cui" and "Si" are easily mistaken for the character "Jiu". He said: "Although these bricks do not have a reign title, judging from their script and patterns, it can be determined that they are from the same era as the Jin bricks discovered in Niutoushan Mountain. The script on the Cui's wife tomb brick has more Han and Jin calligraphy meaning, and the fish-shaped pattern is even more valuable. In the old days, the title of Lang was called Lang. I checked the Examination of Han and Wei People's Names -compiled by Zhang Zeji, Professor of the Department of Chinese Language and History of National Chung Cheng University- and it was most common in the Later Han Dynasty. From this, it can also be inferred that this tomb was around the Three Kingdoms period. When the nearby villagers pulled soil to bury tombs, they often pulled out many tomb bricks and pottery in the caves. Many shepherds also sometimes picked up ancient funerary objects in the mountains, and there is a myth circulating.

Two Golden Chickens on the Mountain, Legends Are Widely Circulated

The myth says: "There used to be two golden chickens on the mountain, which often came out to look for food. The villagers chased and captured them, but they were suddenly injured and disappeared." These are of course unreliable, but there are many ancient tombs hidden in the soil in Dagushan Mountain that have not been discovered, which is a true fact!"

Finally, he added:

"Qingjiang is an ancient name, a land of barbarians. It was not until the Southern Tang Dynasty that a county was established. Zhangshu borders the east bank of the Gan River and is the hometown of Tao Kan's mother in the Jin Dynasty—Zhangshu has the Huasuo Pavilion of Tao's mother—originally Xin'gan County, later renamed Qingjiang Town. Niutou and Dagu mountains happened to form a horn shape with Zhangshu Town. Before the county was established, it was a high mountain near the outskirts. Climbing high and looking far, you can see the plains and fertile fields, dense smoke, and a beautiful scenery and majestic atmosphere, so the brick patterns and words discovered twice are beautiful and simple. Here, we can also see the general examination and appreciation of patterns and art in the Middle Ages, and the meanings of the Ningkang brick and the Cui wife brick are similar and discovered together, so it can be determined that it is Han-Jin ancient objects are beyond doubt. If someone can excavate and sort them out as historical materials for future research, this is what I expect."

When I left the room, Mr. politely sent me a few rubbings of the ancient bricks, and said eagerly:

'If you are interested, I can guide you to during the winter vacation. 'Such a spirit and enthusiasm for research are moving. When the setting sun was approaching the distance, and the shadows of people were scattered, I easily concluded my archaeological and interesting visit.

### Museum of Inventions - Science and Education Exhibition - Random Notes on Visits

— Paris, 18th Air Mail Dispatch - Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Paris, Wang Yizhi

Since Paris is the center of [whitespace] today, [whitespace] the science of cultural and educational [whitespace], the West [whitespace] Branch Station is in Paris. [whitespace] Paris will surely become the world's scientific center. [whitespace] Champs-Blyse [whitespace] demonstrates the science of an era [whitespace], including everything. [whitespace] Visitors stepped into it [whitespace]. It is like opening a history book of twenty-four dynasties, suddenly not knowing where to start. Now, let's try to focus on the main theme of science and culture. [whitespace] It also includes the projectors used for documents, books, and newspapers, as well as various [whitespace] instruments. [whitespace] This is indeed the latest tool of modern civilization. Checking the [whitespace] of the film, [whitespace] this country, by installing double lenses, can easily take two copies of the moving picture with Mr. White's rapid reduction machine Appareil Dehrie, which projects two electric lights Projecteurs with strong light, using the method of projecting moving pictures, placing two [whitespace] rolls of film, which are only three centimeters and a half, side by side, from left to right, [whitespace] quickly rolling, directly facing the documents or newspapers [whitespace] below, [whitespace] completed. At the beginning of each film, it should be like the subtitles of a moving picture. First, use a Pypewriter to mark the "title" on a [whitespace] surface of 12 cm long and 7 cm wide. [whitespace] The title attached below [whitespace] for the Ti [whitespace], separately [whitespace] aligned in a square box and facing the light of the "surface", [whitespace] an additional small [whitespace], taking advantage of a short moment in the middle, [whitespace] the film, this reduction machine's lens, projects directly downwards onto the document on the [whitespace] surface, and the distance depends on the size of the original. If the [whitespace] surface's [whitespace] is small, [whitespace] occupying a surface of 28 cm long, 8 cm [whitespace], 19 cm [whitespace], [whitespace] turn the machine button to make the aerial projection box extend downwards, then the lens will gradually move downwards and get closer, only 40 cm. The resulting reduced projection [whitespace] film, 36 cm long and 24 mm wide, is reduced by eight [whitespace] compared to the original. If the [whitespace] eastern surface is [whitespace] large, even as large as a surface 90 cm long and 60 cm wide, then [whitespace] turn the machine button to tighten the lens box upwards. At this time, the [whitespace] eastern surface of the lens can be as far as two meters. The resulting film, 36 cm long and 24 mm wide, is reduced by 25 times compared to the original. The picture shows Mr. White's projector produced by An re Dehrie Film Materials Store at 111 St. Maur Road, 10th arrondissement, Paris, [whitespace] a title plate and two [whitespace] projection lights' [whitespace] projection box. The straight ruler at the back marks six ratios of reduction: 8 times, 10 times, 12.5 times, 15 times, 20 times, and 25 times, which are clear at a glance. The entire machine weighs 90 kilograms, and the price of each unit is reportedly 330,000 French francs, equivalent to about one trillion Chinese currency. The special advantages of reduced projection films are: firstly, the objects are small [whitespace], making it extremely convenient for airmail to travel far [whitespace]; secondly, famous people's manuscripts or rare illustrated magazines, reduced to small rolls, do not need to take up much space, [whitespace] placed in a safe, can be preserved for thousands of years; thirdly, reprinting old books avoids [whitespace] errors and the burden of personnel. This method does not require proofreading, saves manpower, and allows people all over the world to easily browse rare and unique books. The facilities for viewing these films, as seen in France, are the "Shadow Character" reader Lecteur produced by Comaptoir o'Optique Industrielle, a lens industry merchant at 54 Rue Taithout, 9th arrondissement, Paris (" [whitespace] ", which is the abbreviation of the French [whitespace]). When [whitespace] a film is [whitespace] inserted into this device, [whitespace] the text is illuminated with electric light, passing through a [whitespace] square [whitespace] surface of 17.5 cm square, projecting onto a [whitespace] square mirror of 15 cm long and 20 cm wide, and reflecting the light onto the [whitespace] below, forming a light screen of 21 cm wide and 30 cm long (approximately one-eighth of the entire [Shen Bao] newspaper page). If the light is reflected onto the [whitespace] surface, there can be a light screen 60 cm wide and 90 cm long for clear viewing. At the same time, there are four types of readers for [whitespace] projecting text, seen [whitespace] in the country: first, transparent light Opti-bloc; second, video projector Visio-phot; third, video Vi il- oc; fourth, diaphragm Dlah [whitespace] (note: this word is an abbreviation of the French Dianhragme "diaphragm" and Document "document" combined). These are all unprecedented, and [whitespace] I will introduce them to the readers in the future. Although the Chinese section of the Science and Education Exhibition is not [whitespace], it [whitespace] attracts a lot of attention. Entering the [whitespace], [whitespace] it is dazzling, with red and green decorations, adding to the style of a Chinese palace. [whitespace] Displayed are enlarged covers of various Chinese magazines, and the Chinese science illustrated magazines displayed in the glass [whitespace] are recorded below as I saw them. (1) "Neptune" magazine, No. 23, Year 17. (2) Shaowu Entomological Society Weekly. (3) Journal of the Chinese Chemical Society. (4) Journal of the Chinese [whitespace] Society. (5) Science Times. (6) Democracy and Science. (7) [whitespace] Digest. (8) English Journal of the China [whitespace] Society. (9) Research Report of the Central Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (10) Construction Research. (11) Weather. (12) [whitespace] Enterprise. In addition, there are books such as Standard Manufacturing Methods, which are not [whitespace] listed. Among the Chinese science films shown at the exhibition, only "Solar Eclipse" produced by the College of Science of Jinling University was shown. Quality is valued over quantity. I recently learned from Dr. Zhao Yuanren, the chief representative of China attending the Science and Education Conference, that people from various countries had a particularly good impression of the Chinese film. In addition, there are excellent films from the United States and the United Kingdom, showing the ingenuity of famous mountains and rivers, promoting commerce and benefiting agriculture, and the operation of machines and power generation, which are difficult to describe in detail, with endless beauty.

### Higher Education in the Northeast

— Shenyang, 25th Air Mail Dispatch - Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao

It has been more than a year since the liberation of the Northeast, and the process of taking over education has been underway for eight months. Since there are problems with primary school teachers and funding, secondary education needs active reform, and higher education has aroused dissatisfaction among many people. In addition to the frequent difficulties faced by the provincial and municipal education authorities, Mr. [whitespace] Fang, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Education, is also greatly blamed.

Youths Love the Country

Primary and secondary education is managed by the provincial and municipal education departments, while higher education and several specialized schools are the responsibility of the Northeast Region Education Rehabilitation and Counseling Committee of the Ministry of Education. The committee started working in April, taking over various colleges and universities, and accommodating and settling unemployed youths.

"The youths in the Northeast love the country. This is the first impression after coming outside the pass." "I have contacted many students and teachers under the age of twenty, and they all feel the same way. This shows the failure of the enemy and puppet education, and the success of our past education," Mr. Cheng Qibao of the education inspection team told reporters. Liang Huasheng, chairman of Jilin Province, also solemnly told reporters: "The youths in the Northeast are the most lovable and promising. Although they have received eight years of enslavement education from the enemy and puppets, they have not been enslaved at all!" How should we cherish this precious achievement and how should we carry it forward?

However, in the past six months, the youths in the Northeast have been restless in their studies. Although there are many political factors involved, the counseling agencies should bear a lot of responsibility. In the future, they should put more effort into educational facilities and leadership. They should not use means, but be sincere, honest, and impartial. Of course, the country's poverty is also the reason why many aspects cannot be satisfactory.

Now, let me introduce some of the situations of the counseling and rehabilitation of specialized schools and above in the Northeast, as published by the Northeast Region Education Rehabilitation and Counseling Committee of the Ministry of Education at the press conference, to help everyone understand the current situation of higher education in the Northeast.

Rehabilitation Preparation Work

There are many graduates from the former Manchukuo specialized schools and above in the Northeast region. Before the Soviet troops withdrew, students from Changchun, Shenyang, and other places rushed to enter the pass on their own. From February 26, 1946, to March 12, a total of 520 students arrived in Pingjin. The committee established the "Temporary Training Center for Northeast Youth Students" in Pingjin to manage and train them, and presented it to the Ministry of Education to establish the "Northeast Temporary University Refresher Class" to accommodate them. Chen Keshou was appointed as the director. At the end of April 1946, the Soviet troops in Shenyang withdrew, and the students who were going to Pingjin were moved back to Shenyang. The "Temporary University Refresher Class" was temporarily opened at this time, and students were gradually admitted in accordance with the examination and admission methods for graduates of former Manchukuo specialized schools and above. The total number of students in the school reached more than 3,000. After several months of refresher courses, the refresher results were considered good, and the school was closed at the end of September 1946. The students were assigned to various corresponding colleges and universities.

In April 1946, a large number of graduates from the former Manchukuo "National High Schools" (the abbreviated term for National Higher Schools, equivalent to the second grade of junior high school) were unable to pursue further studies. The committee established the National Northeast University Preparatory Class, appointing Fang Yong [whitespace] as the director, who was later replaced by Qu Shi [whitespace]. From June 1 to June 10, a total of more than 3,000 students entered the school. Since other former puppet [whitespace] National High School graduates successively [whitespace] arrived in various cities, intending to enroll immediately, the Northeast University Preparatory Class, limited by manpower and resources, could not accommodate more students. With the approval of the Ministry of Education, preparatory classes were established in Jinzhou and Yongji, so that the graduates of the Northeast National High Schools could all have a place to settle down and study. [whitespace] Shen Ming [whitespace] and [whitespace] Jingfang served as directors. The Jinzhou Preparatory Class officially opened on October 22, and the Yongji Preparatory Class officially opened on November 11.

The National Northeast University campus was taken over by Northeast University in April this year. Since the damage in various places was very serious, efforts were made to repair it. Over the past six months, most of the project has been completed. The faculty and students of the school, originally located in Santai, Sichuan, have now all arrived in Shenyang and have been settled. In addition to the original three colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, Law, and Commerce, the two colleges of Engineering and Agriculture have been restored, with a total of 22 departments and one specialized course. The school officially opened on December 25. However, due to the severe damage, all equipment needs to be added. Rehabilitation is almost equivalent to reconstruction. The Ministry of Education has been requested to restore the old appearance, so that it can become a strong highest institution of learning in the Northeast.

In order to improve the quality of teachers in the Northeast, the Ministry of Education specially established a teacher training institute in Shenyang, appointing Zhou Muwen as the director. It is specially designed to accommodate those who are currently or wish to serve as primary school teachers. Each term lasts for three months or six months. Since the beginning of May, the first class of students has graduated and has been assigned to various schools to serve. The second class of students has now entered the institute for classes and is expected to graduate at the beginning of 1947. The institute has added a sports and children's training class in the second term and has invited experts to teach.

Commentary on Current Affairs

### Severity of the Situation in Vietnam - Asia Still Unable to Achieve Peace

— Chu Yukun

This week is the last week of 1946. There is peace and tranquility in the international arena, but in one corner of Asia, chaos persists. The situation in Vietnam is becoming more serious day by day, and the scope of the French-Vietnamese conflict is expanding day by day. It is no longer comparable to ordinary events, thus attracting close attention from countries around the world. Therefore, during this week, the world's attention is focused on Vietnam.

Close Attention from China, Britain, and the United States

The increasingly serious situation in Vietnam will not only endanger peace in one corner of the Far East but will also be sufficient to affect the development of the entire world situation. The three countries of China, Britain, and the United States have deep relationships. British Foreign Secretary Bevin is deeply concerned that the situation in Vietnam will affect Britain's interests in Southeast Asia and has invited British officials to a meeting to discuss the current situation in Vietnam. U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson also made a statement to the press, expressing the United States' concern about the Vietnam issue. As for China, because there are 435,800 overseas Chinese in Vietnam, any conflict between France and Vietnam will be sufficient to damage the lives and property of the overseas Chinese, so the Chinese government has to worry about these many overseas Chinese and take specific and effective policies to protect them.

Both France and Vietnam are Moving Towards Extremes

France's policy towards Vietnam has not changed its past practices. Although the Blum Cabinet is a progressive Socialist Cabinet, the measures taken this week are still a policy of suppression. (1) French military authorities, under the orders of the government, urgently transferred troops to Vietnam to reinforce their forces; (2) French aircraft participated in the war, bombing Viet Cong concentration points in the skies over Vietnam; (3) French Colonial Minister Moutet gave a speech in Saigon, firmly rejecting the Vietnamese people's demands for independence; (4) The French government blamed the conflict on the Vietnamese side.

As for Vietnam, because the people of the whole country have been stirred up by nationalism, they cannot abandon the national liberation movement halfway and will not stop until they have won independence. President Ho Chi Minh has demanded that French troops withdraw from all of Vietnam, and Kuomintang leader Nguyen Cong Toan has also advocated the organization of a "National Front Government" to deal with France to the end, and appealed to the United States and China to mediate, so the Vietnam issue will not be easily resolved for a while.

Blum Attempts Peace

If the worrying situation in Vietnam is allowed to develop naturally, it will cause very serious consequences. France's insistence on maintaining its prestige in Vietnam will also make it lose more than it gains, and may even cause political unrest at home, so Premier Blum had to send a telegram to President Ho Chi Minh, explaining that Colonial Minister Moutet's mission was to restore the situation in Vietnam based on the French-Vietnamese agreement. This is a peaceful attempt. It is heard that Ho Chi Minh will send a telegram expressing his agreement and asking the French military authorities to issue a ceasefire order.

As long as France can realize that the era of imperialism is over and no longer treats Vietnam as a colony, the peaceful resolution of the Vietnam issue is not impossible.

### The Mystery of the Engagement of the British Princess and the Greek Prince

The British heiress to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, is not engaged for one reason only, and that is that her father is concerned about the happiness of his beloved daughter.

Talks over tea after lunch at Buckingham Palace unanimously admit that Princess Elizabeth is deeply in love with Prince Philip of Greece. Well-informed people believe that if it were not for the opposition of King George VI, the engagement would have been announced long ago.

But people in London who can get accurate information insist that the King has never opposed his daughter's marriage for political reasons. According to people close to Buckingham Palace, Princess Elizabeth told her father about her love for the Greek prince, and the King, like any father in the world, advised his daughter not to get engaged immediately, saying, "Wait six months and then decide, and make sure of your heart."

According to people with reliable information, the King believes that although the Princess of Wales, Elizabeth, has the right to enjoy legitimate love like ordinary people, she does not have the freedom to change her mind at will like ordinary women.

### Random Records from the White House - Security is Not Very Tight - Many Steal Souvenirs

Is it comfortable to sleep in a bed in the White House? Do guests steal things as souvenirs? And who is the most difficult guest to serve among all the guests to date? After Mrs. Nesbitt, who served as the chief housekeeper of the White House for a total of 13 years, wrote an article this year describing the U.S. President's residence, readers sent letters one after another, asking for answers to questions such as the above. The editors compiled all the questions and answers and selected the ones that received the most inquiries and published them in this month's magazine. Just like listening to many lectures where questions are allowed, the translator believes that the questions are more concise and detailed in nature than the descriptions and have a special flavor. I will select and translate several sections of the article as follows:

How Tight is Security at the White House?

Security there is certainly tighter than at your home or mine. For example, guests who come to play poker with the President, chat with Mrs. Truman, or woo Miss Margaret do not walk through the hallway and ring the doorbell on the front door. They have to stop at the White House gate and be questioned by the secret police before they can step into the corridor and be received by a very orderly attendant who guides them upstairs. However, once you walk through the first and second floors, which serve as offices and reception rooms for state guests, the atmosphere is typical of an American home and not strict at all.

Are the Beds in the White House Comfortable?

When I first tried to sleep in them, I thought they were very good, but the Roosevelt children, after a long period of research, said they were not good—the springs were too stiff and the mattresses were too hard. So I rearranged the mattresses. Since then, I have never heard anyone from the Roosevelt or Truman families, Democrats or Republicans, emperors or generals complain.

Do the White House Guests Love to Steal Things as Souvenirs?

I would say they certainly love to steal. The number of towels that went missing in the thirteen years I lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is simply impossible to estimate. Many cotton towels missing from the bathroom had to be replenished by me. In doing so, I deliberately omitted the abbreviated mark of the President's residence, so this part of the souvenir hunting was eventually prevented. But on one holiday when the White House was open to the public, we were shocked to learn that the large musk flower curtains in the "East Room" had been cut into small pieces by tourists. This is indeed a problem that has always made us uneasy.

Who is the Most Difficult Guest to Serve at the White House?

The person is Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The difficulty lies in the busy work of security. For example, when he is in the room, all servants are not allowed to stay on the same floor. Only after he goes downstairs are the servants allowed to return to their original work. Therefore, Molotov naturally made our work very difficult. However, in my humble opinion, these troubles are all unnecessary. Because in 1942, under the strict vigilance of the wartime protection personnel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, even a mouse could not run into the White House to threaten his safety.

How Much Do the White House Maids, Servants, Ushers, etc., Get Paid?

The number of salaries is quite staggering, ranging from $1,100 per year for maids to $1,600 per year for ushers. Personnel changes among them are very frequent because after working in the White House for two years, they can be transferred to the government to take on more leisurely work and receive higher salaries.

Who Started the Example of Employing All Black Staff?

Mrs. Roosevelt. She felt that they worked very well and wanted them by her side. Mrs. Hoover used a mix of black and white staff. Mrs. Truman retained all of Mrs. Roosevelt's old staff and only added a Missouri cook. (Translated from the New York Times)

### To Avoid a Third World War - Women Who Nurture Men Must Participate in All Important International Justice

Can the United Nations Organization bring lasting peace to mankind? Recently, a friend asked me this most serious question in the world, but I cannot give him an optimistic answer.

Everyone with a slightly clear mind will have the same idea. I fully agree with the goals of the United Nations Organization, but I am afraid that in its current organization method, will the chances of success be greater than those of the many peace organizations that preceded it? The crux does not lie in any errors in the concepts or goals, but rather that it has extremely serious weaknesses at its foundation.

In its current state, the United Nations Organization is an organization held by men and belonging entirely to men. After so much bloodstained history, now once again, politicians and power-worshiping politicians are trying to build a new world order without the help of women. This policy is truly pathetically unwise and shortsighted.

If the United Nations wants to move towards the road to success (and it must move towards the road to success), and if we want to avoid a third world war, we must let women who nurture men participate in all meetings.

### The United Nations is Like a Family - Needing Mutual Assistance Between Both Sexes

Everyone knows that without the mutual cooperation between both sexes, the smallest unit of our society, the family, cannot be happy. I believe that the same is true. Except for an international organization that reflects the thoughts, feelings, and spiritual aspirations of women as much as men, what else can we expect from a family composed of nations to succeed.

All historical facts with definite evidence are sufficient to prove that my opinion is correct. Women are inherently different from men. Men live in the real world, so the most important goal is often the direct effect of their work. Women, however, have a powerful instinct that extends to the future. Because the life of the race continues from generation to generation through the physiological functions of women, they often yearn not only for their own children but also for the children's children to have a safe and beautiful living environment. Spiritually, men have never been able to think as far into the future as women. And only by considering the future can the United Nations sustain human civilization.

If women are allowed to participate, the instinctive sympathy is only one of their many extremely valuable contributions. Although two bloody and depressing wars have occurred in this generation, many men still seem to be nostalgic for war. This is a legacy they have inherited from countless generations of warrior ancestors. Women do not have this foolish feeling. What they have inherited from their ancestors is to heal wounds rather than create them. If there is a need for healing work in world affairs, then the degree of need is truly greater than ever today.

Most importantly, only women can make the people's belief in the United Nations as strong as their belief in religion. Men rely solely on reason and reasoning to survive; women live on their emotions. People of all nations must have a strong emotional confidence in their hearts, so that these many nations can intertwine into one family. To succeed, the United Nations Organization must become as sacred to us as churches, hometowns, and flags. Only women have the power to make it so sacred. (Translated from the New York Times)

### The White Man Has Lost His Superior Position in the Far East: Conclusions of a New York Times Reporter After Inspection

— Translated by Lu Cheng from an article by New York Times reporter Lun Bu'er

The Rise of Nationalism in Asian Countries: White People Returning to Colonies Immediately Encounter Extremely Serious Difficulties

The Golden Age Has Become a Passing Cloud

The white man has lost "face" in the Far East. This is the conclusion the author has had to draw after traveling in China, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, and speaking with white residents in other Asian countries. Various isolated incidents and the new attitudes visible everywhere undeniably demonstrate that the power and prestige of the white man have greatly diminished.

This transformation can be seen in many ways. The arrogance of Chinese police and low-level officials is most obvious. It seems that the Chinese are retaliating for the grievances they suffered before the abolition of extraterritoriality. Almost every day, one or two arrogant incidents make the white man in Shanghai feel that he is now an inferior expatriate under Chinese sovereignty.

In the Philippine Islands, although there was a "honeymoon" period when the Japanese were first driven back, there is now a strong anti-American sentiment, openly expressed in Manila newspapers. Pedestrians in the Philippine streets display a self-importance never seen before. Is this a permanent transformation? Or is it just a reaction to certain military occupation policies or the misconduct of American soldiers? Perhaps no one can answer this question. However, the blows they inflict on Americans are indeed on the rise.

Everywhere in the Far East, the superior position that the white man once enjoyed as a representative of national power has now been lost, and perhaps forever.

In addition to the aforementioned development of ethnic separation, there is also a political transformation, a resistance to Western rule. As a manifestation of this resistance, there are rebellions in some places. In the period after the Japanese surrender and before the Allied occupation, various nationalist parties in Asia rose together. The political consciousness among these people has advanced by a century in just a few years due to the good opportunities for national solidarity gained during and after the war. White people returning to colonies immediately find themselves encountering serious difficulties. The ideals they themselves have expressed, like the truly noble sentiments of the Atlantic Charter, are rebounding in their own faces. Colonial policies in any part of the world are now being tested.

But the dual transformation of the white man losing face and the resurgence of nationalism is even more pronounced in the Dutch East Indies than anywhere else in the world.

Masters Become Partners

The Indonesians still call white people "Tuan"—master—, but now this "Tuan" is just a title. The golden age of the "Tuan" in the Dutch East Indies is over. What lies ahead is the "Bung" period. "Bung" means partner, a mutual term of address among Indonesians.

In the short time of the war, a vast sense of self and national identity has risen in the hearts of Indonesian youth. For the first time, they feel that they are also people. After centuries as colonial subjects, they are now citizens of their own country. Only the white people, who have always been masters, are now forced to take a lower position.

The Dutch say that this situation, which began with the war and the Japanese's lightning victory on these islands, was inevitable. The public degradation and insult of white people by their Eastern conquerors would leave an indelible impression on the hearts of the Indonesian people. Many Dutch people believe that the Allies' return with unparalleled power, sweeping away the brutal conquerors, as they did in the Philippines and elsewhere, did indeed restore a lot of hope for the white man. After the plan to reoccupy Java was shortened by the Japanese surrender, the Dutch felt that the recovery of these islands lacked many essential highlights. In fact, the recovery of these islands was indeed mishandled. The Japanese were left on the islands to rule for two months after the war ended. It was during this period that the Republic of Indonesia rose, and the rule of the "Tuan" became a thing of the past.

The Dutch can still comfort themselves by saying that the East Indies are still part of the Netherlands in any case. Because the Dutch royal family still sits atop the Dutch-Indonesian Union, which was established in the past two years. However, according to the agreement drafted here (Batavia), Indonesians will have the right to manage their own internal affairs. The Dutch now know that they no longer occupy this country, but are immigrants on the streets of their own construction. Although they can still retain private property, they must pay taxes to the Republic of Indonesia. They have been abruptly reduced from landlords to tenants.

### New Year's New Hopes

(In order of receipt)

My personal New Year's new hope for the year 36 is that the New Year after the year 37 will always be happier than the years before the year 37.

Two

My hope for the country is the realization of lasting peace. My hope for myself is that my life can be more disciplined, and that I can make the best use of my time. Sometimes I want to see the movies "A Song to Remember" and "Henry V", but I always miss the opportunity. There are also many art exhibitions and music performances, and I often don't have time to attend every one, which I deeply regret.

Three

My hope is that from this year on, everyone can live a good life in a peaceful and happy environment.

Four

I have no new hopes. For ten years, every year-end, I have had the same hopes for life, for the world, and for society. So I can only say that I have old hopes, not "new hopes".

I hope life is like a vibrant rose; the world a peaceful garden; society like a bright sun!

I hope the sun eliminates the pests and bacteria in the garden, and I hope the roses are always lush and always beautiful.

Five

Qingge says I am "mentally unhealthy", which is true. So I have no hopes, only dreams.

For thirty or forty years, I have dreamed of feudal remnants devouring people, of fascist demons setting the world on fire, of corrupt officials drinking their cocktails, of gold bars, young ladies, and Mr. Fapi (Legal Tender) racing, of puppet show experts staging their masterpieces in Chinese theaters, of wailing everywhere with no one caring, of high-ranking officials and politicians issuing empty checks, and of the true gods, the goddesses of beauty, and the goddesses of peace weeping... Because I dream too much, it's too scary! It keeps me from falling asleep for a long time, and I wait for dawn with my eyes open!

Dawn has come! The painted scene is no different from the dream scene! I am tired of waiting and need to find a clean place to sleep forever, and I don't want to do anything.

If I must write a little hope, then I only have——

I hope that humans and the earth will become transparent crystals, so that I can take a closer look; or invent a pair of X-ray glasses, so that I can wear them and see what is hidden deeper than atoms in the earth, and the mysterious hearts of people!

Six

Positive new hopes existed last New Year; today, I dare not think like that. This year's hopes are only passively new:

That mediation will produce miracles, that the Communists and Nationalists will actually have peace, that the civil war will surely end, and that gunfire will be swept away.

That many treacherous officials will leave their posts, corruption will weaken its power, politicians will change their style, and that they will run around and shout, clenching their fists and rubbing their palms, all for "the people's democracy."

That factories will stop closing, businesses will avoid disaster, prices will not rise, and life will be more stable;

Then, there is hope for national recovery, and the people's strength will gradually rise!

Seven

It seems that the new hopes of the New Year are evidenced by a poem:

It's hard every year, but every year passes,

Every year is saddened by spring, but every year there is spring,

If you compare the New Year to everything,

You're always working hard to patch things up here and there.

I want to ride the wind and fly away,

But fame and fortune are tied to me!

How easy is it to get rid of them temporarily?

I can only accept my fate in this life.

"The old must go before the new can be hoped for,"

We must clearly understand our responsibilities,

Cut down and eliminate old ideas,

And usher in a new spring with all our efforts.

Eight

I hope that one day, people will live the same simple lives as we do, or that we can live the same comfortable lives as they do.

Nine

History will not and should not repeat itself. Let all the ugly and evil things in society become relics of history! I hope that from now on, everyone in the world can live a human life—at the very least, be able to eat their fill and keep warm; that everyone can have the opportunity and environment to develop their talents, and be able to speak freely and write freely; that the law can become the only fair measure of society, delivering justice to everyone's door; and I also hope that from now on, beautiful women will not have short lives, and Dong Shi will find a good husband; and I hope that heaven is on earth, and earth is also heaven!

Ten

I hope 1947 will be the most fulfilling year. First, I hope that the people of all countries will have happy days (materially and spiritually). I hope everyone smiles; I hope the sun shines in our hearts as it shines in the universe. I hope to continue to study China, understand China better, and love China more. I hope to respect "wisdom". May friends who love "truth" and "beauty" work together to worship and sing about humanity's progress towards "ideals." I also hope that the children of China and the children of France will work closely together to jointly determine the only goal: to promote human culture and enhance human dignity. (Narrated by Fa. Kuluote. Lu Xu; Translated by Xu Zhongnian)

Eleven

When I hear the word "hope," I can only force a bitter smile! The common people are not without hope, but until now, all hopes have been bubbles, so why mention them? If I must say a few good words on this first day of the New Year to bring good luck, then I might as well follow the custom and continue to indulge in wishful thinking.

Our country is called "The Republic of China." Whether in power or in opposition, all political parties, as well as social elites, are calling for "democracy," and under "democracy," they have added the words: "Only this one family, and no separate branches," much like "Lu Gao Lu, the originator of cooked meat cuisine," oh, how grand! Now, is it because the people are regarded as pigs, and so we would cook them? Not so! It is to give food to the people. Therefore, the first hope of the New Year: I hope the people have peaceful meals to eat and peaceful days to live.

For five thousand years, spanning hundreds of thousands of houses: Chinese culture is indeed the eldest brother among the cultures of the world. In the clan, the eldest brother is the head of the family: he has responsibilities, and also enjoys benefits. However, going one step further, our current culture has become a "culture of enjoyment," a culture that enjoys the cultures of others. How is this evident? Others invent this and that, and ship it to China for sale; we accept it wholesale and enjoy the benefits, so why bother racking our brains to research? People who talk about scholarship and research are the number one fools! Getting close to these people is harmful, and staying away from them will bring resentment; give them food, and they will argue seven hundred and twenty times, a thousand times! Therefore, the second hope of the New Year: I hope that intellectuals will all become "patriotic" merchants and sell more foreign goods.

As for myself, I never have great hopes. If I could "casually" become a mute, a deaf-mute, or have a heart of stone, then congratulations!

Humans live in hope; even in despair, there is hope. The new hopes of the New Year are not new to the author; as early as thirty years ago, every New Year, there was always an article of the New Year's first writing, to embellish the new scenery of the New Year. The memories of these thirty years are painful; however, we still cannot help but have hope. It is hope that enables humanity to continue its life.

The new hopes of the New Year, what are my hopes again? If I say I have no hope, there is hope after all. But after middle age, hope should not become a vain hope. My hope is very simple, it is to have peace. During the War of Resistance, no matter how adverse the circumstances, I fortunately enjoyed peace; because I had peace, I had no worries, so there was the so-called "broad heart and fat body." We should not underestimate ourselves, but we should not overvalue ourselves. Those engaged in cultural work have a magic weapon that is well known. "Avoid trouble and fear hearing of literary inquisitions, and write books to make a living." If there are new hopes for the New Year, mine are these: I hope that from now on, those engaged in cultural work can all have self-awareness, and that everyone can have peace.

### The Era of Sending a Boat

— Wu Jingheng

"Sending a boat" was the name my maternal grandmother gave me when I was born in my mother's womb eighty-two years ago. The original text at the time was "Ji Zhou". Because I sought the hidden meaning from a Guan Yin oracle, it was "Guo Ju Burying His Son Heaven Bestowing Silver." My maternal grandmother thought that I was the reincarnation of the son who had not been buried, hoping that I would have a career, so she called me "Ji Zhou". Now, I have forgotten them, but the third floor of the Xie Cang Ming Ben Lou is just right. On April 25th, after leaving Chonglu for nine years, I flew back. On May 3rd, I went to Nanjing again to participate in the ceremony of returning the capital on the 5th, as Dong people called avoiding the war of resistance; on the 17th, I returned from Nanjing again. Lying in bed early, I felt that everything was not in order, how beautiful my things were! But once I stretch my legs and leave, I don't know how the objects will be scattered, and I laugh. Life is like sending a boat! Temporarily staying in this third floor, floating in the high sky, without a ship of Wu, the boat has eight rooms, where one can read, write, eat, drink, excrete, sit alone, or lie down in a daze when tired; old and tired, Yang is withered, and although there are beauties, I cannot build a bridge; lacking this point to compare with Qin Shihuang's Afang Palace, it is naturally inferior, but the boat can be controlled, and the palace is not what I want. I am sending this boat here, and I am sending myself to the boat. I wonder how long this will last? Asking this is either foolish or stupid. One day at a time, counting one day at a time is fine. Written on May 17th, the 35th year of the Republic of China, written on the wall of the Yuzhai on June 4th. (Published on New Year's Day of the following year)

### An Ideal Experiment

— Zang Kejia

The Memory of Editing a Quarterly

I often think that if I have the opportunity to edit a publication myself, I must strictly adhere to the following rules:

First of all, break down sectarian prejudices. Prejudice is a narrow door, often keeping good things out. As long as it is created with an "artistic conscience," has real value, has historical significance, and has a sense of justice and a spirit of struggle, it is all welcome.

Secondly, don't ask if it is famous or unknown, just ask if the work is good. Works by famous writers can also be rough, and works by unknown writers can also be outstanding. However, one cannot lower standards and seek out works by unknown writers, just as one cannot let go and abuse the manuscripts of famous writers.

Publish less of your own things in your own publication and open up the space to others. Even if you publish your own articles, you must put them at the back to show some humility. Moreover, you don't necessarily have to print the editor's name in large letters! Of course, in certain necessary circumstances when you have to show your name, that is another matter.

Spend time reading manuscripts because the contributors have spent a lot of effort writing them, and they send them out with a "for sale" mentality, like sending out a hope. If the editor lets them accumulate without even looking at them, that's too unfair to the people and to yourself. New writers are all selected. When you discover something good, you will be so excited that you will jump up, as if heart and heart have connected, it is so happy. Even if the manuscript is not suitable, you should write your own opinions on it to convince the author, and not discourage them.

The style should be simple and generous, the proofreading should be serious, and every punctuation mark should be arranged in the most beautiful place. Pay manuscript fees on time and publish on schedule. …

This is my ideal, and I expressed it in a short essay entitled: "Introducing a Poetry Journal." Not long after the article was published, someone sent in a manuscript, thinking that I was really running such a publication. In fact, it was: "The land of ideals, there is no such garden, just imagining it to be so."

Last year (today, it can be said to be last year) in August, I edited the "Star River" and "Learning Poetry" weeklies for the "Overseas Chinese Daily". The former was a full edit, and the latter was an eighth. This gave me the opportunity to experiment with that ideal I had had for a long time. Although it was an unknown small newspaper, I did my best to edit it, and I asked friends from all sides to help write articles. There were always several submissions that came from the postman every day. Many seniors and friends from Chengdu, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Beiping, Tianjin, Guilin, Taiwan... have been constantly writing articles, and they are still piled up in my drawer without a chance to be published.

But the distance between ideal and reality is always so vast!

First, there are sometimes so many typos that it is impossible to see the sentences clearly, and even a "straw hat" is added to Mr. Cheng Shewo's head; manuscript fees, the first month was good, but after that, the time was dragged longer and longer. The list of manuscript fees for October has not yet been cashed. For me, this is a very heavy spiritual burden!

Because these supplements failed to make money for the newspaper, I received three "Orders" within five days: the first was to reduce the size and change them all to six columns; the second was: manuscript fees were reduced to three thousand to five thousand; the third was to cancel all supplements.

Looking back on these four and a half months of "experimentation", there was joy, there was guilt, and even more was indignation.

[K[>P>Ode to Garbage
— Wang Shanshan

Garbage, the cityscape of a big city, a symbol of the human world.

These piles, some are from the countryside, the roots of cabbages, the pods of green beans; some are from the ocean, the whiskers of lobsters, the scales of fresh fish; some are the dregs of delicacies from mountain villages, and some are the leftovers of food from watery countries. There are peels and pits of fruits from hot lands, perhaps once grasped by fair hands, and sucked by delicate mouths. There are also the corpses of ancient treasures, perhaps once appreciated by literati and elegant scholars; now they are only discarded on the roadside, left to be trampled on by pedestrians.

Here are torn silk stockings, and also the packaging of cosmetics; here are scarlet love letters, and also soiled account books; here are broken copper and scrap iron, and also fragmented manuscripts; there are various wine bottles, and also various medicine jars; there are baby's diapers, and also a girl's menstrual belt; there is the sputum of old people, and also the vomit of patients; there is the white hair of old women, and also the tears of sad people. There are fallen leaves, there are withered flowers, there is feces, and also English poetry, there is a lost diamond ring of a noble woman, and also the hidden weapons of a sharpshooter. …

Rainy days increase its moisture, and when it clears up, it spreads a strong fragrance.

The red is a patch of peach blossoms, the yellow is dazzling like gold, the green is like jade, and the bright is like crystal. During the day, pedestrians walk over it, and vehicles roll over it, but it does not hinder its brilliance and glory. At night, under the moonlight, a piece of fermented green sprouts light, like sparkling stars in the sky; also like looking down from high above on this sleepless city. Greedy mice come out to celebrate the newly discovered treasure, burrowing in and out, dancing and singing.

Flies are discussing with ants about organizing a joint-stock company; parasites are also planning to go it alone; although typhoid and cholera bacteria have received official appointment letters, they are still expressing humility in talks with journalists. Everything is stirring secretly, preparing for a big meeting to show off their skills.

Don't look at it as just a pile of dirt, it contains infinite beauty and mystery.

Caterpillars all turn into butterflies from here, toads eat swan meat from here, and even timid puppies can dare to take a risk here, hoping to get what they want.

Cats and dogs may occasionally have unfortunate conflicts with mice, even if it is a struggle, it is just like a human tragedy or comedy, what does it matter?——Dawn, everything returns to calm; quietly waiting to receive new stacking courses.

Remember, citizens of big cities, remember, you produce one and two-tenths of a pound every day you live here. Two thousand four hundred tons is the daily production of four million citizens. Every one of us citizens is an obligatory laborer for producing garbage, working for free to produce garbage.

In this day and age, everyone believes, "Economy first, work second," so in order to implement the principle of thrift, I would like to advocate preserving this urban cityscape. It saves money and trouble, it saves labor, and it saves brooms.

Pile it up, pile it up, pile it up as high as skyscrapers, pile it up as big as ancient pyramids, pile it up into mountains, pile it up into hills, pile it up into the cultural fortress of a metropolis.

However, the meddlesome cleaner finally shovels it, sweeps it, but what is shoveled away in a day is piled up again in a day; what is swept away in a year is another year; the garbage on the roadside has never been cleaned up! Just like the dregs of society, floating and sinking with the evolution of human history.

Pile it up, garbage! Pile it up, dregs! The cityscape of a big city, a symbol of the human world.

Postscript

Ten years since leaving Shanghai, I returned east in the early summer of last year. Looking around the streets, the accumulated dirt had not been removed, a rather strange sight, so I created this article. Later, after several migrations, it was placed at the bottom of a box. In the blink of an eye, the New Year's holiday has arrived, and my writing is slow and dull, and I cannot write a timely article, so I have slightly altered this article and attached it to the filler, as a substitute for the New Year's gift of a returning guest, which I believe will not be without the meaning of getting rid of the old, and the reader will not think it is an insult.

### Founding of the Republic and Presidential Inauguration

— Lu Danlin

The first day of the first year of the Republic of China marked a new era in the thousands-year history of group and political system reform in China. It was also a turning point in the evolution of our national system. At the same time, a quarter of the world's population transitioned from the autocratic, oppressive politics of a monarchy to a democratic republic. The significance is extremely profound. That day was the day the Founding Father took office as the first popularly elected President of China. Counting back, it has been thirty-six years.

This major turning point in Chinese history was certainly the result of eighteen years of organization and continuous action by the revolutionaries. As circumstances matured, more than ten provinces successively revolted within a little over a month after the Wuchang Uprising. A central government was organized to comprehensively manage the unified administrative structure, which was of utmost importance both domestically and internationally.

Initially, Cheng Dequan, the governor of Jiangsu, and Tang Shouqian, the governor of Zhejiang, jointly telegraphed Chen Qimei, the governor of the Shanghai army, proposing that representatives from each province be publicly elected to convene in Shanghai. This was to emulate the system of the thirteen-state conference in the United States, to ensure consistent action across the twenty-two provinces of the country. After two or three meetings, the representatives elected Huang Xing as Grand Marshal and Li Yuanhong as Deputy Grand Marshal, drafting the powers of the Grand Marshal to preside over the Provisional Government of the Republic of China. However, the representatives of the provinces in Wuchang expressed their disagreement, and Huang resigned as a result. The provincial representatives re-elected Li Yuanhong as Grand Marshal and Huang Xing as Deputy. However, Li could not go to Nanjing, and Huang also strongly declined, stating that he would wait for the Founding Father to return to the country. As a result, neither Huang nor Li took office.

After completing his diplomatic activities in various European countries, the Founding Father safely arrived in Shanghai on November 6th. The revolutionary atmosphere and the nation's focus, and the selection of a leader, entered a new stage.

The day after the Founding Father arrived in Shanghai, many of the League's leading members held a public banquet in Aili Garden and discussed the formation of a government. Huang Xing, Chen Qimei, and Song Jiaoren secretly discussed recommending the Founding Father as President. They then signaled this to the representatives of the provinces, based on the fact that the Founding Father had led the revolution for eighteen years (since the founding of the Revive China Society), and his hard work and great achievements made him the most suitable candidate. Ma Junwu also published an essay in the Minli Bao, calling the attention of people inside and outside the party. In the evening, at the Founding Father's residence, they discussed the government organization plan. Song Jiaoren emphasized a cabinet system. Based on the facts at the time, the Founding Father strongly opposed this. Huang Xing persuaded Song to withdraw his proposal, but Song was unwilling. The next day, Huang went to the Nanjing Representative Assembly and proposed three motions: first, to adopt the Gregorian calendar; second, to use the Yellow Emperor's reign as the epoch for the uprising, which should now be changed to the Republic of China epoch; and third, the government organization should adopt a presidential system. The results were completely approved.

On the tenth day of November, the provincial representatives held a provisional presidential election assembly in Nanjing. Representatives from Hebei, Fengtian, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Qin, Jiangxi, Anhui, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, totaling forty-five people, attended. It was stipulated that each province would cast one anonymous ballot. Zhejiang representative Tang Erhe chaired the meeting. The results of the vote count were: Sun Wen received sixteen votes, Huang Xing received one vote, totaling seventeen votes. When the voting was about to take place, Hunan representative Tan Renfeng secretly said to Ju Zheng: "You are a representative of Hubei, you should elect Li Yuanhong as President!" However, Li did not receive a single vote, which shows the psychology of the representatives at the time.

After the Founding Father was elected, the representative assembly specially dispatched Wang Chonghui, Chen Tao Yi, and others to bring the certificate to Shanghai to welcome the President to enter Nanjing to take office. The Founding Father instructed Chen Qimei: "We revolutionaries should eliminate all bad habits and not adopt any rituals. Just prepare one passenger car, that will be enough." Chen followed the order and notified the railway bureau to handle it. On the third day of November, at eight o'clock in the morning, the car departed from the Shanghai North Station. At five o'clock in the afternoon, the car arrived at Xiaguan, and a ceremonial salute was fired, accompanied by military music. On that day, the Shanghai-Ningbo and Nanjing-Shanghai railways were connected, and he continued to take the train into the city. Although the wind was biting, the enthusiasm of all sectors to welcome the President did not diminish in the slightest.

When the Founding Father arrived at the station in the car, soldiers guarded all around, and idlers were not allowed to board. Shortly after, the Founding Father got off the train, holding an ordinary military cap in his hand, and wearing a khaki-colored military uniform, without wearing epaulets or gold belts. After leaving the station, he rode in a blue silk-decorated carriage, with military music and cavalry leading the way, followed by guards, directly to the Presidential Palace (the former Liangjiang Governor-General's Office).

After resting briefly, the provincial representatives gathered and reported the election process, requesting him to take office immediately. At ten o'clock that night, the Founding Father performed the inauguration ceremony.

It was announced that this day would be January 1st of the first year of the Republic of China. The next day, the representative assembly resolved to add the election of a Vice President, and Li Yuanhong was elected for the time being. Following this, the cabinet was organized and submitted to the representative assembly for approval. Following the American system, there was no Premier. From then on, the newly established central government comprehensively managed everything both domestically and internationally.

Looking back on the past, of course, there are unlimited feelings. However, over the past thirty years, there have been many changes in the country and its people. The responsibility for future revitalization and nation-building lies with the heroes of the country. They must eliminate private opinions, work together, and build a Three Principles of the People country, so as not to fail the lofty and ambitious goals of the pioneers who created the Republic of China.

### Ode to New Year's Day

The rising national flag brings the new year—the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China.

Today is the first day of the thirty-sixth year, New Year's Day. The so-called "Yuan" refers to the beginning of the year, the beginning of the day, the beginning of the hour. The revelation of "Yuan" is a new expression, so New Year's Day is worthy of praise. However, in the past, people used the monarch to represent the country. On this day, "the officials offer congratulations of ten thousand autumns and long life," and the edict states "the joy of starting anew." Inferiors only know to congratulate themselves on their wealth and status. After all, there are few people who, like Yuan Weizhi, utter the ironic words "What is achieved by wishing for wealth and status? Intelligence is used to make things more difficult." People today certainly take the country as a prerequisite, but under the sound of "Long live the Republic of China," everyone exchanges the phrase "Congratulations" when they meet, focusing on their own concepts. Yuan Weizhi is a sinner!

The calendar on the desk has been changed thirty-six times. Although it is not as long as the Gregorian calendar, which is one thousand nine hundred and forty-seven years old, our national calendar has reached this number, which is quite remarkable. In the past, the fate of the "calendar" shifted with the feudal circle. Before Emperor Wu of Han, even New Year's Day was not fixed. According to the transmitted calendar calculations, the Yellow Emperor and the Yin and Zhou dynasties established Zi as the correct month, taking the eleventh month as the first month. The Qin dynasty established Hai as the correct month, taking the twelfth month as the first month. It was not until the seventh year of Emperor Wu's Yuanding reign that it was corrected, and this calendar was used for thousands of years, called the "ancient calendar," which was the Taichu calendar from an even earlier period than the Yellow Emperor, establishing Yin as the correct month. Gu Qiong and Xia Yu also did the same, so it is also called the "Xia calendar." Of course, it has become a past term in the present era. However, some people call the Xia calendar the "agricultural calendar," which is very appropriate. It specifies when "Grain Rain" is, when "Grain in Ear" is, and from the Beginning of Spring to the Beginning of Winter. Doesn't the current national calendar also use these seasonal markers on the side? Kicking out from the feudal circle, preserving the good and discarding the dross, thus laying the foundation for the long-term fate of the national calendar. On this day, we offer ten thousand autumns and long life, praising the continuation of the Republic of China, especially the second New Year's Day of the revival. We should accept this "joy of starting anew"!

However, a year has passed since the victory. Only by being able to "think about the past" can we talk about "looking to the future." Let us review the past year. How were we on this day last year? We had just recovered the heavenly voice and majesty of the great Han from the external disaster of "Huaxia." There was a chorus of voices calling for rehabilitation and restoration. However, the phenomenon of rehabilitation was unbearable to witness, and restoration naturally could not catch up to the original state. The most painful thing was that the lives of ordinary people were still suffocated in the struggle under high pressure, and the flames of domestic war had once again spread across every inch of land stained with blood and stench. A year has passed in a hurry. But we will not be pessimistic, because we have fully experienced the lessons of extreme hardship and striving for light in the past eight years. In the past year, in the "reversal after extreme stripping," we will bear the remaining pain ourselves, and the constitution was completed this year and promulgated today. By the end of the year, the constitution will be implemented. We must look at the year ahead. This year is no ordinary year.

The thirty-sixth year is no ordinary year. Yes, the number "thirty-six" tells us that it is a good symbol. From the perspective of "six," it is the Yin number in the Book of Changes, and six sixes make Kun. The image of Kun is the earth, and the commentary says, "To carry out the Kun Yuan, all things are born." It can be said that six is as vast and thick as the earth, so there are six relatives in human relations, six emotions in character, and six virtues in education. And six sixes are thirty-six, which is reminiscent of Qin Shi Huang's division of the world into thirty-six commanderies, and the Han dynasty's subjugation of the thirty-six kingdoms in the Western Regions, which is a phenomenon of far-reaching power. We hope that from the court to the countryside, we must firmly grasp this extraordinary year, and how to "be honest and establish integrity." On this New Year's Day, we cannot be sinners like Yuan Weizhi, and we must jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of nation-building. Then, when the government is returned to the people, the people can recover from the high pressure of life and return to the spring terrace of peace and happiness, and my Ode to New Year's Day will not become a "hopeful saying at the Pillar."

### Two Steps Backward and Three Steps Forward for Spoken Drama

— Hong Shen

Over the past year, the crisis in spoken drama has been growing, and the situation is indeed very serious. The main manifestations are the scarcity of playwriting and the difficulties encountered in professional performance.

The eight years of the War of Resistance were the golden age of spoken drama. From major cities to remote rural areas, the footprints of spoken drama troupes could be found everywhere. There is no doubt that spoken drama played a great role in publicizing the War of Resistance and promoting popular morale. The prevalence of military drama reflects how spoken drama served the War of Resistance and existed as an important tool for political education. According to preliminary statistics from the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, there were no fewer than 50,000 professional spoken drama practitioners nationwide, and the number of amateur practitioners was often several times that number, which shows the vigorous scene of the spoken drama movement at that time.

In Shanghai during the "Isolated Island" period, it is said that there were more than a dozen spoken drama theaters, and nine out of ten shows were full, which could rival the interior. Combining the playwriting in the interior and the occupied areas during this period, whether in quantity or quality, it was a rare harvest since the New Culture Movement in China.

Over the past year, it can be said that there have been very few playwriting. As far as what has already been staged is concerned, it seems that there is only "The Ghost Catcher." However, a year ago in Chongqing, I already heard the author Wu Zuguang talk about the concept of this play, but it was only recently completed. There are also two new works: "Grievances of Mountains and Rivers" (published in installments in "Literary Renaissance") and "Ode to Peace" (published daily in Wenhui Bao), both recent works by Li Jianwu, but the full picture has not yet been seen. In terms of quantity, it is really scarce enough.

Why is it so difficult to produce plays? The first is the instability of life. Today, cultural workers are really in a situation of "not even having time to save themselves." "Writing books for the sake of rice and millet" can be considered a peaceful and prosperous event. At present, even this point is close to fantasy for literary writers. Writing plays is subject to various technical limitations, which takes more effort than other creations. Who is willing to give up the easy for the difficult, to win an unreliable need for a few liters of rice? Moreover, even if you write it, unless you are a well-known writer, otherwise the bookstore is unwilling to print your things. Because物价涨了，成本高昂, 普通人没有钱买书来看，有钱的人又不大看书. Even if it is printed, the opportunity to stage it is also slim. Secondly, in order to be busy arranging for basic needs, or trapped in the chores of sweeping and cooking, writers have no way and no mood to write. If they reluctantly write, the environment prevents them from speaking freely. These things directly and indirectly wear down the playwright's will to create, forming the phenomenon of playwriting stagnation.

The number of spoken drama theaters in Shanghai has suddenly decreased from more than a dozen during the War of Resistance to five at the beginning of this year, and to only two at present, and the business is not very good, struggling hard.

The most serious problem in professional spoken drama performance is the decrease in basic audiences. Of course, part of the reason is due to the dumping of Hollywood films; however, the bigger reason is probably that the burden of ticket prices, including taxes, is too heavy. The basic audiences for spoken drama are civil servants, students, and young professionals, and these people are all victims of currency inflation. Although they love spoken drama very much, they cannot afford it. Just look at the box office situation when the Shanghai Theater staged "Heroes of the Grassland." Selling at full price, the business was extremely miserable. Selling at half price, it was full—as a result, selling at half price, the theater's income actually increased a lot. Why can't the ticket price be reduced to suit the spending power of the audience that supports spoken drama?

The soaring cost of performance is also a big problem. At present, no professional spoken drama troupe has its own theater and has to pay extremely high rent. Some are "profit sharing" and some are "bottom guarantee." For example, the "Shanghai Drama and Art Society" is "bottom guarantee." If business is bad today, they have to pay out of their own pockets to make up for the front desk. At the same time, due to the increase in performance costs, they have to resort to usury, which is a quagmire that can put any business in a desperate situation, unable to extricate itself.

Due to the above difficulties, the theater authorities have to try their best to save on performance costs. As a result of the savings, the installations are often simple and crude, and they are not willing to purchase more props and costumes, and the rehearsal is also careless. As a result, the standard of spoken drama performance has declined. Due to the decline in the standard of performance, the few remaining audiences gradually become more disappointed, and the business is even worse. Therefore, the theater authorities again focus on reducing performance costs, and the business is even worse. The two factors interact with each other, pushing the spoken drama business downhill.

This is the case in Shanghai, and it is said to be the same in other cities.

The audience wants to reflect reality, but spoken drama cannot meet their requirements. Why? In some areas, the multiple inspection system of play script censorship and performance censorship still exists; therefore, a play with practical significance, after several "revisions," has its realistic components reduced, and cannot meet audience requirements, thus affecting attendance.

Finally, undeniably, today's spoken drama performance has departed from the excellent traditions of the past. It is true that from amateur to professional, the regularization and careerization of drama work is not a bad thing in itself. However, the mentality of market merchants has infiltrated the spoken drama world. The spirit of open administration and open economy in the past has been lost. Those who are responsible for administration and economy are often separated from the actors and other workers, and the latter become a simple employee. To some extent, everyone no longer pursues the common artistic goals or engages in an ideal reality. We know that no matter what group, if the measures of economy, administration, and personnel cannot be reasonable, it will inevitably affect the development and existence of the business.

The past year can be said to be a year of two steps backward for spoken drama. Spoken drama may encounter greater difficulties, and our staunch warriors of the spoken drama movement should strive to overcome these difficulties and weaknesses and take three steps forward in 1947. ——35, 12, 24——

Appendix: Letter from the author of this article

Mr. Jin:

Thank you for your letter asking me to write a "Spring and Autumn" special feature for New Year's Day, and stipulating the topic as "Spoken Drama in the Past Year." I have made an effort to write a short article. Because I have recently developed a stomach illness, it was recorded by the secretary. I am sending it to you for your review and to determine whether it can be used. I am afraid that the original title is used by many people, so changing the topic may be more novel, please also consider. I wish you peace.

Sincerely, Hong Shen Qi 35, December 25th.

Free Talk Congratulations on the New Year

### The Beginning of the Year

— Shao Fu

The beginning of a new year, everything is renewed. Looking forward to the future, everyone has their own hopes and brightness, and recalling the past, one cannot help but be filled with mixed feelings.

Although the past year was the first year of victory after the War of Resistance, whether from the perspective of the country or the individual, it was a continuation of suffering, which was very different from the post-victory scene we had imagined during the War of Resistance. In fact, this is not surprising. We were originally a weak and poor country, and once we suffered this mutual comfort, and continued to fight hard for eight years, all the new wounds can be said to be deeply and painfully mutual. How can we fully restore the old appearance and move forward in a short time? It is inevitable that we are not satisfied, but each of us has a responsibility. This responsibility is that we have not worked hard enough, or even have not worked hard at all, and even hinder the efforts of others!

However, in this year of continued suffering, we convened the National Assembly and completed a fundamental law of the country. This achievement is brilliant, and perhaps only this achievement can be used to account for the expenses of the past year.

How about this year? Hope is indispensable, but it does not have to be too extravagant. In all aspects, there will certainly be progress; but each of us must appeal to our own conscience. Does my work, my career, my life behavior, in addition to benefiting myself, benefit others? Does it cause harm to others?

At the beginning of the new year, I would like to share this with you!

Fable

### The Changing of the Guard—Rooster, Dog, Pig

— Sui

On the eve of the thirty-fifth year, amidst the sound of gongs and drums and firecrackers, the Dog Star wore a tattered "Bingxu" style coat, with a dejected spirit, and its tail clamped tightly in its buttocks.

It was about to go to the Pig Star to complete the handover formalities. As soon as it left the gate, there was a chorus of "Boo" sounds around it. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that they were some employees who had just closed shop from the store or factory: "Another noisy year-end bonus issue!" The Dog Star was filled with resentment. Thinking that it was about to be handed over, why bother to suffer for others? It shrank its head into the collar of its coat, took three steps in two steps, and hurried away from the door, thinking as it walked, when the Rooster Star and itself completed the handover at this time last year, it had said: "It may not be perfect, but I seek to be clear of my conscience." Although this year people have given more criticism than praise, I have done my best, running around, and I have no guilt when I search my heart. Since I have no guilt, then "let them boo, I have been a good official!"

The Dog Star was happy, and its tail straightened up. At this moment, a group of sneaky guys came to greet them. They bowed and smiled, standing respectfully on the roadside. The Dog Star recognized that they were some traitors who had been hiding for nearly a year. Now that the reporting deadline was over, they were going to swagger out to profit and show off again. It could not help but snort: "It's cheap for you bunch of thieves!"

The Dog Star has the habit of arrogant officials, and it cannot stand people's flattery. Its arrogance arises spontaneously, so it again raises its head and strides forward, the resentment of some mockery it just received is forgotten cleanly.

Crossing two streets, many store doors are pasted with notices of "Declaration of Liquidation." The Dog Star felt two chills in its heart; walking past the distribution center, on the side of the road that was crowded like a long dragon during the day, several beggars were huddled up, desolate and bleak. The Dog Star shook its head and sighed.

Arriving at the Pig Star's house, the old Pig was swallowing clouds and puffing out smoke on the bed. The Dog Star was shocked, took out two handover registers from its side, and pointed solemnly and rigorously at a line of work outlines of "××× will be executed from New Year's Day," saying:

"People say you are confused and angry, why don't you take care of yourself?"

"What?" the Pig Star said lazily.

"×× is the first major event after you took office? You are personally demonstrating and breaking the law!"

"You are making a mountain out of a molehill! I am precisely because I am going to lead everyone to ×× from next year, so I take advantage of the last day of this year to ×× happily. You see me as confused, from tomorrow I will also vigorously change my ways and start anew!"

"New person..." The Dog Star raised its tail. Facing the energetic old Pig, it handed over several thick registers.

Although the room was smoky, seeing the new "Dinghai" style robe on the old Pig, it was radiant and dazzling, as if there was unlimited new weather. The Dog Star smiled happily and easily.

Morning Tea

### Congratulations on Getting Rich

— Hong Guo

In previous years, everyone said "Congratulations but not getting rich." This year, we cannot but hope to get rich! Because everyone has been poor enough in the past year, "big and small, faces without color!"

At the beginning of the new year, everything is starting anew. We, as ordinary people, force a smile and struggle through the new year, only hoping that weapons of war will be transformed into money, and guns and ammunition will be transformed into production machines. Transportation should be restored as soon as possible, and factories should resume work as soon as possible. In a thousand words and ten thousand sentences, the root is one sentence: "Harmony brings wealth!"

New Year's Day is the beginning of writing, everything is auspicious, congratulations on peace, congratulations on getting rich!

### New Year's Customs Are Strange and Bizarre

— Zheng Fan

The Doukhobor folk dance of Canada

Every New Year's Day, they must put an empty chair in the house, treating it as if a distinguished guest is sitting on it, serving it diligently, and even serving it dishes.

The Doukhobor people firmly believe that unexpected guests are from heaven. If a strange guest comes uninvited on New Year's Day, they consider it an unparalleled honor, and that guest will bring a year of happiness. Even if no strange guest comes, they still have to "act as if there is something" to see the guest off, but the door cannot be opened, lest "the God of Fortune slips away quietly!"

On festivals, the people of Tibet, as usual, greatly invite their guests, and have performances of "Ten Thousand Dances," "Flying Gods," and other unique Tibetan skills. People from all over come from thousands of miles away to see the Living Buddha, holding gold and jewels on their heads and kneeling to offer them. If the Living Buddha accepts, he will use a whisk to brush their heads, and this believer will be overjoyed. All women must smear red sugar on their faces when they see the Living Buddha, otherwise it is considered "presenting beauty to confuse and disgust people," a great and unpardonable sin.

The Muslim New Year is the most boring. Originally, from the morning of every New Year's Eve, all men and women over the age of ten were "hungry," not allowed to eat or drink, not even allowed to swallow saliva. This is how he was hungry for a year - until the New Year's Day of the following year.

The "Yuchi" Indians in the United States are particularly comical. Every New Year's Day, they have to drink the bitter juice made from the roots of the ball snake flower grass. Drinking that bitter juice will definitely make people sick, but they have to drink it. Drinking it makes them sick, and after they get better, they drink it again, and drinking it makes them sick again... They drink it seven times in a row, and get sick seven times, before it is considered "meritorious and complete."

On New Year's Day, in the village squares of the "Yuchi" Indians, the natives line up in long rows, waiting to drink the bitter juice. If they get sick, they go to the side of the pit, and there is also a long row lying on the side of the pit.

It is said that they believe that drinking the bitter juice and getting sick will cleanse the body, then "the Sun" will like them, and the crops will certainly be abundant in the year.

### From the Plane Crash in the Fog: Talking About Kongming's Arrow Borrowing in Heavy Fog

— Kang Shi

The heavens have unpredictable winds and clouds, leading to three aircraft accidents. The saying that "man can definitely conquer nature" cannot be fully believed today!

Speaking of this "unpredictability," it's the "dense fog filling the sky"!

Speaking of "fog," we are reminded of Zhuge Kongming of the Three Kingdoms period, who borrowed 100,000 arrows from Cao Cao in one night of heavy fog.

Zhuge Kongming's arrow borrowing was also due to his familiarity with "astronomy." In Zhou Yu's camp, he knew that there would definitely be "heavy fog" three days later, so he boldly wrote a "military pledge." Zhuge Kongming's "familiarity with astronomy" allowed him to carry out this "farce" with his life. He was indeed "in charge of timing"! Research shows that the time of the arrow borrowing was just a few days after the winter solstice.

Now, the plane crash occurred three days after the winter solstice. The winter solstice is the birth of yang, and there must be "heavy fog" in the weather transition. Kongming borrowing arrows is one example, and Kongming "borrowing the east wind" to burn the Red Cliffs is precisely a natural change in the weather. The ancients had already understood these "mysteries," but today, when science is said to be advancing day by day, we are falling short in this regard, not paying attention to "the birth of yang at the winter solstice" and the changes in the timing of the heavens. It's somewhat felt that "modern people are not as good as the ancients"!

From this, it can be known that ancient China may not have lacked astronomy science academies, but everyone regarded them as "secret manuals," unwilling to pass them on to later generations, being selfish and unwilling to conduct public research, which led to good theories and no successors, which is indeed a regrettable thing!

Intelligence Test

### Why Suspected?

— Ge Chunliang

Professor Howard Dunne said: "Gollay was an obstinate and taciturn old man, but I liked him very much. After he was murdered last December, I decided to investigate the case. Browning, the last guest to visit him in his life, should of course offer some explanation for this visit."

"Browning said: 'I told the people at the hotel I trusted where I was going (in case something happened, the address and phone number where I could be found), and around five o'clock I arrived at Gollay's suburban residence. I saw him sitting at a long table in the study in the dim twilight. He waved for me to sit in a separate chair and invited me to dine with him at eight o'clock in the evening. After sitting down, I reached for a cigarette, but I remembered that Gollay disliked cigarettes, so I put the cigarette down.'"

"'In our discussion, his main contribution was to nod in agreement, or to roar, or to use the single word "yes" or "no" to express everything. Mr. Gollay was unwilling to waste words.'"

"'Around seven o'clock, the phone rang, and he asked me to answer it. It was my wife, asking me to return immediately to meet a guest. After finishing the call, I returned to my chair, and I told him about the phone call, and Gollay nodded in agreement that I should return immediately.'"

"'On the way out, because the lights were not on, I bumped my head, which explains why I have a wound on my head. Just as I was approaching the door, he called out to me from behind, saying—"See you again tomorrow morning at ten o'clock!" When I left him around a little after seven o'clock, he was still alive and well!'"

Professor Howard Dunne continued: "Although Browning's phone call proved to be genuine, before he finished speaking, I knew that he was involved in the murder case!"

Clever readers, why is Browning a suspect?

The answer will be revealed in four days.

### The Organization of Beggars 23

— Huang Jiamo

Catching Poisonous Snakes

Among the hard-core beggar gangs, the snake beggar profession is the most promising. Because they are specialized technicians in the jianghu, they cannot survive without real talent and skill. Because poisonous snakes cause people to turn pale at the mention of them, and no one wants to anger them. But the more poisonous the snake, the greater the profit. As long as the snake venom is overcome, one can be successful in all aspects and no longer worry about food and clothing. Therefore, snake beggars only need to start their careers to shed their tattered clothes and stand alongside the four classes of people. So, to become a snake beggar, one must have great patience and sincerely worship a master to learn the art. Experienced snake beggars are very cautious about accepting apprentices. Any rotten wood that cannot be carved is rejected. In addition to loyalty and cleverness, they must also have sound physical strength, and literacy is a qualification for being selected as an apprentice.

"Catching slippery ones" is the gang slang for "catching snakes," and "slippery ones" is the general term for "snakes." But there are many gangs, and some also call them "digging earth dragons." Catching snakes must first require learning to make snake medicine, which is called "merging lines" in slang. The secret recipes are only known to members of the gang and are not easily passed on to outsiders. According to the results of the author's investigation, it is said that "bedbugs" and "earwax" are placed on yin-yang tiles and baked, then ground into a fine powder, which is extremely poisonous and can overcome poisonous snakes. But they did indeed use bamboo to clamp both ends of "centipedes" and expose them alive to the sun until they were dry. They were then baked on yin-yang tiles and ground into pills. These "centipede pills" were white and had a herbal taste, and it is likely that other medicines were mixed in. The secret of the secret recipe naturally cannot be investigated. A secondary recipe is to mix shochu with realgar, and the exhalation and saliva in people's mouths. It is said that shochu removes the poisonous gas, realgar removes the poisonous taste, and saliva removes the poisonous juice. Such jianghu sayings can naturally only be heard casually. However, when catching snakes, these three things are indeed needed. First, use messy silk floss to wrap the arms and palms, like a Western doctor bandaging a rotten leg. Soak the shochu, realgar, and saliva to the fullest extent, and reach into the hole to catch the snake. If you encounter the most poisonous snakes and many small snakes in a "dragon village" (snake nest), you must eat "centipede pills." It is said that centipedes can overcome snakes, which can be said to be "fighting poison with poison."

If you encounter a snake swimming on the ground, it is easier to catch. The snake beggar only needs to rush forward and strike the snake's head hard. The snake will then dart straight up, but it will still swim when it falls down. Another strike, and the snake will not dart up as high. With the third strike, the snake is somewhat injured and will no longer move. Then grab the "seven inches" area (i.e., seven inches below the snake's head). Point the snake's tail upwards, hook it on the arm, and wrap it tightly. At that time, you must not try to hold it up with force, just loosen it and let the snake wrap around. After a while, it will naturally loosen. With a shake, the snake will no longer move. Then put it into the "dragon palace" (snake basket), where the snake beggar can play with it without it becoming fierce. When poisonous snakes, such as "vipers" and "red-banded snakes," are caught, the snake gall is taken out and sold to people to eat. For hundreds of years, the jianghu has recognized snake gall as a good medicine for treating blurred vision. Non-poisonous snakes, such as "green whips" and "yellow whips," can be skinned and eaten, and are said to be very delicious. It's just that they cannot be cooked in iron or steel pots. Water cannot be scooped with a copper spoon either, but must be done with earthenware pots, otherwise it will be poisonous, probably due to chemical reactions.

After learning how to catch snakes, snake beggars can go into business alone. Having snakes is equivalent to having money. Selling snake medicine, selling live snakes, and selling snake gall are all ways to make a living. It is said that simmering snake skin into ashes and applying it to cold and sauce-rotted feet has a miraculous effect. Applying powdered borneol to festering wounds under snake skin also has the possibility of healing. Snake beggar's eye medicine is very valuable, but in fact, it is a mixture of snake gall and coptis and other medicines. Snake meat can be used as food, salted or plain, dried or fresh, and is said to have the effect of removing ringworm, but this cannot be verified.

### The Beginning of Democracy — "A Good Start is Half the Battle" —

— Jurist Lou Tongsun

The "Shen Bao" New Year's Day supplement solicited articles, and just as the National Assembly's constitution-making work has entered an important stage—the Comprehensive Review Committee is seeking compromises on all the particularly significant issues that the various review committees have failed to resolve, and will soon present a report and begin the second reading—my feelings are complex and profound. It can truly be said that, faced with the entire twenty-four dynastic histories, I don't know where to begin! As one of the delegates, and also as someone who originally participated in drafting the "May 5th Draft Constitution," I have been in the Assembly and review committees for weeks, and what I have seen and heard makes me feel that there are countless issues that not only can be spoken about, but should be spoken about. However, apart from raising a few proposals or making a few remarks on a small portion of purely technical issues, I have ultimately remained silent, using a degree of self-restraint I have never used in my life to suppress my tongue, which is not yet completely decayed. Why is this? Why is this? I am also clearly aware that there are many people in this Assembly who hold the same attitude. I know that I have not made any agreements with anyone, nor have I lost my personal freedom of speech, yet I am present at the Assembly almost as a cheerleader for the draft constitution proposed by the National Government, so that it can be completed quickly: I clap my hands, raise my hand, or press the button to approve of anything that can boost the draft's momentum; otherwise, I hesitate and am cautious, though my heart may disapprove, my mouth does not speak, and my hand does not move, secretly fearing that I will gain the sympathy of the audience, as if overturning the original proposal would inevitably cause the country to suffer inexpressible harm. This kind of psychological inner turmoil, contradiction, and pain, though I knowingly commit it, what is the reason for it?

By the time this article of mine is published, it may be the day when the Constitution of the Republic of China is formally promulgated. What the content of the Constitution will ultimately be, I cannot yet predict as I draft this article. But what can be asserted is that, since this National Assembly is no longer a conference of one party or faction but a national conference, the Constitution that will soon be promulgated will also not be a Constitution of one party or faction but a Constitution jointly made by the people of the whole country. This is in line with what the "Kuomintang's Declaration" said: "Only after the Kuomintang is deeply integrated with the people can the Chinese nation hope for true freedom and independence." Also, the declaration of the Kuomintang's First National Congress once said: "The constitution's effectiveness depends entirely on the support of the people." Only a constitution jointly made in close integration with the people can gain the support of the people. The Chinese Kuomintang and the Chinese people have had a close relationship from the beginning. For more than fifty years, the Chinese Kuomintang has advocated revolution, overthrown the Qing Dynasty, completed unification, and defeated powerful enemies. Under the great righteousness of the Three Principles of the People and the National Revolution, countless lives and property have been sacrificed, with people advancing wave upon wave, persevering despite setbacks. The Kuomintang has in reality thoroughly fused with the blood and sweat of the people of the whole country from the beginning. Now, the Kuomintang is once again adhering to its consistent policy of resolutely convening the National Assembly as soon as possible and promulgating a constitution, in order to return power to the people. This spirit of great benevolence, great courage, utmost righteousness, and utmost strength should be understood and appreciated by the people of the country. However, in the constitution-making conference, the aforementioned majority of delegates who deeply understood the overall situation could not avoid falling into the painful situation of saying one thing and thinking another. On the other hand, a small number of parties appeared to be quite arrogant regarding textual issues that were not of great importance. They put great pressure on the majority of delegates, but the majority of delegates were ultimately able to put aside their own preferences and accept constitutional theories and provisions that they were unwilling to accept in their hearts. It is estimated that within a few days, the entire draft constitution will be passed by the Assembly and "promulgated throughout the country, to be followed by all forever." In this unprecedented conference, in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, the approximately 1,700 delegates from various parties, factions, and strata were able to fully demonstrate this great spirit of mutual tolerance. This is due to the influence of revolutionary doctrines and the charisma of the chairman, but also the virtues of the delegates in taking the overall situation into consideration and working together in harmony, which are the traditional Chinese cultural values of self-discipline, restoring ritual, and forgetting oneself for the sake of the public. There is much to be praised!

The West has a saying: "A good beginning is half the battle." This National Assembly is a historic conference. At the beginning of learning democracy, it has achieved this democratic effect. The author, in addition to feeling uneasy, conflicted, depressed, and sentimental, is filled with infinite hope for the future of our country's democracy.

My saying this is neither self-consolation nor self-deception, but can be said to be a self-encouragement formed from a mixture of the two. I would like to express it at the time of completing the constitution and offering New Year's greetings, to encourage the people of the country together.

Wood must rot from within before insects can grow. The Kuomintang has made great contributions to China, which is universally recognized. Yet, at the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, there was the Political Consultative Conference. Looking at the situation during the consultation process, the Kuomintang was almost in the position of being judged. The fact that a minority controlled the majority in this National Assembly is enough to prove the Kuomintang's extremely difficult and unfavorable position. This is due to the objective environment created by several complex and important factors in domestic and foreign politics and economics; but it is also an undeniable fact that some of the Kuomintang's measures over the years have not fully satisfied the hopes of the people of the whole country. In all fairness, these facts are mostly caused by irresistible forces and less by poor planning. "Not seeking merit, but seeking to avoid mistakes," should be emphasized in terms of personal conduct. But in terms of national politics and the rule of a political party, merit is what should be done, and mistakes are the responsibility that should be borne. Moreover, the Kuomintang is a revolutionary party, seeking merit in everything and determined to be responsible, as can be seen in the party's and Chairman Chiang's past documents and declarations. The minority parties, while not forgetting the majority party's great achievements in governing the country for a long time, also want to hold it accountable for its real responsibilities. This cannot be said to be something that should not happen. The Kuomintang, without relying on its merits or avoiding its responsibilities, is earnestly making a constitution to return power to the people. This is the spirit of a great party with revolutionary nation-building, principles, and beliefs, and the success of this National Assembly is mostly due to this spirit as a guiding principle. Doesn't Mr. Sun say? "In revolutionary undertakings, nothing is more difficult than destruction, and nothing is easier than construction. Now that the difficult ones have succeeded (such as overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Expedition, unification, and the victory of the War of Resistance), while the easy ones have failed, what is the reason for this? It is only because it is easy that many people do not know its necessity and neglect it, which is why it fails. Why is it called easy? Because destruction has been completed, and resistance has been greatly reduced. When resistance is eliminated, we can do anything without restriction, which is very different from the situation when planning destruction, where slight carelessness can lead to unforeseen consequences?" (Sun Wen's Theory, Sixth Army) Judging from the atmosphere of this National Assembly, the Kuomintang delegates may inevitably feel that they have failed, but the great task of making a constitution has ultimately been successful. Thus, although construction is easy, it is not often defeated. Since all the previous resistance has been eliminated by the Kuomintang, laying the foundation for construction, we are now free to do anything without restriction. If, after the promulgation of the constitution and the implementation of constitutional government, the democratic government formed by various parties and factions throughout the country is still unable to achieve unification and peace, thus completing the task of revolutionary nation-building, then how will we explain our spirit of tolerance and national planning to the world and future generations? This is what the author wishes to share with the people of the country as a warning, in addition to self-encouragement!

As for the specific issues in the content of the constitution that have been hotly debated, opposed, and revised, such as the form of government, the capital, the organization and powers of the National Assembly, the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, and the methods of producing legislative and supervisory committee members, etc., if measured against Mr. Sun Yat-sen's theory of the five-power constitution, it would not be difficult to establish a considerable standard, but in the discussion of a democratic conference, there is also no absolute standard. Why is this? Politics emphasizes compromise, and democracy values harmony. If all parties insist on their own opinions and are intolerant, then there is no need for a conference at all. Therefore, in terms of a democratic conference, whatever is accepted and passed by the Assembly, its theory or provisions are considered by the conference to be superior and correct; conversely, they are considered inferior and incorrect. The minority obeying the majority is a common practice in democratic politics; the majority tolerating the minority is a characteristic of the actual situation. Correct theories can be deduced to produce logical facts; but the current facts must also be formed by some insurmountable objective conditions. Therefore, at this time, in China, when making a constitution, it is more advantageous to accommodate the facts than to talk about theories. What do you think of this, wise people? (December 19, 1946, in Nanjing)

### New Year's Greetings

— Cheng Tixuan

On the first day of the 36th year of the Republic of China, when the year is renewed and the constitution is promulgated, all countries look up to it, and hundreds of millions of people celebrate together. The dust is gone from the world, and I wish to hear the sound of joy throughout the land; spring fills the divine land, and I will chant the words of revival and glory.

Time flies like an arrow leaving the string, and I entrust my New Year's greetings to colorful stationery. The constitution's draft has sought wisdom for a century, like the Great Xia dynasty. The brush blossoms overnight, foretelling spring. I pity the past days that have been spent in vain, and I want to help the people out of their suffering. The chaos in the South has gradually subsided. Gradually, I see the plum blossoms and willows charming the mountains and rivers.

### The 35th Year of the Republic of China (1946) Political Consultative Conference: Ten Major Domestic Events

— From our Newspaper Archives

Among the news published in newspapers throughout the year, the most space and attention was naturally given to the peace talks between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In the half-year after Japan's surrender, the CCP's army, by preventing the acceptance of surrender, caused destruction of transportation, stagnation of repatriation, and rekindled flames of war everywhere. It was not until the arrival of the New Year last year that a glimmer of hope for peaceful unification was seen. After much deliberation between the government and the CCP, and with Marshal George Marshall mediating, the Political Consultative Conference was finally convened on January 10th in Chongqing, the temporary capital, to thoroughly discuss various military and political issues. About thirty-eight representatives, including those from the KMT, CCP, Youth Party, Democratic League, and notable figures from society, participated. From January 10th to 19th, nine plenary sessions were held. After the 19th, discussions continued in groups outside the conference. By the 31st, agreements had been reached on all issues. The tenth plenary session was then held, resolutions were passed, and the conference was declared closed. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference covered a wide range, divided into five areas: first, regarding government organization, to reorganize the National Government Committee, expand the number of members, and accommodate various parties, so that the National Government Committee would become the highest state organ; second, regarding the platform of governance, to determine the national military, political, diplomatic, economic, and financial policies; third, regarding military issues, the government and CCP armies would implement reorganization and unification, and the military would be nationalized; fourth, regarding the National Assembly, the date for convening the National Assembly was decided, and the number of representatives was expanded; and fifth, regarding the draft constitution, several principles of revision were passed, to be studied in detail and compiled by the Constitution Drafting Review Committee, and then submitted to the National Assembly for adoption.

These five major resolutions contained solutions to all the problems faced by the country after the war. If all parties could continue to maintain the harmonious spirit of the Political Consultative Conference and faithfully implement the resolutions, the goal of peaceful unification would not be difficult to achieve. Unfortunately, the auspicious atmosphere brought about by the Political Consultative Conference was only fleeting. As soon as the conference closed, conflicts arose in Northeast China, causing the entire year after the victory to be spent in widespread warfare.

(2) The National Government Returns to the Capital

The grand ceremony for the National Government's victorious return to the capital was solemnly held on May 5th of last year in Nanjing, the capital city. After the outbreak of war, the government moved to Chongqing in November of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937] for the sake of long-term resistance against Japan. Eight years later, the Japanese invaders surrendered, victory arrived, and it triumphantly returned to Nanjing. In the history of the Chinese nation, what a significant and profound event this was!

Repatriation and return to the capital was an extremely arduous task. This was mainly in the area of transportation. During the eight years of the war of resistance, transportation routes and tools were either destroyed by the enemy or deliberately destroyed by us to hinder the enemy's advance. Now that victory had suddenly arrived, naturally, everything felt a bit overwhelming.

In September of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1945], one month after Japan's surrender, the government formulated a plan for government agencies to return to the capital in stages and mobilized all available transportation resources to actively implement it. Air transport flew directly from Chongqing to Nanjing, and land transport traveled north from Chongqing via Xi'an, Tongguan, Xuzhou, and then turned into Nanjing. The most important was water transport, traveling downstream along the Yangtze River. The work of repatriation and returning to the capital began in September of the 34th year and was largely completed by April of the 35th year, and the grand ceremony for the return to the capital was officially held in Nanjing on May 5th.

The return-to-capital ceremony was held at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. On this day, the sky was clear, the sun was shining, the roads of the Mausoleum were clean and dust-free, and the plane trees lined the avenues. Government officials, both civil and military, were all dressed in ceremonial attire, lined up on the left and right sides of the hall. At exactly 9:00 a.m., the ceremonial gun salutes boomed, and the ceremony began. President Chiang and his wife led the civil and military officials to pay respects to the portrait of the Father of the Nation, and mourned for the soldiers and compatriots who died in the War of Resistance. After the ceremony, the President stepped out of the hall and announced the official return to the capital to the compatriots across the country.

May 5th is a day that is eternally worth commemorating in the hearts of the ten thousand citizens of Nanjing and compatriots across the country.

(3) Peace Talks

From New Year's Day to New Year's Eve of the 35th year, not a single day passed without news about peace talks in the newspapers. And the result was that the situation on New Year's Eve seemed to be the same as on New Year's Day, with no improvement at all.

The Political Consultative Conference, which began on January 10th, closed on the 31st and passed five resolutions. On February 25th, the military three-person group organized by Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall officially signed an agreement on the reorganization and unification of the KMT and CCP armies. It seemed that peace should be very hopeful.

In early March, Soviet troops began to withdraw from Northeast China, and the National Army went to take over in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty. However, the CCP troops, who had secretly moved out of the pass in advance, immediately rose up to obstruct them, capturing the cities after the Soviet troops withdrew, thus triggering a full-scale conflict in Northeast China. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the military reorganization plan all became waste paper.

The government issued a ceasefire order for Northeast China on June 7th in order to achieve peace. The military three-person group also resumed meetings on June 23rd to conduct negotiations, but they were intermittently held and there were no concrete results.

This situation dragged on until August. On August 13th, President Chiang Kai-shek published six guidelines for dealing with the future situation, and the peace talks became active again. In terms of approach, the government advocated holding a five-person meeting, starting with the reorganization of the government to fundamentally resolve the overall problem; the CCP advocated holding a three-person meeting to only resolve military issues. Later, the two sides finally agreed to hold both the three-person and five-person meetings at the same time, but the negotiations did not continue due to the military conflict in Zhangjiakou. Zhou Enlai went to Shanghai and did not continue the peace talks.

In early October, third-party figures such as the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Democratic League did their best to mediate, and government representatives also went to Shanghai to invite them in person. Finally, on October 21st, everyone returned to Nanjing and reopened negotiations. This negotiation was still unsuccessful. On November 15th, the National Assembly opened. The Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party all participated, while the CCP declared that it would not participate. After the 19th, Zhou Enlai returned to Yan'an, and the intermittent peace talks of this year came to an end.

(4) President Chiang Kai-shek's Sixtieth Birthday

Last year, October 31st marked President Chiang Kai-shek's sixtieth birthday, a joyful occasion for the entire country. Grand celebrations were held throughout the country to express respect and admiration for the President's great achievements. Among them, the "Dedicate Schools to Celebrate Birthday," initiated by the Shanghai press and education circles, was particularly meaningful and received enthusiastic responses from all over. In addition to dedicating schools, provinces, cities, and counties also made memorial gestures, such as: jointly signing birthday congratulatory albums, constructing birthday halls, writing birthday screens, birthday odes, birthday prefaces, birthday paintings, and presenting bronze statues, etc. Afterwards, the Ministry of Education designated the period from the President's sixtieth birthday in the 35th year to his birthday in the 36th year as "Dedicate Schools to Celebrate Birthday Year" to commemorate it forever. On the day of the birthday, President Chiang and his wife, accompanied by Special Envoy Marshall and his wife, went to Wuxi to avoid the birthday celebrations. For a time, the scenery of Taihu Lake added infinite splendor. The Wuxi County Government, the County Party Department, and the Provisional County Council specially initiated the construction of the "Longevity Bridge" in Taihu Lake to commemorate the event, leaving a good story for history.

### Chiang Kai-shek Bronze Statue Inauguration Ceremony in Taiwan

— Our Newspaper Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu

The iron frame for hanging the national flag was installed in Taipei just three days ago. On this extraordinary day, it was fully utilized. The bright national flags were all at the same height, equally vibrant, and solemnly fluttering in the warm sunlight. It was so solemn, orderly, and beautiful.

The bronze statue of President Chiang, erected above the fountain in the intersection opposite the Governor-General's Office, held a grand unveiling ceremony today—National Recovery Day. "Virtue surpasses the ancients, great achievements, both martial and literary," these words woven into a colored arch made of green leaves were praised by every Taiwanese spectator.

The sound of twenty-one gun salutes dispersed a layer of morning mist, and the ceremony was announced to begin. The square was already packed with people. After the symphony orchestra finished playing the national anthem, the lively daughter of Speaker Huang of the Provincial Assembly stood in front of the ceremonial altar and gently pulled down a white curtain on the President's bronze statue. Tens of millions of eyes stared at the bronze statue in a daze. The white curtain was pulled down, and a pair of white doves tied with red silk took the lead, and more than twenty others flew out all at once, soaring in the clear sky. The President's bronze statue was smiling, and every Taiwanese compatriot looked at him and smiled, a great resonance arose in their hearts. Just like when the President personally came to Taiwan, he also looked at this beautiful island with such pleasure, inspiring every Taiwanese compatriot who returned to the embrace of the motherland.

Twenty young girls in white dresses and blue skirts presented flowers to the bronze statue, piling them colorfully around the statue.

Governor Chen first gave a speech, saying: "Today's unveiling ceremony of President Chiang Kai-shek's bronze statue is of great significance in terms of national consciousness and national concept. President Chiang is the savior of Taiwan. Without the great President Chiang, Taiwan really doesn't know how much more suffering it would have to endure. But now we are free and liberated!" His earnest words spoke the words that the Taiwanese compatriots wanted to say from the bottom of their hearts. Indeed, stroking the wounds of fifty years of shackles and looking at the President's bronze statue facing the Taiwanese compatriots, one would truly be moved to tears.

The artist who sculpted the bronze statue, also came to participate in the unveiling ceremony. How happy he must have been to see his work displayed before the eyes of tens of millions of people. He said that he respects art, admires the leader, and serves the country, and that he can only do this kind of work with his own blood and sweat. It took nearly ten months from modeling to the completion of the bronze statue. The statue's expression is very lifelike. He himself said that he had never seen the President, but started modeling after referring to many photos, which was really not an easy task.

The bronze statue is nine feet four inches tall, three fen thick, and weighs 2,000 catties [approximately 2,645 pounds] in total. This great bronze statue will forever stand in the hearts of millions of Taiwanese compatriots. "Long live President Chiang! Long live! Long, long live!" The earth-shattering cries spread from the bronze statue of the President to every corner of the island (Sent on the 29th)

### The Democratic Constitution Comes from a Long Road

— Legislative Member Chen Guyuan

Based on its established policy, the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) ended the period of political tutelage and returned governance to the people by convening the National Assembly on November 12, 1946. Representatives from all parts of the country and overseas, from various parties, professions, women's groups, and military units, gathered together to create a democratic constitution. This was an unprecedented grand event in our country's millennia of history. I, Xian Yuan, had the honor to attend this great event, comprehending many essential aspects of democratic politics and learning many skills in democratic politics. I suspect that many others shared the same feelings. As we celebrate the New Year's Day and the Founding Anniversary of the Republic of China in 1947, I believe it is more appropriate to share my insights and learning from the National Assembly with the readers than to write a superficial commemorative piece.

However, I personally have a historical perspective. Therefore, before writing down my direct impressions from the various corners of the Assembly, I would like to start from the front page of China's democratic politics. It is necessary to understand the historical facts of China's democratic politics to realize the difficulty of its creation, which is comparable to the experiences of European and American countries. Precisely because it is difficult to achieve, it should be cherished deeply. How delightful it is that this National Assembly has created a democratic constitution! So, what is the front page of China's democratic politics? In simple terms:

The origin of democratic politics in China, like that of all nations in the world, seemed to have begun in the tribal states era. As recorded in the Book of Documents, Emperor Yao abdicating to Shun after consulting the Four Mountains, and Pan Geng relocating the capital after consulting the people of the country, can be seen as the beginnings of democratic politics. However, at that time, there was a distinction between people of the country and people of the fields, as well as a distinction between gentlemen and commoners. Even if tribal meetings were held, they were not national assemblies, and therefore cannot be considered modern democracy. The primitive form of democracy, due to the increase in tribal population, the expansion of territory, and the economic needs and defense of life that did not allow for permanent stagnation in the tribal state era, and the lack of modern conditions conducive to the implementation of democratic politics, was lost with the emergence of monarch-centered power states.

In China, although it did not go through a stage of monarchical supremacy like European countries, the politics of the past millennia only showed the spirit of "people as the foundation" and did not demand "governance by the people." It is still difficult to call it having the concept of modern democracy. People-based ideology is merely a combination of the two concepts of "owned by the people" and "enjoyed by the people," with at most the addition of the concept of "coexistence and shared prosperity between Chinese and foreign." Because the concept of "governance by the people" was absent, even this democratic concept of coexistence and shared prosperity between Chinese and foreigners was diluted of its glory. We know that China has always had sayings such as "the people are the foundation of the state" and "the ruler is also one of the people," which at most lean towards the concept of "owned by the people." There are also sayings such as "loving the people," "shepherding the people," "sharing joy with the people," and "following the people's likes and dislikes," which at most lean towards the concept of "enjoyed by the people." In other words, it only acknowledges that politics belongs to the people and that the government exists for the benefit of the people. As for the idea that politics must be managed by the people themselves, it is completely absent. Because "political power comes from the people" is tantamount to saying that everyone is the emperor; how could that be allowed! Therefore, the so-called "benevolent governance" and "benevolent rule" of China for thousands of years did indeed restrain many monarchs, preventing them from openly acting arrogantly. However, this sugar-coated poison ruined the people's demands for governance by the people. Look, when King Li of Zhou was expelled by the people, a system of governance by the people should have appeared in theory. In the end, however, the people still chose the aristocracy to hold power, calling it "republicanism." The Han and Ming dynasties were both successful popular revolutions, and could have avoided repeating the mistakes of emperors, but they still harbored the mentality of "he can be replaced." Even the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom princes of modern times, who accepted Western European thought, still followed suit in establishing a dynasty, abandoning democracy for their own rule, showing the weakness of the concept of "political power comes from the people!"

The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Revolutionary martyrs shed their blood and patriotic people exhausted their sweat to establish the Republic of China. However, the people, after being shackled by thousands of years of monarchical politics, suddenly became masters of the republic. Lacking the ability to shoulder political responsibilities and the interest in concerning themselves with politics, all power naturally fell into the hands of ambitious people, leading to endless turmoil. Foresighted of this, Sun Yat-sen planned to use the military government period to carry out the destruction of the revolution, the tutelage period to carry out the construction of the revolution, and the constitutional government period to complete the purpose of the revolution, with a clear and orderly procedure. The tutelage was not dictatorship, but rather leading the people onto the road of democracy, and returning governance to the people, standing with all parties under the democratic constitution, was its ultimate goal. The Chinese Nationalist Party never sought political power for its own interests; the tutelage was an obligation rather than a right. If not for foreign aggression, the implementation of constitutional government would have been ten years ago, and if not for the stubborn opinions of the parties after the victory, the constitution would have been drafted half a year earlier. In the end, because the National Revolution stemmed from selflessness and utmost sincerity, it was willing to fully accommodate the opinions of all parties after the victory, even at the cost of repeatedly postponing the National Assembly, in pursuit of domestic peace. Finally, it obtained the cooperation of enlightened parties and non-partisan social figures. The assembly opened and drafted the constitution. For parties that did not submit their lists, seats were still reserved, hoping for their participation. At the same time, the government's proposed draft constitution maintained the principles decided by the Political Consultative Conference in every aspect. For this reason, the senior cadres of the Chinese Nationalist Party spent countless energy, held countless meetings, and repeatedly advised their party members, hoping that they would smoothly pass this democratic constitution. This tolerant attitude of considering party interests is truly the essence of democratic politics. It is rarely seen in political parties in other countries around the world. Now, China has ended the Chinese Nationalist Party's tutelage and begun national politics. However, its process has had a long and arduous history, and involved many compromises and considerable deliberation. Ultimately, it achieved the goal of directly returning governance to the people, placing every citizen in the position of an emperor. This is what we first understand from this great beginning of ending the tutelage, returning governance to the people, convening the National Assembly, and drafting the democratic constitution.

Indeed! Although Sun Yat-sen set the stage for the period of tutelage, the expected results of the tutelage were not fully achieved due to internal and external troubles, which cannot be denied, and may inevitably reduce the efficiency of the implementation of democratic politics. However, since the people of the whole country hoped to return governance to the people as soon as possible, the Chinese Nationalist Party did not seek self-interest from the tutelage. If the Japanese invaders had not deeply penetrated, the tutelage would have ended long ago. However, during this period of resistance against Japan, the convening of the National Political Council and the establishment of provincial and county councils also created many bridges and foundations for democratic politics. Moreover, as a result of the tutelage period, the people have fully developed an interest in concerning themselves with politics, which can be said to be more than half successful. As for the ability to shoulder political responsibilities, even if it is not sound, it can gradually be acquired through learning. The convening of this National Assembly can be said to be the people's first learning experience in concerning themselves with national politics. In fact, society is developing forward every day, the times are progressing forward every day, and humans are constantly learning. It is not limited to understanding the meaning of democratic politics before learning the skills of democratic politics.

(II) Not only must everyone have a say, but everyone must also have food to eat

Secondly, I personally graduated from the Department of Political Science at Peking University, and served as an assistant teacher in the Department of Political Science for several years. Until 1930, I taught political science courses at various universities in Shanghai. After that, although I focused on law, I never completely abandoned subjects related to political science. Therefore, my second impression is that China's future democratic politics at least contains three aspects of meaning. In addition to political democracy, it must also consider international democracy, and value economic democracy even more. Only in this way can we achieve the most perfect democratic politics, which was fully revealed during this drafting of the constitution. We know that political life in social phenomena is like the skin, muscles, and bones of the human body. Without it, the body cannot be protected or supported, and all organs would have nothing to rely on. It is indeed very important. However, the national spirit and cultural life, similar to the brain and nerves, and the economic life, similar to blood circulation, are equally valuable to the skin, muscles, and bones in a person's thinking, movement, and nourishment. Therefore, although democratic politics is based on political democracy, international democracy and economic democracy must not be neglected. The Three Principles of the People - Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood - are aimed at these three aspects; they are broader than the concepts of government of the people, by the people, for the people, and include the entire meaning of democracy.

Nationalism enables all ethnic groups within the country to equally form the Chinese nation and coexist with all ethnic groups in the world; that is, it promotes its own culture and promotes the exchange of world cultures, seeking the survival of its own nation without hindering the survival of other nations. Abiding by international charters and supporting small and weak nations is to seek international democracy from ourselves first; China's past ideal of coexistence and shared prosperity with other ethnic groups is also developed from this. Therefore, nationalism not only makes all ethnic groups within the country equal, but also lays the cornerstone of international democracy. If this concept is ignored and only political and economic democracy is sought, it becomes one-sided democracy, which is not valuable from the perspective of all mankind. Moreover, in practice, without considering international democracy, it may not be possible to truly embark on the road of democracy domestically; the past aggressor nations are good examples. As for the two meanings of democracy, political and economic, one should not be overemphasized over the other. The democracy of general capitalist countries, where everyone has a say, outwardly attaches importance to the spirit of governance by the people. However, most people only have the right in name, and the actual benefits are in the hands of big capitalists. No wonder some people say that such democracy is not thorough. The democracy of some socialist countries, where everyone has food to eat, in practice attaches importance to the spirit of "for the people". However, most people cannot participate in the decision-making process and only enjoy the results that have been shown to them. No wonder some people say that such democracy has lost its essence. Because each only obtains a part of democracy, there is a flaw exposed. It must contain all three aspects of meaning, and then it is truly the democratic politics needed by mankind.

The democratic constitution drafted this time has declared in its preamble that it is based on Sun Yat-sen's legacy of establishing the Republic of China, and the three aspects of democratic meaning are all absorbed in the charter. The articles emphasize the spirit of national politics everywhere, which strengthens the effectiveness of political democracy, which goes without saying. Regarding the attitude towards foreign affairs and economic measures, on the surface, they seem to be policy matters and do not necessarily need to be included in the constitution, but because they are indispensable parts of democratic politics, they cannot destroy the tripartite balance or create a crippled situation. Although everyone did not hesitate to argue heatedly and dispute during the discussion, it was all to seek how to stipulate it so that it would be appropriate technically, but there was no disagreement on such fundamental principles. The development of China's democratic politics in the future will not only thoroughly realize national politics and seek economic equality, but also support world peace and protect international security; this is what we must understand from this great beginning of ending tutelage, returning government to the people, convening the National Assembly, and drafting the democratic constitution.

This solemn and great democratic constitution, although Sun Yat-sen previously enlightened its spirit, enabled democracy to progress in three aspects. However, I think that the representatives from the people do not necessarily have a deep understanding of constitutional law, and do not necessarily pay attention to all aspects of democratic meaning. Even I usually emphasize the concept of government by the people when talking about democracy, and often overlook the concept of international and economic democracy. Through the various stages of broad discussion and review in the assembly, from the speeches of Mongolian-Tibetan representatives, occupational representatives, etc., no matter how I judge their speeches, they all make me deeply understand that the appearance of democracy contains three aspects of consciousness. Gathering the views of hundreds of people provides learning for everyone. I think anyone who attends this assembly, with a sense of comprehension, even if they do not become an expert in constitutional law, will at least have a closer understanding of China's future democratic politics. Knowing without doing is possible, but doing will certainly lead to knowing more. All understanding is the result of learning.

(III) Everything for the country, everything for democracy

The constitution drafted by this National Assembly is, in itself, a democratic constitution. Professor Pound said: "China needs a Chinese constitution with Chinese characteristics and in line with China's national conditions, without copying foreign countries;" and also said, "The separation of powers is not a necessary condition for democratic or constitutional politics." Then, the most suitable for China's national conditions is naturally the Five-Power Constitution formed from the Chinese people's original cultural relics system and traditional ideals. However, because the parties are unwilling to fully accept the theory of the Five-Power Constitution, they cannot adhere to their own ideals and insist on it. The spirit of democratic politics is to sacrifice one's own views and tolerate the views of others. Especially the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, which is followed by the people of the whole country, beyond the interests of all parties, classes, and clans, and must be open-minded. If what others say is right and reasonable, we naturally submit. Even if some theories seem unacceptable to us, but others must insist on them, and do not greatly hinder our ideals, we may as well adopt them. Everything is for the country, everything is for democracy. In other words, the constitution is national, and the democratic constitution we need is neither in the nature of a "decreed" constitution, nor is it based on historical background like the British constitution, with its clauses fought for by its people through repeated unanimous actions against the government. Naturally, it cannot satisfy everyone who participates in the constitution-making process. Therefore, even if the constitution is freely drafted in the form of a "constitution determined by the people," there are even more divergent opinions. Only by obeying the decision of the majority can a common will be formed; if we talk about the original opinions, everyone has something they are dissatisfied with. Moreover, after the victory, in order to achieve the goal of peace and unification, the government party and the parties held a Political Consultative Conference to determine the principles of the draft constitution. Although it cannot bind the constitution-making of the National Assembly, from the perspective of the parties, it fully has the meaning of an agreed constitution, which is a fact. Since it comes from an agreement, the five powers are not the five powers, and the three powers are not the three powers. Each adopts its strengths and abandons its weaknesses, tolerating for the country, in order to realize democratic politics. Although it is inevitable that there is unspeakable pain for the party's doctrine that has always been believed in, in order for the country to quickly embark on the road of democratic politics and to make this democratic constitution very smoothly completed, one can only abandon one's own prejudices and follow the principles of political consultation, and let future generations criticize all praise and blame! When newspaper reporters inquired about my opinion of the assembly, I said, "Draft a centennial law with a later objective attitude, and open up lasting peace in a harmonious atmosphere." Although a constitution may not necessarily have a hundred years of effect, and the peace brought about by this constitution cannot have lasting duration, the objective attitude and harmonious atmosphere are indispensable factors in drafting the constitution, if it is truly a manifestation of the spirit of democracy.

Since the constitution is a thing that transcends parties, classes, and clans, then all those who participate in the constitution-making process naturally come for the fundamental law of the country and for the benefit of the people of the whole country. Even though the representatives of parties and the representatives of social elites are produced by different methods; there are also women representatives and military representatives who come from special elections; they are all representatives of the people and must always speak for the people of the whole country, and cannot regard themselves as unique from others because the units that produced them are different. The National Assembly representatives are representatives of the national people, not representatives of only the people of the producing unit. Regional representatives and occupational representatives are like this, and even the selected representatives of special elections cannot be explained in this way, or else it cannot be explained that they represent the meaning of the people. Then, there is no reason for party selfishness, class views, clan distinctions, and regional divisions to transcend the interests of the country. Therefore, the constitution-making process must be in a harmonious atmosphere, with an objective attitude, for the handling of the clauses; I have repeatedly spoken in the Assembly Review Committee, often biased towards the compromise, hoping that everyone can get by. Although newspapers have praised me for being good at resolving difficult problems, in my personal opinion, it is sometimes necessary. However, in reality, the speakers sometimes argue and advocate based on their own profession, or based on the department they are in charge of, or based on the interests of a certain clan or region. On the surface, it seems that they are doing this for the benefit of a certain part, but after careful observation, it is not entirely the case. One cannot just superficially view the value of such speeches. We know that the constitution is national in nature and covers the interests of all professions, departments, clans, and regions. If the regulations on one side are not sound, it will inevitably affect the well-being of the whole country. People in the profession know the situation of the profession the deepest, people in one department know the facts of the department the most, and the same is true for various clans and regions. The meaning of the meeting lies in extensively collecting opinions, not worrying about their speaking, but worrying that they cannot speak more. As long as their views can win the sympathy of the meeting, or after being refuted by others, they no longer insist and know that their views need to be discussed, they are all commendable opinions; at most, they can only be called short-sighted, but they cannot be completely regarded as selfish. This is my view.

A democratic constitution is formed by synthesizing opinions from all aspects. Although everyone speaks for the interests of the country and the happiness of the people, in the discussion, they do not immediately stop fully expressing their views just because they humbly listen to the views of others. For truth becomes clearer with debate. If one's own view is correct, one should declare it to the public. Even if it is not valued, one should hold the mentality of gaining as much sympathy as possible and speaking one's mind. The extensive discussions at this meeting, with more than 120 representatives speaking, regardless of party, clan, region, profession, or women, all expressed their opinions freely, forming an unprecedented debate. This extensive discussion has influenced the revision of the draft constitution to some extent. Its effect can reduce future interpretations of the constitution and reduce the articles of amendment to the constitution in the future. Using interpretation to change the original meaning of the constitution is ultimately a compromise. Once the articles of the constitution are formulated and promulgated, further revisions are also a last resort. Therefore, when drafting the constitution, all the problems that can be thought of should be said for everyone's reference, whether to adopt or not, awaiting public decision. Therefore, when a reporter from a certain newspaper asked me for my opinion of the assembly, I replied with the following two sentences: "During the discussion of the constitution, individuals should fully express their views as much as possible. After the vote, the minority should absolutely obey the will of the majority."

However, we should not only deeply understand all of this, but also hope to continue to learn, so as to promote the implementation of the democratic constitution.

(IV) Refining mediocrity to express the refined.

The operation of democratic politics does not necessarily rely on meetings, but the holding of meetings facilitates the expression of the democratic spirit. In particular, the openness of the National Assembly and the drafting of the democratic constitution have allowed us to learn a lot about the essence of democratic politics and learn many skills in democratic politics from various corners of this Assembly. Now, I will summarize it below:

Democratic meetings are not afraid of the number of attendees, but only afraid of the lack of order and discipline. Meetings are organized. If the order and discipline of the meeting can be controlled, one should not worry about the number of attendees. Given the vastness of China's territory, the size of the population, and the importance of the constitution-making work, can 2,050 representatives be considered too many? However, gathering so many representatives together to discuss proposals is not only a first in China, but also uncommon in other countries around the world. Therefore, controlling the order of the meeting and maintaining the discipline of the meeting is certainly a difficult task. However, on the whole, everything is still fine; if we compare it with the previous old National Assembly meetings, it has progressed very quickly, which cannot be said to be the achievement of the tutelage stage. Everyone will remember that fights and bloodshed often occurred at the old National Assembly meetings. The ink boxes on each member's desk were eventually firmly embedded on the desktop, no longer allowed to fly freely and become weapons. At that time, I was still studying at Peking University, and I decided to go to the hearing. It happened that the government proposed the appointment of Zhou Ziqi as Minister of Finance, seeking the consent of the parliament. The voices of support and opposition from the audience were issued at the same time, and the members even left their seats and made a mess. In the end, it broke up without result. After listening, I was very disappointed and said, "Such a mess is not as good as our student meetings"; however, the total attendance of them was only a few hundred people, and they were so undisciplined! This time, the National Assembly regularly has thousands of hundreds of people attending, and they can all observe the order quite well. Although there are occasional shouts or boos, but after inferring their origin, they cannot be avoided in any meeting. The shouts mostly arise from disputes over the agenda, and shouting quickly is the only way to save it; otherwise, it is also a shout belonging to a complaint. (Continued on page 3)

### Understanding and Learning Democratic Politics

— Legislative Member Chen Guyuan

(Continued from page two)

The boos mostly arose because the speaker's theory was displeasing to some representatives, and they insisted on continuing to speak beyond the allotted time, which inevitably led to this aversion. Sometimes, the booing was excessive, and neighboring representatives got caught up in issues related to order to stop the booing. The fact that issues of order arose from trying to maintain order is one example. However, these occasional occurrences were eventually reduced through the skillful handling of the presidium and the self-examination among the representatives. In addition, the secretariat of the assembly specially printed and distributed "A Summary of the Rudiments of Civil Rights" to the representatives for handy reference, so that the meeting could demonstrate its organizational nature in every aspect and contribute to the success of the democratic meeting. Because in the first few meetings, representatives corrected procedural errors based on what was shown in "The Rudiments of Civil Rights," and the entire assembly estimated that the number of representatives who could be familiar with "The Rudiments of Civil Rights" was only over 40 percent. The number of representatives who could truly use "The Rudiments of Civil Rights" with ease was probably even less. As for representatives who came purely from the grassroots, there were certainly more who were unfamiliar with the use of "The Rudiments of Civil Rights". In the meeting, everyone held this book, learning and using it at the same time, which had a significant effect on promoting democratic politics through meeting techniques.

The attendees of a democratic meeting, no matter where you come from or what your social status is, are all representatives. When attending a meeting in the capacity of a representative, one should never have a sense of superiority, let alone look down on others. The true essence of democracy lies first in being able to respect the personality of others, and respecting the personality of others is respecting one's own personality. Therefore, the speeches of others should never be disregarded because of their humble status, nor should one show an attitude of disdain. Even if the speaking skills are not very high, and the reasons for the arguments are not very sufficient, there may still be a valuable insight to be adopted, or even if not, it can be used to refute and prove one's own views are superior. Being able to listen to the opinions of others with an open mind is a manifestation of respecting the personality of others in the meeting, and it is essential to realizing the spirit of democracy. Conversely, since you know others are the same, the rules that others must abide by must also be followed by yourself, and you cannot uniquely seek to be different. In a democratic meeting, there should never be the pride of "a crane standing among chickens," but only the attitude of "treating each other as equals." Humility demeans one's own personality, while pride damages the personality of others. For example, the speaking time during the discussion of proposals, except for reports and questions, is limited to five minutes per person. This is necessary to ensure equal speaking opportunities. This statutory time is stated in the rules of procedure, and everyone should abide by it, unless the chairman specifically permits it, or the entire assembly unanimously supports you to continue speaking for more than five minutes. It is absolutely wrong to think that you are superior to others, or that your reasoning is absolutely correct and that you can disregard such restrictions. It must be known that concise words are not verbose, and there is no need to be verbose. Even if there are profound theories that need to be detailed, they can also be expressed in other ways without taking up the speaking time of others. During a general discussion, I requested to speak and submitted it to the chairman, and it was my turn three days later. With this ample time, I spent a lot of brainpower to ensure that the content of the speech, every word, was not empty talk, and matched the five-minute speaking time exactly, and fortunately received good reviews from the attendees. From this, I realized that in a democratic style, one can only seek expression from the ordinary, and the skills of expression must be deeply learned and cannot be ignored.

(V) It is Politics of the Entire People, Politics of the Majority, Politics in Which Everyone Has a Share

Democratic politics is the politics of the entire people, and it is necessary to take the interests of the entire people as its own interests; but among the entire people, there are always some who need support and assistance before they can truly achieve the practical goal of safeguarding the interests of all. Therefore, in the assembly, I not only expressed sympathy for the women representatives who were fighting for the number of electoral seats, and for the Mongol and Tibetan representatives who were requesting various forms of assistance, but also automatically made some compromise proposals. I always feel that legal equality is formal, and it is necessary to target the facts to achieve actual equality before it can be considered thorough. Although from a purely theoretical standpoint, the regulations on the number of women elected seem to lose the meaning of equality; but from a purely factual standpoint, what good is this nominal equality to women? I also feel that since the situation of the Mongols and Tibetans is special, it is reasonable to seek a kind of guarantee in the constitution, and it should not be the case that because we suspect they have other intentions, we do not give them the reasonable regulations that they should have. Since they attended the National Assembly and participated in the drafting of the constitution, they must have considered themselves a member of the Chinese nation, and we must always consider the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last wishes, especially love and support them to the end. As for social security and the interests of farmers and workers, many representatives in this conference paid special attention to them, and I also expressed my deep sympathy. Although various relevant proposals do not need to be incorporated into the constitutional clauses, the unanimous opinion of the assembly is that it is a major direction in the application of democratic politics in the future.

Democratic politics is also the politics of the majority in the decision of opinions, so to gain sympathy for a proposition, it is necessary to first gain the understanding of the majority. As for the inherent value of the proposition itself, that is a secondary question. During the extensive speeches at this conference, a representative proposed the words "reserve president," and the entire assembly burst into laughter. He then said, "Don't laugh, everyone. When Dr. Sun Yat-sen first proposed the Five-Power Constitution, everyone also thought it was strange," and the entire assembly laughed even more. In fact, if you think about it calmly, his intention may not be without merit. It is only because he believes that the prestige of the president is due to the social status cultivated on weekdays, and that the method of storing talents cannot be used to allow him to cultivate the prestige of being worthy of the president in the position of "reserve president." Even if this representative has other reasons, he can still think of other ways to do it, and there is no need to suddenly bring out this unfamiliar "reserve president" in this conference, which is surprising to everyone. At the same time, a representative proposed the name "Constitution Implementation Law." People who study law have never heard of this name, because how the constitution is implemented can only be determined in the chapter on the implementation of the constitution, or a transitional measure can be decided by the people who drafted the constitution. However, in nature, it still belongs to a part of the constitution, and is not like civil and criminal law, which has its own implementation law. However, the representatives in the meeting felt that the provisions on the implementation of the constitution in the draft constitution were not very comprehensive, and how to implement it was a question to be resolved. Therefore, when this statement came out, the entire assembly applauded, and the creation of legal precedents often comes from this. It can be seen that in a democratic meeting, if a proposition wants to be valued, it must strive for the sympathy of the majority. It is said that "if you listen to the people separately, you will be foolish, but if you listen to them together, you will be wise." The place where wisdom lies is that it has the support of the majority. With the support of the majority, even if it is not the truth, it is the truth. Unless you have the spirit of standing alone and leave this meeting, you can make yourself believe that the argument that you think is the truth will not be coldly regarded by the attendees.

Democratic politics is also politics in which everyone has a share. Therefore, activities under democratic politics require preparation and the courage to move forward extremely. The method of retreating in order to advance used by Chinese scholars, or the method of hoping that others will automatically come to support the situation, is absolutely impossible. When the representatives of the National Assembly were elected in various places in 1937, I could not leave my work post to return to my hometown to engage in activities, and I also felt that working alone might not be successful. I also had the idea that I never participated in matters that required competition, so I did not proceed. I was seriously ill for nine months before and after two years ago, and almost kicked the bucket. After recovering, I thought that I still had years to work hard. In addition to proceeding with my own system in academic aspects, I also became interested in practical politics. In April of last year, the Kuomintang representatives attending the National Assembly had to elect 17 people from the legislative members. The election was held in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters in Xingdu on the 15th. With the help of friends, I was fortunate enough to be elected third place. However, at the opening of this conference, the first thing was the election of the presidium candidates. Not only did I still have a cold heart, but the other sixteen colleagues in the Legislative Yuan also did not engage in the election of the presidium candidates with a style that was not suitable for engaging in democratic politics. Later, the members of the Comprehensive Review Committee were three people recommended by various units. This was more related to the conveners of various review committees for technical aspects, and was considered very important. I really wanted to participate in it; and I hoped that the sixteen colleagues elected by the Legislative Yuan could all do so, and could contribute a little to the technical aspects. My unit was the Kuomintang, with more than 200 representatives, and there were many talented people. I did not dare to have this wishful thinking. I thought that I was produced by a certain unit, but a representative in this unit thought that I was suitable for selection, so I did not dare to proceed any further. However, there were still many friends who were working for me, and they told me that it had already been successful. Unexpectedly, someone temporarily proposed that they should be selected separately from the three regions of the province: south, central, and north, and then send the list to the presidium. My friend heard the news and planned to overturn this decision and implement a vote. I thought that since it had already been decided, why bother being serious? I only blamed myself for not actively competing for the position beforehand. According to the law, each review committee recommended two people to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee. I ignored this move again. At the first meeting, I was caught off guard because I had not been notified of the vote in advance. When I arrived at the place of the Third Review Committee, they were voting and there was no hope. When I turned to the place of the First Review Committee, they were about to vote. At this time, two or three representatives from a certain unit temporarily engaged in activities for me in the meeting. I only got sixteen votes and failed to be elected. In the meeting, I also met a classmate from Peking University who I had not seen for more than 20 years. I always felt embarrassed to tell people about the election when I first met them, and I don't know how many votes I lost. A friend who came to the First Review Committee with me knew a lot of people, but I forgot to tell him that I wanted to compete for the position. When I looked for him temporarily, he had already left the meeting. This is another weakness of mine that I am not accustomed to in democratic politics. From these various things, I also deeply realized what kind of methods should be used in democratic politics, and everything still needs to be learned.

(VI) Introducing a Companion Who is Unfamiliar - "Instrument-Rule"

Finally, I have one more feeling that I want to write as an aside:

I was a student in the May Fourth era. The two gentlemen that I supported at that time, one was Mr. Democracy, and the other was Mr. Science. In other words, it is democracy and science. Science does not necessarily have to progress in a democratic society, but democracy must rely on the assistance of science in order to be enhanced. Especially in China, with its vast land and large population, it is even more necessary to fully express the spirit of democratic politics. The convening of this National Assembly, no matter where you live in the north or south, you can quickly receive the summons and come to Beijing to attend quickly. This is due to the smoothness of scientific study, which has achieved its effects in transportation, needless to say. Furthermore, looking at the hall that can accommodate two thousand and several hundred people, if there were no loudspeakers and voting machines during the discussion and voting, how much difficulty would there be? Voting can still be done by standing up or raising hands, but counting the numbers and wasting time is already a headache, and accuracy is also a big problem. Now that there are voting machines, hanging in the meeting, visible to all, accurate and fast, this is a necessary tool for meetings of a large number of people. Secondly, like speaking during discussions, in order to make everyone in the meeting hear, without the use of loudspeakers, the people sitting in the back would be like watching a silent movie, and the meaning of speaking would be completely lost. Therefore, I feel that the view of managing things should not only advocate imitating the slogans of the New Life Movement, making rule of law, rule of propriety, and rule of man stand side by side, but also making rule of law, rule of propriety, rule of man, and "instrument-rule" stand side by side. I have gained a proof in this conference. "Understand propriety and righteousness" - can be said to be "rule of propriety"; "know integrity, shame, and responsibility" - can be said to be "rule of man"; "observe discipline" - can be said to be "rule of law"; everything must be scientific, that is "instrument-rule".

The advancement of democratic politics cannot be separated from the rule of law, which everyone knows. This National Assembly formulated the constitution. In a political sense, it is a performance of democracy. In a legal sense, it is the formulation of the fundamental law of the country to guarantee the implementation of democratic politics and to be the source of the rule of law. Taking the assembly itself as an example, there is the Organizational Law of the National Assembly, which defines the scope of the representatives' powers, etc., and the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly, which regulate the various procedures in the process of drafting the constitution. Then, in the management of the drafting of the constitution, what is it if not the rule of law? If you pay attention to the spirit of democracy and ignore the spirit of the rule of law, then it becomes a crowd of chickens. So, what about the rule of propriety? Because in ancient times, the word "law" was limited to criminal law, and civil law and political law outside of criminal law were all attributed to propriety. Therefore, in essence, propriety still contains the element of law. Confucianism despises criminal law, so it opposes the rule of law and elevates the rule of propriety. In modern times, the scope of law is broad, including political law, civil law, and criminal law, so there seems to be no reason to advocate the rule of propriety again. However, the so-called rule of law generally only refers to the management of things according to the enacted law, and customary law and rationality law are both excluded, which is still not enough to use. According to the views of "propriety is to practice righteousness," "institution arises from righteousness," and "propriety is reason," and based on the interpretation of "righteousness is doing what is appropriate," in addition to the rule of law, there must also be the rule of propriety to make up for its shortcomings. The draft constitution submitted by the government in this National Assembly is based on the principles determined by the Political Consultative Conference. The Political Consultative Conference has no legal basis, but in order to realize democratic politics, it is inevitable to go through this stage in terms of political reason, which is the institution. Otherwise, the May 5th Constitution Draft was already promulgated according to law and promoted to the public for many years, so why should the May 5th Constitution Draft be fundamentally revised in a short period of time? Taking the assembly itself as an example, in addition to the legal basis of the rules of procedure, it is also necessary to strictly abide by what is shown in the Rudiments of Civil Rights. The Rudiments of Civil Rights is not a "law" in form, but it is the reason that should be followed in the procedure of exercising civil rights. I have no name for this kind of management rule, and I will name it the rule of propriety. Other things, such as signing in for attending the assembly, standing up for the whole body when reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will at the meeting, and the adjournment after the chairman announces the adjournment, are not the rule of law but should be listed in the rule of propriety. Then talk about the rule of man. The rule of man is the rule of virtue. No matter whether it is the rule of law or the rule of propriety, it must be promoted by people. Therefore, the element of the rule of man is also indispensable in the management of things. In other words, although the law is the standard for all things, without the rule of man, it is inevitable to play with the law; although propriety and righteousness are used to seek the appropriateness of all things, without the rule of man, it is impossible to explore the mysteries. In the future, the National Assembly will formulate the constitution, seeking perfection among various difficulties, unwilling to violate the principles of the Political Consultative Conference, in order to show great trust, which is a manifestation of the rule of man. The rule of law, the rule of propriety, and the rule of man are seemingly three legs standing side by side, but in fact they are a trinity. If you add the scientific "instrument-rule", it will definitely have more sufficient effects on managing anything. This is especially true in democratic politics.

For the instrument-rule, one of the legs, to give full play to the effectiveness of democratic politics, it is fully demonstrated in the second assembly, needless to say. However, it still needs to be combined with the rule of law, the rule of propriety, and the rule of man at the same time, so that it can be useful, but it cannot be indispensable. If there is instrument-rule but no rule of law! No matter what your law is, I only regard force as the standard. Science becomes a tool for killing, just like aggressive countries that do not abide by international law and endanger world democracy, which is very obvious. In the first assembly, the installation of loudspeakers solved the difficulty of hearing; if there were no rules of procedure, or if there were rules of procedure but they were not followed; then, several loudspeakers would be placed in all directions, and everyone would rush to speak, each occupying one instrument, fighting each other with sound, and the slightest effect of the loudspeakers would be lost. Similarly, if the chairman violates the statutory voting procedure and submits it to a vote, someone quickly presses the button. If someone finds a procedural error at this time and is seconded by the public, the voting result of this decision, although using the voting machine, the red light is still in front of us and is still invalid. If there is instrument-rule but no rule of propriety; no matter what your reason is, I only use machines to produce, squeeze the assets and blood and sweat of the public; just like capitalist countries that formulate laws to protect the interests of capitalists and despise the democratic principles in the economic aspect, it is also a very obvious thing. In this conference, how many people ignored the reason for the location of the loudspeaker, or used a loud voice, or placed themselves too close, which made the speech delivered to the listeners' ears unclear. I was not used to using this thing at first, and I swung it back and forth on the speaking platform, just like in a classroom, making a big joke. Speaking of the use of voting machines, because it is the first time in China, many people are not used to it. The secretariat specially printed a simple explanation for this and appointed a staff member to explain it orally at the meeting. However, in actual use, some said "press the button," some said "press the bell," and some said "press the voting machine," but they still could not achieve one effect. The reason for these things is one end of the rule in management. Propriety is the appropriateness of things, and new discoveries are made at any time, so we also learn at any time. If there is instrument-rule but no rule of man: the situation is the same as if there is rule of law or rule of propriety but no rule of man. Empty law is ultimately uncertain to act by itself, empty propriety is ultimately insufficient to respond to changes, and empty instrument is ultimately insufficient to talk about democracy and human welfare. In this conference, if someone does not abide by the order of the meeting and uses the loudspeaker to argue, or shouts at the loudspeaker at will, it is better not to have it, it is more peaceful. Although this is my assumption, it can also be seen how important the rule of man is to instruments. Looking at the voting machine again, because each seat is connected, and people who ask for leave and are absent are also common, if someone presses their own button during the vote and then presses the button on the empty seat, there is no way to investigate it. This kind of responsibility must be borne by the individual himself based on moral responsibility. In these situations, although the instrument is used as the rule, it still cannot be separated from the relationship of using people as the rule.

In short, the confusion I had in attending this National Assembly cannot be written completely for a while, and writing this draft is before the formal discussion of the results of the review of the draft constitution. It is inevitable that many feelings will continue to pour into my mind. But to sum it up in one sentence, the most fortunate thing for me in this unprecedented event in thousands of years is nothing more than the understanding and learning of democratic politics.

### The Path to Economic Reform

— Economic Expert Xiao Zheng

The Way to Resolve the Crisis

The current economy is facing a critical juncture. The livelihood of the majority of the people is on the verge of collapse, and the very existence of the nation is at stake. The formation of this actual crisis is indeed comprised of a variety of complex reasons, but the most important factor among them is the destruction of the agricultural economy.

China has undergone thirty-five years of civil war and foreign disasters. The organization of the agricultural economy was destroyed along with the organization of the nation and society, and it has become the most difficult link to restore. What we see today – the widespread decline of industry and commerce, the large number of unemployed in cities, and the national hunger and poverty – are all phenomena that should occur after the destruction of the agricultural economy. Therefore, in discussing China's economic crisis at this stage, we must first focus our attention on agriculture, where the nation's wealth lies, before we can find a fundamental solution.

China is an agricultural country, and the foundation of life upon which the masses depend is agriculture. But today's world is one of highly industrialized production, and the desires of human life can no longer be satisfied by original agricultural production. Therefore, if China wants to catch up with the world, it cannot be done by simply maintaining the original agricultural production. If China is to embark on the road of industry, it must have agriculture that can produce raw materials for industry in large quantities and to a standard. And the two major undertakings that connect agriculture and industry, transportation and water conservancy, are prerequisites for this. Therefore, if the national economy is to start from the root today, it must take the following steps: (1) Change the agricultural system (including the land system) so that agricultural production is in line with the needs of industry. (2) Vigorously build railways and water conservancy to promote basic industries. (3) Promote domestic industry and commerce by improving the lives of farmers (through the construction of rural houses, the manufacture of furniture and agricultural products, etc.). (4) Promote foreign trade by reforming agricultural products. The purpose of these four items is consistent: to promote industry by improving agriculture, to revitalize the bankrupt cities of today by prospering the countryside, and to raise the living standards of the people of the whole country by improving the lives of farmers.

2. Guiding Principles of Economic Reform

In order to save the fate of total economic collapse, the most important thing is to seek national unification and social stability at any cost, so as to restore national and social organizations, and then we can further talk about economic reform. Economic reform must have guiding principles:

The first is to establish a policy. Our highest guiding principle for the economy is, of course, the Principle of People's Livelihood, but how to interpret the Principle of People's Livelihood can easily confuse people. For the sake of clarity and practicality, it should be noted: (1) Our economic path is neither capitalism nor communism, but a regulatoryism that focuses on economic harmony. Therefore, all our economic measures must be based on the two major policies of regulating capital and equalizing land ownership, which are based on regulatoryism, otherwise we will go astray. (2) Our business methods should be neither liberalism nor totalitarianism, but planned economy based on regulatoryism. The anarchy of production and distribution in liberalism and the suffocation of production and the bureaucratization of distribution in totalitarianism are both common diseases for those who know. We should adopt a planned economy that includes the strengths of both free economy and totalitarian economy, so as to catch up with the new economic path of the world. (3) Our business entities should be neither purely state-owned nor purely private-owned, but a mixed public-private system that combines both. Purely state-owned will lead to communism. Purely private-owned is capitalism. We must classify enterprises as state-owned or private-owned according to the size of the business scope, the severity of the nature, and whether there is a monopoly. We must use state-owned enterprises to lead private enterprises, and use private enterprises to assist state-owned enterprises. These policies are the first prerequisite for economic reform, and also the guiding light for saving the current economic crisis.

The second is to establish policies. The economy is the whole picture of the national economy and the people's livelihood, and economic policy is the body of national policy. Therefore, economic policy can be divided into the activity goals of each department of the economy, and combined into a national policy. Since our national policy is the Three Principles of the People, our economic policy is the policy for implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. Therefore: (1) We must focus on seeking the equal sufficiency of the people's livelihood and establish land policy, labor policy and financial policy. In other words, the three major elements of economic production, land, labor and capital, must be placed under a consistent policy to achieve the goal of equal sufficiency of the people's livelihood. (2) We must focus on expanding production and establish agricultural policy, industrial policy, trade policy and transportation policy. All measures in agriculture, industry, commerce, transportation and transportation must be concentrated on a unified goal, and production must be expanded as much as possible in the short term by all possible means in order to save our economic crisis. (3) We must focus on fair distribution and establish social policy and fiscal policy. The expansion of production will not cause distortion in distribution, which lies in the full play of social policy and fiscal policy. The coordinated development of these economic policies is a national policy.

3. Specific Implementation of Economic Reform

For economic reform, we must not only present guiding principles, but also determine a practical implementation method in order to truly eliminate the current economic crisis. I advocate:

First, establish a planned economic system. (1) Determine the highest authority for implementing the planned economy. (2) In line with the needs of national economic construction, gradually implement the inventory of human, material and financial resources, and determine a forecasting system for the close cooperation of human, material and financial resources. (3) Divide the country into seven economic zones: Southeast, Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, North China, Central China, and South China. Set up supervisory agencies to fully develop the characteristics of the economy in each region according to the overall construction plan, and adjust the facilities of agriculture, mining, industry and commerce in each region according to the needs of national defense. (4) Stipulate the minimum amount of production of each item in each region within a certain year, and determine the method of transportation and distribution. (5) All measures for transportation, finance, taxation, and labor management should be reconfigured and adjusted according to the needs of the preceding paragraph.

Second, make the implementation of agricultural land reform and the construction of a new agricultural system the center of the planned economy: (1) Complete the agricultural land reform in Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Northern Shaanxi, and Shandong, Hebei, and the Nine Provinces of the East within three years, so that agricultural land is transferred to self-cultivating farmers. Expand the fields with the cooperative farming system and gradually implement mechanized farming. (2) The agricultural land reform and the new agricultural system in the remaining areas of the country should be gradually promoted in different regions according to the methods in the preceding article. Develop special agricultural products and adjust their defects. (3) The surplus labor force after the implementation of agricultural land reform and the new agricultural system should be transferred to the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest regions. All their houses, tools, seeds, and fertilizers should be purchased and prepared by the state in advance, and a ordering system should be implemented to alleviate the current industry and commerce. (4) The land funds after the implementation of agricultural land reform, that is, the land price recovered from the landowners' income, should be guided by the state to invest in public-owned enterprises, and the principal and interest should be guaranteed so that the landowner class gradually becomes industrial and commercial entrepreneurs.

Third, based on the implementation of the new agricultural system, plan the development of industry, mining, trade, transportation and other undertakings and strictly implement them. (1) Based on the implementation of the new agricultural system, estimate the required amount of machinery, fertilizers, houses, furniture, etc., and the state will place orders (limited to domestic) so that all related industries and businesses will immediately begin active production. (2) Based on the implementation of the new agricultural system, reconfigure transportation, finance and other public facilities. The state will immediately start building roads, dredging rivers, reclaiming wasteland, building houses and other work, so that the surplus labor force will be fully employed and the obligatory labor force will be fully utilized. (3) Based on the increased production volume obtained after the implementation of the new agricultural system, plan processing and manufacturing and prepare its supply of electricity, oil, coal and machinery. (4) Plan the amount of import and export trade based on the new production volume, and plan the warehouse transportation equipment of the domestic distribution market and guide the people to operate it.

Fourth, plan the source of funds for implementing the planned economy and stabilize the quota for currency issuance: (1) The expenses for the first two years of implementing the plan should be absorbed by fundraising, public bonds, foreign debts and incentives for investment to supply idle funds. (All state-owned railways, mines, farms, factories, etc. are allowed to have a certain proportion of private shares. Such private shares should also be guaranteed principal and interest.) (2) After the implementation of the plan, increase production volume as the capital for reproduction. (3) The issuance of legal currency should determine the quota before the implementation of the planned economy, and thereafter it should only be increased in proportion to the increase in production.

### How to Establish a Reasonable Relationship Between Science and Politics

— Researcher at the Academia Sinica and Director of the Geological Survey, Jiu Zan Dong

Beacon fires fill the sky, and smoke and clouds obscure the sun. A picture of clear skies, bright sunshine, and a beautiful spring is still a hundred and eight thousand miles away from reality. I hope that the thirty-six-year-old Republic of China will complete these hundred and eight thousand miles as quickly as a somersault cloud!

Modern politics affects the life and work of every individual, and scientists are certainly no exception. The content of politics is complex and multifaceted, and many departments require the participation of various experts and generalists in the design and execution. Scientists must also actively participate in politics, and even occupy a decision-making position in certain undertakings, in order to solve problems and ensure the smooth progress of undertakings. In today's world, there is a close relationship between science and politics. If the relationship between the two is brought into a regular and reasonable state, the result will be enlightened politics and developed science. If it is not brought into a regular and reasonable state, the result will be chaotic politics and the inability to advance science. To establish a reasonable relationship between the two, there must be a transcendent, independent scientific review and decision-making advisory body.

Scientists refer specifically to people who are actually engaged in scientific research, excluding those who have a scientific background but have later changed careers. For the convenience of writing, they are simply referred to as scientists. This should be stated first.

Scientific Freedom vs. Scientific Political Participation

A major feature of modern politics is the unprecedented expansion of government power. In ancient times, governments could govern by doing nothing, and making the people live and work in peace and contentment without disturbing them was the highest goal of governing the country. In modern times, human life has become increasingly complex, and the scope of activities has become increasingly broad. Since politics is the management of public affairs, the aspects that need to be managed are increasing day by day. Nowadays, the duties of the government include everything. Therefore, the situation of being unable to cope with certain matters has gradually occurred. The most obvious example is the legislation, execution, and evaluation of scientific research undertakings themselves. This major event cannot be handled by ordinary government agencies, and it is necessary to find other ways to solve it. The only reasonable way is scientific self-governance or scientists' autonomy. Scientists manage their own research undertakings themselves, without being strongly interfered with by outsiders. In other words, "return science to scientists," so that scientists have freedom, and with freedom, they can fully exert their strength and move forward smoothly.

Naturally, scientists are also citizens at the same time. Their ordinary behavior is subject to the sanctions of laws and orders like other citizens, and there can be no violation of regulations in any way. Only in the professional field of scientific research should the government grant scientists a high degree of autonomy, so that they can fully exert their spirit of independence and autonomy when deciding on directions, choosing routes, and carrying out work.

The government has the necessity to promote science, but does not have the knowledge required to interfere with scientific research. Unfortunately, things happen because of this: it can use the promotion as a pretext to implement control. This is what scientists are unwilling to endure. However, because they are law-abiding and well-educated, they have to swallow their anger and endure humiliation under strong control. Their ambitions cannot be realized, and they are depressed all their lives. In this situation of bad environment and low morale, even if they can barely work, the harvest will certainly not be abundant. In more enlightened countries such as Britain and the United States, from our point of view, the actions of politics interfering with science have been very weak, but scholars in those countries still often loudly call for the hand of politics to leave science. The large-scale scientific promotion association also regards "only scientists are qualified to manage scientists" as one of the goals of the movement. In 1944, Lyons wrote the history of the Royal Society of England, saying: There were many non-scientist members in the Society in the eighteenth century, and the progress of the Society's affairs was greatly hindered. After 1820, the control of the Society gradually fell into the hands of scientists, and the progress of the Society's affairs became smoother day by day.

Why should the government not manage scientific research through ordinary political personnel? Politicians have different viewpoints, different styles, and cannot deeply understand the current situation and desirable development of science. Their management of science is prone to the following problems. (1) Ignoring basic pure research, adopting short-sightedness, seeking shortcuts, and unilaterally promoting applied science. This is still good. (2) Even not knowing the existence and importance of a certain science at all and not paying attention to it at all. (3) Improper use of talent. There are talents and slaves. Among talents, there are specialized talents and general talents. Slaves please people and are easily used, thus causing mistakes. Specialized talents and general talents are suitable for different positions. If they are not in the right position, they will reduce efficiency and cannot give full play to their strengths. (4) Improper decision-making, and it is difficult for the budget to achieve a reasonable allocation. Recently, Mr. Jing Xi said: "Deciding on the use from a political point of view or for administrative convenience, they (referring to administrative personnel) cannot use this fund according to the actual needs of science in our country." As early as the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the China Science Society made a formal declaration on the handling of the Boxer Indemnity, calling for the establishment of an independent committee whose members should be completely detached from political and diplomatic relations, which was also aimed at this problem.

The government's non-interference in scientific research undertakings does not mean ignoring it. On the contrary, the government should actively promote it, pass a high percentage of the budget, and hand over a large amount of funds to the committee composed of scientists for free disposal, so that all scientific institutions and organizations can receive appropriate funding to engage in the work they should do and are capable of doing. If scientists demand academic autonomy, and the government not only refuses to accept it magnanimously, but instead harbors resentment, reduces or stops funding, or even threatens their safety, they lose two necessary freedoms - freedom from want and freedom from fear - the result is that work is suspended, life is insecure, and life is not guaranteed. The sacrifice of individuals is not a pity, but the future of the country is unimaginable.

The field of politics is vast; the duties of the government are also complex and multifaceted. Some undertakings require a high degree of scientific knowledge in the design and execution. This knowledge is not possessed by ordinary political families and entrepreneurs. If scientists are not invited to participate or mastermind the matter, even if it does not completely fail, it will be half the effort. Therefore, in enlightened politics and progressive governments, there must be an institution for scientific consultation and design elected by the people. Through this institution, the government can obtain valuable opinions from experts and scholars. The more closely related the problem is to science, the more it is necessary to listen to the opinions of scientists. Furthermore, some matters can simply completely rely on their suggestions, and the government honestly executes them as they are.

Fortunately, our government has gradually realized the preciousness of the opinions of scientific workers in recent years, and has reached out for help on some issues. But the shortcoming is that it often does not know what kind of experts are needed, whether there are suitable talents in the country, or knowingly does not use them, and only seeks advice from guest officials. Not using talents from one's own country, but preferring to spend a lot of money to rely on foreigners, thus creating the danger of the guest overwhelming the host. Foreigners know one's own affairs like the back of their hand, while one's own people are ignorant and know nothing. It cannot be said that it is not a very dangerous thing. Even if it is said that a certain work really has the need to ask foreigners for help, if it is not selected by learned scholars, it may be difficult to get a person with suitable qualifications. As for science with great local characteristics, foreigners who come to China for the first time cannot find their way around for a while. If they are suddenly entrusted with a heavy responsibility and complete the work carelessly, wouldn't it be even more abnormal? All of the above illustrates how necessary it is to establish an institution for government consultation.

The Central Institution of Scientific Undertakings

Scientific research and the promotion of the entire academic undertaking require a truly national decision-making, review and recommendation institution, as mentioned above. So, what is the organization of this institution? What is the task? If the country has the appropriate development of various subjects, avoid unnecessary duplication, and strive to ensure that the energy of the existing small number of talents is not wasted. Second, investigate and count the existing talents, so that they can each be in their own position. Estimate future needs and provide plans for cultivating talents, so that various undertakings are coordinated with relevant education. For emerging sciences that are not staffed, seek appropriate schools or institutions to cultivate or train them. Third, decide on the major plans for scientific undertakings, such as research directions, cooperation methods, and the increase, decrease, expansion, reduction, or merger of institutions. Fourth, provide consultation to the government and automatically make suggestions to the government. This institution, which covers the whole country, maintains close ties with various institutions and organizations at all times, so that scholars from all places and sciences have the opportunity to contribute to the country.

Currently, there are two national academic review institutions in our country: one is the Central Research Institute's Review Committee, and the other is the Ministry of Education's Academic Review Committee. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ding Wenjiang, the general director of the Central Research Institute, organized the Review Committee according to the Institute's regulations. His original intention was to form it into a national academic decision-making review institution. Although the Review Committee meets every year, and the selection of reviewers is generally satisfactory, it is a pity that it cannot fulfill its proper responsibilities due to various constraints. The matters evaluated are either limited to the Institute, or related to the whole country but lack the strength to promote, resulting in empty words and no effect. The Academic Review Committee was organized by the Ministry of Education a few years ago. The members of the committee are all appointed by the ministry. In terms of personnel selection, it is not as cautious as the Review Committee, which is elected. In terms of business, the scope of the Review Committee is also too narrow. Even if there are sound personnel, it is difficult to take on the task of promoting health throughout the country.

Since our country needs a decision-making institution, and there are now two nominal organizations, how should we solve it? There are three possible solutions. (1) Since the existing two committees cannot complete their missions, another institution has to be established. The existing two committees are either cancelled or exclusively in charge of the affairs of their respective institutes and ministries. (2) The existing two committees coexist, and the two parties agree to divide the work and cooperate. (3) One of the existing organizations is retained and the other is abolished, and one of them is responsible for the overall planning of national academic affairs. Under the current situation, we believe that the third option is more feasible, and advocate that the Central Research Institute's Review Committee should shoulder this major task. First, because the Review Committee's responsibilities should be like this according to the regulations. Second, the selection of reviewers is more cautious. Third, the Research Institute itself is the highest institution in the country and includes the most disciplines. It is very appropriate for it to convene meetings and use its general office as a place for communication and assembly.

If we adopt the Review Committee, we obviously cannot be satisfied with its current situation. We must effectively improve it: enrich the personnel, expand the powers, and strengthen the liaison with various academic institutions. The most important thing is that the government must give it the power to freely dispose of a large amount of special funds for academic research, so that it has the power and ability to fulfill its responsibilities well. With the expansion of the Review Committee's powers, the original number of reviewers, about 30 people, is too small, and should be appropriately increased. The election method should also be re-established. The current reviewers are not all scholars who are actually working, and cannot be regarded as having entered the regular. If the vast majority of accomplished scholars in the country are allowed to participate in the election, they will definitely be able to elect reviewers who truly care about the future of academic affairs and form a sound, substantial, fair and active Review Committee. This is what we urgently hope for.

Beacon fires fill the sky, and smoke and clouds obscure the sun. A picture of clear skies, bright sunshine, and a beautiful spring is still ten thousand miles away from reality. However, people cannot be without hope, and without hope is equivalent to no life. We hope that the thirty-six-year-old Republic of China will complete these hundred and eight thousand miles as quickly as a somersault cloud.

### Self-Confidence and Self-Knowledge

— Paleontologist Yang Zhongjian

The completion of a self-confident aspiration cannot rely on luck, let alone on scheming and infighting, or any other improper means; rather, it relies on self-knowledge, on one's own true abilities. An extra measure of ability equates to an extra measure of accomplishment. This is just like a machine, horsepower cannot be forced.

Speaking of the individual, self-confidence is a virtue. In all living things, including us humans, it seems that the creator emphasizes the growth and prosperity of the entire species, rather than each individual. Look at the way each species propagates, all fearing that the species will not survive, using every means to increase their numbers greatly. If there were no losses, and they were allowed to develop naturally, the whole world could be occupied by that one species in the shortest amount of time. But that is impossible. How many individuals of each species are destroyed by being unsuited to the natural environment, such as enemies and disasters. Nature's creation only seeks the survival of the species, never considering the safety of the individual. As long as a few in the vast majority can achieve the goal of propagation, it is considered satisfactory. But for each individual, they all want to use every means to survive. If it is a higher form of life, like us humans, then not only do we want to survive, but also to survive very comfortably. Not only do we want to survive very comfortably, but also to seek satisfaction in other aspects beyond survival. Such as a lofty position, superior power, etc. Therefore, some individuals cannot help but have a degree of self-confidence. The starting point of self-confidence can be said to be setting goals. Set a goal and move towards it. Striving, competing, enduring hardship are all for the sake of achieving the set goal. "What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I? Anyone who strives can be like him." This is setting a goal, which is also self-confidence. It is that each individual must have the ambition to consider themselves extraordinary. If this individual can succeed, the result of their development will often conflict with other individuals of the same species. The so-called "one general succeeds, ten thousand bones wither" is the rationale for this. However, speaking not of the entire species, if a few individuals in Taiwan can flourish, it will also achieve the purpose of the overall flourishing of the species. For example, people from various countries who win the Nobel Prize are mostly white, so people naturally treat white people differently, and inevitably look down on other people of color. Therefore, I consider self-confidence to be a virtue, even though it requires sacrificing other individuals, it does not conflict with the overall flourishing of the species or group.

I now want to further elaborate on this human sense of self-confidence. As long as a person is physically healthy and physiologically normal, there is no one who does not want to improve, no one without desires, which means no one without self-confidence. Moreover, desires are often endless, always wanting to go further. First, they deal with hunger and cold for survival, and when the problem of living is solved, they want fame and position. Once the fame and position they want is obtained, they want even higher fame and position. But this is a very dangerous thing. Because you want to improve, and so does he; you want fame and position, and so does he. Careers are limited, fame and position are limited, and the result is that conflicts of interest, selfishness, and attacking or undermining others are inevitable. As a result, many bad habits of mankind are produced. Therefore, although self-confidence is said to be a virtue, in its extreme evolution, it turns the human world into a place where only one can survive, harming each other, and full of deception and suspicion.

If we talk about creatures other than humans, there is no such thing as suicide or self-harm. Many creatures, when food is insufficient, eat their own kind, or even mothers eat their children, which is common. But after all, they are creatures, not people. The reason why humans are humans naturally has characteristics that are different from other creatures. Within a certain scope, one must fight for oneself, but also consider the struggles of others, so there are virtues such as mutual concession and mutual assistance, which are not discussed in detail in this article.

There is also an important fact that prevents human self-confidence from developing without limit. People's dispositions are different, their environments are different, their educations are different, and their abilities to do things are also different, so naturally the achievements they should obtain cannot be the same. That is, there are many lofty positions, but not everyone can do them well or manage them smoothly. If one does not consider everything, but relies solely on self-confidence or even special connections to obtain a better position that exceeds one's own abilities, then the result will inevitably be failure for the individual, and for the group, the more such situations there are, the more the group's career will naturally not succeed, but will completely collapse.

Based on the above reasons, I would like to raise a second question, which is self-knowledge. Self-knowledge is to understand oneself. Although there are many good things in the world, with a short life, it is impossible to do them all one by one. Although there are many high positions in the world, one must see whether one's own abilities can handle them, so as not to mislead oneself and mislead others. The condition for self-knowledge should first be self-confidence. Believe in oneself and what one can do, and what one cannot do. If it is something one cannot do, but insists on doing it based on self-confidence, then of course it will not succeed, and of course it will interfere with other people's affairs, which is not good for anyone, and the result is self-suffering.

Why do I want to talk about the principles of self-confidence and self-knowledge here? I feel that there are too many self-confident people in our country now, and too few self-aware people. The anxieties about national affairs are one of the reasons, and it can even be said to be a major reason.

Almost everyone admits that the ability of our people to do things is too poor. With the same manpower and doing the same things, we are always not as good as foreigners. In foreign institutions, on the surface, very few people are used, but things are pushed very smoothly. Even in the gatehouse, their large institutions only have one person on duty, but everything is handled. In many of our institutions, there are three or four people in one gatehouse, but things are still not running smoothly. This naturally has other reasons, but the ability of our people is really inferior to others, which is undeniable. The paleontology department of the Natural History Museum only has one woman. She manages the library in the laboratory, manages the registration of specimens, manages the revision and proofreading of all the articles in the laboratory, and also goes to the main library every week to select new reference books for everyone to read. If these things were done in China, it would take at least five people, and it would not necessarily be done better than she can do alone.

Speaking of household affairs from a higher position, when we compare the people in each of our institutions with those in comparable institutions, we know that the quality of our people is really inferior to others. In other words, we are very self-confident in the positions we have obtained, but we have not fully understood ourselves. I think that in our country now, from top to bottom, anyone in any profession who can be competent and who is praised for their work, although it cannot be said that there is none, in reality only occupies a pitiful minority. From a typist in an institution to the head of the institution himself, this phenomenon exists. Yet we still only hear many people dissatisfied and unwilling to accept their position, and still want to climb up. As a result, the higher they climb, the harder they fall. It doesn't matter if individuals fall, at most it is a sacrifice of the individual, but in a country, if most government offices, or every structure, are filled with incompetent people, then can the country still have hope?

I think at least some people become blind because they are too self-confident, and they inevitably think that they are very self-aware and have a feeling of "If I don't come out, what will happen to the people!" or "If not me, who else?". Everyone wants to climb up, without considering their own abilities. As a result, in addition to causing phenomena such as infighting and competition, personnel changes have also become commonplace. It is rare to see a person who can have a long history in a fixed position. Because everyone admires people who can climb up, they not only do not hate those who are promoted to one position today and changed to another position tomorrow, but instead envy them. If they have the opportunity, they can also do the same. In this way, things become more difficult to manage, and one only sees the floating and sinking of the official sea in the form of promotion, but one does not see the progress of real careers.

For example, no matter how high a person's talent is or how great their ability is, they resign as chairman of a certain organization today and can be a minister of a certain department tomorrow. Or today they are a prominent figure in the military, and tomorrow they want to compete with specialists for resources and study water conservancy. I dare to believe that they cannot do anything well. In China, once an official becomes powerful, it seems that they become omnipotent and know everything. These people are fundamentally ignorant, so how can they be blamed for not being self-aware! Also, for example, the representatives in the recently opened National Assembly, these are people who represent the people, who want to discuss the major laws and seek the welfare of the country, and of course there are many who we admire. But I am afraid that there are also many of them who, if they ask themselves who they represent, whether their own cultivation, knowledge, political morality can be compared with the people's representatives or political figures of advanced countries without shame, I am afraid that they will find it difficult to express their feelings. Furthermore, various parties and factions are competing for political power and for democracy, wanting to make the country better. This, whether from the individual or from the political party, is a kind of self-confidence, which cannot be criticized, but these people should also examine themselves, how is their own morality and ability. If they do not have the grace of self-knowledge, and rashly come to power, even if they can take pleasure for a while, what if they end up in disgrace? What if this leads to a revolving-door revolution where no one is satisfied with anyone who comes to power?

From another perspective, I can only talk about my own experience. Paleontology is only a natural science in science, and what I have been engaged in over the years is only the vertebrate department. But I already feel that it is vast and boundless, and my own ability cannot fully understand it. When I was forty years old, I happened to discover some fossils in Yunnan. To the best of my ability, I could not distinguish whether they were mammals or reptiles, so in my forty-year self-mocking couplet, there was a sentence "Remembering bones for twenty years, unable to distinguish reptiles from mammals," to blame myself. In the eyes of ordinary people, you have been studying bone fossils for twenty years, but you still cannot distinguish what is a reptile and what is a mammal, you are of course useless. But I can only admit and blame myself, and only feel that my ability is poor. But therefore, I also suspect that the work of others, and human intelligence, will not differ much, especially political science and political activities, which are not much easier than natural science. (Of course, as an American friend once told me, Americans who cannot do anything in the East or West, and cannot stir up anything, then stir up politics. This can only be used as a kind of satire.) However, some people who are about the same age as me have now become prominent figures. I am very suspicious of them, that even if they work hard, they are not necessarily like me who cannot distinguish reptiles from mammals, and treat what doctrine as what doctrine, let alone that some of them have not fully enriched themselves, so how can they talk about developing great strategies and responding to the great cause of national construction!

China is now one of the five great powers, but it is barely so, which has been generally recognized. But when we investigate the reason, in my opinion, it is very simple. The things that everyone is responsible for are barely so, and are things that they are incompetent to do, but are barely holding the position, so this phenomenon is created, and we are one of the barely five great powers!

Now most of the well-known people in the country have their fame and position already exceeding their abilities. This is because China is lagging behind in everything, and there is a scarcity of talent, so a little bit of recognition brings both fame and fortune. Speaking of the individual, it can be said that they are blessed by heaven. As Mr. Yu Youren has a poem saying, "The body is not prosperous in the world to inherit the new destiny." This so-called new destiny can be interpreted as China's lack of talent. These people should conscientiously devote themselves to their current work, knowing that the position they have obtained does not rely on their own ability, but comes from China's national conditions. On the one hand, they should work hard to enrich themselves, so that their ability and position are both compatible, and they are worthy of it. Then the country will gradually get on track, and there will be hope. If they are still not satisfied, they will not only be sorry for the country, but also for themselves, harming others and not benefiting themselves. I advise these people to be self-aware. As for the general young people, and people in unimportant positions, I still hope that they can be self-confident, but self-confidence is not empty talk. The completion of this self-confident aspiration cannot rely on luck, let alone on scheming and infighting, or other improper means, but must rely on self-knowledge, and on one's own true abilities. An extra point of ability equates to an extra point of achievement. This is true for learning, and it should be true for doing things as well. This is just like a machine, horsepower cannot be forced. If there is not enough horsepower, one will still not be able to travel safely on the path of life's struggle. Self-quality and self-knowledge are not contradictory. But if both aspects are taken into account, the country will have hope in everything, talents will be used to their fullest, people will be secure in their positions, and the effectiveness of the work will naturally be promoted.

### New Era, New Mission - Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics Headquarters

— Huang Zhenqiu

The arrival of the new era of the Republic of China in the thirty-sixth year signifies that the historical mission of this stage has descended even more urgently on the shoulders of the military and civilians across the country.

First, the lofty aspiration of the Chinese Kuomintang to return power to the people was achieved with the successful conclusion of last year's National Assembly. In order to formulate a democratic constitution, the government, with the greatest tolerance, openly and honestly engaged with all parties and factions, and society to jointly research and develop it. This constitution undoubtedly reflects the will of the majority of people in the country, so except for a few who have other motives, it should win the support of the majority of people. Democratic politics is about constitution-making and constitutionalism. Constitution-making is extremely important, but constitutionalism is even more important. If constitutionalism cannot be practiced, or is practiced improperly, then even a perfect constitution becomes a reflection in the water or a flower in the mirror, a mere empty check, or an embellishment to decorate the facade. Therefore, constitutionalism is the biggest task of the people across the country this year, and within this year, we must see the beginnings and the achievements of whether the constitution can be practiced properly. As the saying goes, "One who travels a hundred miles is half way at ninety." As a Western proverb also says, "It must have a good beginning." As such, the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China is truly a test of whether our country can implement democracy, in other words, it is a test of whether we can follow the trend of the world and join the ranks of the powerful nations.

Second, the foundation of constitutionalism lies in the unity and stability of the country, and the unity and stability of the country is closely related to the premise that the army belongs to the state. The opinion of the majority is built on the interests of the majority. The opinion of the majority is made into laws, and even if the minority does not agree, they should obey. While the minority should be allowed to engage in political struggle, they are absolutely not allowed to organize an army of a certain group outside the national army, using guns and the flesh and blood of the people as tools for political struggle. If unfortunately there are people who believe in force, then that is against constitutionalism. In order to strive for the foundation of constitutionalism, we must strive for the nationalization of the army. The theory of nationalization of the army has been talked about for a long time, but to this day, in addition to the national army, there are still illegal armed forces that divide the country and slaughter the people. In this situation, can the constitution be implemented? Can democratic politics get on track? Since this new era is the year of constitutionalism, the difficult problem of nationalization of the army must be resolved this year. I hope that those who believe in using force to seize power can take the people's hearts as their own and the country's blessings as their own, gracefully change their ways, and return power to the people and the army to the state.

Third, in this world war, democratic countries only won the war, but have not yet won the peace. The idea of aggression and plunder still remains in the minds of ambitious countries, not only has it not been eradicated, but there are still signs of revival. An unprecedented large-scale spiritual war is underway, and no one can guarantee that the current sparks will not cause a prairie fire. Under this situation, in order to ensure the survival of our country and nation, national defense construction must be urgently pursued. The organization and plan of our new national defense were established last year under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, Minister Bai Chongxi, and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng. However, the situation is urgent, and the implementation of the new national defense construction cannot be delayed. At the beginning of the new era, the military and civilians of the country should accept Chairman Chiang's instructions and work together with one heart. When we talk about national defense, we cannot ignore industry, which is the mother of national defense. After the victory of the war of resistance, the reconstruction has been going on for years, and the state of our country's industry is distressing. Industrial equipment in the Northeast was looted in a planned manner, industrial areas in special regions were largely destroyed, and most of the industries taken over have been shut down. If industry is like this, how can national defense be discussed? Therefore, we know that the efforts of our government and people to reorganize and build industry, and to overcome the various obstacles in the process, must begin simultaneously with the start of the new year, so that the survival of the country and nation can be guaranteed.

We focus on "political democratization," "nationalization of the army," and "industrial national defense." The thirty-sixth year is actually one of the most urgent years in the post-war situation, and it is also the year when our mission is the most serious and arduous. The military and civilians of the country must have this awareness and effort!

### National Top Ten News (Continued from First Page)

(V) Recapturing Zhangjiakou

The Battle of Zhangjiakou was caused by the Battle of Datong. The Communist army had been attacking Datong since mid-July. The Nationalist army in the city fought hard to defend it, but the Communist army failed to capture it after two months. At this time, the Nationalist army in eastern Rehe and Hebei, and western Suiyuan, in order to support the war in Datong and rescue the besieged city, launched offensives in different directions towards Zhangjiakou from September 1, to divert the Communist forces besieging Datong.

Zhangjiakou was the actual political and military center of the Communists after the end of the war. During the War of Resistance, everyone knew that the headquarters of the Communists was in Yan'an, but after the end of the war, the Communists gradually moved some of their institutions and personnel to Zhangjiakou. Zhangjiakou has been a vital military stronghold in the north since ancient times, capable of both offense and defense, and geographically covering the entire situation in Northeast and North China, unlike Yan'an, which is located in a remote corner; especially the abundance of its products, which Yan'an, with its barren land and poor people, could not hope to match. The Communists were naturally determined to defend this new nerve center of their own.

This battle for Zhangjiakou lasted for a month and a half from the beginning of September, and on October 11, the Nationalist army recaptured Zhangjiakou.

Militarily, this was a great blow to the Communists. At the same time, it made the Communists realize the unreliability of seizing power by force. If the Communists had not attacked Datong, the Nationalist army would not have needed to attack Zhangjiakou; if everyone could faithfully abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and not use force to solve problems, then this blood would not have had to be shed in vain. As General Fu Zuoyi, who led the troops into Zhangjiakou, said: "Although we won the battle, there is only grief, not joy," because the government absolutely does not want to see the country it governs full of soldiers.

(VI) National Assembly

When the top ten news stories were being selected, the National Assembly was still in progress. Now, the assembly has successfully concluded, and the first constitution in the history of the Chinese nation! Has also been formulated. This will certainly become the biggest event of the past year, and can also be said to be the biggest event since the Xinhai Revolution.

The National Assembly was held in Nanjing on November 15, with Wu Jingheng as chairman. Chairman Chiang of the National Government also attended and gave a speech, encouraging the representatives to complete their sacred mission. Preparatory meetings were held from the 18th, electing 46 members of the presidium and drafting the rules of procedure for the assembly. The formal assembly was held from the 25th, discussing the rules of procedure. At the third assembly on the 28th, Chairman Chiang, on behalf of the government, solemnly handed over the draft constitution to Hu Shi, the chairman of the assembly. Afterwards, the representatives made extensive statements on various aspects of the draft constitution in the assembly, and organized various group review committees to summarize the opinions of the representatives and discuss them separately. At the same time, the comprehensive review committee was responsible for the overall collation and research. Among them, issues such as the proper name of the state in Article 1, the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, the powers of the National Assembly, and whether officials could also serve as representatives, etc., aroused fierce debate. In the end, thanks to Chairman Chiang's magnanimous appeal and the representatives' ability to work together harmoniously and make concessions for the sake of the country, agreements were reached on all articles under extremely democratic and progressive principles. On December 20, the first reading of the constitution was completed. The second reading was completed from the 21st to the 24th. On the 25th, the third reading was passed, and Yu Youren, chairman of the 20th assembly, put it to a vote. The entire audience stood up and applauded, cheering in unison and shouting "Long live the Republic of China." In the afternoon of the 25th, the closing ceremony was held, and Chairman Wu Jingheng solemnly handed over the passed draft constitution to Chairman Chiang of the National Government. The assembly lasted for forty days, and this solemn and sacred constitutional work was completed. The assembly decided to implement the constitution on December 25, 1947.

(VII) Opening of Foreign Exchange

On February 25, the Supreme National Defense Council passed the plan to open the foreign exchange market and abolished the official foreign exchange rate. At the same time, the closing ceremony passed the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade and the Provisional Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange.

This was a necessary measure after the end of the war and the hope for the resumption of import and export trade. The old exchange rate of 20 to 1 had long been nominal. Everyone knew that 20 yuan of legal tender could not be exchanged for one US dollar, but because the external transportation during the war had been completely cut off, and there was no international trade in goods except for the import of military supplies, there was no urgent need for adjustment. After the victory of the war, this issue immediately attracted close attention from the government and the financial and industrial circles. Many domestic experts have written articles to discuss how the exchange rate should be determined. This matter is extremely important, because if it is set too high, the industrial and commercial circles will certainly agree, because in this way the US dollars exchanged for goods will be valuable, and the export volume will inevitably increase, while foreign goods will not be able to exchange for much US dollars after they are shipped to China, which is not worthwhile, so the import of goods will inevitably decrease, indirectly allowing the domestic industry and commerce to prosper. But for the general public, they have been overwhelmed by the prices manipulated by the nouveau riche and hoarders for eight years, and they hope that the foreign exchange rate can be set low so that a large number of American goods can come in to lower the prices. These two different positions cannot but be revealed.

The government weighed the gains and losses of both sides, cautiously handled the matter, and finally decided on February 25 to abolish the official exchange rate, and the Central Bank officially listed the exchange rate as 2020.

The opening of the foreign exchange market is also the opening of import and export trade. This is certainly a very important thing for the national economy after the war.

(VIII) Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo Assassinated

Li Gongpu, a member of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, was assassinated and killed in Kunming on the evening of July 11. A suspect, Li Chengye, was caught on the spot, but Li firmly denied it, and no weapons were found on him. At 5:30 p.m. on the 15th, Wen Yiduo, a professor at Southwest Associated University in Kunming, was shot by thugs on the street after attending Li Gongpu's memorial service and died despite rescue efforts. Various speculations arose about the two cases. Chairman Chiang was very concerned when he heard the news and ordered the military and political authorities in the province to arrest the real murderers as soon as possible. At the same time, the Lower House also sent letters to the provincial and municipal governments to declare their responsibility to protect the lives, safety, and freedom of all people, and sent the Director of the Police Department to Kunming to supervise the investigation and arrest. Later, the Chairman sent Gu Zhutong to Kunming to handle the Li and Wen cases in full. After Gu arrived in Kunming and conducted a detailed investigation, he arrested the real murderer of the Wen case and learned that the criminals, Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan, were active-duty soldiers. On the 15th, they heard Wen Yiduo's speech at Li Gongpu's memorial service, which slandered soldiers. After the meeting, they were angry for a moment and shot Wen to death with a pistol. The case was thus clarified. The two criminals were sentenced to death by a military court and executed by firing squad on August 26. As for the Li case, it is still under strict investigation.

(IX) Import and Export Permit System

Since the end of the war, the most urgent task for China's recovery has been to obtain materials to replenish the consumption and shortage of the eight years of the War of Resistance. Therefore, in the year after the end of the war, a large number of imported materials were shipped in, and the relief materials from UNRRA were also continuously imported. Under this situation, the materials controlled by the government have reached a considerable quantity. In order to cooperate with the country's established economic policy and support the domestic industrial and commercial enterprises, the government announced 18 amendments to the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade on the 17th, implementing the permit system for import and export goods.

Under this new method, all goods can be freely exported, except for the nine major categories of special minerals, rice, wheat, etc. that are prohibited from export. As for the import of goods, except for the 40 major categories that are prohibited from import, the rest should apply for import permits in advance.

In other words, it is to encourage exports and control imports to a considerable extent. In order to implement this system and coordinate the work of various institutions related to import and export, the government established a temporary import management committee under the Supreme Economic Council to conduct overall management.

Of course, the implementation of the import permit system has not fully achieved the goal of encouraging domestic production and seeking a balance between import and export, because there are many factors in this regard that cannot be solved by one thing. But in any case, the import permit system has indeed stimulated the development of export trade and has considerably curbed some of the excessive black market for US dollars.

(X) Chen Gongbo Case

Traitors must die! Especially the number one traitor—the acting "chairman" of the puppet "National Government"?

In March, when the grass was growing in Jiangnan, the high court in Suzhou was solemnly settling accounts with this major traitor who wanted to escape to a "friendly country" but was caught and brought back.

"Chen Gongbo conspired against the enemy country and plotted to rebel against his own country. He is sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life. All his property, except for a reasonable amount to retain for the necessary living expenses of his family, is confiscated."

The endless confessions cannot cover up his crimes. His evils are obvious. Please see the ten major crimes of the traitor Chen announced by the court:

(1) Concluding secret treaties that humiliate the country and forfeit its sovereignty

(2) Searching for materials to supply the enemy

(3) Issuing counterfeit currency to disrupt the financial system

(4) Recognizing the enemy as father and declaring war

(5) Conscripting strong men to serve the enemy

(6) Publicly selling opium to poison the people

(7) Revising textbooks to implement enslavement education

(8) Using the pretext of clearing the countryside to harm patriots

(9) Officials are corrupt and politics are based on bribery

(10) Recruiting puppet troops to harm the country and endanger the people

The judgment was sent by the Jiangsu High Court to the Supreme Court for review. On May 14, the Supreme Court announced: "The original judgment is approved." June 3, early morning—Chen Gongbo's end has come.

At 7:30 in the morning, Li Zhuodong, a prosecutor from the Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office, along with clerks and bailiffs, went to the No. 3 Prison and escorted the traitor Chen out of cell No. 1 in the Li character area for a final interrogation. At 8:30, he was executed in the wasteland Rongpu execution ground behind the prison. As the gunshots rang out, this generation of major traitors finally reaped what he had sown!

The dikes and revetments protecting Hualien City have been partially destroyed by the typhoon and urgently need to be repaired, otherwise the urban area will easily become a swamp.

### A Review and Prospect of the Cultural Movement

— Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Cultural Movement Committee

Humans are the most intelligent of all creatures. The unique ability of mankind, which distinguishes them from ordinary animals, lies in their creative will and power. Based on this power, they automatically interact and develop, and automatically explore to achieve the values they desire. They select and accumulate their values to form a cultural system. Therefore, culture is the achievement of the development of human mental capacity, and it is also the value and common cause produced by the creative will and power of mankind. This is why humans are the most intelligent of all creatures.

If mankind did not have the creative will and power, they would be the same as ordinary animals. Animals can also create, but they cannot accumulate. They can also imitate, but they cannot select. Therefore, animals can only adapt to survival and cannot accumulate the value and common cause of adapting to survival. For example, river sand, even after hundreds of years of accumulation, from one year to two years to hundreds of millions of years, its situation can be imagined. Humans are different. The activation and creation of their free will accumulate and move in new directions every day, without any restrictions or constraints. Because of their continuous interaction and creation, they have selected infinite values and common causes, and then they can declare independence from the natural world and develop the realm of culture. The scope of the cultural realm is endless, and the cultural movement is engaged in the direction of exploration.

The cultural realm is endless, and its scope is determined by the creative development of mankind. The purpose of biological survival is the same, and mankind also develops and creates for survival, selecting values suitable for survival for "abundant life" and "utilization," inseparable from matter and spirit. Matter and spirit are two sides of the same vital element. For the sake of "utilization," it is necessary to create a material culture, such as the progress of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and other tools, and the adjustment of the entire environment, all of which are to promote conditions that are beneficial to survival and eliminate obstacles that are harmful to survival. "Utilization" therefore leads to "abundant life," but the requirements for "abundant life" are not so simple. In addition to material utilization, mankind also requires comfort, pleasure, order, expansion, freedom, etc. For the satisfaction of these desires, there must be the creation of spiritual culture, and politics, language, ethics, literature, art, and religion are produced accordingly. The combination of "utilization" and "abundant life" is the total amount of national culture. The work of the cultural movement lies between the small self and the large self. Under the conditions of survival competition, its direction and scope are determined by the current needs in order to create and select the position that the world and mankind should obtain. This is lasting peace.

Culture and the cultural movement, as described above, require further supplementary explanation. "Culture" and "cultural movement" have very different natures. Culture is the result, and the cultural movement is the cause. Culture has already been formed, and the cultural movement is in progress. Therefore, we can say that the cultural movement is an activity of creating culture, and culture is the crystallization of creation. For example, scientific invention is a cultural movement, and the result of invention is the creation of machines, which is culture. The idea of civil rights is a cultural movement, and the result of the movement is the creation of a constitution, which is culture. The will and power of human creation are endless, and the future of the cultural movement is also endless. The cultural realm is endless, and the scope of the cultural movement is also endless. We can only take the needs of survival as the direction and transform creative maturity and vitality into crystallization as a temporary paragraph of a period of cultural movement.

Based on the above, we who are engaged in cultural movement work under the highest meaning of the Three Principles of the People may as well review the past to see if there have been considerable development achievements in the cultural realm to match the current needs of survival and determine the new direction for the future.

Talking about the review and direction of the cultural movement cannot be separated from the historical background and the needs of the times, and it is also necessary to recognize the historical mission of the subject. The racial and political revolution of the Xinhai Revolution changed the old view of thousands of years of history, reflecting the characteristics of culture. It was the gestation and birth of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, sending a epoch-making signal in the history of modern Chinese culture. The two Northern Expeditions inherited the cause of the Xinhai Revolution and completed the epoch-making transformation. Although the impact on culture was to remove the shackles of feudalism, the collision between China and the West and the admiration of the new while scorning the old led to extremes, forming a complex and scattered phenomenon. When the War of Resistance broke out, the Chinese nation was on the verge of life and death, and the cultural movement was coordinated with the War of Resistance, proceeding simultaneously, creating for survival, transforming the feminine culture into the masculine, the complex situation into the unified, the extreme trends into the moderate, as well as the awakening of the cultural circles and the expansion of the cultural realm. In a word, it was the improvement and enrichment of the content of culture. We can analyze the content of culture to review the guidelines and achievements of the cultural movement in the past eight years.

In terms of academic theory, although the May Fourth New Culture Movement ended the shackles of feudalism, it inevitably had the feeling of "burning all jade and stone together." For a time, the new had not matured, and the old was overthrown across the board. Foreign culture formed a situation of usurping the host's position. Debates and arguments were often stubborn and prejudiced. During the War of Resistance, in order to coordinate theory and action, the cultural undertaking replaced the War of Resistance undertaking. On the one hand, it was necessary to promote the inherent excellent traditions and consolidate people's hearts. On the other hand, it was necessary to catch up with modern scientific civilization and adapt to needs. Thus, in academic thought, Chinese and foreign cultures gained new recognition and new evaluation. Not only did the value of the inherent culture become equal to scientific civilization in the country, but it also occupied a considerable position in international culture.

In terms of thought and will, from the Xinhai Revolution to the completion of the Northern Expedition, although it established the center of national belief, the divergence of academic theories spread complex and complicated thoughts. It was not until the arrival of practical problems that people suddenly realized the task of everyone being responsible. The characteristics reflected in the cultural aspect are the concentration and unification of thought and will, reversing the past feminine and pure style and moving towards a realistic and expanding path. Everything is coordinated with the War of Resistance and the building of the nation. The cultural movement is the movement of the War of Resistance and the building of the nation, opening up unprecedented performance techniques and further confirming the cultural meaning of the Three Principles of the People as the highest principle for the revival of China.

In terms of life and action, culture is originally the manifestation of life. Mankind has the development of culture for the sake of life. From general life, we can see fragments of culture. Since China's opening to the sea, it has always admired the material civilization of foreign countries, and has developed contradictory thoughts of longing and disgust. However, since the War of Resistance, contradictions have returned to unity. People have abandoned luxury and are content with plainness. The reflection in the cultural aspect is the improvement of life and spiritual mobilization, strengthening the inherent national morality from the small self to the large self, and cultivating a brand-new ethical concept from the family to the nation. The cultural movement is applicable to the War of Resistance and the building of the nation, forming the sublimation of Chinese new culture.

Reviewing the direction of the cultural movement in the past eight years, it can be said that it was created, selected, and developed for the survival of the entire nation. The entire cultural movement was coordinated with the War of Resistance and worked. The cultural realm has expanded, and the content of culture has been enriched. The phenomenon of emptiness has changed to reality, the situation of divergence has changed to concentration, and the contradictory psychology has changed to unity. This cannot but be regarded as the solid success of the cultural movement in the review, and it can also be regarded as a stage of a period of cultural movement. However, the mission of the cultural movement in the future is even greater. In the past, it was coordinated with the War of Resistance, and in the future, it must be coordinated with the building of the nation. The new direction of the cultural movement is to create and develop in the cultural realm for the future of the building of the nation. We strictly reflect on the current situation of the cultural circles, and there are also places that make us alert. First, the achievements of science in the cultural realm are not as good as general art. Second, in terms of the content of culture, material progress is also difficult to keep pace with the spirit. Third, the cultural circles themselves cannot keep in step, thus forming a difference in the cultural undertaking. In the future, to cooperate with the national construction undertaking, we should determine the following new directions:

(1) The Three Principles of the People is the highest principle of national construction, and the cultural movement must determine its direction and direction under the principles of the Three Principles of the People. The cultural movement of national construction must be the cultural movement of the Three Principles of the People.

(2) Based on the highest meaning of people's livelihood, the cultural movement should promote the inherent excellent culture, communicate with international culture to eliminate misunderstandings, enhance understanding, and achieve the goal of lasting peace for mankind.

(3) Based on the highest meaning of the principle of people's rights, the cultural movement is to develop the democratic spirit, enrich the essence of education, take management, education, and nurturing as practice, and take freedom and equality as the goal.

(4) Based on the highest meaning of the principle of people's livelihood, the cultural movement is to eliminate class struggle, coordinate the social economy, and take the people's livelihood being rich and the people's livelihood being beneficial as the greatest goal.

Cultural construction is the foundation of national construction. The cultural realm is endless, and the scope of the cultural movement is also endless. We review the past and look forward to the future. We must grasp the main goals, determine the correct direction, and strive to develop within this scope under the purpose of survival, while also combining ideals and facts. We will definitely be able to increase national strength with cultural power and promote national construction with cultural construction.

Orchid Island—Island of Fishermen (Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)

### The Function of Meteorology

— Meteorology Expert Lü Jiong

Meteorology today can be called an applied science with the most extensive utility. Every day, major meteorological observatories in Europe and America receive countless inquiries from all sectors of society requesting weather reports. For example, before the war, the Berlin Meteorological Observatory in Germany had personnel stationed by the telephone from morning till night, answering weather forecast inquiries from all sectors. The United States Weather Bureau records daily weather reports on records and plays them on gramophones from morning till dusk. Members of the public who wish to know the future weather only need to dial the telephone, hold the receiver to their ear, and they can hear the weather report. From this, one can see the extensive application of meteorological science in Europe and America. Our country's meteorological undertakings are just beginning, and some of our countrymen may not fully understand this science. Therefore, I have drafted this article to briefly describe the applications of meteorological science in various fields to introduce it to readers.

The initial application of meteorology was in agriculture, as the abundance or scarcity of agricultural products is closely related to rainfall and temperature. In particular, the abundance or scarcity of rainfall is even more important. To determine which climates in different regions are suitable for which plants, meteorological measurements must first be taken as a reference for crop cultivation. Conversely, agricultural land development without meteorological measurements would mean being completely unaware of which plants are suitable for planting. In large-scale orchards, the prediction of autumn and winter frost is very important, because without prior preparation, if the fruits in the orchard are hit by frost, the losses would be significant. Sugar cane growing regions must not allow frost damage. If this is known in advance, preparations can be made, such as setting up stoves to create smoke to eliminate frost, thereby avoiding losses.

In coastal fishing areas, weather forecasting is also extremely important. Fishermen who sail on the sea and encounter storms without being able to avoid them often suffer the disaster of being capsized. Along the coast of our country, ignorant fishermen have never known how to use weather reports, so every year, countless people are buried in the bellies of fish. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has paid great attention to this, and has requested the Central Meteorological Bureau to set up coastal marine meteorological observatories to forecast the weather daily and use radio broadcasts. In the event of bad weather, advance avoidance can be made to protect the safety of fishermen and avoid repeating past mistakes. If this plan is implemented, coastal fishermen will undoubtedly benefit greatly in the future.

Hydraulic engineering cannot be separated from meteorological work either. For example, for the Yangtze River dam project and the Yellow River water storage project recently planned for our country by the American hydraulic engineering expert Dr. Savage, meteorological measurements and descriptions are also very important in addition to other scientific work. Without meteorological data, the design would be difficult to carry out. Recently, Dr. Savage departed from Beijing to inspect the Yellow River water control project along the way. He had previously requested the Central Meteorological Bureau to provide meteorological data for the Yellow River basin and wrote an article studying the meteorological conditions in the Yellow River basin for reference. Flood and drought prevention are the common tasks of hydraulic experts and meteorologists. Without long-term meteorological observations and experiments in advance, plans for preventing floods and droughts cannot be realized. The longer the history of such meteorological observations, the better. Meteorological records in Europe and America are mostly several decades or more, and some are about a hundred years old, so they have better methods for preventing floods and droughts.

The relationship between aviation and meteorology is even closer, as everyone knows. If the weather is good when an airplane is flying in the sky, it is naturally very safe. If it suddenly encounters a storm mid-flight, the danger is worrisome. There are many examples of airplane accidents caused by bad weather, too numerous to mention. A recent example is that on December 14, due to the southward advance of a cold wave from the north, with strong winds and heavy rain, a transport plane of the Central Aviation Corporation crashed near Changxing, Zhejiang. China Aviation Corporation Flight 67 arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 5:20 p.m. on the same day and landed at Longhua Airport. Due to the excessive wind force, it collided with other parked airplanes on the field. This was still a great stroke of luck amidst misfortune. Wind and fog are the most important meteorological elements in aviation meteorology, so the measurement of wind direction, wind force, and fog at various altitudes in the high air should be given the most attention in aviation.

Hygiene administration also needs meteorological data for research, especially every summer. This is because epidemics such as malaria, typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery mostly occur in the summer and are closely related to the level of temperature and the amount of humidity. Therefore, every summer, the epidemic prevention institutions of the Department of Health must obtain meteorological data from major cities throughout our country from meteorological institutions as a standard for research and to take preventive measures.

In recent years, the Ministry of Food has often taken meteorological data as reference for judging the abundance or scarcity of harvests in various regions to determine the amount of grain to be levied. If there is excessive or insufficient rainfall in an area, causing droughts or floods, the grain levy can naturally be reduced appropriately. Otherwise, if a locality reports a famine but the inspection finds that the rainfall is suitable, it will be known that the locality inevitably has some inaccurate reporting.

The application of meteorology in Europe and America has almost become a household name. Boat and car travelers must also inquire about the weather conditions in advance. When building houses, they must first find out the amount of rainfall to determine the size of the drainage ditches. Hollywood film companies in the United States even sign contracts with meteorologists to be responsible for reporting the weather. This is because movie stars are extravagant, and if they unfortunately encounter continuous rain when going out to shoot a movie, delaying the filming for days, the expenses are enormous, and the company's losses are not small.

During World War II, Europe and America used meteorology to achieve unexpected victories. There are many deeds that can be commended and are worthy of reference. A brief description of a few points may also be welcomed by readers.

When the German army attacked Poland in September 1939, meteorologists chose an auspicious time to launch the attack. We know that autumn and winter in Europe are rainy seasons. German meteorologists measured a period of several consecutive days without rain for their air force, so the German air force used an overwhelming force, with a continuous stream of bombings, attacking day and night, and Warsaw collapsed from then on. Later, when attacking Norway, assaulting Greece, and conquering Crete, they all followed the same method. It can be said that they conquered cities and seized land in no time, using weather forecasts to the extreme in blitzkrieg tactics. For example, in February 1941, the Germans also used weather forecasts to help two warships escape from the tiger's mouth. It turned out that Germany had two warships, one called the Scharnboster and the other called the Gneisenau, which were stationed at Brest on the coast of France. The captain wanted to sail these two warships through the English Channel and back to the Baltic Sea, but the British bombers were watching intently, making it difficult. Admiral Raeder, the leader of the Nazi navy, consulted with meteorologists. The conditions were: there must be low clouds for cover, the visibility under the clouds must be very poor, and at a low altitude of several hundred meters above the sea, the activities of ships on the sea could not be seen clearly. If enemy aircraft (referring to the British) flew into the clouds, ice would immediately condense on the wings. Only then could the warships escape the British air force's fire net. German meteorologists found that this type of weather could be produced in February when a storm passed through the strait from west to east. On February 9 of that year, German meteorologists reported that the time had come and preparations were underway for departure. The two German warships left Brest on the night of February 11 and sailed through the English Channel the next day. The British air force's torpedo bombs were unable to use their skills.

On June 6, 1944, when the Allied forces attacked Germany and landed in Normandy, meteorologists also chose an auspicious time to launch the attack. The Allies chose to land in June because there is a climatic basis for it. This is because in Normandy along the coast of France, the rainy days in June are the fewest in all months of the year. However, it rained every day for several days before the landing. Eisenhower, the commander of the European offensive, was very anxious and consulted with meteorologists every day. On June 4, the meteorologists told him that the weather could improve within 36 hours. So Eisenhower decided to land on the night of June 6. However, this landing involved not only meteorological factors but also oceanographic factors. This is because June 6 happened to be a full moon, and both high tide and low tide were particularly severe. When the tide receded at night, the sandbars were vast and boundless, and the faint moonlight penetrated through the clouds, which was the perfect time for landing.

Usually, various weather changes move from west to east. After the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany, British weather reports were kept secret, which was unfavorable to Germany. Because of this, it could no longer use British weather reports to predict its own future weather changes. However, it could still use Greenland's weather reports to make rough estimates. Therefore, in early October 1944, the U.S. military occupied the German meteorological observatory in Greenland, making it difficult for Germany to detect weather in the Atlantic from then on. After the end of World War II, some powerful countries, fearing invasion, competed to set up meteorological stations in the Arctic Circle, which is also a matter worth noting. During this war, the United States, with its strong financial resources, had meteorological reports that could almost be said to cover the entire globe. It trained thousands of university students to engage in meteorological work. The Army Air Corps alone established 900 overseas meteorological stations during the war, in addition to the reports from regular meteorological observatories in peacetime. Therefore, they could almost know the weather conditions at any place on the entire globe except for the two poles at any time. Therefore, after Saipan was occupied by the U.S. military today, a meteorological report was issued the next day. Therefore, U.S. warships and aircraft could gallop vertically and horizontally on the sea and in the air without any obstacles. Therefore, meteorological work helped them win the war. As for our country's meteorological undertakings, they have gradually developed due to the war, but compared with Britain and the United States, they are still far behind. I hope that our people will pay attention to this.

### Overcoming Reality, Creating Culture

— Cultural History Expert Chen Dongyuan

Generally speaking, to increase the level of culture, life must be stable and the economy must be prosperous. This is because only in this way can there be leisure time, and only then can the intellect, emotions, and ability to appreciate cultural creation be produced. To talk about the current cultural construction of China based on this premise is indeed a relatively difficult thing. After being bound by a century of unequal treaties and eight years of long-term resistance against Japan, the lives of ordinary people have long been oppressed to the point of being unable to breathe. And the current civil strife is still continuing, transportation has not recovered, the economy is bankrupt, causing widespread suffering, and there is no hope for recovery. Every Chinese citizen feels unable to survive and unable to die. Under these circumstances, where does the strength to build culture come from? Therefore, if our culture is only allowed to develop naturally, there is no hope for it to improve.

However, judging from historical facts, the culture of any country does not rise in a straight line, nor does it decline forever. Brilliant Greece has a day of decline. Golden Rome has a time of demise. The period of decline in culture is unavoidable for any country. But extremes beget their opposites, and when things get really bad, they must turn for the better. Taking the West as an example, who could have expected the world of today's flourishing science when living in the dark Middle Ages? To explain this in the words of Ms. Chen Hengzhe: "It is like when spring is about to come, although there are morning winds and evening rains, and the sky is overcast and the ground is damp, the brilliant spring light cannot be brewed without this." Why can't we take this view of China's current situation? The problem is only where we generate strength and which path we follow to restore our culture.

Open the newspapers and magazines and look at our current literary works. Ninety percent of them are dissatisfied with reality, attacking reality, and fully depicting the ugliness of reality, while not offering an ideal. If there is one put forward, it is all the same, nothing more than political reform, advocating the union of so-called democratic warriors to form a new government. In other words, the opinion put forward by most writers today is that as long as the government is reformed, the country can be good and culture can progress. This is the same mistake as the reformers of the Hundred Days' Reform, who believed that as long as Cixi was removed, the country could become better. Culture is the total expression of the spirit and material of an era, and it requires the joint efforts of the entire nation in all aspects. Reforming the government will definitely not improve the entire life or raise the general culture. Democratic politics is our need today, but what we especially need is that the intelligent people of the whole country, with one heart and one mind, cooperate and work hard in their respective positions for the country. Only in this way is true democracy.

The insecurity of life and the difficulty of the economy are indeed obstacles to cultural progress, but to reveal the light in the darkness, advanced people must overcome these difficulties, invigorate the intellect and emotions of creation, and give the people of the whole country an upward ideal and a direction for joint efforts. This is not impossible to do. Taking literature as an example, after the First World War, German writers, in order to save the defeated Germanic nation, did not take the reality of themselves as a means, nor did they escape reality, but instead enthusiastically embraced reality on the one hand, and on the other hand, relied on the spiritual power of reality, mobility, and clear longing to conquer reality and suppress reality. The old novelists wanted to give interest and entertainment with their works, while the new German novelists wanted to give the people emotion and upward sentiment with their works. The former describes external reality, while the latter transforms reality to complete noble reality. This is Expressionism in literature. Although Germany was later led to the path of decline by the demented Hitler, the spirit of their writers to save the nation cannot be erased. Due to this historical fact, when talking about our current cultural construction, why don't our writers abandon their style of merely depicting reality and instead drum up their enthusiasm for loving the nation and loving culture to give us a forward-looking ideal, in order to change the atmosphere? Not only literature is like this, but all practitioners of academics such as the board of directors, politics, society, economics, science, education, fine arts, music, and drama should abandon their negative, depressed, and submissive attitude to current awards, and instead put forward an upward ideal and work hard in academic research and practical business. If this can be done, there will be hope for Chinese cultural construction, and the birth of a new China can be germinated from this.

### Engineering Construction in the First Year After Victory

— Engineering Expert Hou Jiayuan

During the Anti-Japanese War, all transportation routes and public works in areas reached by the enemy's cavalry suffered extremely severe damage. The longer the war lasted in a region, the greater the loss. Taking railways as an example, the lines north of the Yangtze River were evacuated more quickly, so the route facilities were relatively complete when the war ended. However, after more than a year of continuous destruction, there is still not a single smooth trunk railway north of the Yangtze River. The lines south of the Yangtze River had been subjected to seesaw battles for a long time during the Anti-Japanese War, and the route facilities were mostly dilapidated, especially the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, which was completely destroyed. As for the locomotives and rolling stock on all lines, those in the rear were difficult to replenish and repair due to prolonged blockades, and even in the occupied areas, they were restricted by the enemy's so-called national policy and did not receive adequate replenishment. In addition, maintenance and repairs were extremely perfunctory during the military period. Even on the lines that were not destroyed, the actual condition of all material equipment was far worse than before the war. According to our on-site inspection and estimation, the railways south of the Great Wall that urgently need to be repaired total more than 3,000 kilometers. Repairing them to the pre-war standard would require more than 370 million US dollars. This preliminary estimate has already exceeded the total domestic and foreign debts of all railways in our country before the war. Although the purchasing power of the US dollar has also depreciated considerably, the extent of the losses suffered by our country's railways can be seen from this.

During the war, transportation in the rear relied heavily on road transport. The road construction in the Great Rear Area over the past ten years has indeed made significant progress, but most of the roads in the occupied areas have been destroyed. The remaining routes have also not been maintained, and their condition is even worse than that of the railways.

The equipment of coastal ports suffered relatively little direct damage from military operations. However, during these nine years, all necessary maintenance was not carried out effectively, resulting in increasingly severe siltation of the waterways in various ports, and many collapses of wharves and embankments. Other important equipment such as warehouses, cranes, barges, and dredgers were also mostly lost or damaged. However, during the occupation of North China, the Japanese began to build a new port at the estuary of the Tanggu Baihe River. The completion of various projects was almost half done, but the construction was stopped midway due to the reversal of their war situation. In addition, the enemy made small improvements to the ports on Hainan Island, but the scale was small, or only suitable for certain special purposes at the time.

Water conservancy projects in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins and along the coast are of great importance to our country's national economy and people's livelihood. Unfortunately, during the Anti-Japanese War, they were either directly damaged due to military operations or, due to environmental limitations, could not be repaired, causing them to gradually collapse. In particular, the diversion of the Yellow River to seize the Huai River and flow into the Yangtze River has had a widespread and severely detrimental impact, rarely seen in decades of floods.

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the central government immediately used its own capabilities to the best of its ability and strove to obtain considerable material assistance from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The central and local authorities in charge have been stepping up repairs to the urgently needed transportation routes and water conservancy projects. The actual conditions of the various projects that were damaged during the war and the extent to which they should be repaired are pending on-site inspection and detailed survey. The repair procedures for various projects should also be weighed according to their importance and urgency, and carefully planned and determined in consideration of the country's financial resources. Moreover, in the process of this repair, we should take this opportunity to innovate and transform the shortcomings of each project in the past and the improvements that should be made due to technological advancements. Furthermore, since there are many new projects to be undertaken after the war, they should also be planned and coordinated at the same time as the restoration work. In order to quickly complete the above-mentioned plans and work, the Executive Yuan established the Engineering Planning Bureau in the spring of this year, bringing together Chinese and American experts to be responsible for this matter.

After nine months of hard work, in addition to the plan for the fundamental management of the Yellow River, which is currently being continued by many experts who are being invited to conduct research and consultations, the railway repair plan has been formulated in detail by the group, taking into account the country's capabilities, the environment, and the degree of urgency. This plan stipulates the order of priority for the repair of each line, the time required for the repair, and a detailed estimate of the materials and funds required. According to the current situation, the lines in the Yangtze River Delta with relatively stable social order should be repaired first. The improvement and complete restoration of the Yuehan Railway will still take two years. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Xiang-Gui, and Gui-Qian lines are expected to be restored to their original state within the next two years and appropriately improved. The other lines north and south of the Yangtze River and in the Northeast will be gradually and quickly repaired in accordance with the planned procedures and with the evolution of the political and social conditions in various places. If this repair plan can be successfully implemented, all lines south of the Great Wall may be fully repaired within the next two years. In addition, realistic and innovative plans will be drafted for the use of locomotives and rolling stock on various lines, the improvement of locomotive factories, telecommunication signals, and driving equipment, and the supply and management of road materials and machinery. As for the construction of new roads, we should focus on connecting the southwest and northwest and making them directly connected to the Central Plains and the southern provinces. Therefore, the main body of this new road plan should be the completion of the Lanzhou-Guangzhou line. Then, the Gan-Sichuan-Xiang line should be repaired in sequence, and then the Baotou on the Ping-Sui line and the Guanzhou on the Sui-Hai line should be connected, and the connecting lines between Chengdu-Chongqing and Yunnan-Vietnam should be built to complete the backbone of the national railway network.

Coastal ports are the throat of the national water and land transportation system. We have conducted on-site inspections and detailed discussions on all the more important ports along the coast, and believe that the consolidation of the ports of Shanghai and Qingdao cannot be delayed any longer. Especially the port of Shanghai, as the hub of the country's foreign trade and material transit, its restoration and improvement work should be actively promoted. The restoration and improvement work of ports such as Huludao, Qinhuangdao, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and Hainan Island should also not be delayed any longer. As for the construction of new ports, the construction of the new port in Tanggu should be accelerated, as it is an integral part of the entire northern transportation system and is necessary for the development of North China's resources. In addition, the development of the Guangzhou Bay port should also be planned and prepared early. This is one of the good deep-water harbors in South China, and it is located at the southern end of the Lanzhou-Guangzhou trunk line. The construction and repair of this port is an integral part of the construction plan of this trunk line, and it should also be coordinated and connected with the railway construction procedure. Xiamen Port has deep water and a wide bay, and is a naturally beautiful good port on the southeast coast, which should also be improved to make it the export port of the future Fujian-Jiangxi Railway.

We have made several practical and appropriate recommendations for the construction, management, and operation of highways, and have carefully reviewed the current situation and future needs of highway transportation in our country, and formulated the standards for highway engineering in various regions and levels as the norms for future construction. Regarding the formulation of the national highway network and the principles for the division of provincial and county roads, the central government's attention in the future should focus on a few trunk highways that connect the important economic, political, and military centers of the country, while the construction and management of other roads should be entrusted to local governments, so that local governments can share more of the responsibilities they should bear. As for the task of highway transportation, it should be mostly entrusted to private enterprises, so that the highway transportation business can be developed rapidly, the operating efficiency can be effectively improved, and all those who are enthusiastic about the transportation industry can have the opportunity to fully exert their abilities. The state-owned and private transportation businesses can complement each other and achieve mutual benefit.

In the year after the victory, the government has also made its greatest efforts to rebuild various transportation and public works. However, the entire political situation has been affected. The civil war has not subsided, and not only the reconstruction and construction work in some areas has been fundamentally impossible to carry out, but also the railways north of the Yangtze River, which have been received and repaired to some extent, have been destroyed again in this year's civil war. Moreover, due to the huge military expenditure, the national treasury is in deficit, and the people's strength is declining. The financial resources and manpower that can be raised and allocated for economic recovery and construction have also been greatly reduced. The work of rebuilding various projects has naturally been difficult to promote quickly. In addition, all basic industrial and mining enterprises in our country are extremely weak. Most of the various engineering materials required still need to be supplied by foreigners. The number of engineering materials that the United Nations can allocate to our country is not only insufficient, but also the need for engineering materials in various countries in the past few years after the war has increased several times. Even if we have made full preparations, it will be difficult to purchase them quickly and in full quantity. Furthermore, due to the extreme shortage of ships after the war and the heavy burden of transporting troops for demobilization, even if a large number of construction materials can be obtained abroad, it will be difficult to transport them to China on schedule, and it will be difficult to coordinate and tightly coordinate with the promotion of domestic construction. In addition, the lack of specialized technical personnel, the inconvenience of domestic transportation, and the continuous sharp rise in the prices of labor and materials are all sufficient to hinder the recovery of economic construction enterprises and directly and indirectly affect the reconstruction of various public works.

Although the overall environment is so difficult, the engineering construction in the past year has still achieved considerable achievements, which should not be completely erased. At the beginning of the restoration work, the government immediately endeavored to connect the transportation routes between the Great Rear Area and the recovered areas. The obstacles hindering navigation within the Yangtze River route were quickly cleared, and the navigation signs along the Yangtze River and various important seaports are also gradually being restored. The airport stations in the important cities in the recovered areas have been able to be quickly improved to a considerable extent, providing great assistance to the reception and demobilization work. The railway restoration work was originally more difficult and took longer. At the beginning of the restoration, the government made great efforts to speed up the restoration of the Yue-Han Railway, which connects the Great Rear Area and the recovered area, and is one of the major arteries of north-south transportation. The length of this road dismantled during the war was nearly 400 kilometers, and most of the track materials and locomotives and rolling stock were lost. The station buildings, factory buildings, and all military equipment had disappeared. At the beginning of this year, relief materials from abroad had not yet arrived, so we had to dismantle more than 200 kilometers of track materials from the Xiang-Gui Railway for the restoration of the Yue-Han Railway. At the same time, we made every effort to collect scattered and lost equipment, made full use of locally produced timber, and concentrated all manpower and material resources to accelerate the progress. Finally, the entire line was connected by the end of June of this year. Although the restoration of the original state of this road still needs to be awaited, the achievement of the person in charge of this land transport trunk line connecting the Yangtze River and the Pearl River Basin in a very short period of time should not be ignored. The restoration work of the coastal railways first started from the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin areas, and started to speed up the repair of the Ping-Han, Tianjin-Pukou, and Jiaoji railways with Wuhan and Jinan as the centers. At present, the transportation situation of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways has been greatly improved compared to the ceasefire period. Outside Shanhaiguan, the northern part of the Beining Railway has already been fully connected with the reception of Shenyang. Although the stations along the line are still subject to attacks and destruction from time to time, the passenger and freight transportation of this road can still be maintained with difficulty. The Changchun-Dalian section of the China-Chang Railway has already been opened for military use. Recently, with the progress of the military, the branch line from Shenyang to Andong has been restored. It is hoped that the transportation to the important coastal cities in the southern part of the three northeastern provinces can be smooth. After the recovery of Zhangjiakou and the removal of military obstacles on the entire Ping-Sui line, the restoration work of the Ping-Sui Railway has been able to be accelerated. Based on the current situation, it is estimated that the entire line should be able to be connected immediately. However, the restoration work of the northern sections of the Ping-Han and Tianjin-Pukou railways is constantly obstructed and cannot continue to be promoted. Although the Zhengtai Railway has been connected twice, it has been continuously destroyed from time to time, and has recently been disconnected again. The restoration project of the entire Tongpu line is not only obstructed by the military, but also lacks sufficient reserve materials, so it cannot be carried out for a while.

The restoration project of the Jiaoji Railway is also constantly obstructed and stopped repeatedly. Recently, the entire line has been reconnected. It is hoped that it will not be destroyed again in the future, so that the transportation business of this road can be smooth from now on. The Longhai Railway has the longest line. The section east of Tongguan belongs to the war zone and is located in the area where the Yellow River breached its banks. The supply of equipment is also extremely scarce. After a year of continuous efforts, the restoration work of the entire line can be said to be completed with difficulty.

### Current Situation of Military Region Division in the "Liberated Areas"

— This Newspaper Information Office

Since the victory a year ago, the Communist army has wantonly destroyed transportation on various routes and has been obstructing the acceptance of surrender by the National Army. Since the ceasefire order issued by the government on November 11 took effect, the National Army has strictly complied with the order and strictly guarded its original defense. However, the Communist army in various places has continued to roam and harass. The Communist leaders also believe that war is the only way to resolve domestic disputes and are also called the "People's Liberation Army," with Zhu De as the "Commander-in-Chief," Peng Dehuai as the "Deputy Commander-in-Chief," and Ye Jianying as the "Chief of Staff." Zhu De recently stated: "The number of Communist troops is expanding." According to general estimates, the Communist army has less than one million regular troops, excluding the 500,000 members of the militia. Compared with the National Army, which is said to have 3.8 million troops, the strength is truly worlds apart. From its actions, it can be seen that the Communist army will maintain guerrilla tactics and attempt to attack the entire national economy by destroying transportation.

The division of military regions in the "Liberated Areas" and the situation of confrontation between the Nationalists and Communists are shown in detail in the figure below, so that readers can understand a glimpse of the areas disturbed by the Communist army.
