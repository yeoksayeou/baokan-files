[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] The American Embassy announced that Wei Te-Mai spent most of the 19th in talks with Chairman Chiang at his official residence on Huangpu Road. Mr. Wei, accompanied by Captain Wu Han-Min, drove there at 10:00 AM, had lunch with Chairman Chiang and his wife, and did not depart until after 3:00 PM in the afternoon.  No other visits took place that day, only gatherings with advisors in the early morning and late evening, along with rushing to write reports.  This was Mr. Wei's first meeting with Chairman Chiang since his return from Southern China. According to Mr. Watson, the press advisor to Mr. Wei, the five-hour-long talk likely covered a wide range of topics, but the specific content remains unknown. On the 19th, a reporter presented Advisor Watson with a photograph of Envoy Wei upon his arrival in Nanjing, a gift from this newspaper, and requested that it be delivered to the special envoy. Mr. Watson was extremely pleased upon reading this, stating that Envoy Wei would surely cherish this gift of friendship as a valuable memento of this trip.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] Special Envoy Wei Te-Mai visited Chairman Chiang at 10:00 AM this morning for a lengthy five-hour discussion in a closed room. He explained the impressions he gained during his recent visits to Taiwan, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, with a very frank attitude.  Reportedly, after investigating North and Northeast China, Mr. Wei also presented Chairman Chiang with evidence, directly criticizing the shortcomings of some military and government officials.

[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 19th] Mr. Cooksell, engineering advisor, Mr. Walker, economic advisor, of the Wei Te-Mai Special Envoy Delegation, along with Mr. Bowlin Zhe, Commercial Counselor of the American Embassy, and three others, arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing at 11:00 AM today.

They paid particular attention to the current status of coal production and transportation construction.  Due to time constraints, they were unable to attend any official receptions, and only took a drive around the city for one hour at 4:00 PM before returning to Nanjing by the original plane at 4:40 PM.

[Dispatch from Nanjing of the 19th]  Mr. Watson, press advisor to Envoy Wei, told reporters that Mr. Cook Er, the engineering advisor, and Mr. Walker, the economic advisor, flew to Hankou on the morning of the 19th to investigate the economic situation in that area and returned to Nanjing at 6:30 PM in the evening.

### Wei Envoy to Report Complex Situation in China to US President

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] Wei Te-Mai will report to President Truman that the current situation in China is even worse than it was at the end of the war with Japan. This situation can, in fact, be attributed to all sides.  Wei Te-Mai's report will be candid and impartial, pointing out where the faults lie, and will criticize both the National Government and the opposing side currently engaged in civil war with it. The Wei Te-Mai mission is not only to assess the situation in China but also to provide recommendations for future US policy toward China.  Since arriving here, he has remained tight-lipped, listening more and talking less. Wei Te-Mai's report will necessarily be set against a background of chaotic and difficult-to-understand circumstances.  Among the things he has found are the following:

(1) The Chinese Communists occupy eighty percent of the wealthy Northeastern region and a vast, important area of North China.

(2) Inflation is becoming increasingly dire, with no end to the upward spiral in sight.

(3) Foreign trade remains in a poor state due to the government's repeated implementation of new regulatory ordinances.

(4) The people are beginning to feel hopeless about the situation, even more so than under their former enemy, Japan.

(5) The floods between the old and new courses of the Yellow River have left millions homeless, with fears of famine this winter.

(6) Transportation is in a terrible state. This makes it difficult for the government to maintain contact and control over the vast border regions and hinders the movement of essential materials.

(7) At least eighty percent of the government budget is spent on military expenses. This has forced the postponement of many important reconstruction projects and some non-military projects.

(8) There is widespread tax evasion.

(9) Foreign businessmen in China feel that China has too many restrictions on them. Although the government has officially announced that it welcomes foreign investment, most American businessmen here advise taking a cautious wait-and-see attitude. American businessmen claim that important Chinese figures have as much as 500 million yuan stored in American banks, and due to the threat of inflation, they are unwilling to bring it back to the country and invest it in reconstruction projects.

(10) Virtually every Chinese person, from Chairman Chiang downwards, acknowledges that extensive reforms are needed within the National Government, but to date, little or nothing commendable has been achieved.

(11) Taiwan, formerly belonging to Japan, is said to have low administrative efficiency after its return to China after the war.

(12) China has a vast uneducated populace, lacking leadership skills and representation.

### US Consul General in Hong Kong Denounces Communist Radio for Spreading Rumors

[United Press Hong Kong Dispatch of the 19th] Communist radio broadcasts that the United States has concluded an agreement with Portugal to jointly use and improve the port of Macau. The US Consul General in Hong Kong, Mr. Hooper, refuted this claim on the 19th as "utterly absurd."  Mr. Hooper also serves as Consul in Macau.  He stated that this rumor has surfaced countless times in the past eighteen months. He said that the US Navy has been making recreational visits to Hong Kong and Macau for some time, so the presence of US sailors and officers may be misunderstood. Mr. Hooper further stated that Portugal has always allowed the United States to use the port of Macau, but only small vessels such as landing craft are allowed to enter. Mr. Hooper admitted that he had met with Wei Te-Mai at the request of the US Embassy to give Envoy Wei a clearer picture of Southern China.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] According to Communist broadcasts heard here on the morning of the 19th, Wei Te-Mai's visit to Guangzhou was denounced, stating: "This trip is a sign that American influence is extending to Southern China and will cause a direct conflict of interest between the United States and Britain there. To dominate Southern China, the United States will first expel British influence. This can be explained by why Wei Te-Mai met with the US Consul in Hong Kong during his visit to Guangzhou on August 15."

The broadcast also claimed: "The United States recently signed an agreement with the Portuguese authorities in Macau, allowing the United States to use the port of Macau, with the United States allocating three million yuan to improve port facilities. Many believe that this is one of the steps the United States is taking to isolate Hong Kong." (Note: The Macau authorities recently denied the above rumors.)

### Gu Wei-Jun Meets Lovett to Discuss Far Eastern Issues

Mr. Gu told reporters that his conversation with Mr. Lovett included several questions regarding the UNRRA program in China. It is reported that he also discussed the issue of ensuring the safe transport of UNRRA supplies to areas where the war is ongoing. The Chinese government's view is that guarantees for the safe transport of UNRRA supplies must come from both sides. Regarding the Lend-Lease settlement agreement, he said that Chinese and American experts are currently studying proposals for future negotiations.

Branch associations in Hunan, Guangdong, Shantou, and other places have sent telegrams requesting postponement. After several discussions, the secretariat intends to seek the opinions of various representatives to make recommendations to the government. After the report, the representatives spoke one after another, and the secretariat then proposed a motion: "Initiate a collection of opinions from representatives across the country to advise the government to carefully handle the election, convene a temporary National Assembly, and decide on implementation methods and related issues to facilitate the country's construction during the rebellion." The resolution was passed and handed over to the secretariat. Finally, a temporary motion was raised, "Propose to schedule a constitutional seminar inviting members from four institutions: the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, and the Political Participation Council, and ask them to discuss the case," which was also passed and handed over to the secretariat for handling.

### Chairman Approves Assistance Association's Resolution to Uphold Sovereignty over Northeast; Wu Zhao-Xu and Others to Meet with Special Envoy Wei to Provide Information

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] The government's determination to resolutely uphold sovereignty over the nine provinces of the Northeast has once again received concrete proof. This is Chairman Chiang's approval of the "Nine Provinces and Twenty-Nine Cities Assistance and Reconstruction Association." The association is composed of councilors and supervisors from the northern provinces in Nanjing. Fearing that the government troops would withdraw from the Northeast, they submitted a letter to Chairman Chiang, emphasizing the pros and cons and requesting that he never give up. Chairman Chiang has now replied, stating, "I have received your submission. Our country's eight-year War of Resistance, which sacrificed countless lives and property of soldiers and civilians, was precisely for the recovery of sovereignty over the Northeast. How could we lightly give it up? Groundless rumors are not to be believed." Furthermore, Wu Zhao-Xu, Ma Liang, Wang Guan-Wu, Du Guang-Xun, Liang Xian-Da, and other responsible members of the association have scheduled to meet with Wei Te-Mai at 11:00 AM on the 21st to provide relevant information and opinions regarding the North.

### Improved International Trade Awaits Currency Stability; Ministry of Economy to Explain Measures for Trade with Japan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] A senior government official in charge of international trade told reporters on the 19th that after the publication of the revised foreign exchange and import-export control measures, China's import and export trade is expected to gradually improve. According to this source: In the past, China had numerous institutions managing international trade with unclear responsibilities. This time, they will be merged into the Import-Export Management Committee, and the responsible person is also a well-chosen candidate. Import-export control can be expected to be less chaotic than before. Before the war, China's annual exports were approximately US$200 million, last year approximately US$150 million, and the situation in the first half of this year was worse. After the publication of the new measures, if domestic prices do not rise, exports can be activated. The authorities are paying close attention to the rising prices of raw materials at the origin of export goods. They believe that if the increase does not exceed one-third or one-quarter, then those engaged in exports can still make a profit and hope that the increase does not exceed this number. Since the publication of the new measures, the responsible department will actively assist in promotion and improve product inspection, etc., so that materials can be sold abroad in a continuous stream. The source pointed out that the new measures are detailed and well-intentioned. However, for international trade to improve, currency stability is still required. Since Premier Zhang took office, he has repeatedly paid attention to currency stability, which is gratifying.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] The Ministry of Economy spokesperson stated: The implementation measures for organizing a business delegation to Japan have been preliminarily drafted by the Japan Trade Guidance Committee and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. They will be announced after a formal decision. The selection of representatives will be primarily based on private labor, industrial, and commercial sectors. The five representatives of public enterprises specified therein are not purely public in nature but are mostly public-private joint ventures, including those proposed to be sold to private operation. When necessary, the Ministry can provide a detailed explanation of the various measures proposed for trade with Japan and the government's intentions.

### Economic Expert Discusses Need to Abolish Official Exchange Rate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] A well-informed economic expert told reporters on the 19th that the new foreign exchange policy is only a preliminary remedial step taken in response to the current financial and economic situation. Although it may achieve considerable results after implementation, the implementation of currency system reform is still required to normalize the abnormal economy. This expert, who did not want to be named, believes that this measure can be called a prelude to currency system reform. The expert believes that the new measures only passively eliminate obstacles, while the active incentives are still insufficient. He pointed out that the government's prescribed quota for the third quarter may not be sufficient to meet actual needs. If the need exceeds the quota and the quota execution is extremely strict, the required foreign exchange will definitely exceed the supply. In this case, the only way to obtain foreign exchange beyond what the official rate can provide is to seek it at the market rate. In this case, another rate is very likely to occur. He was deeply surprised that the official rate still exists, pointing out that except for foreign financial reasons, he has not seen any need to maintain the official rate. If the public sector needs foreign exchange, the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank can handle the transfer procedures. The use of the official rate for the settlement of foreign exchange for five daily necessities such as food and coal has also been done before. However, whether it can achieve the goal of price parity and whether the real beneficiaries are the consumers are both questionable. Since the low price of these five "necessities" is a national policy and paid for by the national treasury, why not also use transfer procedures? He believes that the existence of an official rate is a loophole and should be eliminated.

### Situation in Beiping Market Stabilizes; Trade Association Convenes Meeting

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 19th] After the announcement of the foreign exchange market price, the situation in the Beiping market has stabilized. In terms of grain prices, rice is stable, local flour and wheat have risen slightly, and Shanghai flour has fallen slightly. Cotton yarn prices have fallen immediately. 42-count yarn is 700,000, 32-count yarn has dropped 400,000, and 20-count yarn has been discounted by 600,000. Cotton cloth has also fallen slightly, and all kinds of cloth have fallen by 5,000 yuan.

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 19th] The Beiping Trade Association held a board meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the trade issues in Beiping after the foreign exchange meeting. It was generally believed that since exports do not need to be settled at the official rate, Beiping's exports can be greatly increased. However, most still believe that it is necessary to ensure that exporters have a considerable import quota in the new foreign exchange and trade regulations. Beiping's main trade is export. If there are only a large number of exports but no corresponding number of imports can be exchanged back, after a long period of time, Beiping's economy will inevitably be exhausted. In addition, they also hope that the Central Trust Bureau will abandon its past export trade operations in North China and leave them to private companies.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch of the 19th] Various export goods in Hangzhou have suddenly become active. Ping Shui tea has risen from 300,000 to 550,000, tung oil has risen from 660,000 to 750,000, and D-grade raw silk has risen from 29 million to 32 million. However, people are waiting and watching, and transactions are light. All are waiting for the market to develop normally.

Last night, the communications between Beihe Dian and Gucheng were destroyed. The Railway Bureau is very concerned about the unfortunate encounters of several technical personnel and has reported the matter to the Ministry, the Beiping Xing Yuan, and the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, requesting effective protection.

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 19th] Two freight cars on the Bei-Ning Line hit mines again this morning, one between Chadian and Jinxihe, and the other between Chadian and Hangu.

### Communist Remnants in Northern Jiangsu Loot Grain; National Army Advances on Yancheng; Reports of Xinghua and Funing Being Captured

Furthermore, a regiment of the National Army under Bi Shu-Wen is cooperating with another National Army unit to advance rapidly towards Yancheng. The communist bandits who have infiltrated Yancheng City, feeling very panicked due to their unstable foothold, have been detaining a large number of civilian boats in recent days, transporting the looted grain and supplies to Hu Duo.

[Our Dongtai Dispatch of the 19th] It is reported that Xinghua and Funing were captured by bandits yesterday, but public morale is still stable. The National Army stationed in this county is actively strengthening defense works to ensure safety.

The National Army occupying the area has now advanced into Fu'an Town in Shaanxi Province and is assessing the battle results.

### Shen Xi-Zhen and Others Assassinated; Zhonghe Party Members Indignant; Resolution to Send Telegram Condemning Mao Zedong

[Central News Agency, this city] Shen Xi-Zhen, head of the Zhonghe Party's Haimen branch, and Shi Wen-Han, director of general affairs, were assassinated by communist bandits in Haimen on the 28th of last month. Upon hearing the news, Zhonghe Party members here were outraged. After days of discussion, in addition to preparing to hold a memorial service on a regular basis and raising funds to comfort the bereaved families and asking the government to ensure the safety of the party's staff, all believed that the communist bandits did not hesitate to take despicable measures, arbitrarily harming the personnel of political parties without armed forces, which not only violates humanity, but also seeks to place peaceful political parties in an impossible situation for survival. Therefore, all unanimously advocated sending a telegram to Mao Zedong to condemn the actions of these people. The telegram is currently being drafted.

### Civil Rule Promotion Association Drafts Autonomy Regulations; Submitted to Government for Reference

### Northeast "Sealed Legal Tender" Exchanged for Circulation Certificates One-to-One; Jinzhou Central Bank Ordered to Handle

[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch of the 19th] The "sealed legal tender" that was once circulated in the Northeast in 1945 is now allowed to be exchanged for circulation certificates at a one-to-one ratio. The Central Bank of Jinzhou has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to handle the exchange. Teng Mao-Tong, deputy director of the Northeast Xing Yuan Economic Committee, explained this matter, saying that in 1945, when the National Army was expediting its entry through the pass, it advanced rapidly along the Bei-Ning Road. The officers and soldiers of its vanguard troops purchased goods using legal tender at the same rate as the puppet Manchukuo currency at that time. When Commander Du Yu-Ming was stationed in Jinzhou, he learned the truth. In order to avoid losses for merchants, Du's seal was added to the legal tender before it was circulated on the market. At the same time, merchants were allowed to register the legal tender they had used and seal it up for future compensation by the government. The total amount registered was approximately 40 million yuan in legal tender. Later, the Ministry of Finance considered this method to be detrimental to the regulations. After several consultations between the Economic Committee and the Ministry of Finance, it was finally decided to exchange it at a one-to-one ratio. Currently, the county governments and councils of Jinzhou, Jinxi, Suizhong, and Xingcheng counties are each responsible for handing over the sealed legal tender to the Central Bank of Jinzhou for joint inspection and exchange to the registered people.

### UNRRA Staff Stationed in China Request Suspension of Transport; Headquarters Deems it Unwise; Central Committee will Discuss the Resumption of the Transport of Relief Supplies

[Washington Dispatch from Central News Agency, 18th] UNRRA officials here believe that the request by the agency's staff stationed in China to suspend the transport of relief supplies to the National Government is an "unwise and inappropriate move." According to a Shanghai dispatch, more than half of the UNRRA staff stationed in China have cabled the UNRRA Central Committee requesting that UNRRA ships and vehicles not be used by the National Government. UNRRA staff also requested to be transferred away from "a position that supports one side of the truce." An UNRRA spokesperson said that this individual action was not only unwise but also inappropriate, and would only confuse the issue. It would not only fail to solve the problem but would make it even more difficult to solve. The spokesperson said that they had heard that the UNRRA staff in China were preparing to make a request, but had not yet received it. If the request was made by staff of various countries to their national representatives, rather than through the proper procedures of the UNRRA China Office Director, then UNRRA could not recognize it. The UNRRA Central Committee will meet to discuss China's proposal to resume the transport of relief supplies to China.

### CNRRA Henan Branch Formulates Plan to Provide Relief for Autumn Plowing in the Yellow River Flood Area; Allocates Funds to Purchase Wheat Seeds for Distribution to Needy Residents

[Dispatch from this City] The CNRRA Henan Branch implemented a spring plowing and sowing plan in the flood area this year, spending 250,000 euros to subsidize needy residents in spring plowing, with good results. In order to provide relief for autumn plowing in the flood area, the branch has formulated an autumn planting purchase, transportation, and distribution plan, allocating funds to purchase wheat seeds for distribution to the needy residents in the flood area. The main points of the plan are as follows: (1) In view of the inability of needy residents to clear the fields, all wheat seeds will be distributed free of charge this time to conform to the purpose of relief. (2) The amount of funds for purchasing wheat seeds is estimated to be 10 billion yuan, and a request has been submitted to the headquarters for approval and remittance. (3) The time limit for sowing is set from September 20 to October 10 according to the climate habits of Henan Province. The wheat seeds will be purchased, transported, and distributed at any time within the time limit. (4) The 10 billion yuan for purchasing wheat seeds is planned to be remitted in three installments: 2.5 billion yuan for the first installment, 3.5 billion yuan for the second installment, and 4 billion yuan for the third installment. (5) The wheat seeds will be purchased separately in four locations: Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, and Luohe. The branch will send personnel to organize a wheat seed purchasing committee with various units to be responsible for handling the matter. The distribution quota is stipulated as: 1.5 billion yuan for Kaifeng, 1.5 billion yuan for Zhengzhou, 3.5 billion yuan for Xuchang, and 3.5 billion yuan for Luohe. (6) Based on a market price of approximately 1,500 yuan per catty of wheat, the entire amount of funds can purchase approximately 7.5 million catties of wheat seeds. Calculating 7.5 catties of wheat seeds per mu of land, a total of 1 million mu of land can be sown. (7) In terms of storage and transportation, it is decided that the warehouses in the purchasing locations and the wheat seed purchasing committees will handle the matter jointly with local transportation agencies. The required transportation tools will prioritize the use of CNRRA trucks, and rubber-wheeled vehicles will be available at any time for transportation. (8) The areas for distributing wheat seeds are stipulated as Zhongmu, Weishi, Fugou, Xihua, Yanling, Huaiyang, Taikang, Shenqiu and other counties. (9) Distribution agencies: The land reclamation team is responsible for the area of tractor cultivation, and the various work teams are responsible for other locations. (10) The travel, transportation, packaging, and other expenses for purchasing, transporting, and distributing wheat seeds are approximately 2.5 billion yuan, which will be separately allocated by the headquarters. The first installment of funds from the headquarters has already been received. The four seed committees in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, and Luohe have also been appointed by the branch, and various tasks can be actively launched according to the planned plan.

### US Soldier in Nanjing Bridge Incident Convicted; Accomplice's Trial Awaited for Joint Announcement

[Nanjing Dispatch from this Newspaper, 19th] The Nanjing Bridge Tragedy continued to be heard on the morning of the 19th. After briefly questioning the two defendants and US Military Police Captain Potter, the debate began. In the afternoon, a secret vote was held to determine the punishment to be imposed on the defendant Adore. At 6 p.m., Presiding Judge Colonel Mao Xiao announced that the results of the verdict would be announced jointly after the accomplice Savane was tried on another day and submitted to the responsible officer (General Rooks) for approval. The court adjourned at 6:30 p.m.

After the court opened at 9:45 a.m., Adore was questioned first. Adore did not deny his involvement in the case, but said that he was informed of it by a colleague afterwards and reported it to the military police captain in surprise. Next, Saveani was questioned. His testimony was generally that he didn't know. Captain Potter reported that he had interrogated Adore and Saveani regarding the case. After the debate began, Prosecutor Gan De first stated three reasons: (1) The facts of the crime are all there. Witnesses saw the defendants continuously pushing the two people into the water, and the victims' bodies were confirmed by doctors to have drowned. This behavior, done of free will, was premeditated. (2) No one proved that the defendants were not so drunk as to be unconscious. (3) In a clear state of mind, pushing people into the river and drowning them clearly shows intent to kill. Next, defense lawyers Major Eustis and Major Markey argued that the defendants were overly excited because they were about to get married, so they got drunk after drinking a little. Throwing people into the river was actually a "dragging corpse" prank in a moment of joy, but unexpectedly resulted in a catastrophe. As for what was said to the machine gun and field military police over the phone after returning to camp, it was also an unconscious rambling after the fact, which is not enough to prove that the defendant premeditated. The prosecutor refuted that the crime in this case was extremely serious and could not be concealed with a prank. Witnesses proved that the deceased were pushed into the water by the defendants, so he still insisted that Adore was guilty of murder. The debate ended at 10 a.m. In the afternoon, after a closed meeting, the judges voted to find Adore guilty. At this point, the trial of the Nanjing Bridge Tragedy came to an end.

### Navy Headquarters to Send Ships Again for Second Patrol of Xisha Islands; Taiwan Fertilizer Company to Send Personnel to Investigate Phosphate Deposits

[Taipei Dispatch from Central News Agency, 19th] The Navy Headquarters has decided to send warships again from Guangzhou to the Xisha Islands for the second patrol since our country took over the islands. The islands are rich in guano (i.e., phosphate deposits), which is an important raw material for manufacturing chemical fertilizers. Although the island is currently under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Provincial Government, the phosphate rights belong to the Resources Committee. The Taiwan Fertilizer Company, run by the committee, has decided to send two engineers, Lin Hanting and Shen Ke'e, to accompany the ships to investigate and plans to transport the phosphate deposits to Taiwan to manufacture fertilizers. According to Tang Yuanji, the general manager of the company, the company has two factories that produce phosphate ore, one in Kaohsiung with an annual output of 17,000 tons and one in Keelung with an annual output of 15,000 tons. However, it is heard that the harbors on the Xisha Islands are poor and the beaches are too shallow, and it will be necessary to wait until the 400-meter-long pier is repaired before seagoing vessels can dock. It is also heard that the warships sent by the Navy Headquarters will depart within this month.

### Editorial: The Unwise Actions of UNRRA Staff in China!

The China Office of UNRRA previously, because the Chinese government did not protect relief supplies distributed in war zones, resulting in UNRRA halting the transport of relief supplies to Communist-controlled areas, considering it a violation of the principle of equal distribution of relief supplies, proposed to UNRRA headquarters a plan to cease transportation to North China. The Central Executive Committee of UNRRA, not understanding the actual situation, actually instructed the China Office to comply and presented two measures, requesting the Chinese government to accept them. UNRRA using "cessation of transport" as a means to coerce the Chinese government into accepting its proposed measures was naturally unacceptable to the Chinese government. Therefore, this issue has been deadlocked and unresolved to this day. According to a Reuters report from this city published in yesterday's English-language *Continental Daily News*, staff members of the UNRRA China Office jointly telegraphed the UNRRA Central Executive Committee, requesting an immediate halt to the transport of relief supplies to China. When we saw this news in the newspapers, we were truly dumbfounded. At the same time, according to a broadcast from San Francisco at 7:00 AM on the 19th, senior UNRRA officials unanimously considered the demands of the China Office staff to be "unwise and inappropriate," sufficient to further complicate the matter and create even greater negative consequences.

This newspaper has previously commented on the suspension of UNRRA supplies to North China and has frankly pointed out that the Chinese nation is a great and strong nation. Rather than wagging our tails and begging for "leftover food," it would be better to grit our teeth, endure hunger and cold, and seek ways to regenerate ourselves. Therefore, we suggest that the government resolutely reject UNRRA's recommendations. If UNRRA insists on its own way, we would rather have UNRRA's work in China end sooner. As for why we make this suggestion, it is very simple:

First, UNRRA insists that relief supplies sent to China should be distributed equally, regardless of whether it is a government-controlled area or a Communist-controlled area. If UNRRA's supplies could be directly distributed to the common people after being transported to the Communist areas, we would, of course, wholeheartedly agree; however, according to the actual situation in the Communist areas, not to mention relief supplies transported from abroad, even the necessities of life for the people themselves, such as food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, cannot be kept for their own use. Therefore, UNRRA transporting relief supplies to the Communist areas, on the surface, seems to be relieving the people there; but in reality, it is tantamount to assisting the Communists and cultivating their strength to create chaos and harm the country. Since the government explicitly ordered the suppression of the rebellion, mobilizing national manpower and resources to suppress the Communists and build the country, it should no longer allow UNRRA to practice the reality of assisting the Communists under the guise of charitable relief.

Second, in the recent one or two months, reports of disasters in the country have been pouring in. In addition to the major flood of the Yellow River, Guangdong, Sichuan, and northern Jiangsu are also experiencing floods. The severity of the disasters is shocking. General Albert Wedemeyer, President Truman's special envoy, also said: "The floods between the old and new courses of the Yellow River have left millions homeless and at risk of starvation and cold this winter." We believe that the UNRRA China Office staff who telegraphed the UNRRA Central Executive Committee to halt the transport of supplies to China must be well aware of the current disasters in China. Why must they disregard the disaster victims and want to assist the Communists? UNRRA is an international relief organization, so how can it "refuse to eat for fear of choking"?

UNRRA's China Office has been working in China for nearly two years. Those who have been directly assisted by the people have certainly benefited significantly, but the general public's impression of UNRRA staff is not very good. They ultimately feel that their daily lives are luxurious. Just the fact that UNRRA's cars fill the streets is enough to illustrate the superior treatment of UNRRA staff. Now that they are requesting UNRRA to halt the transport of supplies to China, we should ask them to return home as soon as possible to avoid using the supplies for relieving refugees in unproductive places!

### Argentina Will Abandon Veto Power

The Pan-American Conference opened in the Brazilian capital on the 15th to discuss the issue of Western Hemisphere collective defense. In recent days, major progress has been made. According to a Reuters report, the Argentine Foreign Minister is inclined to abandon the "veto power," which cannot be said to be a major success in American diplomacy. According to Secretary of State Marshall, he advocated that the twenty republics of the Americas should not remain neutral or stand aloof when resisting aggression in the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. Any collective action, if approved by a two-thirds majority, should be uniformly implemented by all contracting states, but does not require any country to provide troops. At the time, this proposal encountered great resistance, especially from Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, who insisted on the principle that collective action must be approved by "all" parties, causing Secretary Marshall considerable distress.

Legally speaking, the United States hopes for this Pan-American Conference to establish a long-term Western Hemisphere collective defense treaty based on the principles of the Chapultepec Agreement established in March 1945 to maintain peace and security in the Western Hemisphere, which is fully in line with the regional security measures stipulated in Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. Naturally, it is easy to gain the support of various American countries, but from another perspective, the United States' plan also has its difficulties in achieving complete implementation: First, the suspicion outside the Western Hemisphere, especially the opposition from the Soviet Union and the suspicion from the United Kingdom, is unavoidable. In the eyes of Britain and the Soviet Union, the collective defense of the Western Hemisphere is tantamount to the United States strengthening its control over the various American countries; naturally, it cannot be tolerated by the Soviet Union, which is in opposition to the United States. Second, there are internal obstacles within the Western Hemisphere. Not only does Argentina advocate collective defense in the Western Hemisphere and take unified action in the event of foreign aggression; it also proposes the standardization of military equipment among the various American countries. In the eyes of some countries, especially Argentina, the fact that their own military equipment must also be standardized according to the American model cannot help but feel that their national defense must rely more on the United States and cannot be independent. At the same time, some people in several countries believe that the implementation of the Western Hemisphere collective defense plan will inevitably increase the burden on the people, and they cannot help but express opposition emotionally.

In the eyes of the US authorities, the above-mentioned difficulties are most worthy of attention. It is also the internal obstacles in the Western Hemisphere, especially the stubborn attitude of Argentina. Therefore, since the opening of the American Conference, Secretary of State Marshall has been using diplomatic means, always targeting Argentina. If Reuters' report is true, then Secretary of State Marshall's diplomacy can be said to have achieved considerable success.

It is expected that this Pan-American Conference will come to a satisfactory conclusion, and the peace and security of the Western Hemisphere can also be guaranteed as a result. For the Western Hemisphere, it is naturally the establishment of a regional security system; for the entire world peace, it will naturally make a considerable contribution. At a time when the world is disturbed, the conclusion of the Western Hemisphere Collective Defense Treaty is particularly valuable to us!

### Security Council Continues to Discuss India-Netherlands Dispute; Soviet Union Insists on International Arbitration and Expresses Strong Dissatisfaction with US Mediation Proposal

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council resumed discussion of the India-Netherlands dispute today. Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko launched a strong attack on the American "mediation," believing that this move by the United States was "overstepping its bounds" in terms of the authority of the United Nations.

Another report: Gromyko requested the Security Council to immediately take two steps: (1) establish a commission of inquiry; (2) establish an arbitration mechanism. Gromyko stated that the United States is unwilling to let the United Nations mediate the India-Netherlands dispute because the United States itself has a great deal of interest in Indonesia.

[Reuters, The Hague, 18th] It was officially revealed here: The United Kingdom has already withdrawn its proposal to mediate the India-Netherlands dispute. The Dutch government has received a telegram from the British Foreign Office stating that the United Kingdom will not take measures to mediate the India-Netherlands dispute unless both India and the Netherlands request British mediation again, in which case the United Kingdom can reconsider the matter. It is reported that the Dutch government is more willing to accept the American mediation proposal.

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Dutch Ambassador to the United States Dr. Eelco van Kleffens strongly stated on the evening of the 18th that the Dutch government believes that the Security Council has no right to intervene in the Indonesian dispute. After a 45-minute meeting with US Acting Secretary of State Robert Lovett, van Kleffens said that the Netherlands is still willing to accept the United States' "mediation" in the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. Although the Indonesian government has also accepted the American proposal, it has reservations. Unless Indonesia cancels its reservations, the United States may abandon its mediation efforts.

### Indonesia Promulgates Laws to Effectively Protect Overseas Chinese

If their residences have been destroyed, they must be provided with accommodation, with all expenses borne by the Indonesian government; (3) If the original residences of the Chinese are currently in Dutch-occupied areas, their living expenses shall be paid by the Indonesian government. If they have family members residing in Indonesian areas, the Indonesian government will arrange for them to reunite; (4) Anyone who loots Chinese property during the Dutch occupation will be executed. The Indonesian government will take legal steps to deal with gangsters whose crimes have been confirmed.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 18th] The 5,000 overseas Chinese in Binjai, 60 kilometers north of Medan, Sumatra, are facing starvation. They are currently sleeping in the open because their houses have been destroyed by the Indonesian military's so-called "scorched earth policy."

### Party Strife in Japan Surface; Liberal Party Decides to Abandon Four-Party Agreement; Government Parties Publicly Condemn It

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The Liberal Party held an executive meeting today and decided to abandon the four-party political agreement, placing the Katayama Cabinet in the position of a purely opposition party. In the afternoon, it convened a meeting of the party's members of parliament, and the executive meeting's resolution was unanimously approved. The main points of the resolution are: The cabinet is already facing practical political difficulties and is hesitant to move forward, using the constraints of the four-party policy agreement as a pretext to embellish the matter. It has violated the four-party agreement on the issue of national coal mine management, and even publicly stated that there is no room for negotiation with the Liberal Party on the decision of national coal mine management. Therefore, the Liberal Party is not bound by the four-party policy agreement, and from now on, will move forward in its own direction.

President Yoshida also issued a statement saying: The Liberal Party will stand in the position of a model opposition party in the future and judge issues from a purely right and wrong perspective. Nishio of the Socialist Party also commented on this, saying: The Liberal Party's statement of being an opposition party is nothing more than a couple who have been separated for a long time now issuing a divorce statement, so there is no change in the political situation. The Socialist Party initially wanted to form a four-party coalition cabinet, but because the positions of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party were extremely opposed, and it was deeply feared that this kind of atmosphere would seep into the cabinet, it resolutely formed a three-party cabinet. Since then, it has not particularly actively valued the existence of the Liberal Party, nor has it severed ties with it. The three governing parties also convened a representative meeting this afternoon and issued a statement saying: Since the establishment of the Katayama Cabinet, the Liberal Party has provided no cooperation, and this time it has automatically betrayed the four-party policy agreement.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] When the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Councillors was discussing the bill to establish a Ministry of Labor, Liberal Party member Mitsuhiro Ono suddenly proposed an amendment, and Socialist Party member Suetsugu Yoshikawa requested a postponement of the vote, so it was decided to postpone the vote to the 20th.

### Zhao Zengjue Discusses Public Utilities Issues: Guarantees No Price Increases Within Ten Days; Automatic Adjustment Method Under Review; National Economic Council Dispatches Counselor to Shanghai to Confer with City Government

### Re-Investigation of the Attempted Assassination of Huang Bohui: Zheng Desheng Indicted; Suspected of Instigating Attempted Murder

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Zheng Desheng being accused of instigating murder by Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Shibao (The Times), has been returned by the High Prosecutor's Office for re-investigation. Yesterday, the prosecutor of the District Court filed a lawsuit. The main points of the indictment are excerpted below: The plaintiff, Huang Bohui, is the owner of the Shibao Building at 179 Hubei Road and lives on the fifth floor of the building. The defendant, Zheng Desheng, lives in rooms 303 and 307 on the third floor of the building. Due to housing disputes, the relationship between the two gradually became cold. Zheng has two American friends, namely Caswell and Mexiu (the chief mate and second mate of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Wan Jian ship), who are at large. Zheng had talked to them about his housing dispute with Huang Bohui and discussed ways to deal with it. Late at night on February 18 of this year, Huang returned home from the outside and walked to the corner of the third and fourth floors. Suddenly, two Westerners, one pulled his right arm, and the other

Fired a shot at him.

Because the bullet was inaccurate, it only grazed the corner of his right head, causing injury but not death. The two Westerners fled in a hurry. Wu Kechang, the gatekeeper of the building, returned home at 11:00 PM and saw Zheng's daughter, Zheng Jingyan, escorting the two Westerners downstairs. Huang knew that Zheng had Western friends and had a grudge against him, so he suspected that he had instigated the assassination and filed a lawsuit, which had been dismissed by this office. The plaintiff refused to accept the decision and applied for reconsideration, which was returned for re-investigation. After arriving at the case, this prosecutor inspected the scene of the incident on May 23 and ordered Huang Bohui to demonstrate the situation at the time, and then seized the

Skull photos

Taken by the Wuzhou American X-ray Therapy Room and identified by Yang Shida, a professor of forensic medicine at Aurora University, proving that it was caused by a gunshot wound. On the evening of Huang Bohui's attack, the defendant Zheng Desheng claimed to be in Nanjing. At that time, the newspapers were full of reports, and Zheng's mother and daughter were detained. Zheng could have stood up, but why did he only surrender after a period of time? Also, the defendant claimed to live in Liu Jianqun's home in Nanjing. After being asked, Liu said that the date was not clear. According to the defendant, Huang was assassinated at 11:00 PM on the same night when he arrived in Shanghai by car on February 18, and the newspaper published it on the 19th. According to common sense, Liu Jianqun could not remember the exact date, but he

Can say, he did live in my house the day before the incident, why did he answer that he could not remember clearly? After the incident, the police sent personnel to investigate, 　　Yan and Zheng Baowen

Were very flustered.

Regarding the housing dispute, the defendant admitted that he had told Caswell about it. Wu Kechang, who was treated better than Zheng, also testified that he saw Zheng's neighbor escorting two foreigners downstairs. At the scene of the crime, the murderer left behind two different gloves, one sheepskin and one yellow leather, both of which were military gloves. Caswell has no grudge against Huang, so why would he want to kill him? It can be determined that he was instigated by the defendant. Caswell fled to avoid punishment and has been ordered to be apprehended. Zheng Desheng is suspected of instigating attempted murder and is being prosecuted according to law.

It is said that the letter will be sent out today.

"UNRRA Staff Association" Reveals 13 Points of "Shady Dealings"

According to a report by the Republican News Agency, a so-called "UNRRA Staff Association" sent a letter to the agency yesterday, listing 13 points of "facts" about the "shady dealings" of UNRRA in the past two years. Among the more glaring ones are: (1) Only Dong Chengdao and Li Zhuo signed the UNRRA's business payment procedures, and Director Huo never asked about them. (2) What the Director of the UNRRA said about having accounting personnel stationed in the office only refers to the funds allocated by the National Treasury, which is insignificant compared to the entire business expenses of the UNRRA. (3) The newspapers received by the General Affairs Office are cut into small sheets from large sheets for each person, but the number of sheets recorded in the ledger is still the same. (4) More than 2,000 large and small cars were shipped by UNRRA, and the wooden boxes used to load the cars were sold for 200,000 yuan per bag last year, but were not recorded in the accounts. (5) UNRRA has no inventory of assets to date.

Custom-Made Flour Bags Given as Gifts of Western-Style Houses

(6) Hou Chang, General Manager of the Materials Purchasing and Sales Office, ordered tens of millions of flour bags from the Anle Wool Textile Factory in one go, and the factory gave him a small Western-style house as a gift. (7) The Wufu Company was opened by Dong Chengdao, and the first batch of American military food boxes of UNRRA was purchased by the company. (8) Deputy Director Li has exclusive control of UNRRA, employs private individuals, and important supervisors are all from the same background. (9) The Storage and Transportation Bureau was allocated more than 100 wooden barges and iron ships, which were transferred to the United and Fuxin trading houses for management. In fact, these two trading houses are just dummy companies.

Inspecting UNRRA's Accounts

He Huimin, the prosecutor appointed to thoroughly investigate the alleged corruption of senior UNRRA officials, inspected the relevant accounts of UNRRA at the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday.

Also, the Supervisory Council had previously received a letter from UNRRA requesting an investigation. According to the council, thoroughly investigating corruption is the council's duty, and no invitation is needed. The letter will not be answered.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Sa Benju being accused by "fallen wife" of adultery with "anti-Japanese wife," and being sentenced to four months of imprisonment with two years probation by the District Court, was once sensational. Recently, "fallen wife" Chen Jizheng learned that Sa was still living with "anti-Japanese wife" Shi in a rented house at No. 60, Lane 532, Yuyuan Road, and was continuing to commit adultery. So she reported to the police and arrested Sa and Shi at the address the day before yesterday, but they were immediately released on bail. Yesterday afternoon, the lawyers representing both parties held negotiations on this matter at the Rongkang Wine House on Jingan Temple Road. As a result, it was decided that would pay Chen Jizheng a living allowance of 300 million yuan and formally announce the divorce.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchant Ship Masters Association, the China Marine Engineers Association, the China Ship Wireless Operators Association, the China Maritime Pilots Association, and the Song-Han District Pilotage Association, among other five maritime groups, gathered over two hundred members in Shanghai. Led by Jin Yueshi, Lu Liangbing, Jiang Keni, Ye Bingkui, Zhang Mingqian, Hua Binwen, and others as general representatives, they marched in formation to the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Maritime Bureau yesterday morning to petition against lowering the treatment of sailors under any pretext. They stated that the shipping industry had reached a period of revival, but some merchants were planning to take advantage of the opportunity to lower the treatment of sailors, which they found deeply indignant. They requested Mayor Wu to consider the needs of shipping and military transport and to help prevent this measure, which could lead to labor-management disputes. Mayor Wu expressed considerable sympathy and offered encouragement, urging them to consider the national environment and avoid any irregular actions. He advised them to follow legal procedures or request arbitration from the relevant authorities to seek a reasonable resolution.

The petitioning group then proceeded to the Shanghai Maritime Bureau and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to petition. Director Huang Muzong of the Maritime Bureau and Deputy General Manager Wei of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company respectively received them, expressing sympathy for all sailors and promising to forward their petition to the Ministry of Communications.

Three Points of Declaration Published

Mr. Yang stated that he was willing to guarantee on behalf of the Federation that there would be no reduction in sailors' treatment and hoped that all members could work with peace of mind and not easily believe rumors. The representatives of the five groups believed that the facts were very clear and accepted the Federation's opinion, issuing the following statement: (1) Since the Federation has taken responsibility for declaring that there is no reduction in sailors' treatment, the five groups naturally trust this and have no misunderstanding with the Federation. (2) They hope that third parties will face reality and consider the shipping industry as a whole. (3) They hope that all members will strictly adhere to their posts and work with peace of mind under close cooperation between labor and management.

### Joint Defense of Hebei and Chahar: Embarking on a Journey with the Army

[Our Newspaper's Report from Zhangjiakou on the 15th] The Joint Defense of Hebei and Chahar has finally been realized amidst hardship. This battle-hardened force of infantry and cavalry, which once swept across the battlefields of Chahar and Suiyuan, will once again arrive on the plains of Hebei. I am honored to participate in this journey to central Hebei, and as a reporter, I am probably the only one accompanying the army.

In the dim night, the train crept along the Ping-Sui Railway. Currently, this is the only railway in the north that is intact and dares to operate at night. The soldiers were very tired and quickly fell asleep. The night was exceptionally quiet, with only the sound of steel clanging mixed with a few sharp whistles. I accompanied the command post's train and passed Kangzhuang at dawn the next day. The platform was very deserted, with only a few children selling tea, shuttling between customers. Regardless of the size of the bowl, each bowl cost 500 yuan. The train continued to move, and the scenery outside Nankou was different. The wheat seedlings in Chahar were less than five inches tall, while the wheat stalks in northern Hebei were already bearing plump ears. Entering the Ping-Bao Line, it was already time for summer wheat to ripen.

Three Hundred Li of Desolate Scenery on the Ping-Bao Line

The train spent a relatively long time resting at Xizhimen Station. Few trains stop here, and there are not many passengers. Compared to Qianmen Station, it appears quiet and orderly. After the command post received orders from the Bao-Yuan-Sui Pacification Office, the military train switched to the Ping-Bao Line at 2 PM and began combat marching. Due to the unclear situation along the way, they proceeded cautiously, asking questions as they went. Passing through Wanping County, the Lugou Bridge could be seen standing on the Yongding River. Many of the people on the train were comrades who had participated in the War of Resistance against Japan in 1937. After ten years, they still had to travel through the flames of war, and they could not help but feel a thousand emotions in silence.

South of Changxindian, the stations were desolate and lonely, full of signs of war. At Liangxiang Station, soldiers were rushing to build bunkers and fortifications. Baodian Station was destroyed by the communists, leaving only broken walls. At each station's entrance and exit, and at both ends of each bridge, there were Western-style pillboxes, and a force of soldiers was stationed to guard them. They huddled in the pillboxes at night, isolated, watching and unable to support each other. Outside the bunkers was the territory of communist activity. The three hundred-plus li of the Ping-Bao Line struggled in the misfortune of "destruction" and repair. Some said that if the labor and materials used for repairs in the past year were accumulated, they would be enough to build another Ping-Bao road. This time, the destruction was particularly severe. South of Dingxing, there were almost no intact sleepers or rails. The communists carried out organized and planned destruction, organizing the villages along the railway line and assigning them the responsibility of destruction by section and time limit. Otherwise, they would be killed for the crime of "national special agent," so the degree of destruction can be said to be widespread and thorough.

The troops got off the train in Zhuozhou County, and they could come into contact with the communists at any time to the south. Zhuozhou was still peaceful. The story of General Fu Zuoyi's defense of Zhuozhou that year is still popular among the people and is endlessly praised. The busy farming season was in full swing, and few cattle were seen in the fields. I saw a family of seven, old and young, pulling a plow to sow seeds, and the waterwheel was also cranked by people. When I asked, I learned that their livestock had been lost in the war.

Mobile Mopping-Up

Nie Rongzhen, the commander of the communist Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, can be considered General Fu Zuoyi's defeated opponent. The Battle of Suiyuan-Baotou, the Battle of Jining-Weihui, and the recovery of Chahar Province all gave Nie's troops a series of heavy blows and never allowed him to gain any advantage. In this mopping-up campaign in central Hebei, the communists avoided battle even more, maintaining a distance of one hundred li at all times. When the army recovered Xushui, the communist army lifted the siege of Baoding, and the Ping-Bao Road was opened. At first, it was thought that the communists would hold on to Hejian, but after the recovery of Gaoyang, the communist army fled back to the west side of the Ping-Han Road. Then the army moved, passing through Lixian, Boye, Anguo, Wangdu, and arriving at Dingzhou. At that time, the communist army had already fled far away to Quyang, drilling into the mountains, and never came into contact with its main force. After more than a month of mobile mopping-up, the military operation came to an end.

The people of central Hebei were breathing under the harassment of the communist army's three main columns (second, third, and fourth). They hoped that the National Army would fully rescue them, ensure lasting peace and security, and looked forward to capable officials and enlightened politics to improve the people's livelihood.

### Smuggling by Japanese Ships in Southern Fujian: Customs Search Unsuccessful

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Fuzhou on the 19th] Smuggling is rampant on the waters of southern Fujian. The Xiamen Customs previously received a tip that two Japanese ships were unloading smuggled goods in the Chongwu waters near Xiamen Port. They dispatched anti-smuggling boats to arrest them, but they had already fled after hearing the news. They are still being searched for. [Another Dispatch] The National Goods Exhibition is about to be held in Beijing. The lacquerware, paper umbrellas, carvings, and wooden clogs here are all special artistic products. It was originally intended to participate in the exhibition, but due to transportation difficulties and high transportation costs, merchants are hesitating and unable to make a decision.

### Three Wild Men Discovered in the Border Area of Poyang and Leping

Blue Eyes, Brown Hair, Teeth Like Saws, Covered in Scales, Hands Like Baskets

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanchang on the 15th] Three giant wild men were recently discovered near Ciyi Village in the border area of Poyang and Leping, in the "Bobaijian" mountain. They often roam between the paddy fields, devouring the loaches in the fields and the pigs and dogs nearby, causing hardship to the villagers. Those who work in the fields during the day carry sticks to defend themselves. The wild men mostly appear at dusk. When evening approaches, the villagers close their doors and do not dare to go out. Some people secretly peek through the cracks in the doors and see the three wild men marching in formation. The larger two are about seven or eight feet tall, and the smaller one is over five feet tall. They have blue eyes, brown hair, teeth like saws, hands like baskets, and are covered in scales. Their feet are more than a foot long, and they walk very fast. The villagers are all surprised and afraid, daring not to chase them, nor daring to attack them. Every night, they hear extremely loud howls from the wild men. The villagers are spreading the news, but due to superstition, they have not yet devised a countermeasure.

### Sun Liangyu, Director of Qingpu Field Grain Office, Temporarily Placed Under Supervision

County Magistrate Orders Limited-Time Completion of Registry and Transfer

Former Deputy Director Deng Liangnan of this County Field Grain Office was dismissed from his post due to a case. After Jin Xingtan came to the county to take over, two months have passed. The financial income and expenditure of Deng's tenure has always been handled by Accounting Director Sun Liangyu, and the accounts are unclear and a mess, and have not yet been settled and handed over. Recently, the County Council discovered financial malpractices such as the accounting office privately transferring warehouse construction costs for personal gain and falsely reporting the concentration warehouse Teng Branch public funds of the township offices, and the County Council is issuing a letter to the County to thoroughly investigate. Unexpectedly, the recent Jin Deputy Director found in the office two ledgers (offsetting a tax quota of more than 7,000 shi) with more than 3,000 advance receipts of grain households from the city office paid as field tax; the director claimed the books are managed by the office; the director stated that the ledgers were lost; according to the office, Statistician Li Jingmei had already handed them to the Sun Director's Office, but Li Jingmei said that he had already handed them to Sun. Each side sticks to his own explanation, so Director Jin Xun reported to the County Chief and placed Li Jingmei under supervision first, and he was soon released on bail. Yesterday morning, the Director Sun Liangyu, was suddenly discovered at the Qing-Hu Road Songze Village Station by County Chief Liu in the course of returning to Qing from Shanghai. The Director was walking to the station from Qing and was waiting for a train to Shanghai. County Chief Liu believed that the Director's whereabouts were mysterious and obviously intended to abscond, so he sent police officers to arrest him back to the city, placing him under temporary supervision, ordering him to hand over the receipt ledgers, while supervising the clearing of Deng's accounts, setting a deadline for the creation of a registry and transfer, in order to stress the handover of the case.

### Suzhou Council

Councilors Think the Military Service Allotment is Unequal

Requests to Review the Shen Kai Embezzlement Case Files

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Suzhou on the 19th] Today was the second day of the Suzhou Council's Second General Assembly.

In the morning, there was a report on the county government's administration, including civil affairs, finance, education, construction, security, society, police affairs, accounting, land administration, field grain, taxation, and military law. Councilors raised inquiries one after another, first pointing out that the collection of grain and rent did not distinguish between rich and poor, causing many malpractices and making it difficult for the villagers to bear the harassment, causing the assembly to invite the Deputy Director of the Field Grain Office, Zhu Shaoqing, to reply, promising to strive to improve it, and the atmosphere at the meeting began to ease. Then there were also inquiries about the issue of rickshaws collecting construction subsidies. The meeting continued in the afternoon, with repeated climaxes. Councilors expressed their incomprehension about the handling of the Shen Kai embezzlement case at the General Tax Collection Office. After the assembly resolved, it was decided to invite County Chief Shen, Chief Guan of the District Prosecutor's Office, and Shen Kai to the meeting on the afternoon of the 20th, bringing with them the case files and ledgers to report. Secondly, councilors from various township districts believed that the current military service quota was unfairly distributed and should be the responsibility of the competent personnel to reply, and requested the County Government to re-determine the number of conscripts in consultation with the Regiment Management District; otherwise, the township district councilors would all withdraw. The assembly decided to invite relevant agencies such as the Regiment Management District to the meeting on the afternoon of the 20th to discuss and confirm. The assembly adjourned at 7:00 PM.

### Zhang Lingfu's Remains Still Being Searched For

[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Liao Kuanghua's Dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th] It has been almost two months since the Battle of Menglianggu. The remains of the late Deputy Division Commander Cai, the late Brigade Commander Lu, and the late Deputy Brigade Commander Ming have been transported to the rear one after another. Only the remains of Division Commander Zhang Lingfu have not yet been found, and looking north at the sky, we feel even more sorrow. For this matter, Division Commander Qiu once inquired about the returning soldiers who witnessed Division Commander Zhang's suicide at the time. According to Division Commander Qiu's statistics, there are three different versions: (1) After the communist army discovered Division Commander Zhang Lingfu's body, they put it in a coffin and transported it to the north bank of the Yi River, where there is a stele with the words "Zhang Lingfu's Corpse" engraved on it. This was witnessed by local people! (2) The late Division Commander Zhang's remains were buried by the communist army thirty li southwest of the Yi River. The inscription on the stele reads, "The grave of Zhang Lingfu, the lieutenant general and division commander of the 74th Division, the lifeline of the Chiang army, who was killed for carrying out reactionary tasks." This stele is made of six-foot-high bluestone. (3) After discovering the late Division Commander Zhang's body, the communist army threw it into the river.

Mostly Export Settlements, Fewer Imports

Government bonds recovered yesterday, with activity in various bonds. Unified C bonds opened at 11,900 yuan, and from 11,800 yuan, rooms 614 and 360 rose to 13,700 yuan. Room 555 sold at high prices, with the price dropping to 13,100 yuan. Unified D bonds closed around 11,500 yuan to 11,100 yuan, with a turnover of approximately 7 million. Compared to the previous close, Unified A, B, and C bonds each rose by 1%, Unified D bonds rose by 800 yuan, and Unified E bonds also rose by 1,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks declined yesterday due to continued selling by securities firms and foreign firms. Cantonese firms also sold, while buying by retail investors was limited, resulting in oversupply. In the absence of other stimuli, Ewo Cotton Mill fell from 87,000 yuan to close at 85,000 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Jardine Spinning, Canton Paper, Shanghai Telephone, and Ziang Hai were flat. Sassoon, Jardine Matheson, Ewo Yuen, and China Merchants Steam Navigation declined, while China Steel slightly rose. Ewo Cotton Mill and British American Tobacco each fell by 0.5%.

### Investor Sentiment Weak, Selling Pressure High, Chinese Stocks Showed Slight Decline From Stable Level

Yesterday's stock market was affected by unfavorable news, such as the cutting of telephone lines on the seventh floor. Over-the-counter deliveries continued to flood the market, and interest rates remained at the original price, resulting in a slight decline from a stable level. News of bank loan stoppages further destabilized the market, eventually leading to a decline, with various stocks closing at lower prices.

The market initially opened higher due to the official announcement of the Central Bank's US dollar exchange rate, which was higher than previous rumors, slightly restoring investor confidence. After the closure of "Di Yong Spinning", the situation fluctuated, with numbers 235, 224, and 60 being sold, and 106, 186, and 180 rising, with the market price around 230 yuan. After numbers 14, 224, 223, and 16 sold, the market fell from 233 yuan to 225 yuan. Numbers 85, 97, 219, and 129 still rose, managing to recover to 231 yuan. Subsequently, police officers from the seventh floor removed the intercom telephones, causing investor confidence to waver. Numbers 223, 163, 82, 104, and 36 were sold. Although 235 rose, 16, 83, and 130 also resold "Yong Spinning", falling to 222 yuan.

At 10:30 AM, the over-the-counter interest rate was still 1.8 fen, 2 fen, and 2.5 fen. Numbers 104, 105, 84, 4, 207, 154, 135, 14, and 24 rose, gradually recovering. "Yong Spinning" rose to 228 yuan. Near noon, rumors of bank loan stoppages caused numbers 163, 235, 223, and 112 to sell off. Before the close, "Yong Spinning" dropped to 219 yuan, before closing at 220 yuan.

After the close, numbers 220 and 163 came in to buy, with bids rising to 223 yuan. Compared to the previous close, instant delivery stocks showed slight gains for Yong Spinning, Mei Ya, Xin Guang, Yong Gong, Qin Xing, Zhong Fa, and slight decreases for Jing Fu, Xin Hua was still flat, while Rong Feng, Zhong Fang, Tong Yi, Zhong Si, Shang Wu, Wu He and Li An underwear each fell half a percent, and Guo Huo and Jing Lun showed slight declines. For deferred delivery stocks, Yong Spinning, Mei Ya, Hua Feng, Xin Guang, Jing Fu Company all declined slightly. For over-the-counter old stocks, Da Sheng and Nan Yang rose half a percent, while Zhong Hua, Pu Dong and Wu Zhou fell half a percent, with the remainder being flat.

### The Cotton Yarn Pricing Sub-Committee Decided To Maintain the Original Negotiated Price For Cotton Yarn and Continue to Allocate Yarn To Regulate Supply and Demand in the Yarn Market.

[Our Report] After an exchange of views among the members of the Cotton Yarn Pricing Sub-Committee of the Textile Adjustment Meeting yesterday, it was decided to maintain the originally negotiated price for cotton yarn in order to stabilize the market price of cotton yarn. At the same time, the allocation of cotton yarn will continue to be increased in order to regulate supply and demand in the yarn market.

Yarn Prices Rebounded

The cotton yarn market opened yesterday with a slightly weak market trend after the large-scale opening of sales by the Textile Construction Company and factories the day before, and the silver of various parties was slightly tight. However, due to the still good demand at low prices and the cloth price also rebounding after falling, investor sentiment turned firm, and the price rose slightly at the close.

As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 100,000 yuan lower than the previous day, at 17.3 million yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse rose by 100,000 yuan to 12 million yuan. Light Double Horse rose by 150,000 yuan to 10.75 million yuan. 16-count Guang Ming rose by 200,000 yuan to 9.6 million yuan.

Other coarse and fine yarns such as 42-count Water Moon, 40-count Blue Phoenix, 32-count Silver Moon, 22-count Golden Rooster, 20-count Tian Nu Da Fa, and 16-count Special Good, Zu Sanming and Hai Long brands all rose by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan. However, 10-count Boy Scout and Golden Treasure Star dropped by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth Stable

Yesterday, cotton cloth initially declined at the opening, but then Hankou showed a slight interest in Yuan Zhigong and Serge, and the dyeing factories in this street also absorbed fine cloth. From time to time, there were also floating sales, indicating that there were not many cloths in the opening section, and the market rebounded after falling. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose from 440,000 yuan to 520,000 yuan, and closed at 450,000 yuan at noon. Four Gentlemen Serge rose from 460,000 yuan to 470,000 yuan, which was the same as the previous day. However, after the close, floating households turned to sell, and it was heard that the price of Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 448,000 yuan in transactions. Other grades of fine cloth such as Five Happiness Blue Flowers and Painted Balls, Yanghe Zhenzhong, etc., fell by 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. White Blank Bleached Cloth Group Cloth Fine Twill also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Printed cloth, blue cloth, and Shilin cloth had mutual rises and falls.

Textile Construction Sells Cloth

The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 31,500 bolts of cloth and 750 bed sheets. There were 908 applications. The listed price for White Blank Yanghe Fine Cloth was 364,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen Straight Serge was 520,000 yuan, and Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Serge was 446,000 yuan. There were many applicants, and it was heard that there were many who were purchasing at higher prices.

Raw Cotton Quiet

Raw cotton trading was quiet yesterday. Yarn factories were very lazy in paying, the trend was dull, and the market was weak. Lingbao opened at 2.03 million, 2.05 million, 2.07 million for on-the-spot delivery prices, and Zhoupu cottonseed was 305,000.

### China Trust Bureau Decided to Maintain Last Week's Original Price for the Allocation of Rayon, Yesterday the Market Price Initially Rose Sharply and then Fell Back Near the Close

Regarding the rayon allocation price issue, representatives of the silk weaving industry, such as Cai Xintao, had discussed it with Director Wu Rencang of the China Trust Bureau. Yesterday (the 19th), the China Trust Bureau submitted a meeting discussion. It is understood that the bureau decided to maintain the original price for the allocation of rayon.

Rayon

The market price rose sharply yesterday morning. Until the afternoon, it was learned that the Central Trust Bureau had decided to allocate rayon to the silk weaving industry in the 13th phase today, totaling about 1,000 boxes. Investor sentiment gradually softened and began to fall back. In the morning, 120 counts of Asahi, Takayama, Shiny and other yarns were quoted at 26.8 million yuan. By noon, it rose to 7.22 million yuan, reaching a maximum of 40 million yuan. Dongyang was 6 million yuan. The final price fell to 6.8 million yuan, but there was no transaction.

Factory Warp

The market was stable yesterday, and the transaction price was the same as the previous day. DE grades were both traded, the former at 30.5 million yuan, and the latter at 30 million yuan. In addition, more than a dozen loads were traded, medium-grade goods were 28.5 million to 29 million yuan, and high-grade ones were 30 million to 30.5 million yuan. Yesterday's transaction price for premium-grade, dry-warped Five Ancestor heads was 18.8 million yuan.

Silk Fabrics

The market for quilts fell sharply by 600,000 yuan yesterday due to continuous selling by factories, resulting in successive declines. The opening price of Huaqiang goods was 11.145 million yuan, and then it fell again, with the minimum price being 10.98 million yuan. The closing price for immediate delivery was 1 million yuan, and the deferred date was 40,000 yuan higher. The final price of Dacheng goods was 1.1 million yuan, and the price for the deferred date was quoted at 150,000 yuan higher. The price of checkered crepe was quoted at 36,500 yuan, but there were few transactions. The price of Huajin crepe was 23,500 yuan, and the price of second-class crepe was 2,000 yuan. Transactions of other goods were limited, and prices were relatively stable.

### Hardware Slightly Higher

Hardware goods, however, have seen an increase compared to the previous day. Wire nails have slightly increased by 20,000, and others also have a trend to rise.

### Rice Market Re-enters a Weak State

Yesterday, a total of more than 3,700 shi of rice arrived in Zhabei and Hupudong in Shanghai. Shops were tired of hoarding, and the market traded quietly. The situation re-entered a weak state. Japonica and Indica rice saw declines of 30,000 to 10,000 yuan. White rice also declined by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. New Japonica rice was still rare, while Indica rice was the most sluggish.

Flour had mixed trends, with firm and weak conditions coexisting. Foreign flour and domestic flour developed in opposite directions. Factory flour and mixed brand flour sold well, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while foreign flour was sluggish, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Unified flour was temporarily flat. Bran was being sold off by retail investors, with supply exceeding demand. At noon, it fell sharply, declining by more than 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake remained stable. Soybeans had strong arrival and sales, high fixed times.

The oil market's trend looked weak. Both raw soybean oil fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Canned raw oil fell sharply by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan due to the suspension of transit. Rapeseed oil followed suit, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sesame oil had low supply and demand, with fixed times being soft.

### Shanghai Customs Notice Banning Edible Oil Transit

[Our Report] The Shanghai Customs recently issued a notice, stating: In accordance with the order of the Director-General of Customs, and the order of the Minister of Finance to the Customs, the customs shall temporarily stop the transit of edible oil (including soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil) from Shanghai to Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Bay ports. It is ordered to be implemented immediately.

### Anthracite Market is Firm and Brisk

The sales of bituminous coal from factories were sluggish, and the turnover was very weak. Since the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs cancelled the limit of 100 tons per month for companies that freely purchase bituminous coal, the arrival of Chenxi Unified Coal from Hankou has been continuously increasing, while the arrival of anthracite coal has been scarce, and the market has been firm and brisk.

Since the current sales price of coal is far from the cost, although there is a large amount of coal in stock on the market, all the dealers are reporting at high prices. Colleagues in the Pingxiang coke industry have also raised the price by 100,000 yuan. Screened coke from Jiaozuo was sold at 2.05 million yuan.

### Lily Bulbs Cheap

Lily bulbs have been arriving continuously, and the supply is adequate for the demand, so the market price is getting cheaper every day. The current market price has dropped by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and they are being sold for 65 to 66 million yuan.

### After the Announcement of the Exchange Rate, the Quoted Price of Export Tea Rose and All Goods in Stock in Shanghai Can Be Fully Exported

It is understood that since the announcement of the new foreign exchange measures, the export tea market has suddenly become active, and the quoted prices have all risen. According to Director Tang Jishen of the Tea Industry Association, according to the newly revised market exchange rate, all goods in stock in Shanghai can be fully exported. However, based on past experience, the prices in the producing areas often increase with the multiple increases in the exchange rate, so it is difficult to predict whether they can be successfully exported in the future. It is also difficult to guarantee that the selling prices abroad will not fall. However, although tea merchants have suffered repeated blows, their determination to cheer up has always been unwavering. The output of tea this year is indeed more than last year. The amount of Keemun black tea that has been produced has reached more than 30,000 boxes and is being continuously transported to Shanghai. Other teas, such as Ping green tea, can reach more than 80,000 boxes, and Tun green tea is also in the tens of thousands of boxes. Although most of these teas have obtained loans from the Central Agricultural Bank, their own funds are still huge due to their high cost. For example, the cost of each box of black tea is 2 million, and the loans obtained range from 300,000 to 600,000 yuan, and most of it still relies on its own resources.

Furthermore, although there are still not many sellers of various domestic teas, the turnover of shops and guest firms in this street is generally not smooth. The situation is that supply and demand are balanced, and the fluctuations are narrow. As a result of the closing, most of them are hovering.

### Clarification on Qualification Training for Medical Personnel

Reply to Mr. Lu Binlin

Letter No. 1199 from your Social Affairs Section, and a letter from reader Lu Binlin attached, inquiring about questions regarding the qualification training for medical personnel. We hereby answer them separately as follows: (1) It is still necessary to participate in the qualification training in order to obtain legal qualifications. (2) Qualification training registration is held in the capital, divided into districts nationwide, and divided into three phases. The first phase is for provincial associations, municipalities directly under the central government, municipalities under provincial jurisdiction, and counties along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, from August to October of this year. For the other two phases, please refer to the announcements published by this association in the newspapers. This qualification training is nationwide and is held only once to remedy those who do have medical and pharmaceutical expertise but do not have the legal practice qualifications. It is advisable to participate in the registration and wait for the qualification training. (3) Those who have passed the subjects of the higher qualification examination should still participate in the next qualification examination, retake the failed subjects, and after passing all the subjects, they can obtain the qualification to take the higher-level physician examination, or gather the documents to participate in the qualification training. The above is hereby replied to for your reference and dissemination. Sincerely, Social Service Section of Shen Bao Newspaper, Secretariat of the Old Election Committee

### Reply from Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Via Post

Regarding your letter inquiring about the Shanghai Gas Company's increased price case, we hereby reply to each item as follows:

(1) The current gas price is determined after strict examination and approval by this bureau and submitted to the National Price Committee for approval. The current price of 3,600 yuan per unit is determined by referring to the raw material coal and general commodity prices and labor prices. At the beginning of this year, most public utility companies received government subsidies, so the prices were never adjusted. Now that the subsidies for public utilities have been explicitly canceled, and the Fuel Management Committee is also affected by the cancellation of subsidies, the price of coal has increased sharply, thus affecting the price of gas.

(2) Regarding the consumption limit, according to past records, 45 units is sufficient for ordinary users. This limit is actually because the company's gas production equipment has reached its maximum production capacity and cannot be increased further. To restrict consumption because demand exceeds supply, it has to take strict restrictions.

(3) The deposit is a guarantee for the gas company to prevent users from owing fees. Recently, this bureau has approved that the deposit amount should be limited to the cost of one month's consumption for the user. It can be adjusted twice a year, in June and December by the Shanghai Gas Company.

The above three items are hereby replied to, and you are expected to refer to them! Sincerely, Lin Shouqi

### Fifty Poems of Returning Home

— Chen Shuren

(1) On Setting Sail, An Occasional Verse

Returning home, I feel light as a feather, despite traveling ten thousand miles by boat.
The mountains and rivers of my homeland must be laughing at me,
Still a bookish old scholar, true to my original nature.

(2) Passing Jiangyin

A small boat suddenly sails up the Yangtze River again.
The ruined forts and remnants of beacon fires are also indistinct.
Standing alone at the舷頭, stroking my white hair,
How many vicissitudes of life have I seen in my eyes?

(3) Yangtze River Wind and Night

Let the wind and waves outside the cabin beat against the sky,
This old man sleeps peacefully tonight.
Having crossed the turbulent sea before,
How much more easily can I navigate this river.

(4) Feelings on River Travel

I've almost forgotten that the mountains and rivers have been renewed by calamity.
Old inscriptions are found everywhere, recognized from the past.
The scenery remains completely unchanged since my last visit,
I only feel as if I am a person from another world.

(5) Harbor Pilot Chen, of Jiang'an Steamer, Speaks of Seeing Me Twenty Years Ago, Expressing Feelings on Recording the Scenery

So fate is determined even by a fleeting trace,
As I age, the scenery I painted is like fading smoke.
I never imagined that the boatman would still remember me,
Recalling copying life twenty years ago.

(6) Sketching Little Orphan Mountain Quickly from the Boat

I cherish Little Orphan Mountain's independent grace,
Whose support does her graceful image reflected in the water rely on?
How many times have I captured her likeness, right or wrong?
I fear others will laugh at this old man.

(7) Gaze at Mount Lu

It's like welcoming an old friend who has returned alive,
The Five Elders (peaks) look ancient and seem to smile.
Returning with white hair, I still ask myself,
Can I be without shame before Mount Kuang?

(8) Reflections on Current Events

Is there not a patriotic Wang Anshi?
There was also the ungrateful Lü Huiqing.
Except for the simplicity and sincerity of fishermen and woodcutters,
Where in the world can one find human kindness?

(9) Painting Madang

In the past, relying on its strategic importance for blockade,
A thousand iron warships sank in this river.
Today, I paint it from my small boat,
Quietly sitting at the舷頭, painting Madang.

(10) Appreciating Rain from a Carriage

This year again, I rejoice at the promise of a bountiful harvest.
How many thousands of 里 of fields in shallow green?
The early summer scenery in the countryside is extremely beautiful,
In the season of rice planting, the rain drizzles continuously.

(11) Passing the Miluo River

Daring to emulate Zhifang's purity and integrity,
I would rather drink dew and eat flowers.
Unexpectedly, as the poet's festival approaches,
I can come to this place to mourn Qu Yuan.

(12) Passing Yueyang and Gazing at Dongting Lake

For years, I dreamed of traveling on Dongting Lake,
But in the end, my wish has not been fulfilled.
I cannot help but let my spirit wander,
At this moment, I should be sailing on a boat on the Five Lakes.

(13) Writing to Express Comfort

The scenery and customs of Lingnan are endlessly missed,
How long have I been separated from my hometown?
One thing is truly comforting this time:
Returning home just in time for the lychee season.

(14) Passing Yueyang and Remembering Du Shaoling

It's a pity to pass by Yueyang City,
Without being able to ascend Yueyang Tower.
Who wouldn't feel the same?
Du Zimei, old and ill, on a boat in those years.

(15) Rainy Night at Changsha Station

The pattering night rain records my journey by carriage.
It's hard to sleep in the ancient驿, thoughts wandering endlessly.
I am ashamed that I have no good strategies for maintaining order,
Emptily recalling buying Changsha to save the world.

(16) An Occasional Verse in the Rain Along the Xiang River from a Carriage

The rainy scenery of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers has been my lifelong dream.
Unexpectedly, I comfortably travel and recline in a light carriage.
If Heaven bestows its kindness again another day,
I hope it won't begrudge me a small boat.

(17) Dengjia Tang

Dengjia Tang marks the boundary of the Xiang River's fishing nets.
Just a few steps away, and I'm in my hometown.
Returning today, my hair is also white,
It's hard to forget the vicissitudes of Zhongzhou!

(18) Gazing at Mount Heng in the Rain

I love to see Mount Heng shrouded in mist and rain.
Daring not hope for clear skies and silently pray for longevity.
The Purple Cover Peak is deeply hidden, and the Heavenly Pillar is obscured,
I can only remotely recognize Mount Zhurong.

(19) Passing Meiling

Plum blossoms bloom on Meiling in October.
How often have I personally seen the flowers in full bloom?
The peaks overlap, 濠 rains incessantly,
But I come when the plums are yellow.

(20) In the Carriage, Appreciating New Poems with Ruowen

Originally different from official duties,
Also different from the startled crows at dawn;
Burdened with talent, now also burdened with official duties,
There truly are earthbound immortals in this world.

(21) Painting at 　　Station

Only the village girl　calls　,
Yellow bananas and red lychees　　　;
Today　, overcome with joy　, I suspect it's a dream,
The local dialect and things of my hometown suddenly feel like Lingnan.

(22) Passing the North River by Carriage

Asking about the way home through mountain paths and water stations,
The closer to home, the more comfortable I feel.
Three hundred 里 of clear river and bamboo,
A light carriage advances along the banks in the rain.

(23) Arriving at Suiyuan by Carriage, Welcomed by Many Friends; Thanking Them in Verse

Deeply ashamed to see such a welcome today,
Flying across the vast sea, passing through myriad calamities.
I offer no other words to thank you all,
Still able to maintain my integrity and survive!

(24) Ten Quatrains to Friends

The old immortal of Hanlin 　磻,
His noble character is admired in the Cantonese region.
After the vicissitudes of life,
Meeting again, his moral character is even more upright. (Mr. Gui Nanping)

It is our generation's responsibility to revive the arts,
And we still cannot shirk this burden today.
You and I, old friends of forty-seven years,
Should encourage each other to cherish our remaining years. (Gao Jianfu)

Warm, gentle, and fond of your excellent writing,
How could I forget our friendship based on morality?
I hope you will continue to study diligently,
So that the Cantonese literary world can soar again. (Chen Shufeng)

I have long admired your heroic name as an iron soldier,
The Central Plains relied on you to sweep away the barbarians.
The mountains and rivers of Guangdong will gain even more color,
And Guangzhou will become a city of surrender. (The day after returning home, General Zhang Xianghua presented a victory map and requested an inscription, which I readily composed in two stanzas.)

Who fell from the sky with a　spear,
Allowing me to return leisurely to my hometown?
Feeling your great achievements in recovering the capital,
No one can forget Guo Fenyang!

The poetry appointment has now been fulfilled,
You graciously honored me with a visit to the countryside out of deep affection.
(Thirty-two years ago, I wrote the last two lines for You Qing's "Calling to the River and Sucking the Sea Collection": "The day of peace is at hand when we return home, and then go to the countryside to meet the old farmers.") If I can confirm our agreed intentions upon my return,
A single ray of light shines ten thousand miles away— (Chairman Luo Youqing visited me at Lingnan University in Guangzhou, so I presented this poem. You寿's poem to me contained the line "A single ray of light shines ten thousand miles away.")

Never forgetting the heart to brave difficulties in those years,
Although we share deep cups of wine tonight,
I cannot help but hold back tears of joy,
As I recite the "Song of the Night Rain on Ba Mountain." (Presented to Li 　　 at a banquet. When traveling in Chongqing, I sent Ze　 the "Song of the Night Rain on Ba Mountain.")

Your elegies are still being published at home and abroad,
Your integrity was admired at that time,
Meeting again today, we both laugh,
A true friendship that can be sworn for three lifetimes. (Chen Luosheng) (Five years ago, it was rumored that Chen Luosheng had died in Hong Kong, and I wrote a poem to mourn him). Who is like you in seeking little fame and profit?
Press forward diligently and don't let others surpass you.
Our friendship has lasted for forty years,
And our hearts are close to each other every day. (Li Gemin).

You widely depict the different customs of the north,
And meticulously select the unique mountains and rivers of the southeast.
I only feel that the younger generation is truly to be feared,
I'll take off my tiger skin and wait to see who will wear it? (Guan Shanyue)

(25) Visiting the Ancestral Graves

Where can I recognize the graves among the ashes of calamity?
A lifetime of sorrow for not repaying the hardship of my parents.
It's unbearable to return to visit the graves as a white-haired orphan
after twenty years of exile!

(26) Boating from Xiaogang to Geshan

Several houses have been abandoned,
And the tall forests are now all barren.
Only a clear stream of water remains,
As I come to visit my teacher's old study.

(27) After Arriving in Guangzhou, I Received Widespread Hospitality and Cordial Treatment. The Deep Affection of My Hometownspeople Has Made Me Realize What I Should Strive For. Thanking Them in Verse: I Know My Hope Is Not to Create a Stir. A Gray-Haired Traveler Feels Extremely Ashamed. Apart from the Scenery and Customs of My Hometown, I Have Not Done the Slightest Bit to Repay Lingnan!

(28) Staying Overnight at Someone Yu's Old Residence

Who has swept away the old traces of the deserted nest?
Coming to stay for three nights, I have to offer excuses.
Silver candles and brocade beds and tables,
How can they compare to a few thatched huts in a mountain cave? (During the Anti-Japanese War, I lived in the mountains of Chongqing and Xiang for eight years)

(29) The Guangzhou Revolutionary Comrades and Twenty-Seven Overseas Chinese Organizations Jointly Welcomed Me with a Banner; Composing a Poem on the Spot

Gray heads and aged voices gather in one hall,
The speeches are impassioned and fly with passion.
"Model of Civic Virtues" (written on the banner), how can I dare accept it?
I am so ashamed that sweat bursts out like a spring.

(30) Inscribing Jianfu's Painting of the Scenery of the Himalayas

Like-minded old painters,
One thing remains that is still a regret:
At the absolute peak of the Himalayas,
I never had the chance to sketch alongside you.

Mount Emei and the Rocky Mountains,
I have also climbed to their towering heights.
How could I willingly lose to you in the end,
Not pursuing strange victories and grasping the entire world?

(31) Listening to Cicadas

I firmly believe that human happiness requires a pure heart,
As I age, I feel leisurely and my intentions are completely peaceful.
Everyone says that it's good to spend the summer in my hometown,
And even more so to hear the clear cicada sounds in the study.

(32) The Night Before the Dragon Boat Festival, Unable to Sleep in the Dormitory of Lingnan School, I Compose a Poem

Counting the remaining village clappers in the small doctor's building,
The crickets are singing mournfully, but it's not autumn.
I don't feel that the scenery and customs of my hometown are different,
But I'm happy to watch the dragon boats tomorrow.

(33) Dragon Boat Festival in Guangzhou

Ten-丈 long dragon boats race,
Embroidered flags and agricultural drums fill the river with noise.
Crimson sun, white rain, and red pomegranate fire,
The Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated in Guangzhou.

(34) Slogan During the Welcome Meeting of All the People of Geshan Township

Eighty-eight years ago, I once studied with great ambition,
And people couldn't help but laugh at my mighty presence.
The elders and children of the entire township welcome me together,
The flags and banners, swords and spears have the momentum of a dragon.

(35) Watching the Dragon Boats from Geshan

Once across the mountain, twice across the stream,
The oars of the dragon boat team can almost be touched by hand.
Flags block out the sky, and drums thunder,
The tourists on both banks are thirsty for a glimpse.

(36) One Month After Returning Home, Sitting Alone in the Lingnan School Dormitory, I Compose a Poem

It's only been a month since I returned to my hometown,
And the mountain flowers and wild birds don't　　each other.
Is painting a place to escape fame?
But obtaining a place for quiet study is also what I wish for.

(37) Paying Respects to the Ancestral Graves

Ten-丈long dragon boats came out to sea to welcome me,
The entire township expressed joy and sincerity.
I know that there is no way to repay the virtues of my ancestors,
So I remain a simple and poor old scholar.

(38) As I Am About to Leave Suiyuan, I Am Bidden Farewell with a Pure Tour and Gathering of Friends; Composing a Poem of Thanks on the Spot

Separated for sixteen years, gathered for over a month,
Today we are drifting clouds again.
I hold one thing that can comfort you:
That our eternal friendship will never be broken.

Now the vast sea is still turbulent,
Occasionally making a clear 　, how can it be a frivolous journey?
But if Chen隅can be grinded into a whetstone,
We each have our own future.

Why ask about the vicissitudes of life?
This meeting should be able to last for a long time.
Please look at the recent literary banquets,
Where our friends have brought their sons and grandsons! (Every friend brings their sons or grandsons to the meeting)

### Deep Night

— Lotus Seed

Deep night, the moon kisses the dreams of the stars!

I lie quietly on the bed by the window, counting the stars of a summer night. A series of "di du, di du" sounds of bamboo clappers come from afar, and with the heavy and sluggish footsteps of the old wonton seller, routinely pass under my window again. The night seems to be made deeper by his knocking, but to me, suffering from insomnia, it feels especially intimate, as if a long-separated lover has just returned from afar and is gently knocking on my window. — When I remember the old man's frail figure, I can't help but lean on the window again. The night is misty, and the road lies quietly in its embrace, resting from the fatigue of the day; under the bright moonlight, the streetlights emit a sickly yellow glow, drowsy and wanting to sleep. The guard dog is also tired and sleeping in front of its owner's door, only this sole night traveler, shouldering the burden of life, roams the streets like a sleepwalker; I follow his shadow as it disappears into the shade of the trees, but I am also happy to see him reappear in the light of a more distant streetlamp.

The person walks further, and the figure becomes blurred, a distant black shadow struggling and shaking in the night! The "di du" sound of the bamboo clappers faintly enters my ears with the evening breeze, as if carrying the owner's sorrow to complain to the only one who is awake; but to someone who is also struggling in the vortex of life, it adds a touch of sadness.

### Mother and Child

— Daumier

Honoré Daumier (1808-1877) was a representative of French Realism. He became famous for his cartoons around the age of twenty. He was unsuccessful throughout his life until his later years when he received material assistance and spiritual encouragement from Corot, which gave him the opportunity to pursue a life of painting. Therefore, he did not create many oil paintings, but they were highly appreciated by famous novelists such as Victor Hugo and Balzac, who organized a solo exhibition for him in Paris, and his reputation grew greatly.

His works are simple and lively, with realistic themes, expressing exaggeration with a satirical meaning. His representative works include "Third-Class Carriage," "The Courtroom," and "The Proposal." This work is his first oil painting and is a work of commemorative significance. (Liu Shi)

### "Belamcanda chinensis"

— Zhu Wen

Sima Xiangru's "Rhapsody on Sir Fantasy": "Above them are phoenixes and peacocks, soaring belamcanda." "Rhapsody on the Imperial Park": "Uncover the Henglan, Xiangmu belamcanda." Belamcanda appears twice, once as an animal and once as a grass, with very different meanings. In "Rhapsody on Sir Fantasy," Fu Qian's annotation says: "Belamcanda resembles a fox and can climb trees;" while in "Rhapsody on the Imperial Park," Sima Biao's annotation says: "Belamcanda is a fragrant grass." However, Xunzi said that there is a tree in the West called Belamcanda, with a stem four inches long, growing on high mountains and overlooking a hundred-ren abyss. So it is also named after a tree.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 381

— Ye Jingfeng

In short, if it were possible to have a bird's-eye view from the clouds, one would see that in such a large territory, there are still many fragmented mountains and rivers, and many folk groups are still living the old mountain village life. Whether they are Red Beards or Black Beards, Volunteer Corps or guerrillas, they all want to protect this fragmented mountain and river of the motherland, and not let the enemy invade and seize it. However, they lack the guidance of leaders with new knowledge, and at the same time, the central government is separated by mountains and rivers, and too far away. Transportation is difficult, and it is not easy to contact them. Therefore, in addition to planting roses and pasturing, mining and obtaining, they also do some elusive, plundering and sniping activities; regardless of whether you are a different race or the same kind, as long as you are unfavorable to them, or they don't like the look of you, they will come and disturb you a little. However, they absolutely sympathize with ordinary, kind people, and not only do not disturb them, but also provide support if possible. This is a semi-chivalrous and semi-bandit behavior inherited from ancient times.

The old village that Little Tiger returned to is one of many villages. It originally had a name, but because this village still exists today and they do not need publicity, the name will not be mentioned for the time being; it is simply "Old Village." It is said that this Old Village has been passed down for two or three generations, so it has over a hundred households, separated by three hundred "poles," hundreds of male and female strong laborers. Since the September 18th Incident, a small portion of the strong laborers have often been drawn out to do guerrilla work. People who do not understand the situation, because of their elusive nature, still consider them to be a separate group.

The leader of the Old Village is called Lord Long Five, or Fifth Lord; it is not known whether this "Long" is his surname or his name, or a title given to him by many allies; he is only in his forties, and can be said to be shrewd and capable. His greatest advantage is that he "deeply understands righteousness"; in modern terms, it is "a sense of justice," and he has no base behavior, so he can win people's hearts. Many villages of the same era have collapsed, but only this Old Village has always stood firm.

It is said that Lord Long Five's grandfather served as a military officer in the Jiawu War, and was on the path to becoming a guerrilla; upon hearing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, he immediately resigned his official position, led his subordinates, found the location of the Old Village, established the village, and settled down. When it was passed on to Lord Long Five's biological father, he worked for only a few years, and seeing that Lord Long Five was of good quality, he handed over the affairs of the village to him early, became a monk, and no longer asked about worldly affairs. At that time, Lord Long Five was only in his twenties. In terms of martial arts, in addition to the family's origins, there were also several old men under his grandfather, both literate and martial, who often gave pointers. Although the methods were old, they were the essence of literary and martial arts. In this poor mountain and remote area, they could still be applied, so in twenty years, he managed the Old Village on a very large scale.

The terrain of the Old Village is not special, but it is one of thousands of mountain gorges in the northeast, and behind the gorge are precipices hundreds of feet high, and outside the precipices is a dense forest. At both ends of the gorge, there were originally sheep intestines, narrow paths leading to the valley, but during the four seasons, traces could only be found during the autumn when the grass withered; in other seasons, the winter snow would not melt until March or April of the spring, and in the summer, thorny bushes would grow rampantly, and even the shadow of a road could not be seen.

Initially, Lord Long Five's grandfather took a fancy to a long valley within the gorge, with good land that could be cultivated into dozens of hectares of highland soil. The slopes of the two walls were not steep, and there were waterfalls and springs; anyway, the affairs of the country were unbearable to ask about, and his ambitions had been dashed, so he opened up the winding path at the east end, which could lead to the main road, and built a village in the valley, and recruited some fellow villagers and poor households from Guannei to open up this canyon.

When it was passed on to Lord Five's father, he opened up the narrow path at the west end for the convenience of trading due to some production in the valley. But when it came to Lord Long Five, seeing that the Japanese invasion was becoming more and more serious; first there was the "Wanbaoshan Incident," and then the September 18th Incident, he felt that this village was not easy to protect, so he discussed it with several surviving elders and decided to adopt ancient military tactics, on the one hand using military methods to control the strong laborers, and on the other hand arranging several layers of traps at the paths at both ends of the east and west. This kind of trap arrangement is called the "Qimen Dunjia" arrangement in ancient military books and war strategies.

Shanghai Whispers

### Fairness and Others

— Shilang

The Shen Chong rape case was actually denied. If a cheap　　　Kong, Zhang raped a white woman, I wonder what this would be dyed into!　　　　 , violent, ignorant human nature! In these places, we do not quite understand how Americans interpret "fairness" and "law"?

Japanese goods have finally arrived. In Guangzhou's street stalls, there are already smuggled clothing materials. Guangzhou's Japanese goods are taking the route of smuggling from Hong Kong, Macau, to Guangzhou.

Once Japanese goods arrive in Guangzhou, can you prohibit them from coming to Shanghai?

A few weeks ago, a university student and a middle school student became bandits. Everyone was not very interested in this "social news," and only regarded it as an ordinary robber and petty thief, thinking that "they brought it on themselves and cannot survive," and no one paid attention to it. Today, there is another piece of "news" saying that a middle school student has started robbing, only stealing things that look like half-sold hams; if no one teaches them again, and a young man embarks on the path of a bandit, how can they not become a big thief holding a fast rifle and jointly looting?

Social customs often judge people by their clothing. Even the watchmen and patrol officers have to look at a well-dressed robber with respect.

Therefore, the drug lord transports drugs in a "streamlined car." He has indeed learned about "social philosophy."

If we are to draw a dogmatic conclusion: those who ride in "streamlined cars" are likely to be "male thieves and female prostitutes."

The Public Utilities Bureau's transportation vehicles have several routes that have adopted the same type of vehicle as Route 10, but some vehicles still use the old style. From the perspective of a passenger, paying the same price but receiving different treatment is unfair. The Public Utilities Bureau must not bully passengers by using bad vehicles just because there are too many people wearing uniforms.

### A Glimpse of Britain

— Translated by Yang Honglie

— Except for children, everyone in Britain is suffering from famine!

Editor's note: This is a good article that is both complaining and pleading, recording the current state of poverty in Britain. It is hoped that readers will take a moment to read it. The British have a more solid national industry and all the favorable conditions than us, but after a long war, what kind of difficult and famine-stricken lives are their people living? Look, how are Churchill and the British Labour Party and their people fighting with their environment!

The British are lamenting, weeping, but they are tenaciously gritting their teeth, and the whole nation is united to overcome this rare difficulty!

On my first morning after arriving in postwar London, I called the dining room to order breakfast:

"Can I order breakfast now?"

"Of course, sir, what would you like?"

"Two fried eggs;——"

"You already got two eggs? Sir, should I come to your place to get them?"

"But I don't have eggs."

"Oh, sir,——we don't have them either!"

Of course, I already knew that Britain was extremely short of food, clothing, and fuel, but it was not easy to understand the truth from 3,000 miles away. After eating a meal of coarse black bread and some substitute-like jam, I suddenly felt that I was in a poor and difficult country.

Thin Clothes, Hungry People

In Britain, each person can buy two dimes worth of pork per week, about three or four taels, or buy seven cents worth of canned beef, nine taels of bread per day, three taels of butter per week, and three taels of "leiji lin," and may sometimes be able to buy an egg.

Thirty-two ration coupons can be used to buy clothing. A pair of leather shoes requires nine coupons, a pair of　　 three coupons, a wool vest requires seven coupons, and a set of clothes requires twenty-six coupons!

A car夫 once complained to me: "We are now living a hellish life. My wife and I's ration coupons are completely used on the children. We usually only have a set of casual clothes and a set of formal wear. The casual clothes have long been broken, so we only wear a formal dress all year round. Recently, Commercial Secretary Sir Cripps announced that our existing ration coupons will have to be relied on for another two months!"

A famous female painter who can only use electricity for a few hours each day told me that when she goes to a certain artist's studio to work in the morning, she can only use the faint light of a lighter to apply lipstick.

I once talked to a wife who was always angry and anxious. In fact, she is a well-known writer on both sides of the Atlantic. Here, I can only conceal her name.

"I stood in a long line for two hours, waiting to buy bread, fish, and vegetables, and then washed them casually. Without milk, eggs, or beef, I cook them plainly and eat them. If a person from a country that is slightly able to feed itself runs to Britain, they will definitely become yellow and emaciated and starve to death in a few months."

People's anxiety is indeed out of helplessness. Although it is now hot weather, occasionally a gust of wind and a sudden rain make it feel like autumn. From people's thin faces, it seems that they are frowning, and they seem to be worried that the severe winter is coming soon.

In the courtyard, the green grass is like a carpet, and all kinds of flowers are blooming, truly colorful. A slender willow tree hangs long, and everything still seems so tranquil and harmonious. Suddenly, a military bugle sound came from the street, the drums thumping, a team of soldiers walked by, followed by a team of Boy Scouts.

"These children seem to be quite strong. They seem to have good nutrition on weekdays," I said to myself.

The car夫 nodded in agreement: "Indeed, the only ones who eat well in Britain today are the children. The best food in the family is eaten by them."

At the invitation of a lawyer and his painter wife, I went to see a vaudeville show. We arrived at the theater at seven o'clock, because the "Light Conservation Movement changed the time to make it flat, but it was actually only five o'clock in the afternoon. Most people sat waiting listlessly. A few witty words from an actor on stage also aroused a burst of noisy applause.

"You endure　months　　this　　iron land. The first act of the play may pass in the　　 noise, while in the second act your empty stomachs growl, and in the third act you will definitely collapse and 　!"

Churchill's Talk

When I met with some British political leaders, my initial impression of Mr. Churchill was not very good. When I went to visit him at his home, he led me to an art room with high murals and lined with easels. As I passed through the easels, I saw an excellent snow scene painting.

"This　", I said, "should be one of the best paintings!"

I looked at the host's face, which seemed to have an incredible smile on it, and answered in his clear, powerful, and somewhat seductive tone;

"This painting is the work of someone else."

"Which of these are your masterpieces!"

"My paintings have been sent elsewhere."

(Weeks later, the author learned that Churchill's painting, indeed under the name of Winter, won first place in the national exhibition)

Churchill, wearing a not very neat air-raid suit, strong and vigorous, with a smile on his face, walked up the stairs of the Chatter, Myler residence, lay down on the sofa, a small　　, nimbly climbed onto his shoulder, staring at me unblinkingly. That house had been the residence of many British sages, and Henry VIII had also lived there. Churchill is now residing there as a guest of the government, but in a few decades, his　place may become a memorial place admired by thousands of people, just like President Roosevelt's Hyde Park.

He spoke eloquently. He always advocated that the United States and Britain should have close　 connections and mutually supportive cooperation. (Above)

The impoverished content of "Green Green Grass by the River"

"Green Green Grass by the River" is adapted from the Western film "Waterloo Bridge." It is obvious that this adaptation is a failure. Chinese and Western customs are different, and the story taken from "Waterloo Bridge" cannot take root on Chinese soil. In the play, the male and female protagonists, Wang Zichao and Lan Qing, in a short period of time, from encounters by carriage, admiration, to passionate love and engagement, this is an American-style "romance." Therefore, Lan Qing's deception and loss of virginity, falling into prostitution, remarriage, and the runaway on the wedding night, are merely plot constructions. The author did not delve into the depth of life, making this tragedy of the era feel empty and weak. Moreover, although "Waterloo Bridge" is a moving tragedy, it contains, to some extent, an anti-feudal theme, which "Green Green Grass by the River" attempts to express is quite vague.

In addition to the inherent deficiencies in the script's creation, director Fang Peilin should be considered quite unsuccessful. Aside from relying on some of the scenery of the Fuchun River to set off the story, those dramatic scenes are handled extremely stiffly and monotonously. As a result, the entire film lacks a kind of mournful and lingering sentiment, tasting like chewing wax. This is naturally a matter of the director's ability.

Wang Danfeng's Lan Qing, apart from possessing a beautiful appearance, still needs exploration for the creation of the character's personality. Yan Jun's engineer Wang Zichao is a completely foreignized young man, superficial and affected. The better performances in the entire play are Zheng Min's Manager Shen and Zi Ling's mother.

The exterior scenes of the Fuchun River and the scenery of the mountain city show the beauty of the former and the clumsiness of the latter in terms of photography and set design.

The Literary Film "Portrait of Dorian Gray"

As a literary film, this adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray," is a great distance from the original. It can be said that the current and Wilde's aesthetic philosophy and the theme of the original painting have a high degree of distortion and alienation. In fact, this is a common problem with Hollywood's production of literary films. Producers only take a relatively superficial part of the original story and ignore or tear apart the original, and even fail to grasp its theme.

Thus, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" is rewritten into a horror film expressing the pursuit of carnal desires and criminal psychology.

However, if we put aside the issue of the original work and adaptation, then we cannot but praise the outstanding achievements of director Albert Lewin. His grasp of the overall tone of the play, the control of the atmosphere and rhythm of the entire play, and the neatness of many layouts and hints, all make you feel the director's overflowing talent. Especially that scene where Dorian Gray stabs the painter Basil after Basildon is a moving shot that amplifies grays emotions.

Among the actors, Hurd Hatfield, who plays Dorian Gray, is perfectly cast. George Sanders as Lord Henry and Lowell Gilmore as the painter Basil are both very stable and competent.

The photography is also excellent in this film.

Excellent Cartoon "The Lost Letter"

It is the first time that a Soviet color cartoon has been screened in Shanghai. After watching "The Lost Letter," we feel surprised. Because when compared to those Hollywood's elaborate and ingenious cartoons, this one appears rough. Especially the Ukrainian wilderness and Cossacks under the pen of the great master Gogol, appear lively and powerfully expressing their kinship. This should be considered a successful product.

"Kiss and Tell" and "The Thin Man Goes Home"

The former is a light British-style comedy starring Shirley Temple and Robert Cummings. The latter is another work by MGM, co-starring Alan Curtis and the dog star Asta. These two films are below average.
