[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] The central government's annual revenue and expenditure budget for the 36th year, after careful and thorough review by the Legislative Yuan, was passed this morning at the 313th meeting of the Yuan. The proposal and the Legislative Yuan's suggestions and review opinions will be compiled and submitted to the National Government. (The full text of the review opinions will follow.) The Legislative Yuan's meeting this morning was chaired by President Sun. The heads of the various agencies were not present, and only the review opinions of the joint review committee of the five committees were considered, along with the responses made by the heads of agencies during the inquiries on the 30th, and a careful study of the revenue and expenditure was conducted. Regarding the expenditure section, especially the elimination of redundant organizations to save public funds, the legislators had valuable suggestions. How to make up for the revenue and expenditure deficit was also given special attention during the review. The legislators hoped that the Executive Yuan could submit concrete plans to stabilize commodity prices and the implementation plans of various agencies for this year to the Legislative Yuan for review. The entire case was reviewed and passed at around 11 o'clock.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Legislative Yuan issued the following review opinions on the central government's annual revenue and expenditure budget for the 36th year of the Republic of China: Review opinions of the Legislative Yuan on the central government's annual revenue and expenditure budget for the 36th year of the Republic of China:

(1) Revenue Section: (1) The profit income listed by various national banks and other banks with government shares under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance should be appropriately increased again. (2) The profit income of the China Textile Corporation under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has increased excessively. The internal organization and personnel of the company should be strictly adjusted to reduce expenses. It should not continue to raise yarn prices repeatedly as before, which stimulates general commodity prices. (3) The rental income from the received enemy and puppet properties is listed as the same as last year. Given the increase in commodity prices this year, it should be appropriately increased. (4) Detailed information on the sale prices of gold and foreign exchange, US military surplus materials, and received enemy and puppet property materials should be compiled separately in written reports and submitted to the Yuan for reference. (5) All foreign debts borrowed in the 36th year, the actual receipt and allocation amounts, should be converted into national currency and included in the general budget. (6) The amount of Japanese reparations is huge. The possible income of reparations and materials for this year should be priced and included in the revenue section to make up for the budget deficit.

Redundant Organizations Should Be Eliminated; Draft a Plan to Stabilize Commodity Prices

(2) Expenditure Section: (1) The Central Design Bureau, the Party and Government Work Evaluation Committee, and the Work Competition Promotion Committee, which are listed under the expenditure for the exercise of political power, are all redundant organizations and should be eliminated. (2) The Supreme Economic Council, the Import Design Specialized Committee, the Import Management Office, and other organizations listed under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan have no legal basis for their organization and should be eliminated. Their businesses should be assigned to the competent authorities. (3) The organization of the Ministry of National Defense is too large and duplicated, and should be adjusted and simplified again to reduce waste and increase efficiency. (4) The tax and customs agencies under the Ministry of Finance have complex organizations and urgently need to be adjusted and simplified. Methods should be drafted and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. (5) The largest portion of the expenditures under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior is used for political affairs. Insufficient attention is paid to household registration and civil affairs. The competent ministry should make reasonable adjustments within the total amount of listed expenditures. (6) The Food Department should be eliminated. The collection of land tax should be returned to the Ministry of Finance, and the supply of military rations should be returned to the Ministry of National Defense. (7) The routine relief affairs handled by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration should be transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs. (8) The legal institution under the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission was originally the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, not the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. Therefore, the second to ninth units under the Commission in the general budget should be corrected according to law.

(3) Other: (1) The method for supplementing the revenue and expenditure deficit in this year's general budget should be proposed by the Executive Yuan in a bill and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. A concrete plan to stabilize commodity prices should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review in the shortest possible time. (2) The implementation plans, business plans, or operating plans of various agencies for this year are not detailed in the general budget, so it is impossible to express the policies or central work of each department. The competent authorities should submit supplementary plans to the Legislative Yuan separately for review. (3) Regarding state-owned enterprises, the competent authorities should uniformly prepare operating budgets in accordance with the law and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan has made repeated suggestions and should be handled accordingly.

### Sino-Canadian Loan Draft Completed Legislative Procedures; Canada Will Loan Us 60 Million Canadian Dollars

[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] The draft of the Sino-Canadian loan agreement was passed by the 313th plenary session of the Legislative Yuan this morning, completing the legislative procedures. According to the agreement, which was initially agreed upon in principle by President Song and the Canadian Prime Minister during his visit to Canada, with the details negotiated by Canadian Ambassador Liu Shishun and the Canadian Minister of Finance, the Canadian government will loan us 60 million Canadian dollars, calculated at an annual interest rate of 3%, to be repaid in principal and interest over 30 years.

Regarding the recent actions of the US, Wu said: Marshal Ma's mediation for a year failed because the Chinese Communist Party firmly refused peace. The withdrawal from the Three-Man Committee and the Military Mediation Department is an inevitable result.

I left to go to an appointment at the Beiping Hotel." Ms. Shen appeared in court without makeup and with disheveled hair. She said: "I was taken to the Dongdan Parade Ground. The two men pushed me to the ground. One of them lay on my body, and the other sat on my legs and took off my shorts. Then the other one lay completely on top of me."

Ms. Shen was unable to identify the accomplice in court. It is said that she saw Pearson under the light, so she could identify him, but she could not see the true face of the accomplice because it was dark.

Reasons for Organizing the Investigation Team

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] During today's routine meeting of the Council of State Affairs Committee, Su and three others firmly requested the organization of an investigation team to investigate the accounts of the Foreign Exchange Commission to dispel doubts. The reasons stated in the proposal were: "Upon investigation of the Foreign Exchange Commission's release of foreign exchange, people in society are extremely cautious about it, leading to numerous doubts and constant complaints. Furthermore, it is recently rumored that responsible personnel of the commission are suspected of using public office for personal gain, resulting in widespread public discontent and extreme difficulties. This council, as a representative of public opinion, has an unavoidable responsibility to undertake the task of investigation. Moreover, recent Executive Yuan meetings and previous general meetings of this council have advocated for a liquidation of the commission's business. At this moment, in order to dispel public doubts and maintain the government's credibility, the investigation work can no longer be delayed." The proposal was decided to request the government to entrust the council with organizing an investigation team to conduct the investigation. Once approval is obtained from relevant parties, the investigation work can begin.

Around Zhoukou, although the ice floes have decreased due to the warming weather, some large ones, up to three meters in size and one decimeter thick, continue to flow into the northwest corner of Beizhai in Zhoukou. Engineering projects such as brick, dam, and embankment works downstream from Posui Temple and upstream from Laoguiwo are under great pressure. At Shuizhai Beiguan, sixty li below Zhoukou, the water level rose to 3.3 meters on the morning of the 28th, level with the fourth-grade riverbank. At Shuizhai Zhoukou Wen Wangze, the water level has submerged the embankment work (i.e., embankment dam) by more than one meter. The riverbank above the Shuizhai embankment work has been collapsed by ice floes for a length of 80 meters. The Kang Dam work has also been severely damaged by the ice floes, but the Henan Repair and Defense Office engineering team has reinforced it with ice defense piles. As of the 29th, the ice near Shuizhai had thawed, but the ice near Doumen had not completely melted, and the water level had not decreased. The engineering team is actively engaged in reinforcement work.

### Various Organizations in the Capital Send Telegrams: Support the Government's Statement, Hoping the Communists Repent and Stop the Rebellion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] More than ten public organizations in Nanjing, including the Municipal Council, Chamber of Commerce, Farmers' Association, General Labor Union, Women's Association, Journalists Association, and Banking Association, have expressed their support for the Nationalist Government's statement regarding the CCP's rejection of peace talks. A telegram to the people of the whole country stated: "Central News Agency forwards to all newspapers nationwide and to the public of the whole country: More than a year has passed since the victory, but the war has not ceased. The Communist Party harbors malicious intentions, attempting to seize territory by force to satisfy its partisan desires. Our government, with forbearance and concern for the country, deeply knows that construction must be based on peace and national unity. For a year, the government has worked tirelessly, engaging in peaceful negotiations with the Communist Party, and has not hesitated to seek the realization of peaceful reunification in various ways. Allied General Marshall also traveled across the ocean at his own expense to mediate fairly. At that time, all parties unanimously agreed on the program for peaceful national construction, and the Communist Party also agreed to and signed the plan for troop reorganization. Even the fundamental law of the country had long been agreed upon in principle by the Political Consultative Conference. However, the Communist Party went back on its word, repeatedly breaking the armistice agreement known to the world, and constantly attacked the National Army, using peace talks to cover up its military and political conspiracies. When the war was unfavorable, it pretended to seek peace, and when its aggression was slightly expanded, it used the destruction of the constitution and the restoration of the military situation before January 13th of last year as bargaining chips to force concessions, eventually openly refusing mediation and closing the door to peace, attempting to subvert the government through military rebellion and plunge our country, which is waiting to be revived, into eternal destruction. This not only affects people's livelihoods and the economy but also harms the international standing. Reading the government's statement on the Communist Party's rejection of peace, we can see the government authorities' eagerness for peace and their painstaking efforts with forbearance. However, the Communist Party has become increasingly egregious, not hesitating to isolate itself from the people of the country, launching an all-out offensive to harm the country and the people, and destroying the hard-won fruits of victory in the war of resistance. The facts are all there and cannot be concealed by any sweet words. Our Republic of China is a country shared by all the people of the country, how can the Communist Party occupy it for its own partisan interests? Every inch of land is the territory of the country, how can local separatism be created? Any army should be under the command of the government, how can it be used as a tool for political strife? And the constitution formulated by the National Assembly is the fundamental law jointly discussed and decided by all parties in the country, and it cannot be torn up by the Communist Party alone. We are alarmed and terrified by the overall situation, and we unanimously advocate and telegram our support for the government's policy of peaceful national construction and the realization of democratic rule. We deeply hope that the Communist Party will repent, stop the rebellion, relieve the people from suffering, bring stability to the country, and realize peaceful reunification. Otherwise, if it insists on going its own way, it will be abandoned by the people of the whole country. Other opposition parties should also base their sincerity, deeply understand the government's intentions, and participate in the government to jointly manage and complete the construction of democratic constitutionalism and people's livelihood economy, so that the country and the nation can achieve prosperity, strength, and happiness. We also hope that people at home and abroad will express their consistent views, which will be fortunate for the country and fortunate for the nation.

January 31st."

### Banknotes Stolen En Route from Hong Kong to Guangzhou: Central Bank Representatives Have Confirmed; Boxes Filled with Marble and Women's Clothing

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 31st] According to a report in today's newspaper, thirty boxes of cash belonging to the Central Bank, worth 80 million yuan, were found to have been stolen when they arrived in Guangzhou from Hong Kong yesterday. Representatives of the Central Bank in Hong Kong have confirmed this to reporters, but stated that the exact amount stolen has not yet been determined.

### Conserving Foreign Exchange and Reducing Paper Shortage: Ministry of Publicity Formulates Six Measures, Reducing the Size of Newspapers in Various Places

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] In order to conserve foreign exchange, the government has listed paper as one of the restricted import items, and imports are subject to restrictions. Recently, newspapers in various places have often increased their size to compete with each other. The total amount of paper consumed last year was almost three times the pre-war import volume. If restrictions are not imposed early, the paper shortage will inevitably become more serious. It is learned that the Ministry of Publicity has formulated six temporary measures for reducing the size of newspapers in various places in order to conserve foreign exchange and reduce the paper shortage: (1) Newspapers in Shanghai and Nanjing that originally had more than three large sheets should be reduced to three large sheets, and the rest should be reduced to two and a half sheets, two sheets, and so on. Those that originally had less than two sheets can freely reduce their size. (2) The size of newspapers in other places should be limited to a maximum of two large sheets. Those that originally did not have two large sheets should not increase in size, and those that originally had more than one sheet can freely reduce their size. (3) Supplements may not be published except on National Day and the anniversary of the newspaper's founding. (4) The layout of advertisements and news in each newspaper should be economical in terms of space. (5) Newspapers in various places must begin to reduce their size according to the standards no later than February 16th. (6) The Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior will discuss and formulate restrictions on yellow publications. It is heard that the above temporary measures have been sent to the Newspaper Association in various places for compliance and implementation.

### Editorial: How to Promote Export Trade

Regarding export trade, it has been reported that the government intends to establish a special agency to actively promote it. Various export industries are very excited about this and propose sending representatives to participate. We believe that whether to participate or not is secondary. However, the importance of this issue is not only something that various export industries should be excited about; other sectors that do not have a direct relationship with exports should also be excited.

The importance of this issue is already very clear from the perspectives of international trade, foreign exchange funds, the development of domestic products, and the maintenance of foreign markets. Furthermore, the current currency has developed to the point where banknotes with denominations of five thousand or ten thousand yuan are not enough for circulation. Most of the overseas remittances from overseas Chinese have overflowed to other areas, and the future of the so-called $500 million loan is uncertain. Although the settlement of foreign exchange for imported goods has been strictly reviewed repeatedly, according to the statistics compiled by the customs, the situation of monthly trade deficits has not fundamentally changed. Based on this reasoning, whether export trade can be developed is an overall national economic issue, not just a matter of the interests of exporters.

How the association will be organized and what its responsibilities will be have not yet been formally announced. We believe that this matter is indeed of great importance and would like to offer the following suggestions:

1. The association should not only have an advisory nature. Now is the time for action, not discussion. Too much discussion and too little success will not satisfy the expectations of the general public. Therefore, the nature of the association should emphasize implementation, not just discussion.

2. The association should not only have a general administrative nature. Regarding export trade, in terms of general administration, whether at the central or local level, there is no feeling of inadequacy. If a specialized administrative institution is added, it would merely add some twists and turns and give merchants an additional boss, which would not be of much practical use. Therefore, we believe that an institution of a purely administrative nature is not necessary.

3. The association should not only have a guiding nature. The so-called guidance refers to technical guidance, the provision of information, and conveniences in transportation, insurance, loading, unloading, and remittances. When the export industry is still in its infancy, this type of assistance has considerable value. However, to promote today's export trade, this type of assistance is clearly insufficient.

In summary, the above three points are only supplementary tasks; do not forget the main task. What is the main task? It is to directly take on the task of promoting exports.

Taking examples from other countries, the methods adopted by countries to promote their export trade are no more than the following four types: (1) subsidies, (2) purchases, (3) tax exemptions or reductions, and (4) preferential treatment in foreign exchange or transportation. Now that export taxes have been completely abolished, the third point is not an issue. What to do with the remaining points is worth studying.

If the second point, the purchase policy, is adopted, then points (1) and (4) will not be a problem, and the procedure will be very simple. Moreover, the purchase of raw silk has already been implemented, and it only needs to be expanded to include the main export products. Then, the association will have fulfilled most of its responsibilities. As for other conveniences, there are a few points as follows:

1. The purchase price does not have to be completely bound by foreign market prices, and producers can work with peace of mind.

2. When selling goods, the association has full control over this type of product, which is more conducive to negotiations on terms.

3. There is no possibility of leakage of funds from sales proceeds.

4. Government operation is technically superior to private power.

However, if the above plan is implemented, there are also several creeds that must be observed. First, it cannot be profit-oriented. The purpose of the government in handling exports is to promote sales and provide relief. At least in the current stage, it should be a business with no profit to be made. If this intention is misunderstood and one thinks from a business perspective everywhere, it will have the opposite effect from what is expected, and it is not worth doing. Second, it cannot be exploitation-oriented, that is, when buying, one must take into account the producers' capital costs. Under the dual pressure of high interest rates and stagnant exports, if the state takes the lead and suppresses purchase prices, it may be possible to do it partially in reality and it is easy to please on the books. However, the main purpose of the government's handling of exports this time should be seen by the people. We will not mention ancient sayings such as "storing wealth among the people," but if people in the industry lose too much and become wary, it is not the government's original intention to promote exports. Therefore, if this purchase policy is indeed adopted, we hope that we can consider both sides comprehensively and lay a good foundation for the future of exports.

### Refugees in Northern Jiangsu Eager to Return Home; Relief Work Has Been Transferred to Their Hometowns

Detailed Rules for Land Disposal Determined on the Spot

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong believes that all counties in northern Jiangsu have been recovered, and the center of relief efforts has also been transferred to various counties. If the refugees in exile continue to stay in foreign lands, they will lose the opportunity to return home. Yesterday, he held a warrant and instructed the Zhenjiang Relief Station to inform the post-war relief associations in various counties to inform the refugees to return home by the end of this month.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] As various counties in the Jiangsu Province Pacification Zone are successively recovered, the land issue is the fundamental basis of governance. The provincial government has successively formulated various implementation methods. In order to conform to the provincial situation, it is based on the Central Government's promulgated Guidelines for Governance in the Pacification Zone, Measures for Land Disposal in the Pacification Zone, Measures for the Disposal of Urban Land and Buildings in the Pacification Zone, Implementation Procedures and Funding Standards for Land Disposal Measures in the Pacification Zone, Land Law and its relevant laws and regulations. The Jiangsu Province Pacification Zone Land Disposal Implementation Detailed Rules are comprehensively formulated again. All previous single regulations drafted in this province will be abolished to avoid confusion. The following are excerpts of the main points of the Implementation Detailed Rules passed by the 83rd Provincial Conference: (1) Conduct a universal survey of various situations of land allocation and production, and prepare registers for recording as a basis for promoting land policies. (2) Clear land rights, organize a general clearing of land rights, and issue land ownership certificates to land owners based on the survey and registration results as proof of management. Immediately compile registers of field taxes to coordinate with the collection of field taxes. (3) Register leases. All tenanted land shall be subject to the conclusion of a tenancy contract by both the landlord and the tenant for safekeeping, and shall be reported to the local township office for record. The content of a lease shall specify the rent amount, the time and method of rent payment, etc., and the township office shall prepare a register for recording to control the tenancy relationship. After the implementation of lease registration, if the landlord and tenant cancel the contract or enter into another lease, they shall still apply for registration with the township office and obtain the prescribed lease in order to improve the tenancy relationship and protect tenants. (4) Establish land rights. Based on the results of the universal survey and land rights clearing, determine the ownership of the original land owner and the cultivation rights of the current farmer, and then collect statistics on illegally distributed land, missing landlords, or land that cannot be restored to its original state, and the remaining land relinquished by large landlords, etc., and create a register for government collection. (5) Assess land prices. When collecting the Wang land mentioned in Item 4, the county government shall form a county evaluation committee with one representative each from the county magistrate, county council, agriculture and industry, chamber of commerce, middle peasant branch (sub-branch), court, landlord representative, and tenant representative from each district as members. The land price shall be assessed on a township basis. If the land price difference is too large, it shall be assessed by district. (6) Announce the collection. The land that has been illegally distributed, the landlords who are missing or cannot be restored to their original state, and the land relinquished by large landlords after persuasion shall be collected by the county government in accordance with the law. The price of the land collected shall be compensated with land bonds issued by the China Farmers Bank. The county government shall cooperate with the China Farmers Bank to be responsible for the issuance of land price compensation. (7) Allocate and release. The agricultural land collected shall be claimed by the current farmers at a price. If the current farmers are unwilling to claim it, it shall be preferentially distributed to the original tenants before the disturbances, or to demobilized soldiers and families of soldiers who fought against the Japanese with the ability to cultivate. The land claimed shall be issued a land claim certificate by the county government as proof of management, which will be exchanged for a land ownership certificate in the future. The price to be paid by all claimants shall be paid to the China Farmers Bank in agricultural products or converted into market prices over fifteen years, and the land claim certificate may be mortgaged to the China Farmers Bank. If the claimant neglects cultivation midway or rents out the land, the county government shall take it back and release it again. The land price already paid by the original claimant shall be refunded in full. (8) Guide operations. After the land is allocated and released, assistance shall be given to improve agricultural technology and to establish demonstration farms and cooperative undertakings in order to improve the economic lives of farmers.

### 21 Counties East of Wuxi to Receive Agricultural Loans of 40 Billion This Year, Focusing on Silk, Fisheries, and Cotton

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 32nd Report] Zhou Hongwen, an agricultural product inspector from the Huifeng Sub-Branch of the China Farmers Bank, answered inquiries from our newspaper reporter in Suzhou on the 31st regarding agricultural loans for this year. The following is a summary: The agricultural loans for this year, which are under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Sub-Branch, include 21 counties east of Wuxi in Jiangsu Province, including Suzhou, Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, Wujiang, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Baoshan, Qingpu, Songjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Nantong, Chongming, Qidong, Haimen, Shanghai County and other places. The preliminary plan is for a total of 40 billion yuan. Suzhou can obtain 2.5 billion. The lending nature focuses on silk, fisheries, and cotton. However, because the amount is extremely large, whether it can be in full amount still depends on the capital situation of the head office. There are already many agricultural loans that are currently being processed. (1) Spring silkworm seed mortgage loans are for silkworm seed farms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The total amount is 2 billion yuan. Each silkworm seed can apply for a loan of 2,000 yuan, with a monthly interest of 0.3%, and the repayment deadline is the end of April. Half of the seed farms in Suzhou Province are concentrated in the Hushu Pass, and they can produce more than 300,000 silkworm seeds, so Suzhou can obtain more than 600 million yuan in loans alone. This loan is not within the quota of 30 billion yuan for silkworm and mulberry loans in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The purpose is purely to maintain the turnover of funds for the seed farms. (2) Various production loans. Before the 40 billion yuan is approved, the Shanghai Branch will temporarily determine that Suzhou will lend 400 million yuan based on last year's quota, which is divided into A. Silkworm farmer loans, including the processes of promoting green feeding, etc., and each silkworm farmer can obtain about 30,000 yuan for raising one silkworm. B. Seed production loans can be loaned 6,000 to 8,000 yuan per sheet based on production costs. C. Water conservancy loans. The head office has recently had a batch of water pumps with diameters of 4 inches, 8 inches, and 12 inches. The Agricultural Bank is preparing to investigate and can purchase them at a price if they meet the needs of rural areas and lend them in kind. D. Fertilizer loans are divided into chemical and soybean cake categories. The quantity is determined by the application of farmers' organizations and approved according to actual needs. E. Fish farming loan. Zhou also stated: "Now that the government's policy on silk has not yet been decided, it is unknown whether the silkworm and mulberry industry should be supported, but farmers have a long history of raising silkworms as a side business, and my country's silk foreign trade also occupies a dominant position in the international market, so the current Agricultural Bank plans to fully support the silkworm and mulberry industry, but the target is not purchasers but silkworm farmers themselves, and without this, it is not enough to talk about reviving silkworm and mulberry. I hope that this year's silkworm farmers in various townships can organize themselves and cooperate to handle the transportation and sale of dry cocoons and silk reeling, so that the Agricultural Bank can issue transportation and sale loans and silk reeling loans as much as possible. I hope that local people of insight will promote it."

### Suzhou and Wujiang Counties to Continue Rationing Rayon

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 31st Report] The Suzhou Office of the Central Trust Bureau, under the order of the head office, began to be responsible for handling the allocation of rayon in Suzhou and Wujiang counties in November last year. The procedure is that each silk factory first applies to the office for the quantity required through the union's tabulation, and then the head office approves it before allocating it. The price is based on the Shanghai market price. According to statistics, by the end of December last year, 263 boxes had been allocated and sold. Now, 6,000 boxes of Japanese silk have arrived in January, of which Suzhou can allocate 80 boxes and Wujiang can allocate 60 boxes. In the future, regular allocation can be obtained every month.

### British Government Recalls Ambassador to Warsaw, Sino-British Relations Increasingly Delicate

British Embassy's Polish Female Employee Arrested Late at Night

[Associated Press, London, 30th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson announced tonight that Sir Peng Dingke, the British Ambassador to Poland, has been reassigned and will be recalled shortly. The spokesperson did not want to link Peng's recall with Britain's protest against the Polish elections, only stating that Peng had been promoted. It is understood that Peng's transfer is due to the following reasons: (1) During a recent treason case, the defendant confessed that the British Ambassador had received confidential military and political intelligence; (2) During the Polish elections, the government and opposition factions accused each other of murder, and Britain protested to the Polish government twice; (3) It is rumored that Peng Dingke had met with Stanislaw Mikolajczyk, the leader of the defeated Peasant Party, after the elections.

[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 30th] Sir Peng Dingke, the British Ambassador to Poland, will soon return to his country from Warsaw. It is reported that the Ambassador's announcement of his return came several hours after Mrs. Marynoski, an intelligence assistant at the British Embassy, was arrested late last night. This 50-year-old Polish woman is accused of acting as a liaison between the British Embassy and Polish underground organizations. According to well-informed sources, this arrest is related to the Grocholski case. The British Ambassador has requested an explanation from the Polish Foreign Ministry regarding this matter, but has not yet received a response. According to Mr. Gocz, a spokesperson for the Polish Foreign Ministry, the matter is very serious.

### Soviet Union Supports Poland Retaining Current Borders, Becomes Focus of Dispute at Moscow Conference

[Reuters, Moscow, 30th] Authoritative sources say that when the Foreign Ministers' Conference is held in Moscow in March, the Soviet Union will demand that Poland retain its current borders. Soviet newspapers have recently published articles elaborating on the issues to be discussed at the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference. As the Red Star newspaper stated, the British and American governments have repeatedly attempted to interfere in Poland's internal affairs, intending to revise Poland's borders in favor of Germany. The newspaper then cited the benefits to Poland after the Berlin and Crimea conferences decided to restore Poland's original territory. For example, in terms of national defense, the current German-Polish border is 400 kilometers long, while according to the Treaty of Versailles, it reached 1,900 kilometers. Moreover, the new German-Polish border is defined by rivers, and Poland can obtain three major ports and fourteen minor ports along the coast, giving it broad access to the sea. In terms of territory, Poland has recovered 104,680 square kilometers of land, including Silesia, which possesses vast natural resources. The other recovered lands also make significant contributions to Poland's economic development. The recovered cultivated land will reach over 14.82 million acres, eliminating the concern that land-scarce farmers will have no land to cultivate, and ensuring that every Polish family repatriated from abroad can obtain a considerable amount of land, preventing overcrowding. The newspaper concluded that the Polish people know that if Germany were to reoccupy these lands, Poland would be subject to the capitalistic pressure of Britain, America, and Germany, and the preservation of Poland's independence depends on the development of these new lands.

### China Reiterates Consistent Position on German-Austrian Peace Treaties, Suggests Two Points to the Four Governments

[Central News Agency, London, 30th dispatch] Regarding the discussion of the German-Austrian peace treaties by the representatives of the four Foreign Ministers, the Chinese government, when invited to express its views, sent notes to the British, American, Soviet, and French governments, reiterating its consistent position that, according to the Potsdam Agreement, the drafting of peace treaties with the European enemy states should be undertaken by the member states that signed the surrender terms in the Council of Foreign Ministers. However, the convening of the peace conference and all procedural issues related to the organization of the conference should be decided in advance through consultation by all five member states of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Regarding the Austrian treaty, it is especially necessary for the five powers to consult, as the Potsdam Resolution did not mention Austria at all. It is reported that the Chinese government proposed: (1) The German-Austrian peace treaties should be formally discussed at a peace conference held by the relevant countries within the United Nations; (2) All procedural issues regarding the convening of the peace conference should be consulted and decided upon by all five countries of the Council of Foreign Ministers. It is also reported that the Chinese government stated that it would submit its views on the substantive aspects of the German and Austrian treaties only after these procedural issues have been agreed upon. Therefore, the Chinese government did not make any statements or suggestions to the conference of the four Foreign Ministers' representatives.

### Austrian Representative States Desires for Peace Treaty, Rejects Southern Territorial Demands

Czech Representative Presents Opinions on German Issues

[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] The four Foreign Ministers' deputies continued their meeting today to discuss Austria's 60-page memorandum. First, the Austrian representative, Foreign Minister Gruber, presented his views, requesting that the Allied powers not impose excessive burdens on Austria, which would hinder its recovery. He stated that the Austrian peace treaty should aim for the following two goals: (1) to confirm Austria's separation from Germany; (2) to avoid imposing excessive burdens on Austria, which would hinder its recovery. Subsequently, the head of the Austrian delegation, Prime Minister Figl, spoke, solemnly confirming, in the name of the Austrian people, the declaration issued in April 1945, announcing Austria's separation from Germany and demanding the restoration of the 1937 borders. He stated that Carinthia was granted to Austria through a referendum as early as 1920, so Austria opposes any foreign demand to acquire Carinthia. Regarding the issue of reparations, Austria was the first to sacrifice under Nazi aggression, so the Allied occupying forces in Austria hope to withdraw as soon as possible. As for the property that Germany seized from Austria, it must be returned to its original owners, and the Allied property in Austria that was damaged in the war should also be the responsibility of Germany.

The four Foreign Ministers' deputies also discussed the German issue this afternoon. The Czech representative stated that the Allied powers must strictly control Germany and station troops in the country until it has been disarmed militarily, economically, and psychologically. The unification of Germany is quite dangerous and could lead to the re-merger of Germany and Austria. In the political aspect, the Czech delegation demanded the cancellation of the Munich Agreement. As for the economic aspect, the Czech Republic demanded the restoration of the pre-war situation so that it could obtain convenience in transportation and communication through Germany and on the Danube, Rhine, and Elbe rivers.

### MacArthur Orders Ban on General Strike, Japanese Labor Community's Pace is Disrupted

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 31st] General MacArthur issued an order at 3:00 PM today prohibiting the nationwide general strike scheduled for February 1. The Ministry of Home Affairs then issued a notice to local officials across the country at 4:00 PM, instructing them to comply with MacArthur's order and ensure public order in the future. MacArthur stated that he took this measure to prevent fatal damage to public welfare. Japanese society today is under the occupation and control of the Allied forces due to its defeat in the war, its cities are devastated, its industries are nearly at a standstill, and the majority of its people are teetering on the brink of starvation. A strike will inevitably disrupt transportation and communication, block the movement of coal, and paralyze industrial activity, which will plunge most Japanese people into disaster, just as a few people drove the Japanese into the devastation of war in the past. This will put the United Nations in a dilemma, forcing it to decide whether to allow the Japanese people to fall into such reckless actions at the hands of a few, or to sacrifice the United Nations' own scarce resources and invest an unlimited amount of food and other necessities into Japan beyond what is necessary to salvage the situation. However, I cannot ask the people of the United Nations to bear this heavy burden. Although I have been forced to take this extraordinary measure, I have no intention of restricting the freedom of action granted to Japanese workers to achieve legitimate goals.

Most strangely, Wang Wanben, who had sworn to heaven to be a witness a few days ago, repeatedly shook his head in response yesterday.

The confrontation between victims and firefighters held in the Municipal Government conference room yesterday afternoon was the climax of the comprehensive investigation and was emotionally charged. According to the head of the police Criminal Division, a total of seven people had been detained for dereliction of duty (none of whom had been handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office as of yesterday). They are: Dai Guangrong (No. 11), Zhu Changhe (No. 17), Cai Zhiying (No. 587), Shang Zhikui (No. 340), Huang Baoqi (Captain of the Jing'an Temple District Squad), Li Xun (District Squad Leader), and Yuan Chengjun (Police Officer No. 108). He stated that Dai Guangrong and Shang Zhikui had confessed to looting during the fire at the police station. However, Zhu Changhe (No. 17) claimed to be a coppersmith and did not participate in outdoor duties, so he suspected that it might be Zhu Changhe (No. 27), whom the victim, Zhou Qifang, had mistaken. However, Zhou Qifang stated that he would definitely not misremember and said that he could identify the person face to face. However, at 9:00 PM last night, when the investigation committee escorted the three suspects detained at the police station to the Municipal Government for Zhou Qifang to identify, they found many errors. He identified Li Xun as No. 17, identified a police officer from the detention center as someone he had seen at the fire scene wearing a flat-topped hat, and claimed not to recognize Zhu Changhe (No. 17). When Li Xun described the rescue efforts, he suddenly burst into tears. He said that he had been ordered to go to the fire scene to clean up the remaining fire and had never entered No. 27. At 6:30 AM on the second day of the new year, he took the No. 49 vehicle back to the district squad and met Police Chief No. 390, who could testify to this. Until 4:00 PM, he was ordered by Section Chief Ye to return to the fire scene. At other times, he remained at the squad headquarters and never left. Police Officer No. 113 could testify for him. At this point, Ke Kexin indicated that District Squad Leader Li and the coppersmith No. 17 had indeed been wrongfully detained and should be released on bail immediately. Inspector General Zhang Da stated that the detention was ordered by the Mayor, so the release of the two also required the Mayor's approval. Because of time constraints yesterday, they could not be released on bail, but it is hoped that they can be released on bail today.

Surging Tides During Questioning

Zhu Qinglan, the Jing'an Temple District Squad Deputy who drove the first fire truck to arrive at the scene, was immediately announced by Ke Kexin to be removed from his position and investigated after he finished his statement. He said that he was acting on the Mayor's order, as Zhu Qinglan bore the responsibility of overall dispatch and should be investigated immediately. Furthermore, when questioning Zhou Yanbing, the captain of the Yangshupu District Squad, Zhou Qifang jumped up from his seat and pointed out that he had seen the captain climb into the third floor of No. 27 on a fire ladder and had not seen him climb out, fearing that he had left through the neighboring building. Principal Pan also stated that he had seen Captain Zhou at the fire scene, causing the atmosphere at the meeting to become extremely tense. As a result, because no concrete evidence of looting was obtained, Zhu was detained.

Furthermore, Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang immediately began a thorough investigation after the incident, and officers and team members were questioned in detail. At the end of yesterday's meeting, Ke Kexin asked him to make a public statement, but due to time constraints (yesterday's questioning lasted until 10:00 PM) and the fact that the investigation had not been fully completed, he had to wait a few days. However, he expressed the hope that the case would not be delayed, and that those who violated the law should be dealt with accordingly, and those who deserved to be killed should be killed. Yesterday's meeting also decided to set up opinion boxes at the fire scene starting today, hoping that citizens would provide evidence and opinions as soon as possible. The investigation committee also scheduled to continue interviewing the American military police who assisted in the rescue at the scene at 2:00 PM today.

[Another Report] The seven suspects currently detained at the police detention center, except for Li Xun and Zhu Changhe, who may be released on bail today by order of the Mayor, will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning today. Furthermore, Prosecutor Shen Zushou summoned Wang Yunfu and his family yesterday morning.

### Eradicating the Corrupt Elements: The Mayor Expresses His Determination in a Speech

The questioning began at 3:00 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Auditorium. In addition to the five members of the investigation committee, those present included Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang, Police Criminal Division Director Zhang Shi, Supervisory Envoy Zhang Quan, Shi Jiliang, and reporters from various newspapers. Thirteen firefighters were summoned. Mayor Wu gave a speech first, briefly stating that the reason why he and Director Xuan attached particular importance to the Seymour Road fire was that they hoped that all firefighters could understand. He deeply believed that most firefighters wanted to do a good job, and that many bad habits during the enemy-puppet period must be eradicated. If there were still cases of extortion and looting among today's firefighters, it would be a disgrace to all civil servants, and the government should investigate and deal with it. He was not treating all firefighters as criminals. He firmly believed that most of them were law-abiding, so those who were attacked by public opinion this time were implicated by a few bad apples. In order to save the reputation of the entire fire department, those who were negligent in their duties must be severely punished, and he believed that this was also everyone's intention. Chinese people often suffer losses and dare not speak up, and it is difficult to find out the truth after the fact. The purpose of organizing the investigation committee was also for this reason, and he hoped that everyone would also automatically report any wrongdoing and not regard the investigation committee as an interrogation organ, but take this opportunity to eradicate the corrupt elements. Before civil servants' salaries can be increased, a special bonus method will be established, and bonuses will be given to those who work particularly hard to encourage them. He hoped that everyone would value themselves, distinguish between right and wrong, and eliminate the bad apples to protect the reputation of the fire department.

After Mayor Wu finished his speech, he left, and the questioning began. The senior firefighters who arrived at the scene left the hall first, and then were questioned separately. Chairman Ge asked the questions, and then Director Zhang, Senator Zhang, and District Chief Hou supplemented them. Newspaper reporters present were also specially allowed to ask questions, but few spoke. During the questioning, the committee members' tone was still tactful, and the main questions were: When did you receive the alarm? When did you arrive at the scene? What was the distribution of water hoses? What was the distribution of work among your subordinates? Which building did you enter? When did you leave? And what was the rescue situation?

### Thirteen Firefighters Summoned: Emphasized That They Had Not Been Negligent in Their Duties

Those summoned yesterday included Zhu Qinglan, Deputy of the Jing'an Temple District Squad, Huang Zhongxiu, Deputy of the Xinzha District Squad, Zhou Yuehuan, Deputy of the Central Fire Brigade District Squad, Xu Liren, Captain of the Central District, Wang Wentao, Section Chief of the First Section of the Fire Department, Xie Zhiyong, Section Chief of the Mechanical Section of the Fire Department, Xia Guoliang, Chief of the Fire Brigade, Zhou Yanbing, Captain of the Yangshupu District Squad, Qiang Fulin, Captain of the Hongkou District Squad, and Jiang Zhijing, Deputy of the District Squad, Wu Yiyong, Deputy of the Yichang Road District Squad, Li Cheng, Captain of the Jing'an District Squad, Tang Zhiqun, Captain of the Central District Squad, and thirteen others. Summarizing the content of their replies, they all described the situation of diligently fighting the fire upon receiving the alarm, and emphasized that the firefighters had not been negligent in any way. The content of their answers is recorded separately below:

### The First Vehicle to Arrive at the Fire Scene: Zhu Qinglan Describes the Process in Detail

Zhu Qinglan (Deputy of the Jing'an Temple District Squad) stated that he received the alarm at 9:48 AM and immediately prepared to depart. The No. 35 fire truck he was riding in had trouble starting due to the cold weather. After starting, the journey was relatively smooth. When the truck passed Seymour Road, it already saw that the fire was very strong. The fire truck stopped at the intersection of Gordon Road and Wuding Road. The most accurate time was about 9:55 AM. It was the first vehicle to arrive at the scene. About four minutes later, the water hose began to spray water. It was directed at No. 425, where the fire started. After about half an hour, the fire was under control. Observing that the fire was spreading towards the rubber factory, he used two hoses to water the rubber factory. One hose watered the Wang family at No. 29, and the other sprayed water at the front of the fire scene. At that time, the Wang family's wooden shed had already been burning. There was a lot of smoke at that time. After dispersing it with the water hose, he saw white smoke from the window and the wind direction suddenly changed, and the fire headed toward No. 29. He immediately led a firefighter, No. 76, and rushed into No. 29 with a hose to put out the fire. He only went to the second floor and then withdrew to direct other workers. Firefighter No. 76 was inside the Wang family's house and only retreated when the roof was about to collapse. He heard him say: "The third floor is really impossible to stand on." As for the reason why the aerial ladder was not used at first, it was because the No. 25 truck did not have this equipment. It was borrowed from the second fire truck of the Xinzha District when it arrived and then used. Furthermore, each firefighter carried a small ax, but he did not see any of them being used.

### Huang Zhongxiu Describes the Process in Detail: Guarantees That He Did Not Enter No. 29

Huang Zhongxiu (Deputy of the Xinzha District Squad) stated: He does not remember the time of departure clearly, but he only remembers that it was only five or six minutes later than the first alarm. He departed in the No. 33 vehicle and stopped at the intersection of Wuding Road and Seymour Road. He saw that the fire was very strong, and the wooden sheds of five houses had been burned, and the fences had also collapsed. It was extinguished half an hour later. The five or six people following him guaranteed that they did not enter No. 29, but he could not guarantee for others. After the second fire, he met American soldiers who asked: Do you need help? He replied: Yes. The American soldiers broke the glass on the second-floor window with stones to facilitate watering. He stood on the tinplate of the top floor of the Wang family's kitchen, broke the second-floor window with a awl, and watered with a hose. He left the fire scene at 5:00 AM the next morning and was relieved by Zhou Tingbing, the captain of the Yangshupu District Squad.

### Pressing Down on the Hose: Abandoned to Escape

Zhou Yuehuan (Deputy of the Central District Squad) stated: He received the alarm at 10:55 AM, departed in the No. 38 vehicle, and arrived at the fire scene eight minutes later, stopping on the east side of Jiangning Road. When he arrived, the fire at the rubber factory had not yet been extinguished, and the third floor of the Wang family had collapsed. Nos. 90 and 360 had entered the second floor of the Wang family with him, and Nos. 278 and 348 stayed downstairs. At that time, the lights had been turned off, and he did not see anyone entering or leaving. He only saw several leather belts lying on the ground. Suddenly, the second floor also collapsed, and Nos. 278 and 250 were injured and carried away on the spot. The hose brought in was pressed down and could not be pulled out, so it was abandoned to escape. The leather belt now left in No. 29 is it. He left the fire scene around 5:00 AM the next morning.

### Two American Soldiers Assisted in Watering

Xu Liren (Captain of the Central District Squad) stated: He received the alarm at 11:15 AM, departed in the No. 31 vehicle, and arrived at the fire scene eight minutes later, stopping at the intersection of Gordon Road and Wuding Road. At that time, it was impossible to enter No. 29. He risked rushing into No. 23, but found that it was too late to save it. He concentrated his efforts on watering No. 21. He broke the lock on the back door of No. 21 with pliers, but he still couldn't save it. He didn't withdraw until the second floor collapsed. He saw two American soldiers helping to water on the third floor, estimating that they entered No. 21 before they did.

### Wang Wentao Said: The House Was Not Good

Wang Wentao (Section Chief of the First Section of the Fire Department) stated: He arrived at the fire scene at 1:20 AM and focused on watering Nos. 15 and 10. After the incident, he reviewed the main reasons for the spread, because although firewalls were built between the foreign houses, there were wooden frames running through them, and the flames spread through these frames. The history of the construction of the foreign houses was more than forty years, so there were many shortcomings. Modern houses would not cause such a disaster. When the fire was raging, he used three to five flood hoses (i.e., hoses with the greatest water force), and the fire was contained. He left around 5:00 AM after the peak of the fire.

Xie Zhiyong (Section Chief of the Mechanical Section of the Fire Department) stated: His task was not to put out the fire but to pay attention to the vehicles. He notified the communications room to call the central district to move the vehicles, and he personally went to the fire scene to inspect. He only heard the driver of No. 606 say that the No. 30 vehicle was broken. He went to inspect it himself, and the water tank was damaged, but it could not be repaired at the fire scene, but it did not hinder the water spraying work.

Xia Guoliang (Chief of the Fire Brigade) stated: After receiving the alarm, he first dispatched several fire trucks from the Jing'an Temple District, and later, due to the strong fire, he continued to dispatch four vehicles from the Xinzha District. He personally went to the fire scene and tried to cut through the tin roof but failed. He withdrew at 5:00 AM on the 23rd. Afterwards, after reading newspaper articles stating that firefighters had been negligent, he visited Wang Yunfu at the International Hotel as an old friend of twenty years, but Wang denied everything, saying that what was published in the newspapers was not true.

### After Arguing, Zhou Tingbing Finally Admitted That He Had Entered No. 27

Zhou Tingbing (Captain of the Yangshupu District Squad) said: He received a notice at 4:00 AM on the 23rd and went to the fire scene to take over at about 6:00 AM. He left at 1:00 PM. His task was to put out the remaining fire. He entered Nos. 29, 23, 11, and 5 to put out the fire, but he definitely had not been to No. 27, because there was no remaining fire in No. 27. (After Zhou Qifang, the victim of No. 27, and Pan Wenzhen, the principal of Seymour Road National Primary School, told him that they had witnessed Zhou Tingbing climb into No. 27 on a ladder, and that the fire was at its greatest in No. 27 at that time, Zhou finally admitted, but argued that he could not clearly distinguish the numbers).

### Du Yuesheng and Yang Hu Go to Hong Kong Together Yesterday

Du Yuesheng, president of the local association, followed his doctor's advice and took a French postal ship to Hong Kong yesterday to recuperate. He will return to Shanghai as soon as the climate in Shanghai warms up. Furthermore, Yang Hu, chairman of the Seamen's Special Party Department, went to Hong Kong on the same ship as Du to comfort returning seamen and overseas Chinese in the Hong Kong and Macau area.

### Qiang Fulin and Others Describe the Fire Scene

Qiang Fulin, captain of the Hongkou District Squad, stated: After receiving the report that day, he and Deputy Jiang Zhijing led eleven firefighters in the No. 32 pumper truck at 12:20 PM. After arriving at the fire scene, the truck stopped on Wuding Road, and the leather belt was connected to the No. 2096 hydrant at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Seymour Road. He was ordered by District Squad Leader Li to water the Nos. 3, 5 and two residential houses. Deputy Jiang led the Nos. 198, 335, and 145 three police officers to climb onto the roof on a 55-foot ladder with a hose, intending to pry open the tin roof and water inside. He led the police officers into No. 5, intending to break the ceiling of the three-story building to attack from above and below. However, after reaching the third floor, the room was filled with thick smoke, and at the same time, the fire had spread. He had no choice but to go downstairs. By the time he reached the lower floor, the second floor was also on fire. At that time, the two police officers, Nos. 198 and 145, who were watering on the roof, had their faces burned by the flames coming out of the roof. Under this situation, he had to temporarily evacuate the dangerous area, and used a "flood hose" with other team members at the scene to water in a pincer movement, and only returned to the team at about 5:00 AM the next morning. He then questioned Jiang Zhijing, deputy of the Hongkou District Squad, whose words were largely the same.

### Li Chenglie Said: He Did Not Put Out the Fire

Li Chenglie, captain of the Jing'an District Squad, stated: He only sent oil to the fire scene from the headquarters to replenish the No. 35 vehicle because he received a report that the No. 35 vehicle was out of oil, and did not participate in putting out the fire. Tang Zhiqun, captain of the Central District Squad, said: Because he received calls from the Nos. 31 and 38 fire trucks requesting to send more vehicles to help, he led thirteen police officers in the No. 46 vehicle to the scene at 12:20 PM, and stopped at the intersection of Xinzha Road, where the district squad leader assigned work, but at that time, the nearby Taiping hydrants had been occupied by those who arrived first, so they could not connect to the water, and only returned to the team at 3:40 AM the next morning. At this point, the questioning was completed.

### Finance Committee of the City Council Holds Ninth Meeting; Municipal Construction Donation for This Year Cancelled After Discussion; Submitted to the Speaker for Review and Transfer to the Budget Committee

[Report from Our Newspaper] The issue of collecting municipal construction donations for this year has a great impact on the burden of citizens, but it also affects the city's fiscal revenue. Therefore, although this case was discussed once at the Second General Assembly of the City Council, there was no result. The decision made by the General Assembly was "to discuss it again if necessary after the budget revenue and expenditure are determined." Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Finance Committee of the City Council held its ninth meeting. Senators Dong Ganwen, Guo Lingshuang, and Lao Jingxiu proposed, and Shi Yonggeng, Shen Ding, Wang Weiyin, and Gu Baoyu jointly suggested "that the Budget Committee cancel the municipal construction donation for the 36th year, and that the central government allocate funds to subsidize the city government's budget deficit in order to reduce the burden on citizens." After a long discussion, it was decided to cancel the municipal construction donation, and the Budget Committee was notified accordingly.

### Requesting Subsidies from the Central Government Is Like Quenching Thirst With Plums; Director Gu Asks for Further Consideration

However, according to Director Gu Chunfan of the Finance Bureau, the case of collecting municipal construction donations for the 36th year was proposed by the Mayor. This tax was set at 30 billion yuan and is a major item in the city's budget revenue. If the collection is cancelled, it will have a major impact and affect the city's finances more than anything else. He must ask for further consideration. Requesting subsidies from the central government is like "quenching thirst with plums." Director Gu also described the experience of requesting subsidies, which was very painful. Since the city's recovery, it has only received 6 billion yuan in allocations from the central government in April last year, and after the promulgation of the newly revised Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, the central government has no obligation to allocate funds again this year. Recently, the central government still wants Shanghai to spend 60 billion yuan, which is even more impossible to meet. In fact, collecting municipal construction donations is not too much of a burden for citizens. The highest amount currently collected is 80 times the housing rental value of the 26th year. If municipal construction donations are not collected, the house tax can be increased according to law, that is, the housing price will be re-evaluated, and the amount collected will be 8,000 times or 10,000 times that of the pre-war period.

### Deputy Speaker Xu Indicates: Taking Into Account Financial Difficulties

At the same time, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing also indicated: In the beginning, most citizens opposed municipal construction donations because they were dissatisfied with the double increase in winter. The difficulty of the city's financial revenue should also be taken into account. If municipal construction donations are not collected, another tax will inevitably be levied, which is actually impossible. How can the missing 30 billion yuan be compensated? Therefore, it is suggested that a decision be postponed and a decision be made after discussing with the Budget Committee.

Finally, the case was decided: "Passed and sent to the Speaker and Deputy Speaker for review and transfer to the Budget Committee. If the budget revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, the General Assembly will discuss ways to raise funds."

However, it was approved that the winter housing tax for the 35th year should still be collected according to the autumn method before the central government's new regulations are promulgated, as requested by the Finance Bureau. As for the evaluation of housing rental value, it will still be based on the standards set by the former Works Department, and only the multiple will be increased.

### Representatives of the Restaurant Industry Go to the Meeting to Petition

Representatives of the restaurant industry association of this city went to the association yesterday afternoon to petition for: (1) Raising the starting point for the banquet tax from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. (2) Reducing the banquet tax from 15% to 10%. (3) Allowing restaurants with music and dance facilities but without dancers and commercial operations to be taxed according to the banquet tax instead of the entertainment tax. (4) Please exempt the banquet tax for noodle shops. Senator Wang Weiyin met and replied: The subcommittee is not in a position to overturn the resolutions of the general assembly and can only submit the various points of the petition to the general assembly for consideration and public decision.

### Municipal Government Ordinances: Sent to the Meeting for Review

Regulations Committee Resolution

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Regulations Committee of the City Council held its ninth meeting at the council yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The resolutions included: (1) Informing the Municipal Government to revise the various ordinances before submitting them to the council for review. (2) Notifying the Director of the Health Bureau and the Barber Industry Association to send representatives to the next meeting to explain the regulations for barber shops, so that they can be reviewed. Similarly, please also send representatives from the city's Slaughtering Industry Association and Fresh Pig Stall Association to explain so that relevant regulations can be reviewed.

### Blood Transfusion King: Has Been in This Business for Thirteen Years, Supplying More Than 30,000 CC of Blood

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Ali Che Jacobi is a Jewish man who specializes in blood transfusions. In his thirteen years of blood transfusion history, he has transfused 36,000 cubic centimeters of blood, truly making him a blood transfusion king.

A few days ago, he transfused blood for a Russian patient in the Sacred Heart Hospital, which was his ninety-sixth blood transfusion. He is now resting at home.

At the beginning of last month, he transfused blood twice in half an hour and did not feel any adverse reactions, only needing nutritious food.

In 1929, Jacobi transfused blood for the first time in Berlin to save his father. But his father eventually died despite the efforts. However, since then, Macobi has learned that he is blood type O and can transfuse blood for anyone with any blood type. Four years later, he began to work as a blood transfusion for a living.

In 1913, Hitler came to power and ordered a ban on the transfusion of the blood of the Germanic "superman" into the blood of Jews. The Jews in Germany automatically organized a blood transfusion organization. By 1938, Jacobi had transfused blood a total of six times.

However, it was not until Jacobi fled to Shanghai that he made a living solely by blood transfusions.

Jacobi was originally a typesetter in Germany. But in Shanghai, typesetting was not enough to support his family, so he transfused blood for the Chinese Medical Association.

Since March 1941, Jacobi has transfused blood a total of ninety-six times, including patients of various nationalities, as well as Hongen, Gongji, and other hospitals.

Of the ninety-six people, one person had been tortured by the Japanese military police. If it had not been for Macobi's blood transfusion, there would have been no hope of recovery.

### Disputes Arise Over the Dismissal of Workers at the China Merchants Bureau Shipbuilding Repair Plant

The Second Shipbuilding Repair Plant of the State-owned China Merchants Bureau on Jichang Street in this city dismissed 86 workers from among more than 300 workers yesterday on the grounds of downsizing. The workers were very alarmed upon hearing this and elected seven representatives, including Wu Xinde, to plead with the factory to withdraw the order to no avail, resulting in a dispute. They then went to the Shipbuilding Industry Trade Union in District One to request assistance, and the union has reported the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.

### Dock Workers Dispute Loading Jobs; Military Police Suppress the Situation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday at around 5 PM, dozens of workers from two groups at the Swire Wharf on the Bund of Jinling East Road engaged in a dispute over jobs, escalating the situation and nearly leading to a brawl. After the Huangpu Police Bureau, Taishan Police Bureau, and the Military Police Corps dispatched patrol cars and sent military police to the scene to suppress the situation, order was restored. It is understood that before the war, loading and unloading at the Swire Wharf was handled by a group of workers led by Zhou Ruisun. During the enemy occupation, the work was contracted to a group of workers led by Chen Yiyu, a compradore for Swire. After the victory, the Executive Yuan issued an official document allowing the two groups to cooperate and share the work. However, on May 18th of last year, the municipal government ordered that only Chen's group could work, causing livelihood problems for Zhou's group. They had petitioned several times without result. Yesterday, they gathered at the wharf intending to participate in the work, which led to the dispute.

### Finance Bureau Urges Reporting of Business Volume; Fines Will Be Imposed for Late Filing

[Our Newspaper's Report] The deadline for reporting business tax revenue for the autumn of the 35th year of the Republic was previously set by the Finance Bureau as February 5th. As this deadline is rapidly approaching, it is reported that the Finance Bureau has decided to impose fines in accordance with Article 17 of the Business Tax Law on those who fail to report by the deadline, and to directly determine their business tax amount. Taxpayers are not allowed to appeal.

### Flexible Measures for Direct Tax; Application for Account Verification and Reduction Allowed

The Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has been taken over by Mr. William Tweedie. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to tax revenue in this city, especially the uncollected portion of the Class One profit-seeking professional income tax for the 34th year of the Republic. Mr. Lou is currently discussing collection and closing methods with relevant parties. According to sources from the Tax Affairs Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the previously agreed-upon budget of 20 billion yuan has not yet been fully met, and many households have applied for account verification and reduction due to their inability to bear the burden. These requests should be verified and reduced accordingly. Those who have suffered losses or have not yet resumed business and have not filed returns, resulting in the tax bureau estimating and levying taxes based on capital and being unable to pay, should also be investigated and exempted. The tax bureau may adopt this principle to close the case. Those who do not have the above-mentioned difficulties but delay paying taxes will be severely dealt with according to the law. Furthermore, according to a responsible person at the tax bureau, those whose tax amounts are estimated according to simplified tax collection methods and have not yet been finalized must first pay 40% of the tax amount, and at the same time submit their account books to apply for a review, unless they can prove that they have suffered losses or have not yet operated. Otherwise, they will be transferred to the court for legal punishment. It was also stated that the national treasury year will end on February 10th, and it will be impossible to postpone the taxes for the 34th year of the Republic.

### Hotel Inspections; Improvement Measures

The military and police authorities in this city have always been very serious about hotel inspections, fearing that unscrupulous individuals may be mixed in. However, ordinary travelers generally find the nighttime inspections disruptive to their sleep, and hope that the military and police authorities will improve the situation. Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jiying, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Council, jointly sent a letter to Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, yesterday, requesting improvements to the hotel inspections. After receiving the letter, the headquarters replied, stating that the headquarters had already drafted measures to improve hotel inspections and would implement them as soon as Commander Xuan returned from Nanjing and approved them.

### A "Trash" Person with an Evil Mind; Conspires with Accomplices to Extort Colleagues

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 8:30 PM on the 20th of last month, five people claiming to be staff members of a certain organization suddenly came to the home of Lu Liansheng at 736 Fanhangdu Road in West Shanghai. They threatened Lu with guns, falsely accusing him of being suspected of instigating murder, and used the excuse of searching for weapons to seize 1.19 million legal tender. Not satisfied, they insisted on demanding five gold bars to settle the matter. After Lu repeatedly pleaded, they agreed to pay another 1 million yuan the next afternoon, but they did not show up. Later, the victim, Lu Liansheng, reported the case to the Jiangning Branch Bureau, which dispatched police to investigate. At 9 PM on the 23rd, the police officers in charge of the case traced the suspects to Room 239 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. There, a person claiming to be surnamed Yu, who worked at a military uniform factory, had rented the room. The officers entered and questioned him, and found suspicious evidence. They kept him under surveillance. Soon, someone from the Daxing Hotel on Hubei Road called the number and asked for Peng Xueliang. Seeing that the name did not match, they took him to the bureau for questioning, and he confessed the truth. According to his confession, his real name was Peng Xueliang, also known as "Trash." He worked at a military uniform factory and conspired with his colleagues Chen Zhiying and Lu Susheng, because Lu's family was wealthy. They colluded with Tang Min, Zhang Bin, Li Wanshan, Lin Jun, and Xu Zhimin, who were employed by a certain organization, and went to Lu's home to extort money. The branch bureau, based on his confession, arrested Xu Zhimin, Chen Zhiying, Lin Jun, and others at their addresses.

### Many Disputes Over Pre-War Debts; Ministry of Justice Retrieves Files for Research

[Our Newspaper's Report] Disputes over pre-war debts and the return of bank deposits have repeatedly occurred, such as the case between Chen Jilin and the Four Banks Savings Society, the racecourse bond case, the case between the Lu brothers and the Juxingcheng Bank regarding the repayment of zero-deposit lump-sum savings, and the case between Shen Haoming and others requesting the Zhongnan Bank to repay silver deposits with silver. The details were reported in this newspaper. In addition to the Juxingcheng case, where the court ordered repayment at 800 times the original amount due to the zero-deposit lump-sum nature of the account, the rest were ordered to be repaid at 1,000 times the original amount. However, after the Four Banks Savings Society and the Juxingcheng Bank appealed to the High Court, the 1,000-fold repayment was reduced to 800-fold, and the 800-fold repayment was reduced to 500-fold. Since this precedent has had a significant impact, the Ministry of Judicial Administration is conducting a thorough study of this issue and recently retrieved all the files and judgments from the Shanghai District Court regarding the case of Shen Haoming and others suing the Zhongnan Bank, requesting that their previous silver dollar deposits be repaid at the price of silver dollars or taels of silver.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Jiang Changle and Jiang Linsheng, apprentices at the Zhenfeng Underwear Factory on Jianguo East Road in this city, were joking and playing around during their free time after work on December 5th of last year.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yan Wu, a 45-year-old woman from Yancheng, lived in a shantytown on Gonghe Road in Zhabei. She had a son named Guangde, 17, and a daughter named Sanbao, 20, who was beautiful. Because of poverty, Yan relied on washing clothes for a living. He Wenqiang, a 30-year-old soldier from Hubei in the General Logistics Department, often frequented Yan's house to have his clothes washed and developed affection for Sanbao, showing her courtesy.

### Verdict in Large-Scale Aerial Drug Trafficking Case; Zhu Qishan, Zhang Mingyuan, and Sun Zhicheng Sentenced to Death; Courtroom Filled with Cries

[Our Newspaper's Report] In September of last year, this city cracked down on a large-scale organized drug trafficking organization. After repeated trials by the District Court, the case against the seventeen defendants concluded on January 28th. The verdict was announced yesterday, with the main culprits Zhu Qishan, Zhang Mingyuan, and Sun Zhicheng each sentenced to death. This is the first death sentence handed down by the District Court this year.

Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the gallery of the First Criminal Court of the District Court was packed with family members of the defendants. The court was heavily guarded, with officers holding loaded pistols stationed around the perimeter, several times more than usual. Judge Shen Tianbao appeared solemn. After the seventeen defendants entered the courtroom, Judge Shen called their names one by one, and then paused briefly. The entire courtroom was silent, with the audience focusing intently on the court. Judge Shen slowly rose and read the main text of the judgment: "Zhu Qishan, Zhang Mingyuan, and Sun Zhicheng, for transporting drugs, are each sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights for life. Zhang Gengtian, for transporting drugs, is sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for life. Yan Dongfu, for assisting in transporting drugs, is sentenced to six years in prison and deprived of civil rights for six years. Song Zixin, Zhang Yiren, Zhang Li Bingkun, and Li Hongying, for transporting drugs, are each sentenced to twelve years in prison and deprived of civil rights for twelve years. Zhou Da, for selling drugs, is sentenced to twelve years in prison and deprived of civil rights for twelve years. Ma Xiangwu and Lu Xinquan are found not guilty. The public prosecution of Li Dingguo is not accepted (Li has hanged himself in prison). The morphine and gold bars are confiscated." In addition, the Nantong District Court, based on the confession of drug trafficker Su Suiliang, sent a document to the Shanghai District Court, which led to the seizure of Zhu Qishan and his wives for drug trafficking. This portion was also included in the judgment: "The public prosecution of Zhu Qishan is not accepted. Zhu Liu Wenlan (Zhu's wife) is sentenced to eight years in prison for intending to sell and possessing drugs. Zhu Decao (Zhu's wife) is sentenced to five years in prison for intending to sell and possessing drugs. Zhang Wenying (Zhu's niece) and Zhang Jianghou (maid) are found not guilty." The three main culprits' faces changed immediately upon hearing the death sentence, and a commotion erupted in the gallery. The court police and bailiffs shouted to stop them and temporarily restricted the audience's movements to prevent accidents. The convicts were immediately escorted back to the holding cell. The family members left the court, some wailing loudly, others crying out to the heavens. Only a few relatives and friends of Ma Xiangwu and Lu Xinquan stepped forward to shake their hands and congratulate them. The sentenced convicts were then escorted by court police to a jeep ten-wheeled prisoner transport vehicle parked outside the door, and sped towards Shanghai Prison, leaving behind a scene of weeping in the District Court.

### "Filial Son" Discovered During Traitor Trial; Claimed to Have Cut Flesh to Cure Parent, How Could He Recognize a Thief as His Father? Huang Heting and Jin Yuzhen Verdicts to Be Announced on February 7th

[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang Heting, originally a rice merchant, was accused of serving as the head of the First Township of the Zhabei Puppet Autonomous Association, the captain of the Puppet Self-Defense Corps, the head of the Puppet First Joint Bao, the leader of the Puppet Zhabei District Grain Public Sale Office Group, the leader of the Puppet Datong Road Public Air Defense Self-Defense Corps, the leader of the Puppet Ailu Protection Corps, and the leader of the Puppet Youth League Branch. He was said to have frequently interacted with Japanese Navy Marine Corps Captain Naka Moto Gi Saburo and translator Kamidaiichi Yu and to have handled puppet baojia for the enemy, controlled food, and collected fees. He was tried in the High Court yesterday. The defendant argued, "I took up the puppet post because I was elected by the people of Zhabei. I am extremely filial to my mother and have cut flesh to make soup to treat her illness. How could I help the enemy and the puppets do evil?" The court ordered the trial to be concluded, and the verdict was set for February 7th.

In addition, Jin Yuzhen, who originally opened the Hefengchang Department Store on Wuma Road, was accused of knowing the leader of the Japanese Military Police Squad and secretly reporting information about our underground workers. A person named Jin Bohe, also known as Bai Leng and Qian Shujun, was appointed by the Military Statistics Bureau as an investigator in the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau to cover up his work. He was discovered by the defendant and reported to the Japanese Military Police, which led to Jin Bohe's arrest and torture. He was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. The defendant argued: "I am a legitimate businessman and have no dealings with the Japanese Military Police. Jin Bohe fabricated the charges out of spite because I refused to lend him money." The court announced that the trial was concluded because the witness, Jin Bohe, had repeatedly failed to appear, and the verdict was set for February 7th.

### Electricity Surcharge to be Implemented on the 15th of This Month; Restrictions on Electricity Use Expected to be Lifted from April

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, reported at a press conference yesterday: Because the Fuel Management Committee increased the price of allocated coal by 42,500 yuan per ton from February 1st, according to the method of coal surcharge on electricity prices, the Shanghai Electric Power Company and other companies were approved to increase the normal price by 42 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and the French Concession Water and Electricity Company was approved to increase the electricity price by 12 yuan per kilowatt-hour, which will be implemented from the meter reading date of February 15th. As a result, the electricity price in the former International Settlement area will increase from 120 yuan to 162 yuan per kilowatt-hour, the electricity price in the Zhabei area will increase from 156 yuan to 198 yuan per kilowatt-hour, the electricity price in the Nanshi and Pudong areas will increase from 150 yuan to 192 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and the electricity price in the former French Concession area will increase from 150 yuan to 162 yuan per kilowatt-hour. Restrictions on electricity use are expected to be lifted by April 1st at the latest. The reason why the surcharge increase is different between the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the French Concession Company is because the French Concession Company's own power generation is entirely oil-fired, and the impact is only on the portion purchased from the Shanghai Electric Power Company. If the price of oil changes in the future and the price per kilowatt-hour is adjusted, the fuel surcharge added by the French Concession Company may be slightly higher than that of other companies.

Director Zhao also stated: For public utilities such as trams and water supply, which use more electricity than other public utilities, this surcharge will not be temporarily applied to avoid simultaneous price increases for trams and water, which would increase the burden on citizens. As for the gas price, which has the most direct relationship with the coal price increase, it will inevitably be adjusted accordingly. The amount to be added per unit is currently being carefully reviewed.

### The Sole Survivor of the China National Aviation Corporation Accident Returns to Shanghai by Special Plane; the Lucky Child is Just Over One Year Old; Parents and Older Brother Perish; Cause of Accident Still Unclear

Xiao was sentenced to five years in prison by the enemy and sent to Zhenjiang Prison, where he died shortly after. After the victory of the War of Resistance, Xiao's family reported Zhang Guanfu to the High Prosecutor's Office. The High Court ruled that although Zhang Guanfu had greedily accepted rewards from the enemy, he did not hold any puppet positions, so the crime of collaboration with the enemy could not be established. He was charged with obstructing freedom and detained. Mrs. Xiao now believes that her husband's grievance has not been addressed and that her life is difficult. She will host a press conference in the coming days. It is said that Chen Hui, a specialist at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Education, was also arrested at the same time as Xiao.

### Social Services: Fourth Application Period Begins Immediately; Trachoma Prevention Campaign Launched Extensively

All Teachers, Staff, and Students of Universities and Schools in the City Receive Free Treatment

The "Trachoma Prevention Campaign" jointly organized by this newspaper and the Relief Hospital at 547 Xizang South Road, has been in operation since August 26th of last year. More than 400 people have applied for treatment in the three previous rounds, all of whom were teachers and students of primary and secondary schools. Except for a few who stopped treatment due to long distances or other reasons, the rest have been treated and cured according to the hospital's doctors. However, due to limited spaces, many people have been unable to participate. Now, in order to provide a wide range of free treatment opportunities to young people in school, this newspaper has obtained the consent of Dr. Wang Juerong, director of the hospital, to start the fourth registration period on February 1st. Students and teachers of universities and schools with signs of trachoma should first apply to the social services department of this newspaper for registration. They can then use the voucher to go to the hospital for examination and treatment. Clinic hours are from 2:00 to 5:00 PM daily. The clinic is closed on Sundays. We hope that young students and educators will actively apply and not miss this opportunity!

Acknowledgment of Gift: We recently received from Mr. Chen Shutong a copy of "Records of Communist's Atrocities and Vinlations of the Cease Fire Ordersince January 13, 1946." We hereby express our gratitude. Library of this newspaper.

Admirable Morality: To the Editor: I recently lost my wallet on a Route 1 tram, containing cash, keys, national identification card, and other items. It was picked up by Mr. Feng Chunqi of the Xieli Coal Company on Huangjiaque Road, Xiaoximen, who took the trouble to travel a long distance to return it to me. In this era of moral decay, people like Mr. Feng are rare. What is commendable is that Mr. Feng was motivated entirely by morality and refused to accept any reward, even the tram fare. Therefore, I earnestly request that you publish a few words in your newspaper to let people know that even in Shanghai, which is full of evil, there are still people like Mr. Feng who uphold traditional virtues. With best wishes, Zhang Qigu.

### Little Formal Trading Still Occurs in the Rice Market; Open-Air Transactions Continue; Prices of Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Rise Across the Board

[Special Dispatch] The supply of rice and grain is becoming increasingly scarce, and the market situation remains seemingly loose but actually tight. Only about 1,800 shi of goods arrived in the northern and southern markets combined. There is still little formal trading in the market. Open-air japonica rice prices continue to rise by 3,000-4,000 yuan, while indica rice and Baiyuan and Yinyuan varieties each rise by 2,000-3,000 yuan. The authorities are extremely concerned about this situation, and the Bureau of Social Affairs continues to sell 6,750 bags of allocated rice in the northern and southern markets. Rice merchants are absorbing it well. The bureau has decided to sell 20,000 shi of allocated rice in the northern and southern markets today to suppress the rising trend.

According to Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Food Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, the city is not lacking in rice reserves, as all grain warehouses are full, and some have even rented additional storage space. The recent price increase is likely due to the fact that farmers are busy with New Year celebrations, resulting in fewer sources of supply. In addition, stimulated by rising prices, prices in the producing areas are high, and many villagers are taking a wait-and-see attitude.

There are more than 2,000 rice shops in the city, and demand is also high. Since the opening of the port, the Bureau of Social Affairs has sold a total of 22,550 bags of Saigon rice, including 12,460 bags sold on January 27, 320 bags sold on the 28th, 160 bags sold on the 29th, 2,760 bags sold on the 30th, and 6,850 bags sold yesterday. If necessary, the Bureau of Social Affairs can continue to sell at any time. Chief Ji also told reporters that rice prices are expected to stabilize within the next week.

The Rice Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting yesterday, but no concrete decisions were made. The Rice Dealers Association also held a meeting yesterday, deciding to report the difficulties faced by retail merchants to the authorities and to request the mayor to sell part of the rice collected as agricultural tax in addition to selling Saigon rice in order to stabilize the market.

It is also rumored that a large amount of Siamese and Burmese foreign rice is flowing into China. The first batch of 8,500 tons shipped from Bangkok arrived in Shanghai during the Spring Festival, and the second batch is expected to arrive in the coming days. The authorities have ordered 100,000 tons of foreign rice from Siam and Burma and 140,000 tons of foreign rice from Vietnam and other rice-producing countries.

Sales in Shantou are slightly more active, with raw oil rebounding by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Clear oil and rapeseed oil have little fluctuation. Raw sesame oil also remains unchanged, but small-batch sesame oil also increases by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Soybean oil remains scarce. Soybean cake is moving in Xiamen and Quanzhou but is not strong, but prices of all commodities are rising, with a corresponding increase of 300-400 yuan. Soybean oil factories are aggressively buying soybeans, and the market is fiercely competitive, with prices skyrocketing by 3,000 yuan.

### Production of Flour Impossible Due to Excessively High Costs

[Special Dispatch] Five major flour mills in the city, Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, Maoxin, and Yutong, previously faced difficulties in supplying 12,000 bags of rationed flour per day due to a shortage of raw materials. After consultation, it was agreed to maintain the supply until the end of January. That date expired yesterday. Whether to continue rationing from February is still under consideration by the mills. However, it is understood that the raw material shortage at the mills persists. An executive of one flour mill told reporters that when the foreign exchange was adjusted last autumn, wheat was priced at 15,000 yuan per dan and flour at 13,000 yuan per bag. Currently, wheat in the producing areas has reached 56,600 yuan per dan, while flour is still only 25,000 yuan per bag. The cost is excessively high, making production impossible. Therefore, the five flour mills jointly submitted a petition to Mayor Wu, proposing three solutions: (1) Expedite the import of foreign wheat so that the flour mills can continue production. (2) To maintain the food supply for the people, request the government to quickly allocate foreign flour to supply the market so that the mills can gradually purchase wheat from the producing areas. The flour produced from the new wheat should be priced separately according to the new cost. (3) The prices of wheat and flour in the wheat-producing areas should be linked to those in Shanghai to facilitate the purchase of raw materials and continue production.

Another flour industry giant told reporters that although the current production situation of the major flour mills in the city is extremely difficult, it is estimated that the mills' ability to supply rationed flour will not be a problem in the short term. However, the fundamental solution lies in increasing the supply of raw materials.

### Cotton Fabric Market Turns Weak; Textile Construction Company Sells 30,000 Bolts

The market price of dark blue drill cloth has been rising steadily since the end of last year.

It is understood that yesterday the Textile Construction Company sold about 30,000 bolts of Longtou fine cloth to dyeing factories at a price of 112,000 yuan. The trading of Longtou fine cloth was gradually seen in the cotton fabric market yesterday, which made it difficult for other low-grade gray cloths to improve. The initial bid for Blue Chicken fine cloth was 100,9750 yuan, but it later retreated to 100,900 yuan. Five Fortunes was 111,000 yuan.

(2) It was found that most of this batch of foreign cotton was ordered at high prices, about 40 cents per pound, while the current market price is about 30 cents, whether or not to supply foreign exchange at this price needs to be decided by the Central Bank. (3) If each factory wants to order new goods, they should first purchase this batch of foreign cotton.

### Rayon - Allocation Vouchers Not Received, Holders Take Advantage to Raise Prices

Silk Fabric Merchants Languishing in the Doldrums

Yesterday, the price of rayon suddenly rose again in the market, mainly because silk weaving factories have gradually resumed production, but the 20th-period allocation vouchers have not yet been received and cannot be used.

It has decided to first send personnel to various weaving factories to conduct a thorough investigation and then make overall plans and allocate raw materials to each factory to avoid the woven products not meeting market needs. These investigators are being dispatched separately and will depart next week, with a deadline of one week to complete the investigation.

### Chinese Church Universities - Suffered Severe Losses During the War - Ten Schools Still Have No Formal School Buildings

[US News Agency, New York, 31st] According to recent reports from Chinese church universities, a total of 13 Chinese church universities need at least US$15 million to repair and improve their school buildings.

### Zhangjiakou Spring Festival: Continuous Nightly Auspicious Snow Foretells a Bountiful Year

— Our Newspaper Reporter Jie Zhong

Zhangyuan Air News, 21st

In the hearts of the people, the Gregorian New Year's Day is a "public" holiday, with national flags hung, spring couplets pasted, and meetings held for celebrations, but it is merely a formality for the "public." Only the Spring Festival is considered the true New Year, and one's age is counted from this day. The year's hard work is meant to be compensated and comforted during the New Year. Even families who normally cannot afford meat will eat "dumplings" on this day. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, even the old oxen and horses get a day of rest.

Spring Festival: Quiet and Silent

This year's Spring Festival in Zhangjiakou was spent in quiet silence. Not even the sound of firecrackers could be heard. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the sky was overcast with dense clouds, and snowflakes danced in the air, covering the earth in a silver coat. A few dim and sparse streetlights flickered on the streets. This scene, which was more elaborate and originally arranged for Christmas, appeared more natural and beautiful. However, with the curfew advanced to 6 PM, who was there to appreciate this wonderful scenery?

The Night Before: Guard Posts Everywhere

To raise vigilance and prevent accidents, the military authorities allowed their soldiers to celebrate the New Year as early as the 18th. The troops all ate a meal of "dumplings" for the New Year. On the eve of the Spring Festival, nearly all the soldiers were dispatched, with strict precautions taken, as if facing a formidable enemy. There were few pedestrians on the road, and guard posts were everywhere. Although people felt greatly inconvenienced, what choice did they have for their own safety?

Government Agencies: Four "No's" Campaign

Although government agencies did not explicitly declare a holiday, due to "human sentiment" and "custom," they could not help but have a "regular holiday" of one day to rest. To promote frugality, the relevant authorities initiated a four "no's" campaign: no gift-giving, no New Year's visits, no banquets, and no New Year's money. Leaders of various government agencies also led their subordinates in signing pledges to practice this campaign. It was stipulated that if anyone violated the four "no's," their name would be revealed in the newspaper. This provided ample excuse for many who "cared about face." Originally, it was truly unnecessary for the poor public school teachers, with soaring prices and meager salaries, to "pretend to be wealthy by slapping their faces until they swelled." The ethos and environment of frugality should always be cultivated.

Wounds: Difficult to Heal

The people of Chahar Province recall the past year as a nightmare. The atrocities of the Communist army have left irreparable wounds in the hearts of the people! Cargo transportation is obstructed, commerce is sluggish, industries are bankrupt, and thousands of people are unemployed. Traffic is cut off, and many people cannot return home. Children are abducted, and families cannot reunite. "Purges," "struggles," and harsh and tyrannical levies have pushed the people's lives to the brink of hunger and hardship. The massacre in Chongli and the bloodbath in Longguan—what force can erase these painful and terrifying memories?

New Year: New Hopes

The New Year has arrived, bringing new hopes. On the morning of the Spring Festival, the snow stopped, and the sun tore through the soft curtain, casting gentle sunlight upon the world. The people also showed smiles of hope, putting on their only new clothes—even if it was just a pair of new shoes and a belt. Women applied thick layers of makeup. Although the shops were tightly closed, the streets were bustling and did not seem deserted. Civil servants greeted each other with "Happy New Year!" Merchants still chanted the old tune of "May you prosper upon meeting!"

Auspicious Snow: Fell Continuously Overnight

These past few days, snow has always fallen overnight, perhaps a sign of an auspicious and bountiful year. In the past year, with continuous warfare, the people can no longer withstand natural disasters. Especially those living in the cracks between the Nationalist and Communist armies, the large-scale troop gatherings directly increase the burden on the people. Mutual blockades sever communication, with cities lacking fuel and food, and rural areas lacking cloth and daily necessities. Only today do the people more keenly experience the urgency of "freedom from want and freedom from fear." Everyone eagerly longs for stability and peace. The people can no longer endure the torment of war. The rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. When their very lives lose protection, one day they will clench their angry fists and turn against the Communist army, which loves war and harms the people.

Provincial Government: Chairman Inaugurated

Fu Zuoyi, the chairman of Chahar Province, and the commissioners and directors of various departments were sworn into office on January 15th. Following the Spring Festival, an administrative conference will be convened to discuss this year's policy directions, and how to turn the words on paper into action. Today's Chahar Province is like a declining family heading towards revival, with scenes of devastation everywhere, and hundreds of policies waiting to be implemented. Everything requires swiftness and efficiency. We urge the realization of a new Chahar!

May the misfortunes of the past forever vanish with the passing year! With spring arriving in the world, we hope to bring the gifts of stability and peace to the people, allowing their desolate hearts to receive the warmth of nourishment.

### Southern Country's Spring Rain

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Liang Feng

Guangzhou Air News, 25th

Perhaps because the Gregorian calendar has not been promoted for long, and the Lunar calendar, which has been used for thousands of years, has a long and deep history, the Gregorian New Year is never as lively as the Lunar New Year. In Guangzhou, the Gregorian calendar clearly passed very quietly, while the arrival of this Lunar New Year is so lively and intense!

Fine Rain Does Not Diminish the Merriment

Some say: The Gregorian New Year is celebrated by the "officials," while the Lunar New Year is celebrated by the "people." While this may not be entirely true, we cannot help but admit that only the Lunar New Year is a public holiday celebrated by all. Because during these few days, perhaps everyone from officials to commoners will temporarily put down their work and rest a bit! Therefore, with the arrival of the Lunar New Year, shops are closed, schools have already started their winter vacation, and although government agencies do not explicitly declare a holiday, there are at least a few days of "black market leave" for free activities. Even foreign-managed agencies like "UNRRA" and "consulates" are no exception. Therefore, although the heavens were rather disappointing during the Spring Festival days, with continuous drizzle, the streets were still lively. Firecrackers boomed all day long, and people squeezed through the muddy roads. Some of the more prosperous roads were even more packed. These bustling crowds all showed very cheerful expressions. Presumably, everyone had a common hope, which was "may this year be better than the last!"

Astonishing Consumption Amidst the Economic Downturn

During this joyful Spring Festival, what makes the people of Guangzhou most headache is the continuous spring rain, which ruined the plans of those refined individuals for spring outings in the suburbs. And various teahouses and restaurants have already "closed the furnace for the year" and will not reopen until the fourth or seventh day of the Lunar New Year. This has resulted in most of the more than 1.2 million citizens only being able to seek recreation at entertainment venues. Therefore, in these past few days, the city's theaters and dance halls have been truly lively. In total, there are fourteen cinemas in the city, showing five performances day and night, and six Cantonese opera theaters, with two performances day and night. Almost every performance is packed with people, and buying tickets is actually more difficult than receiving relief rice. Then there are the dance halls! During these few days, regardless of whether people can dance or not, they all like to go to the dance halls to join in the fun. Even young women from the countryside are taking this New Year's opportunity to have a good time, and the dance floors are so crowded that one cannot even turn around. Although there are more than thirty dance halls of various sizes, every one of them is equally crowded. The theater and dance hall owners are naturally beaming with joy, and the "waist-bending ladies" are naturally "reaping a great harvest"! Someone has estimated that the entertainment consumption within three days, just for the cinemas, has reached more than 300 million yuan, and the direct and indirect consumption of the more than thirty dance halls is certainly more than this figure. In this economic downturn where all industries are depressed, this huge consumption figure is truly astonishing!

Streetcars Transformed, A New Atmosphere

The streets of Guangzhou have indeed added a lot of new atmosphere with the arrival of the New Year. The most significant change is the public buses, which have been transformed. At the time of the restoration, in order to maintain urban traffic, cargo trucks were used to convert public buses, which was a makeshift solution. These cars were truly unsightly, and after more than a year, most of the cars were badly damaged. Recently, the municipal authorities seem to have made some improvements. Around the Spring Festival, a large number of new-model public buses have been running on the streets, and the routes have also been reorganized starting from Lunar New Year's Eve, so that almost every road has a public bus passing through it, unlike before when they were concentrated in some prosperous areas. This is naturally very reasonable, and the citizens are all praising the convenience. However, there are still some shortcomings, namely that the roads are still as bumpy and uneven as before, and have not been repaired. Even though good cars have been replaced, they are still truly deadly. Especially in these past few days, with the spring rain falling, the roads are full of mud, and mud splashes everywhere the cars pass. Also, these days, the street cleaners are resting for the New Year, resulting in piles of garbage on the roads that no one is cleaning up, and the stench is suffocating. This is truly a blight on the scenery!

All Sectors Promote a Grand Movement

This Spring Festival, all sectors of Guangzhou are actively promoting a grand movement, which is to request that Guangzhou be changed to a special municipality. This matter is closely related to the more than 1.2 million citizens, so this movement is giving everyone great excitement. Originally, Guangzhou meets all the conditions to be changed to a special municipality, but the reason for the long delay is that it is the location of the provincial capital. If Guangzhou is changed to a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan, then the provincial government would have to move, and Guangdong does not have a town equivalent to Zhenjiang in Jiangsu or Chengdu in Sichuan that can serve as a provincial capital, so this problem has been delayed. However, this has greatly hindered Guangzhou's recovery and construction, because Guangzhou is a provincial-level city, and construction funds are extremely stretched. Currently, the city government is unable to undertake tasks such as the reconstruction of school buildings, the repair of roads, the establishment of social relief, local cleaning, and police reorganization, forcing it to levy donations from citizens, which increases the burden on citizens. Therefore, the City Council and dozens of civil organizations have launched this movement to request "change to a special municipality," and jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the first day of the Lunar New Year to make the request, with the following reasons: (1) Guangzhou is the birthplace of the revolution, and the Founding Father had planned it in detail as a special municipality; (2) The population exceeds one million, possessing all the conditions of a special municipality; (3) Geographically, it has been a major town in the South, with direct international transportation and trade, and at the same time, its politics and economy have special circumstances; (4) Cannot due to being the provincial site, and [prevent] other [developments].

As for the provincial government's view on this issue, there has been no expression; the reporter interviewed Civil Affairs Director Li Yangjing, who only answered "everything is handled in accordance with central government laws and regulations." And most recently have gotten news that the City Council's report has already been sent to Chairman Chiang for approval, and may be decided at the same time as the three cities of Shenyang, Changchun, and Hankou. Presumably the order will be issued soon, and it will soon be known whether Guangzhou's "change to special" can be realized.

Rain Presents Good Omen, Prices are Rising

According to the Lunar calendar, this year is the year of Dinghai, the year of the Pig. In theory, after this year, all prices will continue to rise. The price of rice has also risen to 80,000 yuan per dan; gold and foreign currency are still soaring. In the three days of the New Year, gold rose to 48,000 to 49,000, and the Hong Kong dollar rose from 1,400 to 1,490. So looking ahead to all prices this year, I am afraid there will only be increases and no decreases, and the degree of difficulty in living this year will not be less than last year! However, there is one thing to be happy about, which is that this year's Spring Festival had ample rainfall. According to the farmers, this is a sign of a bountiful year.

### New Year's Day Tragedy: "Public Display" in Taiyuan

— Li Bi

Santuo Taiyuan Air News

Strive to bid farewell to the old year, revive and welcome the new year. New Year's Day, in Shanxi, is said to be the day the revival work begins. In the country, it is said to be the time to promulgate the constitution. Therefore, with a happy mood, the reporter browsed the narrow streets for a week. Although the north wind was blowing, I did not feel cold. This may be because I was too excited. Colorful wall newspapers and red and green slogans were everywhere. Beautiful national flags fluttered in front of every household. On the glass windows of shops, one could see red paper strips that read: "Celebrating New Year's Day, prices reduced for three days." At the entrances of theaters, posters were also put up that read: "Celebrating the promulgation of the Constitution, half-price tickets for three days." Amidst this celebration, tragedies occurred one after another. What is strange is that one scene happened each day, and they were well coordinated. The first scene was the beheading for public display, the second scene was a car accident, and the third scene was a rape and murder case. Among them, the most sensational was the first case. The details of the situation are reported below:

Head Severed from Body, Fresh Blood Flowing

At about 10 PM on New Year's Day, when the reporter was returning home from the cinema, when I reached the most lively place in Taiyuan—the south entrance of Liuxiang, I suddenly saw several armed sentries standing there. Moreover, they were strictly prohibiting passage. In fact, a huge crowd had gathered, and it was impossible to walk past. I only heard people say: "This person is really unlucky. Instead of having a good New Year, he had to go to a brothel. As a result, his head was moved." The reporter was very surprised to hear this. Does visiting a brothel warrant the death penalty? I finally took advantage of the sentries blocking others to quickly sneak into the crowd, and it took a lot of effort to finally break through the encirclement. What I saw at a glance was: a headless corpse lying on the ground. When I looked up, oh my, on the electric pole at the entrance of the Hengdeli Watch and Eyeglasses Store, there was someone hanging a human head. The blood under the head was still dripping intermittently. The face was not very clear, and the age was no more than twenty. Looking closely at the corpse, it seemed to be lying in the shape of a large character in the heart of the street. It was wearing a new gray cotton military uniform, and a pair of Japanese-style leather velvet boots. Judging from the situation, the neck must have been cut more than seven or eight times. The skin was retracted outward. Those who saw it had tragic faces. After the reporter looked around, I did not see anyone with a smile on their face. Some women lowered their heads and wiped their tears with handkerchiefs. In this gloomy atmosphere, although there were many people, it was very quiet, and no one spoke loudly. If they did, they were all talking in extremely low voices. No one knew why someone was killed on this day. Someone whispered, "It's terrible. He said as he was dying, 'Am I being killed just for taking a look'?"

Disturbing the Peace, Executed on the Spot

When I got up early the next morning, I went to Liuxiang again to inquire about what had happened. I only saw many more people than the night before. Half of the alley was full of people, and it seemed that it would be impossible to squeeze in again. Later, I heard a friend say, "There's a notice posted at Hai Shibi." The reporter hurriedly ran to the place where the notice was posted at Hai Shibi. Indeed, there was a circle of people. Fortunately, the notice was not posted too low. I only saw the following written on it:

"For the purpose of this notice: It is known that citizens of civilized countries abide by order, and armies of civilized countries strictly observe discipline. On the night of New Year's Day, Zhang Wenzheng and Liao Senhuai, two members of the Auxiliary Heavy Brigade, took the opportunity to disrupt order and disturb the peace while the masses were enjoying themselves. They were apprehended by military police and executed on the spot to serve as a warning. Hereafter, any similar illegal acts will be punished with death. This notice is hereby given for all to know. Listing Zhang Wenzheng, a native of Dingxiang, 25 years old, sergeant of the Transport Brigade, Liao Senhuai, a native of Guoxian, 22 years old, Second Lieutenant Special Service Chief of the Third Battalion of the Transport Brigade."

Head Hanging at the Alley Entrance, Corpse Displayed by the Wall

The reporter realized at this time that the deceased had committed the crime of disrupting order and disturbing the peace, and truly deserved to be killed. Killing one can serve as a warning to a hundred. But where was the other person killed? Someone said in Sidao Alley, so I ran to Sidao Alley. There I saw the head hanging on the gate at the entrance of Toudao Alley, and the corpse displayed by the wall. It was also wearing a new gray cotton military uniform. Most of the back of the head was gone, with small pieces of flesh hanging down. There was a pool of blood on the ground. The reporter could not bear to look at it any longer. By the time I returned, it was almost 12 o'clock. I don't know why no one collected the body.

Commander Sun Talks About How It Was Handled

Here, the reporter will write down the process Commander Sun (former Garrison Commander Sun Fulin) talked about the process to the reporters of Bing City: "Yesterday was New Year's Day, and various agencies issued orders for a three-day holiday. There were many tourists on the streets, especially in entertainment venues. At about 8 PM yesterday, in Sitong Alley in the old city, there were about 40 soldiers in gray uniforms who had a conflict with other troops in a brothel. The order was suddenly disrupted, and the situation was serious. Military police rushed to the scene upon hearing the news to try and resolve it. Not only did they refuse to obey the ban, but they were even more unruly. Later, the Security Command learned of the incident and immediately sent officers and soldiers to arrest them. Most of them heard the news and fled. Zhang Wenzheng, a sergeant of the Ganzhong Brigade, and Liao Senhuai, a Special Service Chief of the Third Battalion, were arrested at the scene, and were escorted to the headquarters. After interrogation, they confessed to gathering to disrupt the peace without hesitation. They were sentenced to death according to the law. After submitting the report for approval, they were beheaded on the spot to serve as a warning. At that time, at 9:30 PM, the criminals were separately escorted to the south entrance of Liuxiang and the entrance of Sidao Alley for execution."

Here are a few words from the × newspaper, which show the situation at the time of the incident: A businessman said in a low voice, "Yesterday at around 9 o'clock, two people chased and killed this person. His head had already been cut off, but his body still ran a few steps before falling down." Everyone who heard it was amazed.

Zhimen's Fire Endangers the Fish in the Pond

This news was published in various newspapers on the 3rd (the 2nd was a day off). Because a certain newspaper carried the words "more than 40 people from a Transport Brigade," the Transport Brigade believed that it did not conform to the facts, so it sent a letter to correct it, saying: After hearing about the incident, this brigade sent Deputy Officer Zhou De to Sidao Alley to investigate the truth the next morning at 9 AM. According to the report, after asking the local street office and merchants, as well as the boss of Baohua Hall and the girls, they all claimed that both sides in the fight each had 30 to 40 people, but they were all wearing yellow military uniforms. This brigade was wearing gray cotton military uniforms. Since they were "the fish in the pond endangered by the fire at Zhimen," and it was said that more than 40 soldiers of this brigade fought with a certain unit, it did not conform to the facts.

### Is There No Winter in Kunming?

— Special Correspondent Xu Jilian

Kunming, 14th [of the month] Airmail

People all say that Kunming has no winter, but in reality, it doesn't even have summer, does it? Therefore, you won't sweat like crazy, with the sun blazing overhead, but at the same time, you don't need to light a stove or wear a thick fox fur robe. In this mountain city, the weather is truly wonderful. The summer can definitely be considered a summer resort, and the winter is even more a paradise for people who are afraid of the cold and have no warm clothing!

At this time of year in Jiangnan, people are probably shivering and pulling in their necks, lighting fires and putting on fur coats. However, in Kunming, people never even think of the cold or thin clothing. It's truly hard to believe. Here, except for a bit of chilliness in the early morning and late evening, during the day, a healthy person can wear a lined garment and not feel cold. The sun rises early in the morning, and it is still so warm and pleasant, never tiring, never showing favoritism. It shines gently on the mountain city forever!

Climate Naturally Blessed, Business Facing Harsh Winter

Although the climate is naturally blessed, without cold or heat, in the man-made world, everything is indeed facing a harsh winter. Moreover, the warm climate cannot melt the bitterness in people's hearts. The most prominent examples of this are the groups hustling and bustling in the business world.

Kunming was once known as a paradise for adventurers, a fertile land owned by gold diggers. However, good times don't last forever. Now, this paradise is also tasting the bitter fruit. A foundation of sand cannot support tall buildings of steel and cement. In the past, some speculators adorned a fancy facade, putting all their efforts into appearances. As time went on, the paint on the facade peeled off, and the true face of Mount Lu was finally revealed. Thus, the true form emerged. It not only made the people in the collapsing building unable to rise, but even the onlookers outside gasped, thinking: So this is what an ugly appearance looks like!

High-Interest Loans in Recession, Daily Credit Failing Daily

High-interest loans were the first to encounter bad luck. In Kunming, the potential power of "daily credit" is the greatest. It controls the life and death of ordinary people. Its prevalence and depth are unmatched by any credit loan. Therefore, "daily credit" has become the biggest headache for commercial banks, because "daily credit" is the most convenient for ordinary people, the procedures are simple, and they don't have to endure the ugly faces of the small clerks in the bank. Payment is easy, so credit associations have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, reaching more than a hundred in just a few months. The target of deposit absorption is naturally mostly ordinary people. The municipal authorities, thinking that a crisis was imminent, stipulated many management methods. But even while they were still in the registration period, the "credit heads" of the credit associations could no longer support themselves, and they absconded with the money. As a result, this caused fear among the ordinary people, who successively withdrew their credit, which was not accepted. The credit heads were fundamentally short of funds. The reason they were able to maintain appearances at the beginning was entirely dependent on the 24% high-interest loans, borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, preventing collapse. But now that the collapse has begun, the overall collapse has started. This collapse after collapse has plunged the Kunming economy into a deep crisis!

Zhengyi Road to Be Renovated, Near Day Tower Feels Lonely

Regardless of how bad the market situation is, the work of beautifying the city must always be addressed. The stately Three Archways of Zhengyi Road, regardless of the opposition from elders and people who believe in Feng Shui, was finally demolished. Recently, the wall posters and slogans of the debate at the Near Day Tower have all been swept away, and the surrounding walls have been freshly painted. The past chaotic scene, with one thing here and another there, under an order to "rectify the city appearance," has become "clear after the rain." The Near Day Tower in winter also feels a bit lonely.

The road administration of the mountain city is quite bad. Except for one flat Taihe Street, the others are all rugged and uneven, and pedestrians suffer from the discomfort of bumps. Therefore, the authorities have listed the major renovation of Zhengyi Road as one of the central tasks of this year's municipal administration. Work has already begun, and the renovation period should not be far away. It should be said that Zhengyi Road really should be rebuilt, because even the "car-owning class" is always worried about "overturning," let alone some "street runners"?

Serious Layoff Problem, Seventy-Year-Old Man Commits Suicide

Speaking of layoffs, Dianyuan has done it quite thoroughly this time. From the provincial government to various departments and agencies, they have all "reorganized" in a swift and decisive manner. The number of people laid off accounts for about one-third of the total. Some were reassigned, and some were simply laid off. Naturally, there were many tragedies in between. The laid-off people are facing endless worries. Facing the New Year, it is also the Old Year. The whole family is drinking the northwest wind. Only those who have personally experienced it can understand this feeling. For example, recently, a technician from the Yunnan Survey Bureau joined the bureau in the third year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty. In terms of time, it cannot be considered short, and the performance of the service is also very good, but he was finally dismissed. All alone, without a wife or children, he was already seventy years old. Thinking that he would be almost done after another two years, but his stomach did not agree, he finally swallowed four cents of high-quality Yunnan soil and died. Even the funeral arrangements were taken care of by his former colleagues. This tragic fact is an episode in the winter of the mountain city!

Kunming's warm winter is coming to an end again, but the cruel reality is pressing down on people. When spring comes to the earth, people only greet that series of days with a bitter smile!

Correction: According to the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the Bangkok Airmail "Overseas Chinese in Siam" published in this newspaper on December 2, 1946, it was mentioned that officials extorted and were corrupt, and the bribery in the case of Taiwanese overseas Chinese amounted to more than one million Qian coins, and that Ambassador Li was busy with social banquets and did not negotiate and handle pending cases, etc. After investigation, there is no factual basis. According to a letter from the Siam Chinese Chamber of Commerce: The communication said that the overseas Chinese leaders started newspapers at their own expense due to attacks from overseas Chinese and criticism in the media, all of which are untrue. Accordingly, we hereby urgently correct this.

### The Legend of a "Volunteer Soldier"

— Wang Ji

Clang clang clang…

The whistle of the steamer tears through the tranquility of this small town every day without fail. Men, women, old and young, rush out from the kitchen, the toilet, or the sheepfold to see this rarely seen "fire wheel ship."

From this county to that county, the small town is fortunate enough to become such a thoroughfare, allowing this group of almost primitive people to broaden their horizons; or, there are also a few "upper-class people" who benefit from its light. As time goes on, the sailboats can no longer withstand this "fire wheel ship." The boatmen begin to feel jealous, asking:

"Whose ship is this that's stirring up the entire narrow waterway?"

The primitive people are starting to dislike this "useless" "monster."

Whose ship is it? One day, it finally spread in the teahouses and restaurants…

Less than five miles from the town, Hupu Creek has a famous lazy person. His father was an opium addict who originally had some "property." The guerrillas treated him as a "god of wealth." When they couldn't squeeze any money out of him, they gave him a "violation of national law" and executed him. His son, Hu Shengxiang, saw his father smoke away his family fortune into an opium pipe and lose his life. With nowhere to turn, he also joined the guerrillas, becoming a "godson." As a result, he inevitably learned that "vocal style": tending cattle, cutting rice ears, and even working as a cook for the Japanese. After a "bitter victory," Hu Shengxiang did not "win" away that style. Instead, it intensified. The small town often suffered his "infringement." He called himself a "hero," but the residents of the small town gave him an unrefined title: little gangster.

Conscription came.

The sound of conscription stirred up the small town even more intensely than the collection of grain. One man from every other household; secret drawing of lots… The people who ran the fried dough stick shops stopped cooking. The tofu makers ran away early in the dark. Young people were rarely seen in the shops. The vitality of the small town was extinguished day by day.

The town office, the district office, and the household registration clerks were correcting the household registers… To apply for an exemption, they handed over all sorts of certificates. When they walked, their chests were puffed out, and all sorts of badges on their clothes shone brightly. Most of those who couldn't get away and couldn't get all sorts of certificates seemed like flies that had died today, struggling towards hope, struggling: requesting a joint guarantee from five households, saying they were the only son, but there was an older brother who had been living separately for several years. Afraid of being reported, who would dare to provide this guarantee? Saying they had to support the family? The head of the district said, isn't your stall worth hundreds of thousands?

As the day for drawing lots approached, the draftees were like prisoners awaiting execution. "If I'm chosen, I'll prepare to escape. Who wants to fight in the civil war? Bah, that's just nonsense."

The words of the conscription supervisor added to the draftees' infinite hatred. What to do?

One evening, less than a week before the "secret drawing," the county suddenly issued an official notice, saying that the government wanted to recruit volunteer soldiers. A notice was also posted, saying "permission to offset the conscription quota," and saying "spiritual and material assistance can be given."

[Material, oh, material!]

This door was finally opened with great difficulty.

After several "town representative meetings" were held, the town office separately issued "secret" notices to each district head: two people must be recruited from each district. Each eligible draftee must pay three dou of white rice.

Volunteer soldiers! Volunteer soldiers! After the separate "mobilization," District Head Feng settled on Hu Shengxiang.

"Serving in the military is the most honorable thing. The government also provides rewards and assistance to volunteer soldiers…" District Head Feng also learned a bit of official jargon, because, in theory, the district head could be granted a deferment.

"How much money? Just one sentence. If you keep babbling, you're a bastard!" Hu Shengxiang said bluntly.

"Fifteen shi of rice. Neighboring counties are only ten shi."

Hu Shengxiang pursed his lips and walked away unwillingly.

Two days passed, and District Head Feng was still frowning. He contacted Hu Shengxiang several times and promised him 800,000 national currency.

The "volunteer soldier" dispelled the sense of misery in the small town. The "secret drawing" was postponed. The small town sent out twelve people as scheduled. Firecrackers and paper flags were distributed by the town office, making the "mobilization" lively for a while. Hu Shengxiang touched his full bag. He seemed to have an idea and laughed along with a firecracker.

He entered the city. Hu Shengxiang was assigned to the new recruit concentration camp. Camp Commander Gao Deli used his eyes to search the new recruits for two consecutive days. On the third day, Hu Shengxiang couldn't stand it anymore. He ran over and patted him on the shoulder:

"Camp Commander seems to have led guerrillas here three years ago." Hu Shengxiang flattered, without waiting for Gao Deli to respond, he continued: "It's just that I wasn't under Camp Commander's command at that time." "Oh, you?"

"Hu Shengxiang, reporting to Camp Commander." He said expertly: "I'm here to be a volunteer soldier, Camp Commander, I…please have a cigarette, don't laugh at me."

A stack of paper, Camp Commander Gao Deli saw very clearly. At first, he pretended to be very unnatural, and then he relaxed into a shallow smile.

"He's an old soldier after all." Hu Shengxiang said further: "It's just a little something. Oh, Camp Commander, it will take a few more days to start training, right? When I'm idle, I always have to, always have to, use my brain…

Hu Shengxiang's words became lighter and lighter. Finally, he brought his mouth close to Camp Commander Gao Deli's smiling face.

The next day, there was gambling in the concentration camp, led by Hu Shengxiang…

Before the physical examination and official enrollment, Hu Shengxiang was fortunate enough to win nearly 20 million. He began to hesitate about this huge sum of money. He had such a hypothesis early on, and now it came. "Why did I come to be a soldier?" He asked himself a question, touched the bag in his pocket, and smiled.

"A 14% interest…being a soldier, that's for ghosts!"

He grinded his teeth and made up his mind.

On the fourth day, the medical officer came to re-examine the physical condition. Hu Shengxiang lay in the rice pile with a stomachache, calling for his mother. Camp Commander Gao Deli said a few words to the medical officer. The medical officer took the stethoscope to examine him and nodded and walked away. ——On the day the new recruits began training, Hu Shengxiang was "eliminated" with full satisfaction.

Hu Shengxiang walked down the street a little tipsy. He seemed to have had a big dream. He almost exchanged his life for this awakening. When he woke up, he thought about the large sum of money, the money exchanged for danger… He decided to use it to wash away the dirt of his life… Dududu

From this county to that county, the whistle of the steamer tears through the tranquility of this small town every day without fail. Men, women, old and young, go from surprise to disgust. Now, the residents of the small town often follow behind the steam whistle with an envious tone:

"Look, Hu Shengxiang is rich, the boss of the fire wheel ship!" (Late at night, December 25, 1946, Hangzhou)

### Dream Outside the Tower Poetry

— Xu Chengyu

I occasionally climbed to the upper platform to lean on the setting sun, the endless mist and willows were shimmering, the dragon coiled power was exhausted, and the cold mountain remained, the name of the ox head remained, and the old ruins were desolate. Lonely crickets on the side of the boat missed the Later Lord, and the bright mirror in the middle laughed at the Former Liang; Who knew the days of talent and unrestrainedness, and saw the public go down to Wuchang.

The Double Ninth Festival in the Year of Bingxu

Tired and still climbing the highest chess, who knew the outside of the tower was full of desolate hills; the dream of the crowned locust palace connecting with the clouds, relying on the worries of mulberry and hemp in Luli by the water; Hungry ants touching their whiskers and soaring into war, sad crickets shaking their wings and abandoning themselves to rest; How could I bear to unfold the Qingqiu Festival, and stand alone in the cold sky for a moment.

### Notre Dame de Paris (Steel Pen Drawing)

### West Lake - Random Memories from a Window

— Ye Dingluo

"If you want to compare West Lake to Xizi, it is always suitable with light or heavy makeup." This is why West Lake is West Lake. But West Lake, it is better to treat it as a small park. If you want to get some lofty and great emotions here, you will be disappointed. West Lake is like a beauty, not a hero. I went to West Lake twice. The first time was at eight or nine in the morning in the spring. I took a boat on the shore of the lake and saw the green hills and weeping willows. I was indeed drunk and infatuated. The water of West Lake is clear and shallow. Sitting on the boat and looking at the scenery in a circle is like leaving the world. On the boat, you can see the fish, shrimp, duckweed, and algae in the water. The ripples of sunlight shine on the bottom of the lake, like the patterns of wrinkled gauze. The mud at the bottom of the lake is commonly known as "incense ash mud," which means that the mud is fine and loose. If a person falls in, they will indeed sink deeper and deeper until they are submerged, so you must not think that the lake water is shallow and you will not drown. The boat floats on the lake, the water is pushed open by the bow of the boat, forming two water patterns like arrowheads dragging behind. Another wave pattern is created by the boatman's oar. There are many small boats, and there are also many of these wave patterns, crisscrossing and winding on the lake like snakes, which is a pleasing sight. The reflections of the surrounding mountains hang in the heart of the lake, which is also a moving picture, like things placed on glass. There is no difference between the real and the fake, and it is the same to look at it upside down. If people lie flat on the ground to see these up-and-down scenery patterns, they will suspect that they have walked into the glass. In the evening, looking at the side of the panoramic view of West Lake on the shore of Hangzhou also has a special taste. The setting sun dyes the sky behind the mountains red, and reflects the water in the lake red. There is a green belt on top of this, which is the ripple of the water. Cooking smoke floats up from behind the ball-like clusters of trees, and the bells of countless temples ring.

Drinking Shaoxing wine in a thatched cottage under the willow shade in the drizzling rain, or fishing by the water, has a very hermit-like childlike taste. Going to the temple to chat with the monks will make you envy the monks enjoying all the blessings. Strolling with a girlfriend on the Su Causeway and the Bai Causeway will remind you of the stories of talented scholars and beautiful ladies. Watching the farmers walking in the rainy field in their straw raincoats, you will feel the elegance of the "Southern School Painting." Going to the monk's temple to eat bamboo shoots and large mustard greens, the fresh wild taste makes you want to be a monk. Going to Xinghua Village to eat drunken shrimp and perch fish, you want to write some crooked poems. As for going to Lingyin Temple, Yue Wang Tomb, Su Xiao Tomb, Gushan, Qiu Jin, Xu Xilin, and Wu Song's tomb, you will think of many people of different natures who have all passed away. But West Lake was later destroyed by modern civilization. The second time I went to West Lake, I saw that Western-style houses had been built on the mountains, and cars were running on the lake embankment, and speedboats were running on the lake. This is imitating the West, but the trees, flowers, plants, and villages of West Lake are genuine Chinese postures, so West Lake does not look as beautiful as before. Xizi has become a fashionable woman, and the most regrettable thing is that the Leifeng Pagoda on Nanping Mountain has collapsed, which has reduced the beauty of West Lake a lot. If it weren't for the Leifeng Pagoda being illuminated by the setting sun, how beautiful it would be to stand red on the mountain?

### Northern Wind and Sand - Random Memories from a Window

— Previous Person

Why is the wind and sand in northern China so severe, but a few hundred miles across the Yellow River, there is no wind and sand? Is it that the wind from the Mongolian desert stops here? The soil is also extremely strange. A few hundred miles across the Yangtze River, the soil is sandy. The wind and sand outside the Great Wall, needless to say. There is also a saying in Beijing: "Three feet of dust without wind, a street of mud with rain." Dust should be brushed on people's bodies all year round. Therefore, the "duster" tool is available in every household in the north. If southerners are the same, using a chicken feather duster is not enough. When people arrive in Tianjin and Beijing and get off the train, someone will take a "duster" to wave your clothes and pat them a few times, scaring you, and then asking you for money. This is a method of begging. It is more practical than a beggar who only says auspicious words. This also shows that the sand and dust in the north must be removed from time to time. In fact, when people come back from the street, their faces and bodies are covered with sand and dust. And the most terrible place for sand and dust is Kaifeng. Every spring, it is the time when the "yellow wind" blows. The wind rolls up the sand, covering the sky and filling the streets. The sun is dark, and people struggle in the sand and dust. In these days, when people wake up in the morning, they will see that they have been buried in the sand quilt, on the quilt, on the table, covered with a thick layer of sand and dust. It is impossible to remove the sand and dust in the food. Sand is air, and air is sand. Air penetrates everywhere. What can you do?

This sand is the silt sand in the Yellow River. It is dried by the sun and blown by the wind, constantly blowing towards the city. The sand blows to the ground and is blocked by the city walls. The sand accumulates outside the city. The sand dunes outside Kaifeng are as high as the city walls. People don't have to walk through the city gates to leave the city. If someone attacks Kaifeng, it is a place that will be broken without attacking. In fact, Kaifeng has no value in many things because it cannot be defended. If there are problems in Xuzhou and Zhengzhou, everything in Kaifeng has long been resolved. Therefore, apart from wind and sand, Kaifeng is not a place that is often killed.

New Fable

### Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth

— Suo Bei

Time: First month of the Dinghai year

Location: Wuding Road

Characters: Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth

Overture—In the Dinghai year, gold is prosperous and fire is strong. In the midst of loud gongs and drums, gold is soaring, and people are thinking about "gold." Water is also unwilling to lag behind. The sky is gloomy and rainy, a dark and chaotic scene. "Wood" is eager to move, taken advantage of by "Fire." Suddenly, white smoke emerges from the "wood" house, making it difficult for a piece of "clean" earth, inch of gold land.

When the curtain rises, there is a noisy crowd, fire and smoke slowly rise, drizzle falls, adding fuel to the "Fire."

The Earth and Wood clans are scorched all over, and they are busy making a phone call to Big Brother Water: "Hey, this is terrible! Brother Fire intends to get rid of us, please do a good deed and come to the rescue! At this moment, you are our only savior!"

Don't "Tease Me"

Water lazily picked up the phone: "Hey, don't "tease me", okay? It's the first day of the New Year!"

Earth: "No matter what, please help! I know everything in my heart!"

Water: "What know, empty words, not good business! First day of the New Year, don't be so long-winded!"

Wood: "Hey: Nothing is more urgent than putting out a fire! Can we talk about everything later? This is terrible, terrible, sparks are flying everywhere, it's tragic! Help!"

Water: "Don't be so loud and exaggerating! If the old is not destroyed, the new will not come. . . . First day of the New Year, brother is busy!"

In the midst of the sound of putting out the fire, phone calls asking Big Brother Water for help came one after another. He, intentionally or unintentionally, picked up two phones with both hands:

"What, where is it? When did the fire start? Why did the fire start? What is the last name, what is the first name, what is the street number?" . . . He blinked his eyes to the Water brothers, and all the clever plans were unspoken.

The flames flew high, and the red light shone everywhere; "Fire" laughed, and "Water" also laughed, a burst of laughter.

New Year's Wealth

With an awe-inspiring demeanor, the sound shook the ground, and the Water brothers finally arrived in military uniform. The leader busily congratulated the Fire God on the New Year's wealth, and then said: "It's okay! It's okay!"

Not Too Early, Not Too Late

After a brief exchange of greetings, Fire said: "Brother, you came not too early, not too late, it's really just right! Don't worry, I'm opening up a fire road for you, there's no need to tear down this foreign house, the neighbor is hiding Big Brother "Gold", please ask him to say a word, and then everything will be done!"

"That's right! That's right! First day of the New Year, do you want us to grow up drinking the northwest wind?"

Gold: (Calm and proud) - "Okay, Lord Gold Eight is here, brothers, please handle it!"

A thousand calls and ten thousand summons are not as good as one word from "Gold Eight." Water finally came out of the belt, walking slowly. The flames and water flowers contrasted each other, the water sprayed into the sky, and the fire flew left and right; then, the fire rushed to the right, and the water ran to the left, pouring, pouring, pouring until the boxes were overturned and the treasures grew wings, and everything was done. Only the gold objects and soft things were saved.

Burning, burning, burning for thirteen hours, pouring, pouring, pouring to a full load! Saving, saving, saving a scorched earth!

### Our Concerns about the Municipal Symphony Orchestra!

— You Ting

We oppose disbandment!

We haven't heard from the Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra for a long time.

Before the Lunar New Year, the orchestra was brewing over the issue of "New Year's salaries," followed by rumors of "disbandment," "private takeover," and so on. At the same time, the routine performances at the Lyceum also came to a halt. We, who cherish the future of Shanghai's music, are very distressed!

Just considering the music books and scores owned by the orchestra (some of which are out of print), this only complete symphony orchestra in China, with a history of over sixty years, should not be allowed to fall into its current state. It is shameful that this artistic asset was originally the achievement of foreigners; we took it back, but we cannot use it well. In the Mei Baiqi era, everything was well-organized, and they performed regularly. Although some people criticized the foreign musicians for being too well-paid, when Mei Baiqi served as conductor and director, the stability of the musicians' lives, their improving skills, and their high standards contributed significantly to our musical culture, which cannot be denied.

Don't Waste the Opportunity

Most of the musicians are old, and their experience is valuable, but life is short. Most of the musicians are about to reach retirement age. Therefore, now that we have taken back the orchestra to be managed by us, the first priority is to use this valuable foundation to continuously add new Chinese performers, gradually creating a Chinese symphony orchestra in Shanghai. In the past, during the Concession era, it was regrettable that this artistic asset was funded by Chinese people but controlled by foreigners. Now that it has been taken back, we should not waste this good opportunity culturally, and we should not "lose face" internationally! (If we cannot manage it well after being free from foreign management.)

Of course, everything is for the sake of funding! In the past, the municipal government only subsidized 20 million yuan per month, and the revenue from performances was deposited into the municipal treasury, which cannot be said to be not worth it! Now, in order to improve the musicians' salaries, the municipal government needs to subsidize 50 million yuan per month in the budget. I think it is still worthwhile! As long as there is no mismanagement and the accounts are clear, the government should take a longer-term view of this cultural investment!

Most of these musicians can teach and take in students, and do not necessarily have to rely on the orchestra as their only profession. Therefore, their salaries cannot be too low; if they are too low, they may disperse completely. Moreover, music requires concentration when life is too unstable. In the Mei Baiqi era, they rehearsed five times a week. After we took over, it was only two or three times, and now it's unnecessary to mention it. In all fairness, they are suffering too much. Their monthly salary is only about 300,000 yuan. Except for top-tier figures such as Magolinsky (the current conductor) and Adler (the principal violin), whose income is quite good because they teach more classes and are busy accompanying private concerts, most of the musicians are still diligently practicing all day long and do not take on other jobs, but the authorities cannot give them a more stable life.

Fear and Anxiety

The only good phenomenon after we took over is that the number of Chinese performers has increased, and the number of Chinese audiences has also increased. But how long ago was it that there was talk of disbanding the symphony orchestra? This news is truly frightening and anxiety-inducing for us who are hungry for music and art!

In today's situation where the municipal treasury is empty and the finances are stretched, we dare not make a big deal out of the symphony orchestra. However, due to a genuine desire to cherish art and talent, we have reason to request the government: give us the rights that people in civilized countries should have - legitimate music!

### Beware of the Old Japanese Trick!

— Hua Min

Seeing in the newspaper that our country's exports to Japan will still be dominated by salt made me feel extremely terrified. According to reports, our country exported 300,000 tons of salt to Japan last year, and the Japanese will use it to manufacture alkali in addition to consumption.

We know that salt is a compound of nitrogen and sodium. Electrolyzing it can yield nitrogen and metallic sodium, and alkali is just a byproduct of the electrolysis process. Sodium is a very expensive metal, and nitrogen can be made into that terrifying killing weapon, the nitrogen gas bomb. We shouldn't be so forgetful, right? The enemy used it to slaughter our loyal soldiers and innocent people. Mentioning it makes everyone shudder. Although it has been banned internationally, chlorine is still very useful in industry. It has the function of sterilization and disinfection, and it is the main ingredient in bleaching powder. Now, Japan is buying cheap raw materials - salt - from our country, and will use them to produce expensive industrial products to sell to our country. The outflow of rights and interests cannot be ignored!

Before the war, Japan's method of extracting money from our country was to use the principle of "raw materials from China, industry in Japan." They transported our cotton away, wove it into cloth, and then sold it back to our country, impoverishing our people. Now they are playing this trick again. I hope everyone will pay attention and not be deceived by them. At the same time, I hope our great gentlemen will not be too "magnanimous" or too "nationally minded." 300,000 tons were already tricked away last year. Can we let them deceive us year after year? It seems ridiculous for a major country called "one of the five powers" to be deceived by a defeated third-rate country.

Metal generates water; to overcome the fire-subduing water, look for metal outside the fire.

Fire contains metal; to extract the metal within the fire, first consider the metal outside the fire.

### Turning Stone into Gold

— Wen

Limiting tuition fees means teachers cannot survive, because of poverty!

Increasing tuition fees means parents cannot afford it, because of poverty!

Amid the cries of poverty throughout China, everyone can only hope for a way to "turn stone into gold."

### Unable to Enter

— Wen

On the second day of the Lunar New Year, Chief ×× personally went to each office to take attendance, but all the workers had taken the day off automatically, and the doors of each office were tightly closed. As a result, he could not enter!

### Water Melody

— Sui

(Feeling moved by the frequent air disasters)

When will the good times come? Pushing open the window,
I raise my glass to ask the blue sky. Cloudy sky.
I don't know what year it is, And I lose sight again!
Which god is in charge of the year? Science is advanced,
I want to ride the wind and return, But why does this hatred still linger?

I also fear the bad weather, Perhaps heaven is jealous of things,
I can't help but feel cold inside: Fast, stable, and cheap,
Going through the air for a moment, This matter is difficult to complete!
Forever leaving the world! Still take a foreign car,
A thousand miles in just a few days!

The predecessor of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra was the Municipal Council Orchestra, founded in 1881, and has had a friendship with the people of Shanghai for more than sixty years. At the beginning, it was called the "Shanghai Public Band," and the first conductor was Lei Mo Sai. The musicians were mostly invited from Hong Kong and Macau, and later a group of talents was also recruited from Manila. In 1907, the new conductor Bai Gu and six European musicians arrived in Shanghai at the same time, and the content was gradually enriched. During the First World War, the orchestra almost disintegrated due to the influence of the current situation. In 1919, the famous pianist Mei Boqi passed through Shanghai and stayed due to illness. He was invited to be the conductor of the Municipal Council Orchestra. Mei received an award in Vienna at the age of seventeen and had profound attainments. Therefore, his contribution to the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra for more than 20 years was witnessed by the people of Shanghai. Unfortunately, Mei passed away in Shanghai on August 3 last year. Today, the Shanghai music scene is sighing that no one can compare with Mei Boqi's cultivation. His death is an irreplaceable loss to the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra today!

During the period of occupation, the orchestra was forced to change its name. After the victory, it was taken over by the municipal government, and the position of director was held by a Chinese, but due to financial difficulties, the musicians' lives were not comparable to those in the Concession era. The current director is the overseas Chinese Xu Mianqing, and the conductor is Magolinsky.

### Li Yuru Has Nowhere to Live

— Shi Ren

The Peking Opera actress Li Yuru, known for her role as the Pagoda Girl, has been busy looking for a house to move into these days. The house she originally lived in, in Jiufuli, belongs to the Tianchan Stage. When Li became a famous actress, the issue of her accommodation should have been resolved by Tianchan, but it is unknown whether it was because the house in Jiufuli was too comfortable, or whether Tianchan Theatre didn't care about Miss Li's accommodation? She still hasn't moved until now. The Tianchan Stage wants to give that house to Ying Ergeng to live in. Yuru is ordered to vacate it within three days. Of course, Yuru has no reason to stay there, but she can't find a suitable place to live at the moment, which has made her very anxious these days.

Since the beginning of the Lunar New Year, Tong Zhiling has been performing at the Central Grand Stage in Nanjing, performing Xun-style plays such as "Two You in Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Pan Si Dong," which have been quite popular. When Zhiling decided to go to Nanjing to perform, she lived in the Central Hotel, which is the best-equipped hotel in Nanjing. For some unknown reason, this time she was invited to live in a small inn called Baile Apartment. This small inn is located in a narrow lane on the left side of the Central Grand Stage, which is full of muddy sludge. It is an old-fashioned two-story building, with board walls dividing it into small pigeon-like rooms. Our beautiful Miss Tong lives in room number twelve on the ground floor, just inside the entrance, using a pseudonym called Liang Wenying. I don't know if it's because she's afraid of being recognized, or if she has other intentions?

EMI is actively negotiating with Yu-style laosheng Chen Dahuo to record records. EMI intends to ask Chen Ling to record twelve sides of records at a price of 20 million yuan, and specifies that he record the complete plays "Farewell at Shaqiao" and "Great Baoguo." However, Chen only agreed to record six sides and refused to record the entire play. The outcome is still under discussion.

### The Good Governance of Cinemas

— Yin

Film From today onwards, cinema ticket prices have been reduced by about 10%. Although the reduction is small, in these times of rising prices, it is not without its merits. In fact, cinema operators and film producers are not losing out, because the entertainment tax has also been reduced accordingly.

For the same film, audiences often prefer to watch it in Cinema A rather than Cinema B. There are some great reasons for this. The environment, air, atmosphere, and even the screen, lighting, and dubbing in the cinema also affect the physical and mental enjoyment within those few tens of minutes, and should naturally be an important factor. In fact, this all depends on the management of the cinema authorities, which does not cost them much money, but the difference in the consequences is huge. For example, take "Dahua" Cinema. When you walk inside, you feel strangely warm, like spring. Now that coal prices are so expensive, you might think that it "costs a lot," but in fact, it only costs nine US dollars in fuel per day. Therefore, the matter is only whether to do it or not, and there are still ways to do it. Everything can be viewed in this way.

### Symphony Orchestra "Disbanded"?

— Ying

Music The Municipal Symphony Orchestra has been suspended for a long time due to funding problems. Recently, there have been rumors that the director will be replaced (it is rumored that it will be the President Dai Cuilun of the Conservatory of Music) and that it will be disbanded. The reporter visited the orchestra yesterday and was told that it will not be disbanded. The new budget (50 million yuan per month) is being reviewed by the mayor. If the new budget is approved, the salary of each musician can be increased to 500,000 to 600,000 yuan per month, and the conductor's salary will be one million. In view of the widespread rumors, the orchestra originally decided to reluctantly perform a chamber concert once tomorrow, but according to news last night, the performance has been postponed again due to the conductor's illness. It can be seen that the orchestra's problems are quite complicated.

In any case, if the orchestra is unfortunately disbanded or suspended for a long time, it will be an extremely unfortunate event for the Shanghai art scene!
