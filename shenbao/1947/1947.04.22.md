[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] After the Joint Conference of the Central Standing Committee and the National Defense Committee passed the amendment to the Organization Law of the National Government, the government immediately notified the Nanjing Office of the Democratic Socialist Party, which relayed the message via long-distance telephone to party members in Shanghai.

Xu Fulin will meet with them before going to Shanghai. Xu's participation in the Government Committee issue will only be decided after discussions in Shanghai.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold a routine meeting on the morning of the 22nd, which will still be presided over by Chiang in his capacity as Acting President of the Yuan.

### The Person Responsible to the Chairman Should Be the National Assembly for Constitution-Making; Proposal Passed by the Research Committee of the Constitutional Promotion Association

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Research Committee of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association held its first meeting at the National Assembly Hall at 10:00 AM on the 21st. Thirty-three committee members attended, chaired by Vice President Mo Dehui. The meeting passed the research work plan and methods for group research, and then discussed proposals. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. The conveners of the association reconvened at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to organize the resolutions of the morning's general meeting and adjourned at 5:30 PM. At the general meeting on the 21st, the association passed a proposal submitted by Committee Member Chen Huanzhang and 57 others stating that the Organization Law of the National Government should stipulate that the Chairman of the National Government is responsible to the National Assembly for Constitution-Making. The explanation of the proposal is as follows: The Organization Law of the National Government was originally based on the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China, which authorized the Kuomintang of China to be responsible for political tutelage. Therefore, the Chairman of the National Government was produced by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China, and it was not inappropriate to be responsible to the Central Executive Committee that produced him. Now that the new government organization law has been promulgated, changing from one-party political tutelage to multi-party governance, its task is to complete the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the constitution. Therefore, although the Chairman of the National Government was originally produced by the Kuomintang, his task has entered a new stage, and the person he is responsible to should be all the people, not just one party, the Kuomintang, and even less so only the parties participating in the government. Moreover, the National Assembly for Constitution-Making includes the participation of the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and social elites. Furthermore, the term of office of the National Assembly representatives extends to the date of the next National Assembly meeting, which is clearly stated in the preparatory procedures for constitutional implementation. Since the government has declared the return of power to the people, and the Organization Law of the National Government has been revised and promulgated, the Chairman should not be responsible to the party but should be responsible to the National Assembly for Constitution-Making to maintain the rule of law and solidify the foundation of the country.

### Reforming the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank into Publicly Owned Banks; National Defense Council Re-deliberates; Submits Specific Principles to the Legislative Yuan

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The draft legislative principles for the Central Bank Law and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank are currently being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. In addition to the Central Bank, the Legislative Yuan advocates that the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank be completely reformed into publicly owned banks, with all capital allocated by the national treasury. Chairman Chiang of the National Defense Council originally believed that this was not necessary at present and should be reconsidered. He put forward three opinions and handed them over to the Financial, Economic, and Legal Affairs Committees of the Council for deliberation. The committees have complied with the deliberation and put forward specific principles at the National Defense Council meeting on the 21st, and they have been passed by the general meeting and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Chairman's opinions are recorded as follows: (1) The recently promulgated Economic Emergency Measures Program is planning to sell some state-owned enterprises to the private sector by issuing stocks. Now that the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank have had people's shares for a long time, it would be contradictory in policy to order them to withdraw their shares. (2) If shareholders are ordered to withdraw their shares, the share capital cannot be returned according to the original amount before the war; if it is based on the ratio of prices to currency value, it will involve even more and easily cause disputes. (3) The proportion of commercial shareholders (including some legal entities) is limited, and most of the directors and supervisors are appointed by the government. All management measures can be carried out in accordance with national policies and will not be affected by commercial shareholders. Based on these three points, it is not appropriate to completely abolish commercial shares in the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank at present.

### National Defense Council Passed the Legislative Principles of the Three Banks Yesterday

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The National Defense Council passed the legislative principles for the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank on the 21st. The three banks are roughly similar. The capital is divided into public shares and non-public shares, and the latter shall not exceed 40% of the total. The funds used for major business operations shall not be less than 70%. Each bank shall have 25 directors, 9 executive directors, 1 chairman, 9 supervisors, and 1 standing supervisor. The general manager (one for each bank) and the deputy general manager (one to two for each bank) shall be full-time and shall be selected by the chairman in consultation with the executive directors from those with financial theory and banking business experience. They shall be appointed with the consent of the board of directors and reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval. As for the main business of the three banks, the Bank of China handles financial business for international trade and international exchange, the Bank of Communications handles financial business for industrial and mining, transportation, and public utilities, and may issue industrial bonds with the special approval of the National Government. The China Farmers Bank handles financial business for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, animal husbandry, reclamation, water conservancy, and land improvement, and may also handle land financial business and issue agricultural bonds and land bonds with the special approval of the National Government.

### Preliminary Measures Drafted for Handling Japanese Reparations Materials: Transportation Costs of Over 200 Billion Advanced by the Government

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Preliminary measures for handling Japanese reparations materials have been drafted and will be further discussed by the Industrial Guidance Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the National Federation of Industries, Commerce Associations, and experienced factories and experts. According to the preliminary distribution plan drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a total of 12,700 tons will be involved, with transportation costs of 220.1 billion. These transportation costs can be advanced by the government, and then raised by the factories themselves. The main items include 1,100 tons for the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant, with transportation costs of 18.9 billion, and 1,100 tons for the Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant, with transportation costs of 18.9 billion. The above two factories have already been established. There are eight more to be established, including the United Electric Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the United Internal Combustion Engine Manufacturing Plant, the United Mining and Metallurgical Chemical Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the United Boiler Manufacturing Plant, and the United Hydraulic Machinery Zhendan Machinery Manufacturing Plant. Each of these five factories will receive 1,100 tons, with transportation costs of 32.9 billion. The United Steam Engine Manufacturing Plant will receive 1,100 tons, with transportation costs of 18.9 billion. Secondly, a plan has also been formulated for the distribution of regions, including two electric steel plants, one to be established in Hankou and one in Guangzhou, both of which are 5-ton electric furnaces, with an annual output of 3,000 tons of steel ingots per region. Light industry distributed to private enterprises includes one aluminum rolling plant to be established in Tianjin, and four aluminum rolling plants to be established in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Qingdao.

[Another dispatch] It is reported that 50% to 60% of the reparations materials will be allocated to private factories and manufacturers who have reported losses, and the remaining 40% to 50% will be owned by the government, but one-third of which will also be sold to the public. The overall distribution ratio will be jointly discussed by representatives of relevant parties convened by the Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee and then finalized.

[This newspaper] According to a certain authoritative source, China has formulated a very detailed plan for the use of Japanese reparations materials. Everything is available regarding the raising of funds, the location of factories, the ordering of parts, and the allocation of talent, forming a huge volume. However, the determination of the overall budget is still pending, because: (1) The targets are not clear. How many factories can China obtain? What kind of factories? It has not yet been announced, and the required funds cannot be accurately estimated. (2) The nature of this compensation is whether it is "early demolition and relocation" or total compensation. Washington has not made a final decision. However, China has made thorough preparations for various possibilities; At the same time, it is guaranteed that all materials returned will be useful and will not be "close to scrap iron" as rumored by the outside world. According to the current situation, shipment can only be started in mid-July at the earliest.

### Guangzhou Nantoutou Paper Mill's Robbed Machinery Can Be Shipped Back

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] The Nantoutou Paper Mill in Guangzhou was the largest of the 13 provincial-run factories in Guangdong before the war, and its scale was unmatched by any paper mill in the country. The factory ordered Swedish machinery in 1933 and started operations in the summer of 1938. Shortly after, Guangzhou fell, and the Japanese dismantled and transported all the machinery and equipment to Japan. After the recovery of Guangzhou, the provincial government requested instructions from the central government to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters in Japan for recovery. Recently, a telegram was received from the outside world that the machinery can be dismantled and shipped back to Guangzhou. The provincial government has decided to hand over the factory to the Industrial Company for operation. However, the original site of the factory has been destroyed, and a large amount of funds is required for construction, transportation of machinery, and purchase of equipment and raw materials. It has been decided to welcome overseas Chinese investment. When the factory's machinery was ordered from Sweden in 1933, the value of the machinery itself reached 211,870 British pounds. The production rate is 50 tons of newsprint per day, and can be increased to a maximum of 100 tons. At the same time, it can produce 20 tons of sulphite pulp and 30 tons of mechanical pulp per day, and can use wood pulp to produce rayon. After the factory resumes operation in the future, not only will this province not need to import foreign paper, but it can also supply the southeastern provinces.

After receiving the order, the Ministry of Social Affairs consulted with relevant agencies such as the Ministry of National Defense and CNRRA and decided to start repatriation from mid-May. The entire work can be completed in two or three months.

### Filipino Chinese Stallholders Win Lawsuit: Primary Court Rules Ban on Stallholders Ineffective, Finance Minister, etc. Prohibited from Executing Department of Finance's Previously Issued Order

[Central News Agency, Manila, 20th] Chinese stallholders in the markets here have won an initial victory in their struggle to maintain their livelihood. Manila Primary Court Judge Ding Lasan yesterday ruled that Philippine Department of Finance Order No. 32, "All public market stalls shall be removed from stallholder leaseholds and stopped from January 1 of this year," was invalid. However, he stated that Philippine Republic Statute No. 37, which gives Filipinos priority in leasing public market stalls, is constitutional. The court temporarily issued an order targeting the Philippine Minister of Finance, the Manila Director of Finance, members of the Market Committee, and Manila market owners, prohibiting the execution of Department of Finance Order No. 32. The court stated: Judging from the wording of Republic Statute No. 37, the so-called Filipinization of market stalls is clearly not intended to give the provision retroactive effect to include stalls that have already been leased when the statute comes into effect, but only refers to stalls that have not yet been leased. This ruling can be appealed to the Supreme Court, which has the final decision on this issue.

### Inspection Team Decides in Kaifeng Meeting on Yellow River Flood Area Re-cultivation Plan: CNRRA Allocates 5 Billion Yuan to Purchase Urgently Needed Supplies

[This newspaper] All members of the Yellow River Flood Area Inspection Team, jointly formed by CNRRA, UNRRA, and other units, have returned to Shanghai one after another. Based on the on-site observations, the team held a meeting in Kaifeng on the 16th to decide on a re-cultivation plan for the flood area and then began to actively promote it.

During the meeting in Kaifeng, the team focused on discussing: (1) relief for refugees, (2) distribution of agricultural tools and seeds, and (3) transportation. However, political issues were also involved. The American representative, the Canadian representative, and the Australian representative of the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee all agreed that if the military problems in Henan Province are not resolved, the re-cultivation plan will be seriously affected and will fail.

The CCP Should Guarantee Non-Interference in Relief Efforts

American representative Gilchrist believes that UNRRA must hold consultations with the highest authorities of the CCP to obtain a guarantee from the CCP that they will not interfere with relief efforts.

The discussion on military issues coincided with two days after the Yellow River Flood Area Inspection Team's visit to Fugou County. The Fugou County CNRRA work team headquarters was attacked by CCP troops, and relief supplies were lost, which were witnessed by the inspection team. In addition to the private losses of Chinese and foreign staff, the work team lost 82 cattle, 362 bags of flour, and 2 million yuan in cash.

Currently, the refugees returning to their hometowns in the flood area have nothing and cannot carry out cultivation. Director Huo telegraphed CNRRA when he was in Henan to immediately remit 5 billion yuan in national currency to purchase seeds, agricultural tools, and other urgently needed supplies for distribution to the flood area.

Sun Dehe, Deputy Director of the Industrial and Mining Affairs Committee, reported on transportation issues, stating that 550 trucks will soon be allocated to the flood area to accelerate the transportation of relief supplies. However, 900 kilometers of highways that have been destroyed and damaged in Henan Province must be repaired first. The highway repair work relief project and the re-cultivation or re-embankment work relief project are currently being planned and implemented.

Afforestation and Dredging Plans Have Been Drafted

Mr. Brig, Deputy Director of the UNRRA Post-War Agricultural Committee, and Mr. Field, Deputy Director of the UNRRA Supply Group, believe that wind erosion and silting are as harmful as river floods. Therefore, it is recommended to plant more willow trees, depending on the wind direction, for protection, and to formulate long-term afforestation and dredging plans and earnestly advocate their implementation.

Water conservancy experts presented the opinion at the meeting that preventing future floods is as important as re-cultivating the flood area. Therefore, the Huaihe River re-embankment project in Anhui Province is necessary. Dredging the canal is a good deed, but the dredging project is expensive and cannot be completed quickly. Therefore, the Huaihe embankment must be strengthened to protect the lowlands on the south bank of the Huaihe River. According to the three-year plan drafted by the technical experts of UNRRA and CNRRA, 2,500,000 acres of land in the flood areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces should be re-cultivated. Currently, 2,000 refugees who are stranded in other provinces return to their hometowns in the flood area of Henan Province every day. The staff of the Henan Branch of CNRRA are working hard to carry out emergency relief work.

After the meeting, the Yellow River Flood Area Inspection Team rushed to Bengbu to inspect the Huaihe embankment in the area. At that time, 68,000 workers were engaged in embankment construction. The total length of the Huaihe embankment on both sides that needs to be repaired is 1,084 kilometers, requiring 36 million cubic meters of earthwork.

### Director of Civil Affairs of Anhui Province Investigates the Wuhu Destruction of Three Newspaper Offices Case

[Central News Agency, Hefei, 21st] This place attaches great importance to the incident of the Wuhu police officers destroying the County Council and three newspaper offices. The reporter visited Mr. Huang Tongchou, the Director of Civil Affairs, who is in charge of police administration throughout the province, on the morning of the 21st. He said that he had not fully understood the inside story and process of the matter, but it was reported that the reason was that the local finances were difficult, the police officers' living standards were low, and there were arrears, which led to disobedience and gathering to destroy the County Council, and then destroying the Gongshang, Fuxing, and Dajiang newspaper offices. The incident was suppressed and stopped by the military police. The Chamber of Commerce temporarily moved funds to pay the salaries for March, which temporarily calmed down. He plans to personally visit or send someone to investigate on the morning of the 22nd.

Editorial

### Trends in the Japanese General Election

April is Japan's political month: the so-called April election includes four types of elections: local governors, members of the House of Councillors, members of the House of Representatives, and local council members, which must be completed within April. The local governor elections, including 45 prefectural governors and 190 mayors across Japan, began voting on April 5 and have now been completed. Following the local governor elections, the new parliament elections will be held from April 20 to 25. The procedure is: the election of members of the House of Councillors, totaling 250, will begin on the 20th; the election of members of the House of Representatives, totaling 466, will begin on the 25th. After the central parliament elections, local council member elections will be held in various places on the 30th. The central and local parliaments will be established after the elections, and according to Article 67 of the new constitution, the Prime Minister must be elected by the parliament. Therefore, Japan's April general election will not only determine the fate of the Yoshida Cabinet but also be a "major test" for the future of Japanese politics.

Elections are a pointer of political trends, a test of the rise and fall of political parties, and a measure of public opinion. The results of the local governor elections that began on April 5 have already been determined: independents won 32 prefectural governor seats and 153 mayor seats; the Democratic Party won 3 prefectural governor seats and 20 mayor seats; the Liberal Party won 4 prefectural governor seats and 19 mayor seats; the Social Democratic Party won 3 prefectural governor seats and 9 mayor seats; the Communist Party won none; and other small parties won 3 prefectural governor seats and 8 mayor seats. The so-called independents are full of conservative colors; the Democratic Party is a transformation of the Progressive Party and, together with the Liberal Party, is a mainstay of conservative forces; the Socialist Party is a left-wing party and, together with the Communist Party, is a party of opposition; the small parties have indistinct colors and no great political power. In the local governor elections, the divided and concerted attacks of conservative forces symbolize the Japanese people's disappointment with democracy, but this is a favorable factor for the conservative forces' campaigns. The local governor elections can be said to be the prelude to the central parliament elections, and its trend is very clear and may also reflect the results of the parliament elections. According to Tokyo broadcasts, more than 38.35 million voters have now begun voting, and the order is very peaceful; looking at the trend, the conservative forces can win at least 171 seats in the 250-member House of Councillors, the Socialist Party may make progress, but cannot gain a dominant position, and the Communist Party is the upper house under the new constitution, the old constitution's House of Peers. The former members of the House of Peers were a feudal group composed of the imperial family, nobles, imperial appointees, and the majority of taxpayers, which was dissolved on March 31. The first direct election of members of the House of Councillors by the people. Although the feudal group of the imperial family has receded, what has risen in its place is the conservative force, which goes without saying that the election of members of the House of Representatives on the 25th may also have the same trend.

Summarizing the above analysis, we can point out the trends in Japanese politics and the direction of public opinion. First, this April election in Japan is based on MacArthur's instructions. On February 7, MacArthur sent a 'Election Recommendation' to Prime Minister Yoshida, advising him to hold a nationwide general election after the 93rd session of parliament closes to coincide with the implementation of the new constitution. The Japanese government accepted the directive, decided on the dates of the four elections on February 17, and dissolved parliament on March 31. The US Eighth Army dispatched district instructions on April 5 to monitor the progress of the elections, so it can be said that this election was conducted under MacArthur's guidance. Second, the new Japanese constitution is a progressive constitution. According to the new constitution, the Diet consists of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, and is the sole legislative body of the state, as well as the highest organ of state power. Matters previously decided by government orders will henceforth be decided by law. Therefore, the power of the Diet members is very great, they can determine the fate of the government, and they can determine the direction of politics. The victory of the conservative forces is the requirement of Japanese public opinion and national conditions, and the decline of the left-wing forces is also the decision of Japanese public opinion and national conditions, because the Japanese nation likes conservative democracy. Their political hopes and economic demands are gradual reforms, not a social revolution-style sudden change. Today's Japan will collapse with sudden changes, but it will survive with conservatism. Therefore, the conservative forces have a sure bet for victory in this general election. Third, the method of this election and the huge amount of election expenses have promoted the rise of independents and the Democratic and Liberal Parties. This election divides the large electoral districts into small electoral districts and uses direct voting to conduct four types of elections. Conservative forces represent landlords, capitalists, and bureaucrats, they have an advantage in the regions, and the elections will inevitably belong to them. Not only do they have a wide range of territories, but they can also pay election expenses of hundreds of millions of yen or more to carry out various necessary activities. The Communist Party's election expenses are tens of millions of yen, far beyond reach, and its inevitable defeat is not difficult to predict. Japanese people speculate that the price of being elected as a member of parliament is 500,000 yen. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party are unable to pay such large election expenses and are therefore unable to obtain more members of parliament. Politics follows economics, and economics is dragging the left-wing forces down and into a bleak future. The victory of the conservative forces and the victory of the ruling party are inevitable trends.

We are concerned about Japanese politics. The Potsdam Declaration stipulates that a 'government representing the will of the Japanese people' can promote Japan's progress. We hope that Japanese politics will progress, society will be stable, public opinion will be expressed, and that it will fulfill its obligations to the Allied countries during the process before and after the signing of the peace treaty. The establishment of a new government is promising. We hope that Japan will from now on embark on the road of democracy and earnestly implement the spirit of the new constitution.

### A Glimmer of Hope in the Discussion of the Austrian Peace Treaty Foreign Ministers Expedite Work Whether the Difficulties Can Be Overcome Will Be Known Soon A Heated Debate Occurred Yesterday Morning During the Discussion of the Trieste Port Report

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 21st Broadcast: The Foreign Ministers' Conference has entered its seventh week today, and no decisions have been made on major issues such as the country and the Austrian issue. The US believes that if the Soviet Union can make some concessions, the US will also make concessions. Also, the Foreign Ministers' Conference is expediting work as the closing is approaching.

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 21st Broadcast: When the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Four Powers met today to discuss the report of the Trieste Port Finance Committee, Marshall, Bevin, and Bidault advocated submitting the report to the United Nations for research, but Molotov firmly opposed it. As a result, the Four Foreign Ministers unanimously agreed to submit it to the Vice Foreign Ministers of the Four Countries for research. At the same time, a heated debate arose over when the Vice Foreign Ministers should submit the report, because this matter is directly related to when the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Four Powers will be extended. Finally, the deadline issue was decided by the Vice Foreign Ministers of the Four Countries themselves.

[Reported by This Newspaper] Moscow, 21st Broadcast: Molotov said that the United States' permission to provide economic assistance to Trieste is actually "external interference" in Trieste affairs.

[French News Agency, Moscow, 20th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will conduct a preliminary study of the Austrian peace treaty plan this morning, which has been completed. Whether this peace treaty can be signed in Moscow by the Four Powers will be revealed tomorrow.

[Reuters, Moscow, 20th] The Four Foreign Ministers made good progress in discussing the Austrian treaty today. They have completed the review of the entire treaty and are engaged in a second review of the first half of the treaty to clarify some minor points that have not yet been agreed upon. The Foreign Ministers were originally scheduled to meet again in the afternoon, but it was temporarily canceled and replaced by a meeting of the Foreign Ministers' representatives this afternoon and tomorrow morning to review the provisions submitted by the Foreign Ministers. The Foreign Ministers will also continue to review the second half of the Austrian treaty tomorrow and discuss the report of the Trieste Finance Committee. The atmosphere at today's Foreign Ministers' Conference was sincere, and agreements were reached on some minor unresolved issues. Of the articles originally scheduled for discussion today, eight have been finally resolved, eleven are left to the Foreign Ministers or their representatives for continued review, and nine have not yet been resolved. Observers believe that if major issues such as borders, compensation, and German assets can be resolved, the final draft of the Austrian treaty is expected to be completed in the shortest possible time. The eight articles that have been finally resolved today are: (1) The introductory chapter of the Austrian treaty, the British suggestion to confirm Austria's responsibility in the war in this chapter has been adopted; (2) Naturalization and residence of Germans in Austria; (3) Transfer of war criminals; (4) Prohibition of former Nazis and other illegal organizations from serving in the Austrian army; (5) Restrictions on border defense facilities; (6) Establishment of a special organization to resolve disputes arising from the return of UN property in Austria; (7) Transit facilitation of certain Austrian railway lines; (8) The organization that approves the Austrian treaty. Since today's meeting has clarified the minor unresolved points, the discussions at tomorrow's meeting can focus on the major points.

### Marshall and Stalin Meet Again May Be Possible

[French News Agency, London, 20th] Regarding Marshal Stalin and US Secretary of State Marshall holding talks, the diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times recently wrote an article commenting that: This meeting did not create any developments that would make the US and the Soviet Union hope to gradually reach an understanding, but it is still possible for Stalin and Marshall to hold another, more effective meeting. It would be unwise to say that the Soviet government is unlikely to take last-minute action to prevent the Foreign Ministers' Conference from breaking down. However, considering the general state of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, it is still pessimistic on the whole. Regarding the increase in coal allocation from the Ruhr and Saar regions to the member states of the European Coal Committee, an agreement has been reached. This agreement can be said to represent a major effort by British Foreign Minister Bevin to satisfy the continuous demands of French Foreign Minister Bidault. The agreement is based on the main principle insisted upon by the French delegation, that is, the percentage of each ton of coal produced in Germany that is exported abroad should be clearly stipulated and should not only be what remains after Germany's own needs are met. The previous method made it possible for German miners to be unwilling to increase production.

### Bidault Visits Marshall

[French News Agency, Moscow, 20th] French Foreign Minister Bidault visited US Secretary of State Marshal Marshall at the US Embassy in the Soviet Union today to discuss matters, but it was a private visit.

### If the German Problem Is Not Resolved, the US Will Implement a New Plan

[French News Agency, London, 21st] The conservative "Daily Mail" New York correspondent said today that US Secretary of State Marshall firmly believes that efforts by the Four Powers to reach an agreement on the German problem have been in vain. Once Marshall returns to the country from Moscow, he will immediately devote himself to promoting the merger of the British, American, and French occupation zones in Germany. People in New York believe that France agrees to this plan. The US State Department is making final preparations for a plan based on President Truman's new plan to prevent communism. The case will soon be submitted to Congress requesting the appropriation of billions of dollars to democratic countries and requesting the cessation of financial and economic aid to the Soviet Union and its vassal states.

### 4,000 German POWs Return from Soviet Territory

[French News Agency, Paris, 20th] The Leipzig Radio Station recently issued a message stating that 4,000 German prisoners of war returned to Frankfurt, Germany from the Soviet Union today. Most of them went home directly, and those who had no home to go to were temporarily sent to concentration camps.

### Next Foreign Ministers' Conference Marshall Suggests Holding It in October

### The US Aid Plan for Greece and Turkey Is Expected to Pass the Senate by a Majority

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Although some people have asked the government to clarify its policy toward the Soviet Union during the Senate's discussion of Truman's bill to aid Greece and Turkey, it is expected to be passed by a vote of four to one when it is put to a vote on Tuesday, and it is believed that the dispute over the lease of materials to the Soviet Union is not enough to affect the final vote.

Greek Foreign Minister Speaks Defends the Government

[United Press, Thessaloniki, Greece, 20th] Foreign Minister Tsaldaris delivered a speech here today, arguing that US aid can ensure that communism is overcome within Greece. Tsaldaris said: The leaders of the Allied countries and international public opinion now recognize that the nature of the Greek people's struggle is passive. We have now obtained strong assistance, which guarantees the smooth outcome of the struggle. The success of various policies since Greece restored the monarchy in March of this year is evidenced by the following five things (1) Former British Prime Minister Churchill recently announced that Marshal Stalin had requested Thessaloniki or Alexandroupolis as a Soviet base during the Potsdam Conference; (2) The US State Department recognized that the lack of security hindered Greece's recovery and the establishment of the UN Security Council's Balkan Investigation Committee; (3) President Truman's speech on March 19 strongly stated that Greece was threatened by totalitarianism; (4) The Balkan Investigation Committee proved that Greece's neighbors intended to occupy the two provinces of Macedonia and Serres; (5) The Security Council decided to station observers in the northern border area of Greece.

### Britain Is Willing to Cooperate with the Soviet Union in Political and Economic Aspects and Plans to Borrow Money from the US Again

[Reuters, London, 20th] Deputy Foreign Minister Mayhew said at a Labor Party meeting that Britain is willing to obtain the closest cooperation with the Soviet Union in political and economic aspects. Although the Soviet Union criticizes our country, we must still be patient in order to establish a closer relationship between the two countries. Mayhew said that Britain's foreign policy has the goals of internationalism, anti-imperialism, democracy, and socialism.

[Reuters, London, 20th] Blackbourne, a powerful member of the Labor Party, said at a public meeting convened by the Labor Party today that Britain has no other way to go except to borrow money from the United States again in the next two years. He said, "We must not let the United States become isolationist. The United States must generously lend money so that people can have food and machines, so that Europe can be regenerated." Blackbourne praised Foreign Minister Bevan, saying that his foreign policy is the main factor that allows the United States to generously lend money to Britain.

### Britain, the United States, and France Complete Negotiations on the Ruhr Coal Issue

[French News Agency, Moscow, 20th] Regarding the negotiations conducted by experts from Britain, the United States, and France on the Ruhr coal issue, it is learned that these negotiations have been largely completed, and what they discussed was a three-nation agreement to control the export of German coal within the scope of the European Coal Committee. The governments of Britain, the United States, and France will issue a joint communique simultaneously in London, Washington, and Paris tomorrow.

### Truman Delivers a Speech at the Annual Meeting of the Associated Press Striving to Maintain US Prosperity to Help the World

[Associated Press, New York, 21st] President Truman attended the luncheon of the annual meeting of the Associated Press here today and delivered a speech, saying that the United States should improve the living standards of its people so that it can show other countries the vitality and advantages of a free economy. The United States should reduce prices domestically to strengthen the national economy, maintain prosperity, and then help the countries of the world that have suffered from war. The President also said: The freedom and integrity of the United States can only be safe in a world where free people live together in peace and trade freely with each other. This is why we want to help the free people of the world to maintain their freedom. He said that many people must choose between totalitarianism and democracy. These people have been devastated by war for a long time and have been reduced to poverty. They eat whatever they can find and are easily invaded by external forces and foreign ideas, so they are really in a difficult situation. These forces directly threaten their way of life and indirectly affect our own well-being. Only by providing economic assistance to various countries for post-war reconstruction can this madness be curbed. However, if we want to help others, we must always maintain our own prosperity. It is a well-known fact that our private industry and commerce system has improved the living standards of our people to the highest level in the world. If the living standards in our country can continue to improve, it will be enough to prove to the world that the free economy is indeed full of vitality and is indeed superior to other economies. This private industry and commerce system is now being tested before the world. If it can prove that it can produce more and is more stable, then it can be said to have passed the test. Conversely, if we ignore the various needs of our country's economy and shirk our responsibilities, we will not only lose the ability to help others, but we will also be unable to move others.

### French President's Tour of West Africa: Ramadier Emphatically Defends the Republic

[United Press, Paris, 20th] French President Auriol, aboard the battleship "Richelieu," observing West Africa, arrived in Dakar today. Upon disembarking, he stated that his trip was intended to demonstrate that his duties and powers extend to all overseas territories.

[Agence France-Presse, Toulon, France, 20th] French Premier Ramadier, touring this area, delivered a speech today, forcefully asserting that France could no longer exist if it ceased to be a republic. He declared that anyone who opposed France was not only a murderer but also a parricide. Since the war, France has felt that it has discovered the path to freedom. We have a constitution that guides our path, and step by step, the republic is being established. Experience tells us that this republic suits our temperament, he said.

### Churchill Refutes Wallace's Speech: "I Do Not Believe I Ever Called Wallace a Communist"

[United Press, London, 20th] Churchill today issued a strongly worded statement refuting the speech given by former U.S. Vice President Wallace in Washington on the 19th. Wallace had claimed that Churchill dared not publicly acknowledge that his party members believed another major war was inevitable. Churchill stated, "I do not believe that another major war is inevitable. However, if the United Kingdom and the United States adopt blind policies of appeasement and unilateral disarmament, then I deeply believe that another major war is indeed unavoidable." Churchill refuted that he had ever referred to Wallace as a "secret communist." He said, "I did not refer to Mr. Wallace as a secret communist. This was an error by the BBC. The corporation immediately corrected their error when it was pointed out."

[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, Denmark, 20th] Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace arrived here at 6:45 p.m. today.

[United Press, Oslo, Norway, 20th] Wallace, speaking at a public gathering of 2,000 Norwegians today, stated: There is a serious crisis, and the United Nations may become a bloc of certain countries against the Soviet Union. If I thought that criticizing the United States could produce peace, then I would criticize the United States.

### Anglo-French Alliance Treaty: Includes Secret Clauses

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] "The Sunday Times" reported today that the Anglo-French alliance treaty includes several secret clauses. The French government's recent decision to prohibit illegal Jewish immigrants from entering Palestine via France is a result of these secret clauses. The report stated: The competition in the Middle East has always been the crux of Anglo-French colonial policies, and there is now good reason to believe that this attitude has changed. The UK's sale of various equipment to France two weeks ago, completing the equipment of the French airborne forces, further reinforces the belief that this is another gesture of British sympathy towards France's protection of its colonies.

### Danish King Passes Away: New Monarch Frederick Ascends the Throne Yesterday

[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, 20th] King Christian of Denmark passed away at 11:04 PM tonight at the age of 76, having reigned for 33 years. Originally, the King was quite robust, but after falling from his horse in October 1942 and sustaining injuries, one leg was amputated. His injuries never fully healed, and he had a large wound on his leg. He then contracted pneumonia, and his health deteriorated. His condition became critical several times. During the last World War, his illness worsened, and Crown Prince Frederick became regent. The sad news spread tonight, and the Danish people mourned deeply, gathering in front of the royal palace until late at night before gradually dispersing. Churches throughout the capital tolled bells in mourning. The Danish cabinet will hold a meeting tomorrow to draft a document. Then, Prime Minister Christensen will announce the King's death on the parliament balcony, followed by "The King is dead, long live the King!" Then introduce the new King Frederick to the public.

### International Security Force: Cannot Act Against the Five Powers

[United Press, Success River, 20th] It is reported that the army and naval generals of the Five Powers attending the United Nations Military Staff Committee have agreed that the mission of the proposed International Security Force should be limited to resolving disputes between small and medium-sized countries. It is said that the representatives believe that the UN forces cannot take action against one of the Five Powers for two reasons: (1) any of the Five Powers can use its veto power on resolutions passed by the Security Council against itself; (2) when any of the Five Powers or a coalition of the Five Powers takes aggressive action against other major powers, a state of war will exist.

### Tensions Rise in the Holy Land: Terrorist Incidents Occur Repeatedly

[United Press, Jerusalem, 21st] Bombs were reportedly thrown at five British army camps today. Power along 300 miles of the Palestinian coastline was also reportedly cut off at eight locations. It is widely believed that these actions are part of a full-scale uprising by the Jewish underground army, aimed at drawing the United Nations' attention to the Holy Land issue. A British army spokesman has confirmed this news, saying that six British soldiers were injured when a bomb was thrown in Natanya, the diamond center between Tel Aviv and Haifa. An army communiqué also stated that a British army camp near H伏脫, eight miles south of Tel Aviv, was bombed, but details were not given. Information on bombings and attacks on British army units in areas north of Tel Aviv, such as H地拉, White他, 鐵克伐, and 賴那那, could not be obtained. Another unconfirmed report stated that a major fire had broken out near H地拉, and all civilian vehicle transportation had been ordered to stop driving on the central highway to clear the way for military police to go to the aid of the H地拉 area. The police department announced today that an explosive device in a truck had been uncovered in the Natanya area. News from Jerusalem stated that the entire coast of Palestine may be under concentrated attack by the Jewish underground army and the Stern Gang, all under the command of the same leader. Telephone lines between Tel Aviv and H地拉 have been cut, and that area appears to be the center of the attacks. It is also reported that Began, the leader of the Jewish underground army, has been appointed commander of the joint attacks by the Jewish underground army and the Stern Gang.

### Nazi War Criminals: No Burial Place; Bodies Cremated and Ashes Thrown into River

[Reuters, Munich, 20th] Reliable sources say that the bodies of the ten Nazi war criminals executed last October, as well as Goering's body, were cremated, placed in military garbage cans, and dumped into the Isar River near here by four Allied generals. The four generals, representing the British, American, French, and Soviet occupation powers, personally threw the ash cans into the river on a frigid morning before dawn, forbidding any assistants or adjutants from being present in order to keep the location of the dumping secret.

After the criminals were hanged in Nuremberg Prison, two military trucks placed twelve unpainted wooden boxes, eleven containing bodies and one empty (to create confusion) into the prison courtyard on the morning of October 16th. The drivers were ordered to drive quickly but to avoid accidents that would delay their mission. They were accompanied by several jeeps carrying fully armed American soldiers, and the four generals. The convoy raced through the streets of Nuremberg, weaving to avoid being followed. Outside the city, the convoy took a specially closed highway straight to Munich, where the wooden boxes were stacked three high and placed in the crematorium.

All German workers at the crematorium were transferred elsewhere. At the request of the British and Soviet generals, Goering's and Jodl's coffins were opened for a final inspection. After an American officer opened the coffins, the Soviet general inspected both coffins and pinched Goering's cheek to verify that he was indeed dead. After the inspection, the coffins were nailed shut, and two American Graves Registration officers were called into the room to begin the cremation process. Crematorium staff were told that the bodies of fallen American soldiers were being cremated, but the secrecy of the operation made it easy for them to guess who was lying in the coffins.

The four generals left after the cremation of Goering's and Jodl's coffins and an American officer supervised the cremation of the remaining coffins. Shortly before midnight, the four generals returned, by which time all the bodies had been cremated to ashes. One general suggested that it would be easier to put the ashes of the dead into one container. The ashes of eleven people were put into a military trash can, which was placed in the back seat of an ordinary German black car and driven straight to the Isar River in Munich and thrown into the rushing river. This was the last journey of Hitler's cronies. Afterward, an American officer found eleven small metal tanks in the crematorium, but none of them contained ashes, probably another diversion.

### Retrial of Embezzlement Case at the Materials Department of the Railway Bureau: Witnesses and Defendants Confront Each Other in Court; Zhang Hongtu Denies That Zhang Bokang Was His Confidant; One Session Concluded, Verdict Scheduled for the 25th

[Our Newspaper] The embezzlement case at the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration was retried by the High Court. The defendants, Zhang Hongtu, Zhu Biwen, Chen Jingyao, Zhang Kaiyuan, Zhang Zelong, Zhu Peizong, Xia Dingwu, Xu Chuangui, Sun Xuesan, Li Jie, Cai Zhidao, He Zuen, and the twelve people were sent back to the District Court for a retrial. Yesterday, the trial was opened, presided over by Judge Xie Zhiying of the Eighth Criminal Court. Cao Zuxin, Li Fenbin, Wu Lianqing, Xia Zhaozhen, Yu Kanghou, Shen Liansheng, Zhou Jinhua, Xu Binghong, and Chen Bochuang, the director of the Railway Administration, representing the judicial section chief of the police department, Cai Dingbang, were summoned, as were witnesses Yu Xiangyan, Zhang Bokang, Wang Renmao, Jing Weijun, Gu Zhenmin, Yu Peien, and Li Runsheng to confront the defendants. The trial began at 10:00 AM and ended at 4:00 PM. One session of debate has concluded, and the verdict is scheduled for 9:30 AM on the 25th of this month. The defendants who were detained were returned to custody, and those who were released on bail remained on their original bail.

The Director Heads to Beijing, the Section Chief Represents

After Judge Xie called the roll, he first summoned Cai Dingbang, the section chief representing Director Chen, and asked why Chen Bochuang was absent. According to Cai, Director Chen had been ordered to report to Beijing on the affairs of the bureau, so he delegated Cai to represent him. Next, Zhang Bokang (chief of the purchasing section), who had been called as a witness, testified that he and Zhang Hongtu were old colleagues, and that he did not know Yu Xiangyan at all. Later, he became familiar with her because they were neighbors. As for giving Zhang Hongtu one million yuan in mid-December 1945, Zhang Bokang evaded and refused to speak directly. Judge Xie turned to Zhang Hongtu and asked why he sometimes approved and sometimes disapproved of the purchase of materials. Zhang replied that he rarely disapproved, only about two or three percent of the time. He also said that Zhang Bokang was slandering him with corruption only to reduce his own guilt. He said that on May 29, after discovering leaflets attacking the Materials Department at the North Station, he had ordered Zhang Bokang to be careful and restrain himself to avoid giving people something to talk about.

The Price Review Committee Was Not Approved for Establishment

He also stated that he had submitted a request to Director Chen twice, suggesting the establishment of a Materials Price Review Committee to evaluate the price of materials, but both times he was rejected by the director. As for the reasons for Director Chen's rejection, he did not know. Section Chief Cai Dingbang immediately explained that Director Chen believed that market prices changed at any time, and that it would not be effective for non-specialized personnel who were unfamiliar with market conditions to handle the matter together. Moreover, employees of the Materials Department who participated in the purchase would easily create corruption, so he did not approve it. Zhang Hongtu also said that he had submitted a request to the director to replace Zhang Bokang, but it was returned by Director Chen and not approved. Section Chief Cai also replied on behalf of Director Chen that the bureau had received a secret report when he submitted the request. He also presented Director Chen's letter in court, stating that Zhang Bokang was Zhang Hongtu's confidant, and that their relationship was extremely deep, pointing to collusion and corruption. After hearing the contents of the letter, Zhang Hongtu also rebutted in court, saying that although Zhang Bokang was introduced to the bureau by him, one introduction did not mean that he was a "confidant". If Director Chen introduced more private individuals into the bureau, would they all be "confidants"? A price list that had been altered was presented in court, and Zhang Hongtu was questioned. Zhang replied that the director of the two departments only approved the material comparison table, and that the price list was submitted by the merchant, so he could ask the merchant.

The Wife's Affairs Are Not Necessarily Known

The court then asked why he knew nothing about what Yu Xiangyan had done. Zhang replied that under the current marital system, a husband does not necessarily know what his wife does, and there is no reason for him to know. Zhang Honggang also stated that the ministry's order of December 10, 1945, had intended to transfer Zhang Bokang, but it was blocked by Chen Bochuang, so it was inappropriate for Chen Bochuang to refer to Zhang Bokang as his personal secretary. After questioning Zhang Honggang, the remaining eleven defendants were questioned. Their statements were consistent with the fact that they did not know the circumstances of the corruption, and they all believed that the money they received was a reward, three times in total. The first time was at the end of the solar year, the second time was at the end of the lunar year, and the third time was during the Dragon Boat Festival. Jing Weijun directly admitted that all the money he received was handled by him alone, but he claimed that the merchant sent it automatically and did not force him. However, the merchant who testified in court stated that Jing Weijun borrowed it. The defendant's defense lawyers made brief defenses because the trial had taken too long.

### Tang Shoumin's Trial Concludes: The Cases of Traitors Tao Li and Lu Boyun Are Also Concluded on the Same Day, and the Verdicts Are Scheduled for the 28th

[Our Newspaper] Tang Shoumin, the former general manager of the Bank of Communications, was accused of serving as the chairman of the Puppet Commerce and Trade Association during the enemy puppet period, buying more than 127,000 pieces of gauze for the enemy, and serving as a counselor of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and a member of the Puppet National Economic Commission. The High Court sentenced him to life imprisonment on May 30 of last year. The defendant was dissatisfied and applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The High Court has opened several hearings for investigation. The case was debated in the High Court yesterday morning. The trial concluded, and the verdict is scheduled for the morning of the 28th. Tao Zhongli was accused of organizing the Dazhong Shipping Company, the Dongfang Shenqu Opera House, and the Jichang Cotton Company during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. He was very close to the captain of the Japanese gendarmerie, Takeshita Mu, and translators Zheng Jinwen, Wang Bin, etc. On October 5, 1942, he colluded with the enemy soldier Tanaka to lure Weng Maozhao, the executive member of the 20th district branch of the Nanhui County Party Department, to the Japanese gendarmerie headquarters at Wangjia Wharf in the city, forcing Weng to admit that he had contact with anti-Japanese elements Yang Baolin and hid more than 30 guns. Subsequently, Weng was sentenced to five months in prison, and he suffered severe torture. After Weng's sentence expired, Tao extorted 10,000 puppet currency. In May 1945, the enemy arrested merchants Gong Deming and Fan Jinkun, saying that they knew Wang Zixiang of the Zhongjiu Army. As a result, more than ten cans of British tin-packaged cigarettes and 50,000 puppet currency were extorted. Fan was extorted 1 million puppet currency. All of these were delivered to Takeshita through Tao and shared more than 200,000 yuan. The case was concluded in the High Court yesterday and is scheduled to be sentenced on the 28th. Lu Boyun, a detective of the Puppet Qingpu County Police Bureau, who was accused of being a traitor, is also scheduled to be sentenced on the 28th.

### UNRRA Food Supplies Allocated for Public Works: Unable to Supply Charitable Organizations

[Our Newspaper] With the Shanghai branch of UNRRA nearing its end, the relief supplies for charitable organizations that maintain foster homes in the city will be discontinued. This will have a significant impact on poverty relief. The Shanghai Social Relief Association, in view of this, had Changwu Directors Du Yuesheng, Huang Hanzhi, and others jointly send a telegram to UNRRA Director Huo, requesting that the supply of major food items to various relief agencies be maintained until the end of December after the Shanghai branch of UNRRA was closed, but it was rejected. According to the reply telegram from the UNRRA, the total amount of food supplies scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai in the future will be no more than 20,000 tons, and it has been approved for allocation to the Water Conservancy Commission for projects. Therefore, the relief agency has no more food to allocate for the supply of major food items until the end of this year, and it is difficult to comply.

### Four Employees of the World Book Company Printing Factory Accused of Being Traitors: Re-examined Yesterday; Still Accusing Each Other

[Our Newspaper] The case of four employees of the World Book Company Dalianwan Road Printing Factory mutually accusing each other of being traitors was re-examined in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Xue Juemin, who was recorded, was the accountant of the World Book Company investment group stationed at the factory. During the War of Resistance, the World Book Company Dalianwan Road Printing Factory was occupied by the enemy and converted into the Huazhong Printing Company. On August 1, 1943, Xue and Zhou Xiangyun, an employee of the factory who was fluent in Japanese, negotiated with the Japanese Embassy. The printing factory was taken back. After receiving it, Xue became the director of the factory, and Shen Lianfang, the original person in charge of the factory, became the deputy director.

Zhou also served in an important position, jointly handling the business in the factory. They successively printed puppet state textbooks, enemy army military textbooks, central party and government car organizational system charts, and puppet Huainan Bank notes, and donated money to the enemy and received awards. After the victory, Wang Furou, the chief of the factory's engineering section, reported them. Xue and others then counter-accused Wang Furou of colluding with the enemy puppets and stealing books from the World Book Company during the occupation. Because it was discovered, he harbored resentment and falsely accused them. The High Procuratorate prosecuted them together for being traitors. They still accused each other during yesterday's trial. Xue said that he was not the director, but Shen insisted that Xue was the director, and the deputy director never asked about the factory's major and minor matters. Zhou said that he did not speak Japanese. Chen Baoyi was another translator of the World Book Company. Afterwards, the witnesses, salesman Jin Yifei, worker Fei Yunfang, and driver Mao Baoyu, were summoned. Their testimonies were mostly favorable to Xue. Wang Furou said that the three witnesses colluded with Xue. Judge Qiu said that the case still needed to be investigated and ordered that the hearing be adjourned. The four defendants were still released on their original bail. Raise the minimum salary discount point

### Subsistence Allowance to Increase This Month, Hope for Mold-Free Rice in Next Ration, Thorough Investigation of Profiteering Through Purchase of Ration Coupons

The amount of the in-kind subsistence allowance for civil servants and teachers in this city for April will be appropriately increased due to the recent sharp fluctuations in prices. The current price levels differ greatly from those in March, and the authorities are currently calculating the adjusted amount.

The rice distributed in the first in-kind ration was of poor quality, reddish in color, and had a moldy taste. After the Review Committee sent the rice to the General Food Warehouse for investigation, it is now known that the warehouse sent personnel to visit Ge Shixin, the Chief Secretary of the Review Committee of the Municipal Government, to explain the situation and stated that the quality of the rice in the next ration would be improved. It is also reported that a small number of rice shops are profiteering by purchasing in-kind ration coupons from civil servants and teachers. The price for each coupon is said to be 40,000 yuan per period for civil servants and 25,000 yuan for public servants. As for the ration of flour, because it is high-quality "Ship Brand" flour, it is also reported that a few flour shops are purchasing each coupon at a price of 42,000 yuan. The authorities are currently thoroughly investigating the above-mentioned illegal activities.

### New Business at Postal Remittance Bureau: Handling Package Mortgages

The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, in order to facilitate merchants and residents, has specifically instructed its branches in various locations to handle package mortgage business. This can be done in all locations within the country where there are postal management bureaus or first-class post offices, and where there are also savings and remittance branches or offices.

### Foreign Car Dealers Prepare to Close After Import Restrictions

[Our Newspaper] Since the government restricted automobile imports, the business of Chinese and foreign automobile dealers in this city has come to a standstill. It is reported that foreign companies, such as General Motors, are already laying off employees in preparation for closure. Ford, however, is still waiting, hoping that the government will change the regulations. According to people in the industry, the government once stipulated an import quota of 500 vehicles, but soon after completely canceled it. However, certain state agencies can still rely on special status to directly order and import cars from abroad, and many of these cars appear on the black market after import. Therefore, foreign companies are extremely dissatisfied.

### Electricity Supply Improves, Factories Can Obtain Power

[Our Newspaper] According to those in charge of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the electricity supply situation in this city has been improving daily. Industrial electricity in the former International Settlement area and the western Shanghai area can now be supplied as much as possible. Recently, a large number of factories in the area have applied to the company, and they can all get what they want. Also, since daylight saving time has been implemented, the city's electricity consumption should be reduced considerably. However, because daylight saving time has only been in effect for a week, there are no accurate statistics on how much can be saved. Last weekend, due to the fact that industrial and residential electricity usage were not adjusted after the implementation of daylight saving time, there was a shortage of electricity and a partial power outage occurred. Previously, because of insufficient electricity in the city, the Electric Power Company had obtained the cooperation of various factories to rotate shutdowns for three hours every night during the peak residential electricity usage time, so that the electricity supply remained normal and prevented damage to machinery. After the new time was implemented, factories stopped and started work according to the new time, but residents, due to habit, mostly delayed their lights-out time by one hour according to the new time. For example, factories that originally started work at 10:00 pm old time now start work at 10:00 pm new time, but residents who originally went to bed at 10:00 pm old time often still delay until 11:00 pm new time. Therefore, during the period from 10:00 pm to 11:00 pm new time, residents are still using electricity, and factories have also started using electricity. With both sides demanding electricity at the same time, the electricity supply became insufficient again. The Shanghai Electric Power Company is now improving this situation and has obtained the agreement of various factories to cooperate by delaying the daily shutdown and startup time by one hour to avoid conflicting with residential electricity usage.

### Yuanpei and Qiujin to Sail Shanghai-Tianjin and Shanghai-Qingdao Routes, Respectively

Haitian Wheel Postponed Until Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's China-India line's "Haitian" ship, on its second voyage to Calcutta, was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai today. However, the foreign ship anchored in the Chinese dock has not yet been removed as of yesterday, so it cannot be loaded.

The "Xi Lin" ship has sailed on the Shanghai-Tianjin route many times, but because there are not many passenger seats, it is not enough for passengers. Therefore, the "Yuanpei" and "Qiujin" ships were renovated yesterday. The "Yuanpei" ship will sail on the Shanghai-Tianjin route, and the "Qiujin" ship will sail on the Shanghai-Qingdao route, with the maiden voyage scheduled for this weekend.

### Huangxing Ship Damaged in Huangpu River Due to Strong Winds and Waves

[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Huangxing" ship, loaded with more than 3,000 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and temporarily docked at buoys No. 5 and No. 6. It was originally scheduled to move to the Yangjiadu wharf at 4:00 pm to unload the coal. At around 3:00 pm, when it was about to set sail southward, the Danish ship "Deli Maersk," managed by Jebsen & Co., arrived in Shanghai from the United States and was scheduled to dock at the Gonghexiang wharf.

The stern of the ship was also grazed by the bow of the "Deli Maersk," and the ship became unmoored at both ends. It drifted towards Puxi and approached the inner bank.

The Danish ship was unable to dock due to the strong currents and temporarily docked at buoys No. 4 and No. 5. The stern of the "Huangxing" ship was slightly damaged. It was moved to the Yangjiadu wharf at 6:00 pm. The captain has reported to the head office and will negotiate with Jebsen & Co. It is reported that buoy No. 6 was also damaged.

### Setting Fire in Broad Daylight, Three Arrested on Yuyao Road

Inspection personnel from the 17th detachment of the 6th inspection brigade of the Garrison Command were patrolling Yuyao Road 162 Alley at 4:00 pm yesterday when they saw three people with suspicious figures.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation

(Refusal to Vacate)

Wang Keqing asks: Yi rented a house from Jia for a period of one year. At the end of the term, Yi was supposed to move out, but it was difficult to find a house at the end of the term, and Yi was unable to move out, but Jia was anxious to take it back for his own use. After mutual litigation, the Housing Rental Management Committee mediated, and Yi agreed to vacate the house on December 22 of this year. The deadline has now passed, and Yi has not yet found a place to live. Please answer: (1) Is it illegal for Yi to refuse to vacate? (2) Can Jia request the authorities to enforce the eviction? (3) What kind of procedure should be used to request an extension of the lease term?

Lawyer Qin Liankui answers: (1) It is not a criminal act to fail to vacate in accordance with the mediation record. (2) Eviction may not be immediately possible. (3) If you want to extend the lease term, you should ask the owner for consent.

(2) Encroachment on Land

Shu Ming asks: Jia has nine points of land, which were pawned to Yi for 150 national currency before the War of Resistance Against Japan. It has not been redeemed to this day, and Jia has died three years ago. A land registration was held in the local area last month, and the land was encroached upon and registered by Bing, a member of Jia's clan, but the land deed is still with Yi. Bing's encroachment registration was handled according to the method of lost title deed. Please answer: (1) How should Jia's descendants apply for re-registration? (The registration period has passed) (2) How should they negotiate with Bing? (3) If they want to redeem the land deed from Yi, how much should they repay in principal and interest?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] (1) Declare the facts and request re-registration. (2) Demand the withdrawal of the fraudulent registration. (3) The redemption amount is based on the pawn deed, but if the pawnee requests an increase in payment due to changed circumstances, it can only be fairly measured by the court unless otherwise agreed.

### National Students at All Levels: Number of Publicly Funded Students: Ministry of Education Stipulates New Ratios

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Based on the results of discussions regarding the publicly funded student system at last week's ministerial meeting, the Ministry of Education has decided on the following measures for publicly funded students in national schools this year. In addition to maintaining the original publicly funded system, new publicly funded students must apply during the application process. The school will then submit the applications to the ministry for approval according to the prescribed procedures. The new ratios for publicly funded students at all levels are as follows: (1) For full public funding at universities, university-level specialized courses, and middle schools, the maximum quota is 20% of the number of students admitted, with the same ratio for half public funding. (2) For five-year vocational schools and vocational schools, the maximum quota for full public funding is 30% of the number of students admitted, with the same ratio for half public funding. (3) For construction and training classes at the specialized or higher level, the quotas for full and half public funding are both set at 30% for five-year programs, and 20% for all other programs. For advanced science and technology classes at the secondary level, the quotas for full and half public funding are both set at 30%. The application procedures for public funding for students in the above classes are the same. (4) The remaining funds from the publicly funded portion of the construction and training class budget will be used for the equipment of that class.

### Encyclopaedia Britannica: Textbook Films Publicly Shown

For Reference by Teachers of All Schools

[Report from Our Newspaper] Textbook films, an audio-visual education tool, use entire moving diagrams to replace text in books. Subjects that are difficult to explain clearly with lengthy text can be clearly displayed in textbook films within a dozen minutes. They are easy for students to understand, easy for teachers to instruct, and save time and energy. Their teaching effectiveness far surpasses that of textbooks. The education circles in the UK and the US are making great efforts to promote these textbook films. For example, last summer in the US, more than 120 universities and specialized schools held summer sessions specifically to train teachers on how to use textbook films to promote audio-visual education. This clearly demonstrates their significant educational value. The import of these films into our country has recently become unrestricted, which is truly a boon for all students. How to seize the opportunity to meet the new trend of audio-visual education is a topic of great concern for the education community. It is reported that the China Film and Photographic Equipment Supply Company, located at Room 603, Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road in this city, is now initiating free public screenings of Encyclopaedia Britannica textbook films, covering various topics such as astronomy, geography, physiology, hygiene, biology, botany, chemistry, and electricity, for reference by teachers of all schools. Written registration is now open to schedule dates and arrange invitations separately. When writing, please specify: (1) Name, (2) Title, (3) Type of textbook to be viewed, (4) Date and time of desired viewing, (5) School stamp, (6) Mailing address.

### City Council to Telegraph Executive Yuan Again: Requesting Allocation of Hongqiao Airfield

Heard it will be used as a Secondary Education and Culture District

### Life of Male and Female Students at Peking University

— He Jingyu

There are no boundaries between female and male students. In classrooms or libraries, they can treat each other as siblings.

Most of the female students at the Southwest Associated University were at Tsinghua, with very few at Peking University. However, among the few returning students at Peking University, there were quite a few returning Kunming young ladies. They still spoke the Yunnan dialect, "shi la me," to each other. Those who had been to Yunnan and had experienced eight years of air raid alerts felt a sense of longing and loss, as well as a kind of warmth. In the long days of Kunming, where spring is always in the air, how many people's hair had turned white? Even today, many professors' families remain in Kunming, where the climate is spring-like year-round, to recuperate, and the cost of living is particularly low, although it was once the most expensive city in the world and maintained the number one spot for a long time.

There Must be Phenomenon if China Advances

The number of female students is very large. The Medical School, the Agricultural School, and the Preparatory Class, which has four hundred students, are not located in Sand Beach. The Engineering School is newly established and only has first-year students who are still taking classes at the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. But the most interesting thing is that there are already many female students studying electrical and mechanical engineering. At Kunming, the Engineering School only had one table of female students the first time. China has made progress. In the near future, there will definitely be more female engineers in China than there are female lawyers now. The optimistic President Hu believes that this is a necessary phenomenon for China's progress. Seeing the female students studying so hard today, perhaps on the day when the Constitution is truly implemented, our government may have a female Minister of Labor like the United States.

When it comes to female students, no one can forget the question of their beauty. Because most of them grew up in Beiping, 99 percent of them speak the Beijing dialect. Even those who have never been to Beiping naturally learn to speak "human language" (as Mr. Lao She wittily called it). They all speak fluent, smooth, clear, and elegant Beiping dialect, which certainly adds to their beauty. Although their clothes are not as sophisticated as those in Shanghai's Jiangwan or Datong Guanghua, besides their interest in clothes, they often run to the library or laboratory. Even after taking exams, they still occupy seats in the library, reading books that are not assigned by professors and newly arrived academic journals from the United States and Europe. Some take advantage of holidays to concentrate on writing dissertations and books. After all, the one or two percent who watch two movies and have a cheap meal at Dong'an Market are the very rare exception. Compared to Shanghai's glamorous world, where a cup of tea in a dance hall costs 20,000 yuan, the male and female students at Peking University and Tsinghua University only feel inferior, unable to catch up, and inevitably appear "poor and dull," admiring with awe. Half of their beautiful youth is spent on academics, one-half of the remaining half is spent on ordinary life, and the other half is spent on love. Perhaps this ratio is just right. Among the female students, many see themselves as elder sisters and devote their entire lives to academic work. "Everyone has their own aspirations," as the saying goes.

Debating Problems Becomes a Trend

Recently, male students have criticized female students, saying that the quality of Tsinghua's female students is better than that of Peking University's. "Quality" is a euphemism for beauty. The reason is that there were more beautiful women during the Southwest Associated University period, and Tsinghua had the most female students from the Southwest Associated University, so Tsinghua's "quality" is better than Peking University's. Others say that Peking University has a large quantity, and with a large quantity, the quality must also be excellent, or at least the probability of excellence is high. This is another kind of logic. The students of the two schools originally came from the same family, so the custom of visiting each other in the city and outside the city is very popular on Sundays, and male students naturally discuss this issue with each other. There are scholars at Peking University who are proficient in geomancy, like Liu Bowen, who believe that the gate of Tsinghua Park is well-positioned, while the various colleges of Peking University are separated and do not have a gate at all. Without a gate, how can the geomancy be good! This may be the saying of eclectic and yin-yang schools, which is certainly not the orthodox Confucian school. However, there are no boundaries between the female and male students of the two schools. In classrooms or libraries, they can treat each other as siblings, exploring knowledge, debating problems, and questioning each other, which has become a trend. The library facilities are among the richest in the country. It is a pity not to study the many good books available. Asking people to move will rarely result in a peaceful day. The country has hired so many great scholars, and we must live up to the country. This world is still ruled by scholars, but wars are completed by scientists.

### Patriotic Guangzhao and Other Middle Schools Request Loans from the Four Banks Unsuccessful

[Report from Our Newspaper] During the Anti-Japanese War, more than 20 private schools in Shanghai, including Patriotic Girls' Middle School and Guangzhao Middle School, were severely damaged. These schools had requested the municipal government to forward their request to the Executive Yuan for permission to borrow 200 to 300 million yuan per school from national banks to rebuild new school buildings. The Executive Yuan's joint office of the four banks put forward a discussion and decided that each school could raise funds from educational institutions. It is reported that this official reply has arrived at the Municipal Education Bureau.

### International Students in the United States: China Has the Largest Number: A Total of 1,498 People

[United States Information Service, Washington, 21st] The Foreign Student Friendship Association and the Institute of International Education here, both private organizations, jointly compiled year-end statistics on foreign students in the United States, totaling 14,956 people, setting a new record for the association in more than 20 years. However, the report also stated that the accurate number may be even higher, as the association's statistical deadline was February 6, and some omissions are inevitable. Thirteen percent of the total, or 1,915 people, come from the Far East or Southwest Asia. Among them, Chinese students are the most numerous, totaling 1,498 people. The Philippines is next, with 295 people.

[United States Information Service, New York, 21st] Teachers College, Columbia University, now has students from outside the American continent, setting a new record. Of the total of 362 people, 168 are male and 194 are female. Among them, the largest numbers are from China, India, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii.

### Municipal School Academic Advancement Fees: Likely to be Distributed This Week

The municipal government may allocate the academic advancement fees for municipal schools in this city to the Education Bureau for distribution within this week. It is reported that the National Education Department of the Education Bureau is currently compiling the amount of academic advancement fees collected by each school and the number of students in schools that have not collected the fees, so that they can be distributed immediately after the municipal government allocates the funds. When all academic advancement fees are distributed, schools that have already collected fees but have not reported them may not be allocated any funds, and the amount collected should be refunded to the students. As for those who have not collected academic advancement fees and have not reported to the Education Bureau, their right to allocation will also be cancelled. Therefore, any academic advancement fee survey forms that are not submitted to the Bureau before the 24th of this month will inevitably suffer an intangible loss.

### Private Schools Approved for Establishment: 30 Elementary and Middle Schools

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Education Bureau has recently been very crowded with applicants for the establishment of private schools and is processing the review procedures in batches. Recently, the fifth batch of private school establishment applications has been reviewed by the Review Committee and approved by the 65th Bureau Affairs Meeting, with a total of 30 private elementary and middle schools being approved for establishment. Establishment certificates and school bells will be issued soon. All other private schools that have not yet been approved for establishment must complete the establishment procedures in accordance with the law before the end of April. Failure to submit an application within the deadline will result in a suspension of enrollment during this summer vacation. The list of private schools that have been approved for establishment is divided as follows: (1) Private Middle Schools: Nianhua Girls' Junior High School, Ronghai, Datong Junior High School, Chuneng, Qilu, Shaoxing Luhai, Lizhi, Yangzheng, Zhizhong Girls' Middle School, Pudong Junior High School, and 10 other schools.

### Provisional Rules for Round Table Tennis, Equipment and Setup

In the realm of ball sports, table tennis stands out for its simplicity of equipment. Just a table, net, paddle, net stand, and ball are all you need to start a lively game. Similarly, the equipment and setup for round table tennis are not complicated.

(A) Round Table Tennis Table

The tabletop material is unrestricted, but must be smooth and resilient. The standard for resilience is that a standard ball dropped from a height of 30.5 cm above the tabletop should bounce back to an average height of 20.3 cm to 22.9 cm. The radius of the round tabletop is 1.3725 meters, and the height of the tabletop from the ground is 0.762 meters. The tabletop must be installed level. The entire surface of the tabletop and legs should be painted a non-reflective dark green. A white border line, 1.9 cm wide from the edge, should be painted around the circumference of the round tabletop. In three-person round table tennis, the round tabletop should be divided into three equal sectors, each sector with an arc length of 120 degrees and a central angle of 120 degrees. The three equal radii should also be painted with white lines 1.9 cm wide. In four-person round table tennis, the round tabletop is divided into four equal sectors, each sector with an arc length and a central angle of 90 degrees. The original three radii are replaced with two mutually perpendicular diameters.

(B) Table Tennis Round Pillars

The material of the round pillars is unrestricted. In three-person round table tennis, four round pillars are used, one placed in the center of the round tabletop, and the other three placed at equal distances around the circumference. The top of the pillar should extend 17.1 cm above the tabletop, and the pillar should be perpendicular to the tabletop. The cross-sectional diameter of the round pillar is 1.9 cm, and the base of the pillar cannot extend horizontally beyond the tabletop. In four-person round table tennis, there are a total of five pillars, one placed at the center, and the other four placed at the four equal points on the circumference. The height and thickness of the pillars are the same as in the three-person version.

(C) Table Tennis Net

In three-person games, there are three nets, each extending from the central table tennis pillar to the table tennis pillar on the circumference, dividing the round tabletop into three equal sections. In four-person games, there are four nets, arranged in the same manner as in three-person games, vertically dividing the round tabletop into four equal sections. The width of the net is 17.2 cm. The color of the net should be white, and the mesh size should be 1.9 cm square. A colored edge, 1.9 cm wide, should be sewn onto the top edge of the net. The two ends of the net should be tightly fastened to the top of the table tennis pillars so that the top edge of the net is level.

(D) Ball and Paddle

The ball and paddle are exactly the same as in ordinary rules, so they will not be described further.

Rules Content

Round table tennis is derived from regular table tennis, and its rules are largely similar to the original rules. However, due to differences in shape, position, equipment setup, and number of players, some aspects cannot be exactly the same. The differences are listed below. (A) Three-Person Elimination System This is a game for three players simultaneously. Here are some points that differ from ordinary table tennis:

(1) (Position) The positions of the three players should be determined by drawing lots. The first draw can choose the best position and the right to serve, the second can choose the next best position, and the remaining position goes to the third player.

(2) (Scoring) Ordinary table tennis rules use a scoring system. Three-person round table tennis, due to the triangular league nature, should use a point-loss system. The first of the three players to lose 11 points loses the game. If three or two players each lose 10 points at the same time, then the person who loses two more points first loses the game.

(3) (Serve) The person who wins the right to serve is the server, and the other two players are the receivers. The server first tosses the ball up and hits it with the paddle so that the ball bounces in their own zone and then crosses the net, landing in any zone to the left or right. This is called a serve. The next right to serve is obtained by the person who loses points each time.

(4) (Receive) The person receiving the ball can return it to any two zones to the left or right, but cannot send it to the same zone three or more times in a row. For example: If Player A gives the ball to Player B, Player B can return it to Player A the first time. The second time Player A can give it back to Player B, and Player B can return it to Player A again. The third time, Player A cannot give it back to Player B and must give it to Player C. Otherwise, Players A and B will be playing forever, and Player C will be waiting forever, which would be ridiculous.

(5) (Elimination) The first of the three players to lose 11 points is eliminated and ranked third. Because the remaining two players cannot play round table tennis, their final ranking is determined by the number of points lost, with the player who loses fewer points ranked first and the player who loses slightly more points ranked second. If, at the time the first player is eliminated, the other two players have the same score, then the last point lost by the two players is counted. Whoever loses this point last is ranked first.

(B) Four-Person Elimination System

The rules for the four-person elimination system, such as position, scoring, serving, and elimination, are the same as in the two-person elimination system. Only the range of sending the ball is slightly changed. In the four-person system, the ball cannot be sent to the same zone twice or more in a row. Because the number of players is increased by one, the opportunity to send the ball also increases by one zone. The attacking range is expanded, which is beneficial to the attacking side. From the defense perspective, the more chances to attack, the harder it is to defend, and everyone is in danger, with a feeling of unease. Therefore, the number of times the ball is sent to the same zone should not exceed twice or more in a row. For example, the first time Player A gives the ball to Player B, Player B can return it to Player A the first time. The second time, Player A cannot give it back to Player B and must pass it to Player C or Player D.

(C) Four-Person Doubles System

Doubles is a game of competition between two teams of two players each. The positions chosen by both sides and the right to serve are determined by drawing lots. If the team that wins the draw is willing to serve or receive, then the other team has the right to choose the position. If the team that wins the draw wants to choose the position, then the other team has the right to decide to serve or receive first. However, the winner of the draw can still give the right to choose to their opponents if they wish. The two players on the same team stand facing each other in a straight line. The serving rules are the same as before. The target of the hit is of course to attack the two enemies to the left and right, but when necessary, it can also be shot into the zone of the teammate opposite them, to rest and wait for an opportunity to enter directly. However, it is not allowed to hit the same team zone twice or more in a row. Serving is not allowed into the same team's zone. The scoring method uses the scoring system, which is the opposite of the previous section. The side that scores 11 points first wins a game. Two wins out of three games determine the winner. The right to serve uses a rotating system, which is the same as in ordinary table tennis rules, so it will not be described further.

### Repeatedly Rising Prices in Other Cities Lead to Soaring Yarn Prices in Three Cities, Garrison Command Inspection Begins Investigation of Yarn Shop Account Books

[Reported by this newspaper] It is reported that the recent continuous surge in yarn prices in Shanghai is largely due to rising prices in other cities. Taking the price of 20-count yarn as the standard, the Shenyang market price yesterday was still over 11 million yuan per piece. After being transported out of Tianjin, Shanghai's delayed yarn, which is deeper than Shenyang's, has changed its route to transit through Yingkou. The fact that the Shanghai yarn market has become stronger with the help of the Niuzhuang gang is no accident. It is also reported that, after the ban on exports from Tianjin, a new outlet has been found to transit through Beiping. Therefore, the market price of 20-count yarn in Tianjin has also rebounded and reached 7 million yuan. Qingdao yarn prices are similar to Tianjin. In other places such as Hankou, Jiangxi, and Guangzhou, the price of 20-count yarn is generally hovering between 6.5 and 6.6 million yuan. The Changsha price is about 6.6 to 6.7 million yuan. Furthermore, due to the recent brisk yarn market in the north, the daily transaction volume of cotton yarn sold to the north in this city is between 300 and 500 pieces.

[Reported by this newspaper] To suppress yarn prices and crack down on illegal speculative trading, the Garrison Command dispatched a large number of officers from the Economic Section of the Inspection Division, led by Zhang Yamin, starting yesterday. They were divided into 24 groups and launched investigations of account books in yarn shops throughout the city. At the same time, based on clues, they investigated the stored yarn in warehouses. Yesterday, because the thorough investigation work had just begun, no cases of significant severity had occurred. However, it is understood that this thorough investigation work will continue until the yarn market returns to normal.

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Tang Zhiliang, chairman of the Yarn Business Association, the reasons for recent fluctuations in the yarn market are: (1) Imbalance of supply and demand, (2) Imbalance of production costs and negotiated prices, (3) Imbalance of yarn prices in various places. With these three factors, it can be known that the rise in Shanghai yarn prices is by no means purely the result of speculative funds. It is hoped that the government will actively encourage and support industry and commerce, creating a profitable production business, so that speculative funds in the market will naturally tend towards production.

### Government Bond Market Flat and Weak

Yesterday, government bonds saw activity shift to the stock market. Prices rose slightly initially, then fell, dragging down miscellaneous bonds as well. United C opened at 15,200 yuan, rose to 15,500 yuan, but sales from room 503 and retail sales pushed it back down to within 13,000 yuan before rebounding. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Class A and B bonds fell by 1,000 yuan, Class C bonds fell by 1,400 yuan, and Class D and E bonds also fell by 1,300 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 6 million yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Mostly Higher

Foreign stocks were boosted by the strange enthusiasm for black market exchange rates yesterday. Securities firms and Guangdong firms actively absorbed them. In the afternoon, a surge of new buying sparked the market. Ewo Cotton opened at 40,700 yuan, with a low price of 40,400 yuan, but rose to 44,500 yuan in the afternoon before slightly stabilizing. As a result, compared with last Saturday, steel and British companies each rose by a strong half, shipping rose by just under 10%, and Ewo Cotton, Jardine Matheson, Guangdong Paper, and Ewo Brewery each rose by 10%. The rest rose slightly. The Ministry of Finance has forwarded all relevant information to the Economic Commission for reference.

### Chamber of Commerce Adopts Import and Export Linked System

The Ministry of Finance has forwarded all relevant information to the Economic Commission for reference.

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously requested the adoption of an import and export linked system. After submitting reports to the competent departments, the Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating: "The telegram and attachments have been received. The revised draft of the import and export trade adjustment measures, and the written opinions of Zhang Yujiu and Zhang Huanzhang on the study of the import and export trade linked system, have been forwarded by the Ministry of Finance to the National Economic Commission for review and reference."

### Xi'an and Guangzhou Need the Largest Denominations

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to remedy the shortage of cash in various places, the Central Bank has decided to issue banknotes with a face value of 10,000 yuan. However, the issuance of these banknotes is currently limited to Xi'an and Guangzhou, which have the most severe cash shortages. In Xi'an, the recent arrival of new cotton requires a large amount of cash for purchase. In Guangzhou, a large amount of overseas remittances is pouring in, also requiring a large amount of cash. As a result, the exchange rates of various banks for these two places have been increasing daily. It is now reported that these large denomination cash banknotes will be transported to the two places for circulation in the near future. The cash panic in these two places is expected to be resolved. The high domestic exchange rate in these two places is also expected to be suppressed.

### Check Clearing Amount

[Reported by this newspaper] According to statistics released by the Shanghai Clearing House: The total clearing amount in March was 11,890,980,997,466.94 yuan, the total number of cleared checks was 2,270,601, and the difference was 1,138,346,047,526.13 yuan. The daily averages were 475,639,239,898.67 yuan in amount, 90,824 in number of checks, and 45,533,841,901.04 yuan in difference. The number of clearing days in March was 25, and the average amount per cleared check was 5,236,933.40 yuan.

### Rayon Prices Weak in Off-Season, Monthly Demand Less Than 1,000 Cases

The black market price of rayon in this city broke the 10 million mark last week, differing by more than double the price allocated by the China Trust Bureau. According to the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau's agency sales: This rise in rayon is entirely artificial, and speculators deliberately raise prices when there is a shortage. In fact, rayon demand has entered the off-season. The silk weaving industry, which has the largest sales volume, has stopped production of its usual goods due to summer. The ribbon industry also cannot work after the summer season, so demand is greatly reduced. Only over 900 cases were distributed last month, and this month is not expected to exceed this number. At the peak, over 3,000 cases were distributed, which is more than two-thirds less. MacArthur Headquarters had promised to supply 5,000 cases per month, but this month it was not possible to distribute them in time due to transportation reasons. Recently, 2,500 cases were loaded onto a ship on the 15th and should arrive within days. As soon as they are received, they will be distributed in full according to the needs of each factory, and the allocated price will remain unchanged. The highest price per case, Tianqiao, is still 5.5 million, followed by Dongyang Jin Sanma, still at 5.3 million. Gaoshan Asahi is still at 5.2 million, and the market should stabilize.

### Various Parties Actively Absorbing, China Stocks See Another Peak

China stocks saw renewed buying momentum yesterday due to a general rise in market prices. While some long positions in the industry were liquidated, they were still actively absorbed. Outside investors with strong capital continued to buy without selling, and the market showed a very profitable trend. More than a dozen stocks reached their limit.

The opening prices were similar to the previous period. Due to active buying by northern gangs, sentiment was firm, and buying momentum started, each count of yarn rose again by 10% to 20%.

The price increases for cotton cloth became even more intense. It is reported that northern gangs and new buyers were still very interested, and the market continued to be strong. The leading fine cloth rose from 225,000 yuan to 260,000 yuan, Wufu 250,000 yuan, and 20-count extra-fine cloth sold at the textile construction opening price plus 49,500 yuan.

### Reasons for Rising Dye Prices: Hoarding Resurges, Tianjin Gang Actively Absorbing

[Reported by this newspaper] Dye prices have recently risen again. A reporter recently visited relevant parties and summarized the reasons for the fluctuations as follows: (1) The number of newly recovered areas in the north has increased, and merchants from Tianjin are importing goods in large quantities, which raises prices due to supply and demand. (2) The prices of the main chemical raw materials for dyes have all increased, so dye prices have risen accordingly. (3) The main use of dyes is in dyeing dark-colored clothing. Their use is most prosperous after autumn. The current season is approaching early summer, and merchants are planning for autumn supplies, so the demand for dyes has increased. (4) From the lunar new year to today, dyes have generally been sluggish, mainly because commodity prices have not fluctuated much (except during the gold rush), and market interest rates are very high. Merchants are unwilling to bear high interest rates and store goods, so dye prices have fallen. However, with the current price increases and the approach of peak months, hoarding has become more prevalent, creating price fluctuations. In addition, the issuance of 10,000 yuan banknotes will have some impact on market psychology.

### Oil Allocation Method Agreed Upon by the Transportation Management Committee

[Reported by this newspaper] The Import Quota Allocation Office of the Temporary Import Management Committee previously convened a meeting of registered importers of "Unlisted Oils and Waxes" to discuss the allocation of import quotas for oils and waxes from February to April of this year. At the meeting, the office announced that the prescribed quota for the above-mentioned goods for this quarter was 515,000 US dollars, of which about one-third had already been used to allocate to applications received before the end of January this year. The remaining two-thirds were allocated to 14 registered importers, and a distribution method was subsequently discussed and unanimously approved. Before the quota for this quarter was set, the office had received a very large number of import license applications since November of last year. According to the provisions of Public Announcement No. 1 A3 (B) of the Temporary Import Management Committee: Before the quota allocation method begins, all Appendix (II) goods (except for five types of goods for which import licenses are handled by the Import Management Office) applications for import licenses should be managed by the Quota Allocation Office, and efforts should be made to handle them. To take care of import applications that had not yet been completed before registration (these applications mostly represent goods ordered by import businesses), it was decided to use part of the quota to clear old cases. All goods with a large number of applications received before the quota was set were cleared in this way to balance the situation. However, this is only limited to this quarter. It is said that the portion of the quota allocated was fairly distributed based on the application figures, except for non-compliant applications.

### Another 38 Brokerage Firms Approved to Sell US Dollar Bonds, Yesterday's Fundraising Results Break Records

### Provisional Suspension of Yarn Allocation Due to Failure to Submit Verification of Business Registration Certificate and Factory Number

[This Newspaper's Report] The China Textile Construction Corporation yesterday officially announced the provisional suspension of yarn allocation to all factories that have not submitted verification of their business registration certificates.

In addition, the company yesterday continued to sell yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Committee as usual, selling a total of 1,886 pieces, including 1,540 pieces to manufacturers and 346 pieces to yarn shops. There were a total of 1,185 application forms from manufacturers and 346 applications from yarn shops.

### No Improvement in Tea Exports

Recently, in the foreign tea market, the appetite of exporters is extremely small, and transactions are as rare as the stars at dawn. The market momentum lacks the strength to rise. Among various teas sold domestically, except for the new Longjing tea of this year, the shops and businesses in this street and surrounding areas still have some sales, but the rest are sold sporadically. The trend consistently maintains a balanced and hovering state.

### 9 Billion in Loans for Fujian Tea

[This Newspaper's Fuzhou Dispatch, 21st] It is heard that the Agricultural Bank has approved 9 billion for tea loans in the Fujian region this year, to be undertaken and distributed to various tea companies by the Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Company.

### Sugar Prices Tend to Soften

The sugar market is showing a daily decline. Yesterday, 200,000 "Qing Jiao" offered by the brokers attracted no interest. Xinghua white sold for 310,000, then 300,500, then 300,300 yuan. Xinghua red sold for 200,600 yuan, with over 200 baskets transacted. Hainan foreign sugar sold for 195,000 yuan, with only 20-30 bags transacted. Zhang Diao also opened with a price of only 192,500 to 195,000 yuan.

### Qinhuangdao Coal Arrives in Shanghai

The Hai Huang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Qinhuangdao, carrying 3,000 tons of coal, now docked at Yangjiadu Wharf for unloading.

### Shaanxi Cotton Arrives in Shanghai

The second batch of 150 tons of national cotton purchased by the China Textile Construction Corporation in Shaanxi arrived in Shanghai on April 19. More than 1,000 tons are still being transported in succession, all of which are being transported by Jiang'an Industrial Company.

### Parallel Market Prices Soar

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] Prices in Taiyuan are rising again, especially for food and cloth. Compared with the lowest prices after the announcement of the economic measures plan, millet has risen from 140,000 to 200,000 per shi, top-grade flour has risen from 80,000 to 98,000 per bag, and Mingxing cloth has risen from 200,000 to 290,000.

### Nanchang Grain Prices Fall Back

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 21st] Prices here are stabilizing daily. Except for silk cloth, which continues to rise sharply, the rest are declining, especially since the government has held flat-price sales, and the grain shortage has been resolved. Today, late rice is 90,000, medium-ripening rice is 88,000, Qi rice is 83,000, and coarse rice is 89,000 on the grain market.

### The Surge in Copper and Tin Prices Has Stopped; Hardware Prices Will Fall Back

The surge in copper and tin prices has stopped, and most goods are trending towards a stable state. Only refined steel ingots are very scarce in the market, and prices continue to rise. The wholesale price for large quantities is 10 million yuan per ton, and the wholesale price per market dan is also quoted at 550,000 yuan.

Another report: The market price of hardware products rose significantly last week, and yesterday the market situation also weakened slightly, with all goods remaining stagnant. According to observations by people in the industry: This surge was purely due to a restless state after a long period of quiet, caused by agitation in people's minds during times of confusing rumors. Therefore, most of the prices were just quoted, and actual sales were not strong. It is expected that prices will gradually decline again.

### Increased Arrivals and Price Drops; Rice Market Still Has No Normal Trading; Flour Slightly Down, Oil Market Temporarily Stabilized

Yesterday, the situation in the rice market had not improved. The north and south markets only had allocated prices and no trading prices among businesses. However, customers registering for goods were coming in an endless stream, and prices in the producing areas had also fallen slightly. Yesterday, the north and south markets received a total of 9,200 dan of rice. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to release 9,000 bags of white japonica and Saigon red indica rice at regular prices, and the market transaction was slack. The high price of japonica and indica rice was set, but then retreated by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and white yuan also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, similar to the risk yuan.

Flour transactions were cold and sluggish, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Bran, on the other hand, became popular for rural sales, rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were actively sought after by customers, and the market was thriving, rising slightly by 300 to 400 yuan. Yellow soybeans were sluggish in sales, and the market was flat and weak, showing a softening trend.

The Shantou market opened lower, and turned strong at the close, but the result was not much turbulence. Oil allocation continued as usual. Mung beans from Nanyang were still popular, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Red beans also turned to rise by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan, and broad beans rose again by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were stable after falling, sesame was in the downstream, corn was sluggish, and red sorghum was temporarily flat.

Investigating Rice Shops

In order to suppress rice prices, the authorities recently stipulated that rice shops must not sell rice above the specified price limit, and those who violate this will be severely punished. However, there are still some rice shops that dare to outwardly comply but inwardly defy, neither displaying price tags at the rice shop storefront nor selling at black market prices of 170,000 to 190,000 yuan, or mixing rice with other grains in an attempt to profit illegally. In view of this, the municipal authorities, in addition to hoping that citizens will assist in reporting at any time, yesterday specially dispatched commissioner Huang Jiaju, together with Wu Yimin from the Social Affairs Bureau, to go to various districts to conduct on-site investigations of rice shops to see if there were any illegal rice sales. The main points of the investigation are: (1) Whether the rice shop displays a price tag indicating the limited rice price, (2) Whether the retail rice is mixed with other grains, (3) Whether there are any discrepancies in the rice shop's transaction books. If it is found through investigation that there are indeed illegal acts, they will be punished according to law.

Siamese Rice Continues to Arrive

[This Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Xia ship arrived last Friday from Siam carrying more than 2,000 tons of rice, as previously reported. It is now learned that Jardine Matheson's Rong Sheng ship also arrived in Shanghai last Saturday, carrying 2,000 tons (20,000 bags) of Siamese rice, now docked at Huangpu Wharf for unloading.

### Restrictions on Shipping Cloth to the South; Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association Asks for Lifting of Ban

The provinces of Guangdong and Fujian have always felt a shortage of cloth, relying on the supply from this city. The provinces of Guangxi and the counties in eastern Guizhou also rely on Guangdong for transshipment. Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs restricted the shipment of cloth from this city to Guangdong and Fujian in September last year, the supply sources of these provinces have been cut off, and the supply and demand have become even more disconnected. In recent months, the market price of cloth has soared, which is quite alarming. The general price level has also been greatly affected, and people's livelihood is in extreme pain. The Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, in view of this, yesterday specially presented nine reasons to the authorities, appealing for the lifting of the ban, and telegraphed the relevant agencies and groups, asking for their support.

### Watching the Yellow River Return to Its Old Course: Can We Avoid Breaches in This Year's Flood Season?

—Jinan, 14th, Air Mail Report, Our Special Correspondent, Fan Lifu

Participating in the Yellow River Tour Group

Thanks to the initiation of Director Fan Qijun of the Sui District News Office, this reporter was able to join the spring tour group visiting the Yellow River after it returned to its old course. On the morning of the 14th, we set off from the News Office in a jeep, passed through the Tianqiao area, and drove out of the bustling city. Although we were met with a vast expanse of yellow sand from the north, what caught our eye along with the yellow sand was a stretch of new green: green mountains, green water, green locust trees, green willows, green wheat seedlings, and green fragrant grass, stretching endlessly as far as the eye could see. This was the first time in two months that this reporter, confined within the city of Jinan by the Communist forces, truly experienced the arrival of spring and breathed in the unique, fresh earthy aroma emanating from the fields after spring's arrival. I deeply felt the loveliness and greatness of our motherland.

We first lingered for an hour at the Wuliu Lock on the Xiaoqing River, about ten miles from Jinan, where the lanes were lined with weeping willows and the water was as clear as a mirror, reminiscent of the scenery of southern China. Then, we drove straight to Luokou. This is a small town on the banks of the Yellow River. To prevent flooding, the town is surrounded by neat and solid walls, and the north wall is built right next to the riverbank. Standing on the city wall, we saw the renowned Yellow River Iron Bridge, stretching over a thousand meters, lying horizontally to the east. To the west of the bridge, there was originally a wooden bridge built by the enemy and puppet regime after the Yellow River changed its course. This spring, when the Yellow River flowed eastward, it was demolished to avoid being washed away, and replaced with a ferry, so as to facilitate travelers. The ferry fare is 400 yuan per person, 800 yuan per handcart including person, and 18,000 yuan per three-horse carriage. To the east of the bridge, several steel-reinforced concrete piers were built during the enemy and puppet period. Originally, the enemy planned to build another cement bridge here to allow public transport vehicles to pass and to dismantle the existing iron bridge and move it elsewhere. However, the cement bridge was not completed before the Japanese surrendered, and it did not come to fruition. We all could not help but rejoice for this iron bridge that was to be removed but never got removed. If we wanted to rebuild this long bridge today, I don't know how much hardship the Railway Bureau would have to endure?

Snakes and Toads Become River Gods

The water of the Yellow River is much more turbid than that of the Yangtze River, and the current is also much more turbulent than that of the Yangtze River. According to the survey by the River Conservancy Bureau, the width of the river today is 649 meters, the flow rate is 0.81 meters per second, the flow is 127.51 cubic meters per second, and the water depth is 6 meters. Compared with three days ago, it has dropped by 7 decimeters. The peach flood, one of the four annual floods, can be safely passed! When this gratifying news spread, it suddenly increased the vitality of those watching the Yellow River. So we walked slowly eastward along the river embankment, which is also the city wall, and unknowingly came to the northeast corner of the city wall. Here, there is a gate on the side of the city wall, and there are stone steps leading directly to the riverbank. Hundreds of villagers are rushing to the river to fetch Yellow River water with bottles and jars. There is also a small temple next to the right corner of the wall gate, enshrining the "Golden Dragon God Great King" in the center, and the positions of Generals Zhang and Yang on both sides. The villagers first place the bottles of Yellow River water they have fetched in front of the shrine, then rotate the burning incense over the bottles containing Yellow River water, then insert the incense into the incense burner, kneel and worship, and then take back the bottles and jars. According to the villagers, this Yellow River water, after being boiled, can be swallowed into the stomach with the mud to cure all diseases. The Golden Dragon God Great King that is being worshipped is one of the Great Kings responsible for governing the river, and legend has it that the snakes in the Yellow River are his incarnations. As for the generals, there are also three, and the toads are his predecessors, assisting in governing the Yellow River, so villagers will worship and burn incense as if they were gods even if they find a very small snake or a large toad on the riverbank. They only pass on to each other that on the day the Yellow River changed its course eight years ago, the sky above Jinan was filled with red clouds and thunder rumbled for more than two hours, but there was no rain. Since then, the Yellow River has not come again! Eight years later, the Yellow River returned to its old course. They don't know that this is due to the Huayuankou damming, but only follow the old legends, regarding it as a divine event and believing that the returning river water can cure diseases. This ancient legend, which still lingers among the people along the Ganges River in India and the Nile River in Egypt, how could they understand that science has progressed to the atomic age of the 20th century? This truly represents the group of the absolute majority of the Chinese descendants.

Seven Changes of Course, the People Cannot Bear Their Fate

Opening up history, everyone knows that this great river is the birthplace of the brilliant and long-standing Chinese culture, and also the cradle of the Chinese nation. However, since historical records began, it has changed its course seven times and breached its banks 1,580 times, countless lives and properties have been lost, and the nation's vitality has been damaged. Therefore, what the Yellow River has left to the people of the country is only countless painful memories. The 1,580 breaches are too numerous to remember. Here, let's just list the seven changes of course!

First time: In the fifth year of King Ding of Zhou (602 BC), it breached at Liyang (now Junxian), and entered the Bohai Sea via Tianjin.

Second time: In the third year of Wang Mang's Shijian Kingdom (11 AD), it breached in Weijun, and entered the sea at Qiancheng.

Third time: In the eighth year of the Qingli reign of Emperor Renzong of Song (1048 AD), it breached at Shanghu, and entered the sea at Tianjin, forming the northern stream. In the eighth year of the Taiping Xingguo reign of Emperor Taizong, it breached at Huaizhou, and entered the Yangtze and Huai Rivers at Pengcheng, called the southern stream.

Fourth time: In the fifth year of the Shaoxi reign of Emperor Guangzong of the Southern Song Dynasty, that is, the fifth year of the Mingchang reign of Emperor Zhangzong of Jin (1194 AD), it breached at Yangwu, and the northern stream entered the sea through the Daqing River, and the southern stream entered the sea through the Nanqing River. Fifth time: In the fifth year of the Hongzhi reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Ming (1492), it breached at Jinlongkou, and diverted the Wen River into the sea.

Sixth time: In the fifth year of Xianfeng reign of Emperor Qing (1855), it breached at Tongwaxiang, and entered the sea along today's river course.

Seventh time: In June of the 27th year of the Republic of China, it breached at Huayuankou, Henan.

This last Huayuankou course change overflowed the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, causing the country to reduce its agricultural crop yield by more than 1.5 million tons per year, and displacing more than 6.1 million people. According to the conclusions jointly researched by Chinese and foreign water conservancy experts, the best plan is to dam the breach, restore the dikes, and guide the river back to its old course. Therefore, starting last spring, the damming project began, and it was finally completed on March 15 this year. The river dikes have also been tasked to the provincial River Conservancy Bureaus to be repaired in sections. The dike restoration project from Qhe to Jiyang within the territory of the National Army in Shandong Province has been completed in eight months, with more than 900,000 cubic meters of earthwork completed, the main dike raised 9 decimeters above the Hong Yong position, and more than 10,000 cubic meters of stone materials collected and transported. All the stones below the middle water level have been repaired. All the projects in this section have been completed by 80%. However, the current problem is that the river course in Shandong Province has been abandoned for eight years. After investigation, it was found that the north and south dikes in western Shandong and the downstream Huimin and Lijin areas under the control of the Communist Army have not been repaired, and the people's dikes taken over by the government have also not been repaired. The dikes are thin and unable to withstand floods. Although the peach flood has been safely passed due to the small water flow, the fall, autumn, and ice floods, especially the fall flood that will arrive in two or three months (that is, July), may cause huge disasters if the repairs are not done well. The dike section in western Shandong that has recently been recovered by the National Army is particularly urgent and needs to be repaired immediately. According to Engineer Chen Yungong of the River Conservancy Bureau, in the past, the Yellow River Conservancy had to gather the strength of the whole country to carry it out. In addition to the specialized river administration organs, river administration and water conservancy have become an important task for officials of all dynasties to govern the people. Even judging from the late Qing Dynasty or before the war, in terms of (1) flood organization, Shandong Province initially had 18 river defense camps with more than 1,600 employees dedicated to repairing and guarding the river. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, it was changed to 18 sections, with more than 1,300 employees. At that time, the total length of the official dike was 750 kilometers, and there was still a feeling that the employees were not enough. This year, the total number of flood soldiers approved for the Shandong section of the flood organization is 600, and there are 150 staff members. The people's dikes in western Shandong are also returned to government control. With 750 employees to repair and guard more than 900 kilometers of dikes, each 1.5 kilometer section of the dike only has one flood soldier. If there is a dangerous project, and you want to rush to cover it, how can you be flexible? (2) In terms of river defense materials: Before the war, trees were planted on both the north and south banks, stretching as far as the eye could see. Materials were taken locally, and there was no need to worry about shortages. If there was a need for wood materials 30 to 40 miles along the river, they could be collected at any time. In addition, the flood control funds were sufficient, totaling 540,000 yuan per year, plus more than 200,000 yuan for rescue assistance, totaling more than 700,000 yuan. According to the usual practice, materials were purchased in winter, and all the broken or incomplete weirs were repaired completely when the freeze thawed in the spring. The materials needed for flood control could also be obtained readily. Now, the trees along the river have been almost completely felled, and the wood materials are also extremely scarce and difficult to collect. Moreover, the flood control funds approved this year are only 1 billion yuan for the three provinces, and Shandong Province is less than 300 million yuan, so all kinds of materials cannot be stored in large quantities, and can only be purchased for 4% of the planned quantity. (3) Regarding defense: Before the war, due to the siltation of the riverbed over the years, the water level in each county along the river was often 5 to 6 feet higher than the ground outside the dike during large floods. Therefore, all officials and civilians concentrated their efforts to jointly protect the river. The county magistrates and commissioners of the counties along the river also personally led the people to patrol the dikes day and night. Today, however, the local order has not been restored, the government orders cannot be unified, the repairs cannot be unified, the protection cannot be coordinated, and strong men flee one after another. If there is a dangerous project, the difficulties are really unimaginable. (4) Regarding telecommunications equipment, transportation, and personnel: The key to flood control information is to be well-informed. Before the war, there were long-distance telephones along the river, and there were also radio stations. During each large flood, the water situation and engineering conditions could be transmitted to the entire river at any time. In terms of transportation, cars could travel smoothly along the dike, and there were many ships in the river. During the flood control period, hundreds of civilian ships could be concentrated. It was convenient for both the employees to travel back and forth and the materials to be transported. Now, the long-distance telephones and river ships have been completely destroyed, and radio stations have not been set up. Cars also cannot pass on the dikes. Comparing the present with the past, how can it be different?

Failure to Do One's Best, Breaches Are Inevitable

With the existence of the above-mentioned actual difficulties, if we do not catch up and try to remedy the situation quickly, then the large flood period that is approaching will not only be possible, but also absolutely expected. According to expert surveys, during the great flood in the 31st year of the Republic of China, the maximum flood flow in Shanzhou reached 28,000 cubic meters per second. After deducting the consumption along the way, the flow to Shandong was about 17,000 cubic meters per second, while the maximum water storage capacity of the Shandong river channel is only 8,000 cubic meters per second. If we still cannot do our best, it is really impossible to avoid the breaches during this year's flood season. If there is a breach in Liuzhuang, Dongzhuang, and other places where the Dang and Lu border, it can overflow the old Caozhou Prefecture area, and go down to Jiaxiang, Jining, Yutai, and other counties, and pass through the four lakes of Nanyang, Zhaoyang, Dushan, and Weishan, and divert the canal south, and enter the Bulao River through Lanjia Dam, and irrigate northern Jiangsu, causing a huge disaster, affecting the project of guiding the Huai River and regulating the canal. If there is a breach on the south bank of Qidong, it can overflow Qingcheng, Gaoyuan, Boyu, Guangrao, and other counties. If there is a breach on the north bank, it can overflow Jiyang, Huimin, Bin County, Zhanhua, Putai, Lijin, Wudi, and other counties.

The reasons for the Yellow River disasters in the past, except for the seventh course change which was due to the war of resistance to stop the Japanese army from advancing westward, were mostly due to misplanning by the people. Therefore, historians often regard the Yellow River as a symbol of China's governance. Some people also believe that the time when the Yellow River advances to having no floods forever, and turns harm into benefit, will be the day when China's great cause of nation-building is truly completed. A week ago, the Central Committee of the Communist Party telegraphed the Yellow River Committee that the National Army had destroyed the river dikes 40 miles below Youcheng (that is, Wang Hedui), which was refuted by the Yellow River Committee. According to military observers, this is very likely to be a scheme by the Communist Party to obstruct the advance of the National Army in western Shandong and to not hesitate to breach the dikes when necessary in order to shift the blame on others. Now that this is not the case, what the people of Shandong are hoping for from the government is, under the premise of putting the interests of the people first, to do the following: passively, to persuade the Communist Party not to use the Yellow River as any strategic or tactical tool; and to work together with the Communist Party to do the greatest effort to increase the funds for repairing and restoring the dikes, strengthen the river dike project, and stop the current crisis; actively, according to the plan drafted by Dr. Savage, Lieutenant General Shippers, and Mr. Groton, to treat the Yellow River fundamentally, forever eliminate future troubles, and make this cradle of the Chinese nation and the birthplace of Chinese culture no longer a "disaster water" but truly be able to continue to nurture and promote civilization for hundreds of millions of years to come.

### Private Smugglers Innocent, Security Team Members Sentenced to Hard Labor: A Regrettable Incident by the Hong Kong Government

— Guangzhou, 28th (Airmail Dispatch) - Special Correspondent Liang Feng of This Newspaper

Perhaps it's because Guangdong and Hong Kong are too close geographically and are governed by two different national governments, that unpleasant incidents seem to occur continuously, following the change of seasons. Is it that Chinese people deliberately create trouble? Or is it the Hong Kong government's contempt for us? We will set aside the rights and wrongs and the causal relationship for now. However, just as the Huang Shuixiang and Zhang Tianxiang bloodshed cases can勉强 be said to be in the past, and the indignation of our people has not yet completely subsided, the Hong Kong government has recently created another shocking incident of sheltering smugglers, detaining soldiers of our provincial government's security team, and sentencing them to imprisonment. This cannot but make us feel even more deeply regrettable!

The incident occurred on February 6th of this year. The Guangdong provincial authorities, having received reports of many smugglers specializing in illegally exporting grain, causing panic and soaring prices in the province, issued emergency measures, setting up a blockade line to prevent the clandestine export of grain. At that time, the 10th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Security Regiment under the jurisdiction of the provincial government was stationed in Shatoujiao, Bao'an County, responsible for anti-smuggling operations. As the area bordered Guangdong and Hong Kong, strict inspection was necessary. On February 6th, the team received a tip from an informant that smugglers were illegally transporting grain from the waters near Baishizhou. They immediately dispatched four soldiers, including Guo Xiangmin, in a small boat to intercept them. They indeed saw a boat coming from Baishizhou and ordered it to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the boat refused to stop and opened fire. A three-masted sailing ship (license number Macau 9326A) and two smaller boats assisted the vessel, firing a barrage of gunfire at Guo Xiangmin and his men, killing security team members Guo Xiangmin and Ye Qihuan on the spot. The remaining two men, Wu Guisheng, and others, along with all their firearms, were captured by the smugglers and handed over to the Pingshan Police Station in the British territory. They were later transferred to the Kowloon Magistracy for trial.

Request for Release Ignored

After the incident, the Guangdong provincial government immediately contacted the Hong Kong government through proper channels, requesting the release of the captured team members and the return of the confiscated firearms. However, the Hong Kong government ignored our request. Subsequently, on March 22nd, Hong Kong newspapers suddenly published a news item stating, "Two men, Wu Guisheng, and others, who claimed to be members of the security team, were convicted in the High Court yesterday morning and sentenced to four years of hard labor each. In court, they requested the judge to telephone Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, but the translator instructed them to apply to the prison warden themselves. The charges against the two defendants were three: (1) Using military weapons to attack others, intending to rob Huang Man and six others, and committing assault and robbery; (2) Intentionally damaging the bodies of others, committing the crime of attempted murder by shooting; (3) Illegally possessing a short gun, six bullets, a handgun, a light machine gun, a mortar, twenty-three rifle bullets, and a grenade, committing the crime of concealing military weapons." As for the six smugglers, including Huang Jin, who opened fire and killed Guo Xiangmin, and others, the chief prosecutor, Mr. Askew, originally charged them with "manslaughter" and "concealing military weapons." Later, the Hong Kong government's Attorney General believed that "since the charges against the security team have been established, legally speaking, the charge of manslaughter against the defendants cannot be established, as they are deemed to have opened fire in self-defense." Therefore, when the trial opened, they were only charged with illegally possessing five long guns, five fishing cannons, and one hundred and eighty-three bullets. Thus, even the so-called "manslaughter" charge was dropped!

Safeguarding National Rights, Upholding the Law

When this news arrived, the people of Guangzhou were extremely indignant. The provincial government also issued a statement, saying: "Our country's security team members were ordered to intercept smuggled ships in our national territorial waters. Their mission was legitimate and cannot be slandered. The smugglers dared to open fire to resist inspection, killing and capturing team members, disregarding the law, and seizing weapons, which is extremely hateful. In order to safeguard national rights and uphold the law, this government is now negotiating with the British through diplomatic channels to return the team members and weapons and extradite the three-masted fishing boat and all the smuggler criminals who resisted inspection, committed murder, and robbery to this province for investigation and prosecution according to law. It is believed that the British authorities will be able to distinguish right from wrong, consider national relations, and resolve the matter satisfactorily, so that the incident will not escalate and the friendship between Guangdong and Hong Kong can be maintained."

Dispatching Personnel to Hong Kong to Lodge Representations

Currently, negotiations on this incident are still underway. The Guangdong provincial government has formally sent a document to the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, lodging representations to the Governor of Hong Kong, and has dispatched representatives of the security team to Hong Kong to handle the matter specifically. Although there has been no result yet, we believe that the British people, who have always prided themselves on abiding by the law, will certainly not disregard human relations and legal principles and disrespect their ally in the war against a common enemy!

### News from Xuzhou

— Express Dispatch on the 16th - Special Correspondent Fang Canglang of This Newspaper

Ferocious, Steady, Stupid – Words of Subtle Insight

The mopping-up campaign in the Yimeng Mountain area has been launched smoothly under the steady and reliable command of Generals Gu Zhutong and Tang Enbo. According to captured Communist military political personnel, senior Communist military commanders once made the following one-word assessments of senior Nationalist military generals, such as assessing Chen Cheng as "Ferocious," Gu Zhutong as "Steady," Xue Yue as "Fierce," and Liu × as "Stupid." Although these assessments may not be entirely accurate, they contain subtle insights. For example, the repeated defeats of the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong have already demonstrated the "Fierceness" of Xue's army. The fact that the Nationalists recovered more than 180 counties occupied by the Communists north and south of the Yellow River in just over half a year demonstrates "Ferociousness". During the fierce battle on the outskirts of Xuzhou, tens of thousands of Communist troops suddenly switched sides. One can only imagine the "Ferociousness" of the Chief of Staff who lightly waves his feather fan. As for capturing Tai'an in an instant and besieging the desperate bandits in the remote mountains, one cannot help but admire the "Steadiness" of Commander-in-Chief Gu, who is as steady as Mount Tai, and force them to hastily produce white flags.

Sun Tzu's Era - Mountain Warfare

After the mountain warfare began, this war has regressed from the atomic age to the era of Sun Tzu. This is the saying of a famous general stationed in Southern Anhui. The Communists, who have now retreated to the Yimeng Mountain area, only think about preserving their strength to prolong their lives and dare not defend dangerous positions to the death. Large-scale offensive and defensive battles will not occur in the Yimeng Mountain area. Both sides are using Sun Tzu's Art of War to seek victory. Examining the mountains of Shandong, the mountains in the triangular area of ​​central and southern Shandong are collectively called the Taiyi Mountains (ie, Mount Tai and Mount Yi). Mount Tai is located northeast of Tai'an County, and its main peak reaches 1,545 meters. Mount Yi is located northwest of Yishui County in southern Shandong and is only 990 meters high. Other famous mountains in Shandong, such as Mount Meng near Mengyin and Mount Yi and Mount Ni, are all under 700 meters in height. These mountainous areas have mineral resources such as coal, iron, and glass, as well as forests, but agricultural products are very scarce, making them unsuitable for long-term defense. Judging from the current situation, after the successful Nationalist search and suppression campaign in Mount Meng, the clearing of bandits from the mountains of Taiyi will not take too long. Although there is a saying in the Chinese bandit suppression proverb that "bandits in the mountains are easy to eliminate, but bandits in the heart are difficult to remove," under the wise decision of the Nationalist senior commanders to "attack the heart first," it is believed that after the people in the mountains have exhausted their millet porridge, they will definitely come out to change their taste and assist the Nationalists to shorten this annoying war.

Tai'an and Yan'an - National Prosperity and People's Peace

A week ago, when Tai'an and Yan'an were successively recovered by the Nationalist army, successive victories were reported from the front line, and sweet rain fell everywhere in the rear. Peace could be expected, and a wheat harvest was hoped for. The joy of the people in the recovered areas cannot be described in words. In the countryside of the recovered areas of North China, the people have suffered greatly from the trampling of the Communist army. When they see the Nationalist army, they often automatically offer food and tea to comfort the troops. When the Nationalist army rewarded them with legal tender or other food, the women often shed tears and told of their past suffering and the crimes of the Communist army, crying and saying: "I would rather have the Central Government eat it all than have the Eighth Route Army call me 'Auntie'." Sweet words and honeyed words are the specialty of the Communist political commissars. When they visit a civilian's home and see men and women of advanced age, they address them respectfully as "Uncle" and "Auntie" (this is the customary term in Xuzhou and Shandong for uncle and aunt). If their demands are not met, their ferocious faces are immediately revealed. Therefore, when the people of Xuzhou and Shandong hear a stranger call them "Uncle" or "Auntie," their hair immediately stands on end. It is also heard that after the news of the successive recoveries of Tai'an and Yan'an spread to North China, the people in the recovered areas excitedly told each other: The Central Government has recovered Tai'an and Yan'an. From now on, the war can be shortened, and national prosperity and people's peace can be expected. It can be seen that the people in the war zone eagerly hope for peace, and everyone hates war and prays for peace, and the war can be shortened. After the recovery of Tai'an, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was concerned about the refugees in the war zone, who have suffered from displacement and separation due to the disruption of transportation by the Communist army in recent years. In addition to ordering the relevant authorities to rush to provide emergency relief to the recovered areas, he also issued a hand-written order to the Ministry of Transportation to quickly repair the railroad north of Lincheng on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, so that displaced refugees can return to their homes and engage in production this summer. It is heard that the person in charge of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Engineering Office is working day and night to rush the repairs and expects to reach Tengxian by the middle of this month. If the materials needed for road construction can be continuously transported, it can reach Yanzhou by the end of May, restoring railway transportation on the Xuzhou-Yanzhou section. It is also heard that the Ministry of Transportation is making every effort to concentrate road construction equipment to carry out the restoration project of the entire Tianjin-Pukou Line. If there are no unexpected difficulties, the railway traffic between Pukou and Jinan may be repaired by the end of September this year. With the restoration of traffic in Pukou and Jinan, the opening of the entire Tianjin-Pukou Line can be expected soon. According to careful estimates, by the end of this year, it will not be extravagant to take a train directly from Nanjing to Peiping to spend the New Year. Under the unanimous national belief of "Military First, Transportation First," this is indeed good news.

Seductive Songs, Making People Forget Their Worries

With the changes in the war situation north and south of the Yellow River, Xuzhou has a new atmosphere. This month, the gentle breeze arrives, and the sweet rain falls. The tigers cross the river, and the wolves enter the mountains. Those who kill are killed (a military officer, Guo Yuzhou, was executed for committing murder for money), and those who smuggle are arrested (the Lu headquarters rectified military discipline and listed this as a prohibited item). Public security must be ensured, the roads must be renovated, and food is not allowed to be exported (food prices have recently fluctuated slightly). Jazz music can relieve sorrows (Pengcheng has three dance halls. In the evening, shadows of dancers flutter, and seductive songs make people forget their worries). Overall, it is not bad for the so-called military city of Xuzhou to have such a phenomenon.

Spring and Autumn

### Random Notes on Reading Poetry

— Zhu Wen

The poems written by predecessors to praise spring are all mediocre and lack novelty. When I read Su Pingzhong's line, "A clear stream encircles the fish market, a thin horse seeks fragrance, trampling on swallow's mud," and Wang Anshi's line, "Ancient plains, cattle nibble on new grass, small courtyards, bees flirt with newly opened flowers," I feel that they are delicate and not vulgar, all of which are things that people have not yet talked about.

Matters of the nether world are generally not discussed, as they are not easily rendered in a fitting manner. There is the poem by Jiong Zhang, "A graceful ghost woman walks at night, a black lantern illuminates her pair of shoe prints, the moss on her face is unclear, still carrying the peach color of her former life." Writing about seeing a monster in the wilderness makes people's hair stand on end. As for Tang Weiyuan's poem on the coffin of a deceased girl, "In broad daylight, she fears people and clings to the old mound, at dusk, she seeks companions and howls in the lonely village," then Xiao Hui not only has an otherworldly beauty but also the emotions of a young girl, vividly displayed on paper.

Writing scenery is easy, writing emotions is difficult. The poems and lyrics of mourning the dead that can move people in ancient and modern times are rare. Nalan Rongruo wrote the most lyrics mourning the dead, but except for "When will this hatred end? Dripping empty steps, cold nights cease. The weather for burying flowers. Three years, the soul dreams are distant, should the dream be long awake!" the rest did not have many moving places. Shen Deqian's Qixi 感事 has the couplet: "Only living separation, no death, after all, heaven is better than the human world." Although it does not directly sing of mourning the dead, the sad emotion of mourning the dead is fully revealed on paper; to say that there is no poem in Shen's collection that surpasses these two lines is probably not false.

Su Shi's "Shuangxi Collection" was seen in the Yueya Hall Series. The poems published are mostly ancient and lyrical, deliberately using allusions, with little to be taken. However, in the first rhyme of Hong Liuzhang's resident Su Huang Horse Ticket, the opening sentence is: "A long cry from the heavenly stables rises like a hairy dragon, ten thousand horses are all dark, suddenly one is in the middle." It feels majestic and powerful.

Lian Wenfeng's poems are generally clear and beautiful, expressing the spirit of nature, without the trivial habits of the poets of the late Song Dynasty. His self-deprecating couplet says: "In the idle door, there are few things, and I know that poverty is good; in adversity, there is much sorrow, and I hate that death is late." The artistic conception is extraordinary and does not fall into the usual path.

In Bai Zhengji's collection, the paired lines often use stacked words, such as "Walking on the lake in spring": "Good flowers are similar every year, but white clouds and stars are no longer mysterious." Sending a friend back to Yue: "The wild geese go away quickly in the autumn wind, the startled magpies perch in the lonely night moon." Autumn thoughts in response to Qiu Renjin's sending: "The reeds are withering in the autumn sickness, the family mountain is in the dream, the road is winding." Presented to Zhao Servant: "The white colt is bright and clear in the empty valley, the autumn water is beautiful and bright in itself." Diaotai says: "The stones are adjacent to each other in the late years, a thread of floating interest in empty fame," and so on.

The farmer Lu Dian's "Piya" is a popular book, but his name as a poet is not obvious, probably because not much of his work has been handed down. Fang Hui's Yingkui Lvsui said that Dian and Hu Su's poetic styles are similar, but Su's poems have been handed down a little more, while Dian's poems are not generally seen. Now, according to the "Taoshan Collection," there are still more than two hundred poems, mostly seven-character recent style, and those in the second rhyme account for seven or eight out of ten.

Lu Dian has eight poems mourning the dead, the concluding sentence of the second poem: "The beauty has gone to immortality without news, the intestines are broken by the spring breeze, a courtyard of flowers." The concluding sentence of the eighth poem: "Wandering in the cold evening, the sleeves are thin, the fallen flowers at the door, the yellow dusk of the moon." I think they are the most touching.

Lu Zhongyu's "Yan Qinglu": Lu Shan's claw injured Yang Guifei's breast, so Jin Cizi covered it up; Jin Kezi is also named Ke Lizhi. When I was seventeen years old, I filled in Taoyuan Yi Fang Ren Yong Yu, the first half of which said: "Huacheng first stopped in the silver screen, messy sideburns fell askew, Cui sleeves and cicada shirt faded, vaguely Ke Lizhi lived." That is, using this matter. But when I first learned to fill in the lyrics, the rules were mostly inaccurate, and the meaning was so frivolous, it was ridiculous.

Chen Yuyi's sentence, "The guest gives me time in two volumes, the news of apricot blossoms in the sound of rain" was appreciated by Gaozong, and he was gradually promoted to executive; among the poets who crossed the south, he was the most prominent and far-reaching. Gao Di's rich words: "Small and big, separated by flowers, empty barking shadows, who comes to the palace in the deep night?" The two words caused disaster and led to death. It was not the clumsiness of poetry, but the different bearing of the emperor. Liu Jingxiu's poem: "If you use words to discuss the mind, I am afraid that there will be endless people who will suffer injustice," is the word of a true elder.

Jianzhai's five-character律诗, with rain as the theme, are the most numerous, and the poems with the theme of rain are the best. "For a while, the flowers are tearful, and thousands of miles of guests lean on the railing." "Ancient swamps give birth to spring waves, and high skies fall in the evening" are all extremely beautiful couplets. Even in ordinary lines of poetry, he often likes to use the word rain, such as "Rain passes, there are no peaches and plums" in "Tu Mi", "A sparse curtain of rain" in "Huai Shu in the Test Court", "Fine rain wets the green forest" on the shore, "Rain stops and comes quickly" on the road, "After the rain, the mountain wants to be near" in the evening walk, and so on are innumerable.

Shanjingju's poetic words record: Doucun Old Man made a living from poetry all his life, he must write every day, and he must save the draft, he did not stop chanting when he was over eighty years old. He also cherished it very much, and the work he made was hung on the roof beams, and he would not easily show it to close friends. He can be said to be addicted to poetry. Among the beautiful sentences recorded, I love the couplet the most: "Buying flowers does not count how much money, keeping guests, I forget that there is rice." And "The bottle flower is fine, bothering the bees to explore, the neighboring bamboo is affectionate, and the bamboo shoots come." The charm is as beautiful and light as this!

Qufang Chen Yuyi has a 萨蛮咏荷花云: "Nixuan faces the lotus root port, it is suitable for wind, moon and rain." Wu Song Huangtangtang's poem Yong Yanghua said: "It is not suitable for the wind, but suitable for the rain. When the time comes, I will see the falling time." A poem and a poem, both use wind and rain to write, proper and natural, and each reaches a wonderful realm.

Although Chen Mei's Yuanli's poems have never been famous, his poetic theories are mostly reasonable. His words are: "Poetry takes warmth and restraint as its body, and takes elegance and boldness as its use. Think deeply and adjust brightly. The grand poem does not fall into vulgarity, and the quiet poem does not fall into dullness. Magnificent sentences should be whole, not grouped; gentle sentences should be detailed, not clever. First, look at the meaning, second, look at the style, third, look at the sentence tone, and fourth, look at the charm; if all four are complete, it is a complete poem. Among the four, the meaning and charm are the main ones. One

Zeng Furen and Zhao Shiwu discussed poetry and books and said: "The younger brother once said that ancient poetry is more difficult than律诗, and five-character律诗 is more difficult than seven-character律诗. Du Shi's seven-character律诗 is all wonderful, but as for five-character律诗, the plain and ancient are half. Only Wang Meng's five-character律诗 is better than seven-character律诗, and it is almost a gift from heaven. For example, when Tao Ling was a great master of five-character律诗, there was no form of seven-character律诗; even if there was, and Tao made it, it may not be inferior to five-character律诗. It should not be said that five-character律诗 is easier." The argument is fair, and it is not possible to say this to those who have achievements in poetry.

Zhu Xiaoting's poem mourning Zhaoto Huang said: "The fragrant grass by the road, the flowers in the road, picking it like looking at the autumn is far away, and the sorrowful desires to recruit, and I don't know who the clouds and rain are scattered to? After Sanlu died, it belonged to Qinglian, and the fame of Zizhi was also passed on. Since ancient times, talented people have been lustful, and talented people have never been immortals." Gai Tao Huang traveled to Chaling in his later years, and he was quite fond of him, and he died in his house; Xiaoting's poem is also satirizing him. Zou Yuan, a talented woman from Liangxi, has a posthumous collection "Yinan 小 唫" which is popular in the world. His poetry is far away, and he does not admire luxury. I especially love her rhythm on Jiao Mountain Peak: "The snails gradually go up the blue cloud ladder, the lush trees are lost on the temple path, the ancient crossing is far away, and Guabu is dim, the dangerous pole is horizontal and the sea gate is low; the clogs stick to the stone steps, the green moss is slippery, the sticks hang with smoke and thunder, and the green is wet. I want to ask Huayang Zhen's anecdotes, and Jiangyang embraces the setting sun again."

In April of the year of Bingzi, my brother Qin Changjin and I traveled to Slender West Lake in Yangzhou, and on the way back, we got the sentence "The setting sun is red over the Wuting Bridge," which I thought had the same artistic conception as Hong Beijiang's first work in West Lake, "The setting sun is red through the purple gauze."

I stayed at Bie Feng'an in Jiaoshan Town, Zhenjiang, and suddenly remembered Beijiang's poetic line: "Hawks and otters occupy the east and west ridges, waves and people compete for boats coming and going." Hawks and otters have no longer inhabited the four mountains, and the heavy rains are still surging with waves and people competing.

Since the death of Chun Dong, I have been afraid to read the poems of 陟岵 莪. Continuing Liu Xiang's explanation of Gao Yu's words in Shuoyuan, I have also sighed several times. Recently, I read the Song Lin Zizhen's poems of filial piety recorded in "Banjinglou Shihua," such as Yong Fan Pangyun: "I would rather block the disaster with my body than bear the separation of my mother. I will not do evil, and I have a word in the Yellow Spring now." Although the poem is not well-written, it is from the bottom of my heart, and I have shed tears.

According to the common custom, on the night of the Qixi Festival, ladies compete to mash balsam and dye their nails, which is said to be an elegant thing. Poets also often use dyed nails in poetry. Recently, I saw Jing An's poem: "Golden plate mixes dew and mashes the sunny clouds, and the red penetrates the slender jade shoots. Cui sleeves cage the fragrance and play the distant zither, and the green shade newly blooms with crabapple flowers." Zhu Shi actually stole from Yang Tieya's poem: "Night mash of the golden Phoenix pistil of the golden Phoenix, ten fingers are all replaced with red crow's beak, leisurely playing a piece of Yaqin, a few points of peach blossoms float on the flowing water." Xing Cijing's poem says: "Fingers are like jade shoots, and the inside is like silver. It is really enviable to skillfully dye them bright red. Playing the Yaoqin in the window, the colored strings are scattered with peach blossom petals." According to the two families, both of them are Minxiu, Zhu has "Ziyi Collection," and Xing has "Zhilan Bao Collection," each with a reputation for poetry. When I was seventeen years old, I learned to play the Magpie Bridge Immortal to dye nails: "Musk sprays golden ducks, and smoke adds orchid flames. The golden Phoenix flies into the deep steps. Lingbo steps towards the small courtyard, and then lightly puts the soft shoots to try to connect.

Just leaned on the vermilion railing, and silver zither was tuned again, and pieces of peach blossoms fell. How many times I think of entrusting my fragrant cheeks, I still suspect that it is the blush of beauty." The intention seems to be based on the two families, but the writing is superficial and unworthy of mention.

### Poets and Flowers

— Yun Yi

Flowers are too closely related to our lives. We cannot imagine what we would feel if flowers disappeared from this universe. Our lives are decorated, beautified, and enlivened by the beautiful flowers around us, yet we often fail to notice their influence. Only poets sense their divine power and gladly write about them.

Among poets, Keats and Tennyson were particularly interested in flowers. They used flowers to enhance the vividness and realism of their descriptions and to express their emotions and reflections. However, after reading the poems of Keats and Tennyson, we find that although both loved flowers, the impact of the beauty of flowers on them was different.

Keats loved the sensory beauty of flowers. When he saw a beautiful flower, he suddenly felt delighted:

"O Wells! Roses come into view,
My senses are captivated by their fragrance."

He was a worshipper of abstract beauty. He believed that "truth" resided in "beauty," so when he saw a beautiful flower, he also saw the truth within it:

"They have words of murmuring complaints, truth, and deep friendship."

As for Tennyson, flowers often made him think of something else. Therefore, rather than saying he was appreciating beauty, it would be more accurate to say he was interpreting beauty:

"I plucked a daisy and brought it to you,
It will tell you what I have seen in England."

He thought of the arrival of spring when he saw snowdrops:

"Coming in the cold, herald of the happy season, prophet of May."

He believed that someone had walked by when he saw daisies turn red:

"I know the path she took home with a bouquet,
Because her feet brushed the grass, turning the daisies crimson."

In any case, both poets had the same enthusiasm for flowers. Keats wrote:

"Sniffing new passions on the flowers,
Telling him that in a world of happiness, I have you."

Tennyson, on the other hand, seemed to have an even more intense passion for flowers:

"Can I not have, can I not have a flower?
If nature does not care about
The blooming of flowers,
Who can live for a moment?
I must see flowers before I die!"

Having understood the impact of flowers on Keats and Tennyson and the reactions they elicited, we might as well take a look at how these two poets used flowers.

Keats talked about the sensory beauty of flowers more than Tennyson. He believed that any place became beautiful with flowers:

"The mountains are beautiful, look, the primroses are out."

Even just looking at flowers made him incredibly happy. The greatest joy in his life was the growth of flowers:

"What is so lovely as the little bee,
Pausing on a blooming flower?"

When he was exuberant, he liked to be with flowers:

"When my blood is feverish, I love to rest my head in the fragrance of roses."

"I fainted on a bed of flowers, intoxicated for three days."

He became happy in places with flowers:

"Our feet become gentle in the flowers.
The newest happiness is hidden in those mountains.
Sometimes
A scent of lilac, a cluster of blooming flowers,
Floats around us, and beehives,
Become fragrant because of the white flowers."

Look how moved he was when he saw the beautiful opium poppy.

"A breeze slips through the dancing opium poppies,
Caressing my soul and creating before my eyes
A hallucination of color,"

On the other hand, Tennyson had a special feeling for the beauty of flowers. Beauty only stirred his inner feelings, not the external ones:

"The soul of the rose enters my blood,"

"The scent of lilac, hidden in the grass,
Pours into my empty soul and body."

"Is everything as clear and white as my flower?"

Another characteristic of Tennyson is that he humanized flowers, for example:

"The flowers, in sweet pain,
Raise their eyes above the water bubbles,
Like our Queen."

If we know that Tennyson was a student of Keats, then it is not surprising that they both had similar interests in flowers. The beauty of flowers made Keats think of "beauty is truth, truth is beauty"; but it made Tennyson think of his lover, his hometown, and his happy youth. The former had a passionate enthusiasm for beauty; the latter had a reflective contemplation of beauty. Obviously, Tennyson was more practical than Keats. From this point of view, the impact of the beauty of the flowers was different for the two poets.

Another noteworthy point is that these two poets had different attitudes towards different flowers. The flowers they both loved were roses, lilies, lilacs, daisies, and primroses. The symbols of these flowers are: roses symbolize love and happiness; lilies symbolize purity; lilacs symbolize tranquility; daisies and primroses symbolize lightness. They believed that roses were the most precious of all flowers because roses are the symbol of love.

Studying Keats's and Tennyson's interest in and handling of flowers is, in my opinion, not without value. They both deeply loved flowers and could be said to be happy upon seeing them; however, their perceptions of flowers differed slightly. This, I think, must be due to different personality types. Keats was a purely Romantic individual, while Tennyson was from the Victorian era; therefore, they naturally looked at flowers with different eyes.

Their love of flowers gave their poems beautiful outlines, and when reading their poems, we learn to love and appreciate flowers with new eyes. (Translated from "British Digest" Issue 1)

### Landscape

— Signac

Signac (Paul Signac, 1862) was also a founder of Neo-Impressionism (i.e., Pointillism). His style was even bolder than Seurat's, and he was not as restrained by formal beauty or concerned with the uniformity of brushstrokes as Seurat was. His brushwork, composition, and colors were simpler and more uninhibited. He rarely overlapped brushstrokes, preferring to leave gaps (the original color of the canvas) between them, giving the impression of a "mosaic" on a medieval church wall. His landscapes had a distinct oriental flavor. He had a great influence on later generations, such as the Post-Impressionist Gauguin, who were inspired by him. This landscape can be considered a representative work. (Lion)

### On Wang Ge YI

— Shi Chongpeng

Recalling twenty years ago, in the realm of calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy, one figure stood tall, admired and collected by connoisseurs as a precious treasure, revered as a model by scholars – Wu Changshuo of Anji. Changshuo's calligraphy and painting benefited from his expertise in epigraphy, while his epigraphy, in turn, was enhanced by his calligraphy and painting. Through fusion and transformation, he achieved a grand and expansive style. Ni Yunlin once praised Wang Huanghe, saying: "Shuming's brushstrokes can lift a tripod; there has been no such talent in five hundred years." With Changshuo's spirit, he could more than easily lift a tripod, truly unmatched in the three hundred years of the late Qing dynasty.

At the time, scholars across the country were captivated by Changshuo's fame, believing that bold strokes and vibrant colors were all it took to grasp Changshuo's essence. Thus, they mixed pigments and applied colors, vying to imitate him, creating a surge of activity that flourished for a time. This led to a negative impression of Changshuo's paintings, dismissed as the Shanghai School, ultimately detracting from Changshuo's reputation. Changshuo himself was distressed by the blind imitation of scholars. However, there were indeed those who studied Changshuo and captured his spirit, such as Chen Shizeng in the north and Wang Ge YI in the south. (Qi Baishi also rose to prominence by studying Changshuo, but he was rather reluctant to admit it.)

Shizeng possessed excellent talent and learning, but unfortunately passed away before the age of fifty. As for Ge YI, he had a strong memory and diligently studied, deeply rooted in the tradition, earning him the reputation of being Changshuo's most accomplished disciple. He excelled in poetry, prose, epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. His calligraphy and painting were grounded in his poetry, prose, and epigraphy, resulting in a style that was profound and unadorned, infused with elegance and scholarly refinement within a bold and vigorous framework, extremely rich in simplicity and breadth. His prose drew inspiration from the "Records of the Grand Historian" and the "Book of Han," while also drawing from the styles of Han Yu and Ouyang Xiu. His poetry encompassed the styles of Li Bai, Du Fu, Su Shi, and Huang Tingjian, truly a versatile talent in the contemporary art world.

Ge YI also had a penchant for collecting, especially works by the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, Zhao Zhiqian, and Ren Bonian. Changshuo's style, in fact, evolved from Zhao and Ren, tracing back to the source. Ge YI's love for Zhao and Ren was akin to studying Wang Meng while tracing back to Dong Qichang. Over the past twenty years, Ge YI has diligently adhered to this path, focusing wholeheartedly, becoming more diligent over time, and the more diligent he became, the greater his success. Ge, seeing the recent trend in the art world to gradually neglect Changshuo's school and emphasize the Song style, felt a responsibility to promote and carry forward its brilliance. Therefore, starting on April 23rd, he held a week-long exhibition of his works at the Ningbo Association, allowing the public to witness firsthand the wonders of Chinese calligraphy and painting art – to the most refined and subtle, and also to the most extensive and encompassing. In recent years, despite the various Southern Wang and Northern Li, Xu and Huang, different styles, complex systems, and diverse schools, the spirit remains consistent, with a unified essence. Brushstrokes and artistic conception, though different paths, converge on the same goal, expressing emotions and depicting scenes, all sufficient to demonstrate the unique style of our nation. This exhibition will also allow the world to know that Changshuo's school has a long history, with its bold, vigorous, profound style, inherently worthy of being passed down.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 403

— Ye Jingfeng

"Ha, you need to think about the kind of education you've received since you were a child, the kind of influence you've been exposed to—"knowing only yourself," "hubris born of ignorance"; and besides, it's just "obedience"; those who aren't in "our" group are supposedly not supposed to exist; not "obeying" is equal to committing a crime?..." Shouyi was being so blunt, pointing out Tsurumi's misguided prejudices.

Tsurumi put his hands behind his back and walked back and forth in the room twice, then suddenly stopped and looked at Shouyi; "Big brother, what you say is absolutely correct, it's strange that I never had this logic before? I always wished to gather all the talents under one command, to proceed together—of course, I don't necessarily have to be the commander—..."

"Wait a minute?" Shouyi interrupted Tsurumi, "You have to understand that this method, if done wrong, has extreme danger—..."

"I understand!" Tsurumi didn't let Shouyi elaborate. "Under a common big goal, each group is free to act. When necessary, as long as the opinions are consistent, one notice, everyone joins forces and advances together, heading towards the same point... right?"

"But, where is the danger?" Shouyi questioned Tsurumi.

"Of course, it's fearing that small groups will 'stick to old ways,' expressing uniqueness, competing with each other, making opinions, fighting for rights, etc., etc.…"

"No!" Shouyi waved his hand, stopping Tsurumi, "The problems you mentioned are beyond the scope of 'comrades dividing labor and cooperating,' of course, they are also correct. What I mean is that any group qualified to be a liaison shouldn't have these problems. As for the 'danger' I mentioned, it's technical: for example, today, if not for the convenience of technical equipment, I would probably have already gone to Nanjing. The matter there is also very urgent. Now, from consulting various reports, I know that the urgency and importance here are no less than Nanjing, and solving it here is equivalent to solving the problem in Nanjing, so everyone in our village who was preparing to participate in the Nanjing action has stopped proceeding, waiting for my message..."

"So you were willing to rush here so early?" Tsurumi's expression had a bit of a sour tinge.

"It was also to meet you, ever since Zhengyan mentioned your various actions." Shouyi expressed his sincerity; using this natural alkaline sincerity, he neutralized the inexplicable sourness in Tsurumi.

These two young men talked with passion and enthusiasm, almost forgetting the urgent topic at hand. However, without this passionate conversation, who knows how many years and months it would take to connect with each other again, going in all directions.

"I have a curious question I'd like to ask you," Tsurumi still didn't want to mention the current urgent issue.

"What question?"

"Wait," Tsurumi thought of something else again; "Let me first explain the 'technical' problem you just mentioned."

"Very good."

"The most important thing in liaison technology is, of course, well-informed news. With well-informed news, all barriers can be eliminated, and misunderstandings can be eradicated. At the same time, if there is a request from each other, there is no need for a medium to convey it, it can be directly transmitted..."

"This is a very good way." Shouyi paid attention to Tsurumi's following words.

### Art and Literary Circles

— Yong

The "Path to Happiness," originally written by Russell and translated by Fu Lei, published previously by the South China Publishing House, has been well-received in the book world. The first edition of two thousand copies sold out in less than a month. Now, a new collection of essays by Tang Tao, "Short and Long Letters," has been published, containing more than thirty of his recent works. Some criticize current abuses and satirize customs, while others examine historical facts and discuss literary affairs. All are profound, broad, and relevant to the times. Those who love to read essays should have a copy on hand.

The Cultural Life Publishing House has released three titles: Ba Jin's translation of Herzen's "A Family Drama," Ba Jin's translation of Liao Kangfu's "The Night Is Not Over," and Jinghua Shang Peiqiu's translation of Gaidar's "The Distant Land."

The New Music, Volume 6, Issue 5 has been published, containing Li Ling's article "One Two Are Good" dance music, and papers by Tan Sen and others.

The Hong Kong Chinese Music Academy opened on April 1st, with sixty-two students, originally divided into three groups. Now, Ma Sicong has been invited to teach violin, adding a violin group of ten students. There are common courses every night. It is now planned to use daytime hours to add ten students to a junior class, with common courses such as Mandarin, English, and general knowledge. Graduation is in eight years. The age for admission is limited to under ten years old.

The Hong Kong branch of the New Music Society has recently expanded and strengthened its work, establishing an external communication group to regularly contact various regions. The Hong Kong edition of New Music, Volume 2, Issue 2, has also been published.

The Hong Kong Music Academy has recently compiled and printed ten series of books. "Melody and Harmony" (Zhao Feng Tan), "Principles of Harmony" (Zhao Feng translated), "Vocal Knowledge" (Li Ling translated) have been published. In print are "Melody and Harmony" Collection 2 (Zhao Feng translated), "Self-Study Harmony" (Li Ling translated), "Fifty Musicians" (Wei Min Tan), "Orchestral Knowledge" (Wen Gang compilation), etc. Direct subscriptions can be made to the Hong Kong branch at 69 Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong.

Due to high printing costs, the text portion of the Shanghai edition of "Music Art" has been transferred to the Hong Kong branch for publication, renamed "Yinyi Waizhuan," and also includes sheet music. The 32nd supplementary collection includes Ma Sicong's "Dance of the Frontier," with each volume priced at 2,000 yuan.

On April 5th, the Hong Kong music community held a grand concert, with eleven groups participating, among which Hong Hong and Zhongyuan were the most popular. Hong Hong is currently practicing Ma Sicong's Democratic Chorus, while Zhongyuan plans to perform "The Yellow River."

The city's Party Committee Propaganda Group will go to Xixi on the 20th to perform "Top Secret No. 1."

There are many literary writers in Hangzhou, such as Mo Luo, Ge Mu, Xu Zhuang, Xie Yue, Lin Mian, Min Zi, and Xu Tianhong. Xu Zhuang and Xie Yue both work at the Southeast Daily, while Lin Mian, Min Zi, and Xu Tianhong all work at the Zhejiang Daily. The Southeast Daily's supplement "Pen Fortress" is edited by Xie Yue. The Zhejiang Daily's supplement "Zhejiang Women" is edited by Mo Luo's wife, Lin Mian, and "Jiang Feng" is edited by Min Zi, whose original name was Min Yuru.

### National Essence and Foreign Exchange

— Chang Chu

A certain newspaper reported that some antique magnates are collecting historical relics from China's millennia of history in Beijing and Shanghai, transporting them to the United States for sale in order to obtain US dollar foreign exchange. It also said that people in the city who care about cultural relics have contacted the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee and the Customs to find ways to prevent important Chinese cultural relics from falling into foreign hands. After reading this news, several friends couldn't help but shake their heads and sigh. But one person said:

"Chu has its own gains. Now it's one family under heaven. What the people of the world lose, the people of the world gain. What's there to regret?"

Another person said:

"This is ultimately our national essence, the legacy passed down from our ancestors for thousands of years. How can we sell it to foreigners?"

"The selling of national essence isn't something that just happened today, nor is it just one person doing it. Don't you know that even humor masters are selling it?"

"Humor masters are only promoting national essence, not selling it. Promotion only ends when the talent of Jiang Yan is exhausted and he switches to machine manufacturing. Selling, on the other hand, ends when one is bankrupt and has nothing left to sell."

"I desire national essence, and I also desire foreign exchange. If I can't have both, I will abandon national essence and take foreign exchange."

"You are truly a profit-seeking creature!" A lady opened her mouth to scold.

"Without foreign exchange, how can you have American lipstick and perfume, how can you have RCA portable radios running around Hangzhou in the spring?"

"Speaking of Hangzhou, really, if you didn't have that radio to listen to at any time, you'd be bored to death?"

"I remember what bothered you the most was when you were looking at antiques in the museum."

"Antiques naturally cannot compare to mountains and rivers."

"How can antiques compare to foreign exchange?"

"Foreigners want antiques, we want foreign exchange. Exchanging something for nothing, everyone is happy. Isn't that a great thing?"

Arriving here, another gentleman read the newspaper. He said that Huo Baoshu, Director of the Administrative Headquarters, returned from inspecting the Yellow River flood area. He said that the area was barren for thousands of miles, with no sign of human habitation, and the yellow sand was several feet deep, almost turning into a new desert. He said:

"If you ask the old people who have flowed out of that area, whether we want national essence or foreign exchange, that would be the real answer!"

Is that so? The people present started arguing noisily again.

### China—A Mystery of the World?

— Bu Shu

Excerpt from a news report:

(New York, Central News Agency, 1st) The associate editor of the Kansas Star returned from the East. He recently broadcasted a special essay on China. He said at the beginning: "China is still the world's greatest mystery. There are extremely conflicting forces working together in China. The apparent chaos and crisis of collapse are all confusing."

In fact, this is just a rehash of old ideas. A long time ago, a foreign writer, after discovering the mystery of China, went back and told others: China encompasses everything, from unicycles, rickshaws, sedan chairs, horse-drawn carriages, automobiles, to trains. His meaning, of course, was not just limited to vehicles. China has both a new side and a backward side to anything. Therefore, there are modern girls in nylon high heels, and there are also their mothers with three-inch golden lotuses. There are ground-breaking ceremonies presided over by young ladies and young mistresses, and there are also the Miao people's cannibalistic rituals. There is the latest translated "World War of the End of the World" by Leonard Engel, and there is also Liu Bowen's "Tui Bei Tu." There are newly arrived copies of the brilliantly colored "Water Lily," but there are also the countryside's sheepskin shadow puppets. All of these are facts. And what do these facts illustrate? It is said that China is still in the process of change, in the midst of the struggle between the old and the new. The new is not necessarily all good, and the old is not necessarily all bad; the end result of the struggle is to achieve the highest degree of "good."

China's progress is based on the struggle between the new and the old. "Mysterious China," "enigmatic China," "Chinese affairs, not necessarily maybe is definitely so," etc., are just the impressions of China in the eyes of some foreigners. John Gunther, known for uncovering international "insider" information, can only have this view of China, so what about the associate editor of the Kansas Star who only took a stroll in some areas of China?

However, when broken down, this so-called mystery is actually not difficult to crack. The reason why China is "not easy to understand," as the saying goes, is because the place is too big, the population is too large, the history is too long, and the writing is too deep. And especially important is that this China, with a history of three thousand years, is in the midst of revolutionary transformation.

China's all-encompassing and all-encompassing nature illustrates the messiness of this land. And precisely because it is too messy, the entire Chinese society is still in the process of revolutionary transformation, still in the process of refinement. To understand China, spatial sightseeing is necessary, and studying history, which records the traces of time, is especially necessary. Some say that China is a victim of square characters; some say that China is the epitome of the philosophy of inertia, perfunctoriness, and carelessness; and some say that China is burdened by metaphysics and has become a paradise for metaphysical ghosts. These words all have merit, and they all only see one side of the truth.

What is worth worrying about is not China's "messiness," but the evolutionary process of mountain people.

A fierce man, when surrounded by Qing guests, immediately becomes an animal specimen in a cage; revolutionary patriots, having tasted a little sweetness, immediately send telegrams, draft declarations, and become clowns on the stage of life. True warriors are rare. Therefore, young people are ahead of their time, middle-aged people follow the times, and old people drag the times, which becomes the "evolutionary process" of most people.

This is sad. If this situation does not change, China's "mystery" will also become a symbol of its tragedy.

### Too Many Names

— Hua

University girl A: Why didn't you pay attention to what name the professor called when he was calling roll?

University girl B: I did pay attention, but he answered to four people's names.

### Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert in "Since You Went Away"

### Anecdotes about Fu Ni

— Lu Shi

There was a certain gentleman in Hangzhou who had poetic and drinking friendships with Fu Ni before the war (Fu was fond of poetry and drinking). When Fu betrayed and became the puppet governor of Zhejiang Province, the gentleman severed all communication. Later, Fu concurrently served as the puppet director of the Taihu Southeast Region Qingxiang Office, and established the puppet office in Jiaxing. He suddenly found that the gentleman was hiding in a Hangzhou village, and sent a letter inviting him. The gentleman replied: "Upon receiving your letter, I know that you miss an old friend. Private feelings are touching, but public righteousness is difficult to speak of. The world is chaotic and troublesome, and my poetic inspiration has been lost for a long time. I heard that you are in Yanyu Duzitou, setting up wine for a high gathering, facing the stream and wielding spears, which cannot be without poetry. Therefore, I recorded a song of Wu Meicun, 'Yuanyang Lake Melody,' to express my meaning." The concluding sentence of the Yuanyang Lake Melody is: "The hardships of the world are all relics of the past, and it is heartbreaking year after year. When hearing the flute, stop comparing yourself to Shi Jilun, and when holding the cup, just imitate Jiang Pengze. Don't you see the white waves soaring to the sky and a leaf in danger? Pulling in the fishing rod is still afraid of turning the boat too late. Life is full of endless hardships, so leave it to the fisherman to know!" It meant to satirize his early withdrawal. Fu was stunned and unhappy, but he hesitated and looked around, unable to extricate himself, and eventually fell into great shame, leaving shame for a hundred generations. How sad!

### "Can't Walk" Theory

— Ye Lin

With the increase in vehicles and the narrowness of roads, no matter if you invite American experts to study the matter or issue notices to stop the issuance of licenses for rickshaws and "tiger cars," the existing roads cannot accommodate the existing vehicles. Therefore, the previous few foreign methods and today's adoption of lane management have not reduced the phenomenon of congestion. Because of the congestion, vehicle accidents have also increased dramatically. Walking on the streets gives one a real sense of "the road is like a tiger's mouth." The recent incident of a Texaco oil truck running over a Jiaotong University student stems from this. Naturally, the driver's claim of brake failure and high-speed driving are also major causes of the accident. However, it is quite strange to say that 90% of vehicle accidents are due to pedestrians not knowing how to walk.

Foreigners have many criticisms of Chinese people, but criticizing Chinese people for not even knowing how to walk is quite novel. It seems that it is also common for people to drive jeeps onto sidewalks while drunk. Is it also justifiable to say that pedestrians are hitting cars and label them as suicidal? Fortunately, the driver is still honest and admitted that the car had brake problems. Otherwise, the Jiaotong University student Jia Zilian who was run over would have been deemed as simply not knowing how to walk.

In fact, instead of saying that they don't know how to walk, it's better to ask why Chinese people can't have one car per four people on average like Americans. In our case, we are the best at walking. In a city where transportation infrastructure has not met the requirements, every pedestrian walking on the road has not been run over, which shows that Chinese people are indeed capable of walking. It's just that they don't have the innate strength to collide with trucks that have high speeds and bad brakes.

In order to prevent future incidents, I would like to suggest to Texaco Oil Company that they might as well request the relevant authorities to treat all Texaco Oil Company vehicles as fire trucks and ambulances. In this way, not only will there be no criminal liability, but even the 50 million funeral expenses can be avoided.

### Introducing "Spring Chamber Tears"

— Ma Boling

"Spring Chamber Tears," like "Amorous Seeds" and "Broken Heart," extends from the love between men and women to the love of parents for their children. I said that the latter part of "Broken Heart" is more tearful than "Amorous Seeds." Now, the latter part of "Spring Chamber Tears" is even more desolate than "Broken Heart." "Since You Departed" and "Nation Above All" are unsatisfactory, so I cherish the tragic element of "Spring Chamber Tears." It has been a long time since I have seen such a tragedy. Watching the heavy rain and fluttering snowflakes in the play, many people cried.

The director, Mervyn LeRoy, directed romantic works by Ramon Novarro in his early years and became famous during the war with "When the Moon Sets, Crows Caw, and Frost Fills the Sky." The most impressive original work in our memory is "Anthony Adverse." Since then, from "Random Harvest" and "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" to this "Spring Chamber Tears," the increase in grandeur is evident. The power of the technique and the manipulation of the atmosphere are all noteworthy achievements, especially the handling from the death of the male protagonist to the end, which is deeply penetrating. As for the actors, Orson Welles's composure is fully displayed, and Claudette Colbert once again teaches us to firmly believe that she is the only Hollywood actress capable of resisting Ingrid Bergman; two child stars should be specially recommended, one is seventeen-year-old Dean Stockwell, who plays the son, and the other is six-year-old Natalie Wood, who plays the Austrian adopted daughter. Her sudden cry at the end is heartbreaking.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

"I know there are not enough cars for so many people. But I already promised Mrs. Hu yesterday, Lao Zhu, you can't let me break my promise!" Finally, she thought of the only way a favored woman can deal with an old man—coquetry. So she sat on the bed as if she were strangely angry, pouting her mouth and nagging, "Didn't you say you would listen to me? You won't even agree to such a small matter, what else can I ask of you? I don't care, you have to find a way to help Mrs. Hu...!"

By the end, she really looked like she was about to cry. Old Zhu had never expected that Jin Aili, who had always been as docile as a lamb, would suddenly cause him trouble. But he also knew that Jin Aili had been living with Mrs. Hu in Xu Shaoming's house for the past few days, and they got along very well. Jin Aili had repeatedly mentioned Mrs. Hu and her two children to him, so he absolutely did not suspect that this was for Lao Zhu's sake.

"Help me, Commander!" Zhu Zhaonian coldly saw that Old Zhu's face had gradually revealed a hesitant look, and knew that things had turned around, so he quickly helped with words. "I, Zhu Zhaonian, understand this matter best. If you can find a way for them when there is no way, I will be even more grateful than if you were helping myself!"

Old Zhu hesitated for another minute or two, and several beads of sweat appeared on his red nose.

"Well, then like this:" he said stammeringly, somewhat undecided. "One adult and two children, my small chartered car really can't fit, at most one can ride. The rest..."

"What about the rest?" Zhu Zhaonian did not dare to relax at all. His gaze was fixed on the other person's pupils.

But it was useless. Old Zhu's heart had been sealed off by the desire for power and profit as early as thirty or forty years ago. He could occasionally help someone once without any compensation, but if it exceeded this limit, he would never agree, even if it meant death.

"The rest we'll think about in a day or two." He said very firmly, but still had a strange, endearing fake smile on his face.

"Are we leaving today then?" Jin Aili, as disappointed as Lao Zhu, mustered up her courage and added this sentence.

Old Zhu really felt a little annoyed at his new favorite's lack of tact today.

"What's the problem?" He glared at Jin Aili secretly. "Even if I leave, there are still people in the company here, and Mr. Zhu can contact them at any time. No problem! No problem!" He said again with a kind smile, meaning that Lao Zhu should retreat in the face of difficulty. (Four) (One)
