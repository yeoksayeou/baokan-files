The original wording of the preceding section of that article was, "The councils or provisional councils of each province, city, and county should, as far as possible, allow the joint participation of various parties and non-party individuals." The phrase "as far as possible" in the text was changed to "by." When Chairman Chiang presented these guidelines, all parties had no objections. Chairman Chiang signed first, followed by Zhang Junmai, Zeng Qi, Mo Dehui, and Wang Yunwu. Zhang, Zeng, and others then successively delivered speeches, elaborating on the significant implications of this government reorganization. Regarding the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, it is understood that it will be implemented immediately after the National Government's reorganization. The selection of individuals from various parties and social elites to participate in the Executive Yuan is still under continued negotiation. During tonight's meeting, Chairman Chiang proposed Zhang Qun to succeed as President of the Executive Yuan, which was applauded and approved by representatives from all parties. The candidate for Vice President has not yet been announced, but it is rumored that Wang Yunwu is a strong contender.

Committee members present included Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, Bai Chongxi, Zou Lu, Liang Hancao, Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiayi, Wu Tiecheng, He Zhonghan, Gu Zhenggang, Zhang Daofan, Zhang Lisheng, Li Wenfan, Zhang Qun, Qian Dajun, Kang Ze, Xiao Tongzi, Lai Lian, Chen Bulei, Tian Kunshan, Xiao Zheng, Bai Yunti, Wang Qijiang, Liu Keshu, and others.

First, Generalissimo Chiang presided over the meeting, where the following were approved: (1) The twelve articles of the administrative guidelines of the reorganized National Government. These guidelines will be announced simultaneously with the list of key National Government members. Subsequently, due to other important matters of the Generalissimo, Committee Member Sun Ke assumed the chair. (2) The organization and methods of the Central Military慰劳团(Comfort Mission). (3) The revision of the methods for Commemorative Weeks for the Premier and the display of the Party and National Flags. (4) The case of the two million yuan抚恤 (solatium) for Zhang Fengjiu, among others.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Regarding the methods for the Premier's commemorative weeks, the display of the Party and National Flags, the reading of the Premier's will at meetings, and other procedures after the government reorganization, the Central Executive Committee has decided to revise them. This case was previously brought up for discussion at the 62nd meeting of the Central Executive Committee and was studied in detail. It was generally agreed that the various procedures mentioned above were originally intended to commemorate the Premier's noble and great personality and to ensure that the people of the whole country understood the reasons for these regulations. Now that the Three Principles of the People have been widely embraced by the people, and the core beliefs have been established, it is appropriate to take advantage of the end of political tutelage and the beginning of constitutional rule to revise these procedures. The Standing Committee decided today as follows: (1) Commemorative weeks for the Premier will be discontinued in governments at all levels, people's representative bodies, people's organizations, and schools at all levels. Alternative commemoration methods will be determined after the government reorganization. Party branches at all levels will continue to hold them as before. (2) Displaying the Party and National Flags. In the future, Party branches will continue to display them as before. Government agencies, organizations, and schools will only display the National Flag and the Founding Father's portrait. (3) Reading the Founding Father's will at meetings. In the future, this will be waived for government agencies, organizations, and schools. Party branches will continue to do so as before. (4) The National Anthem will remain the same for the time being until the government promulgates a new National Anthem (the current National Anthem has historical significance and is not easily modified, and many countries use revolutionary songs as their national anthems, including those of the martyrs).

### Yang Lianggong States that Taiwan's Clearing Work Can Be Completed by the End of the Month, Cultural Exchange is More Important Than Economy

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] Fujian-Taiwan Supervisory Envoy Yang Lianggong met with our reporter on the 16th. The order in Taiwan has gradually been restored, and the clearing work is expected to be fully completed by the end of this month.

### Foreign Aircraft Intrudes Upon Our Territory Without Permission; It Should Be Considered an Infringement of Airspace Sovereignty; Minister Peng Answers Questions at Reception

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] At the Central Propaganda Department's press conference on the 16th, Minister Peng answered questions from reporters. The questions and answers are recorded below:

Question: If a foreign aircraft flies over Chinese airspace without prior permission, what action will Chinese air defense forces take? Can you disclose the permanent instructions received by the air defense forces? Is it permissible to shoot in all circumstances, or only in certain circumstances? Is shooting permissible only against certain types of military aircraft, such as fighters, destroyers, or bombers?

Answer: (1) Any foreign aircraft that enters our airspace without permission will be considered an infringement of our airspace sovereignty. Our side will first force it to land at our airfield. If it does not comply, it will be shot down in the air. (2) Whether an aircraft entering our airspace is military or civilian (because photographic and bombing equipment is not easily visible from the outside), it is difficult to identify in the air. Therefore, everything will be handled according to item (1).

Question: What is the current military situation?

Answer: (1) In northern Shaanxi, the remaining main force of He Long, about 30,000 people, is gathered near Long'an, north of Anse. The national army is attacking from the south from Yulin and from the north from Waibao. The forces will soon converge. (2) In southern Shanxi, the communist army Chen Geng's force of about 40,000 people, in order to support He Long, has been fleeing westward from its Taihang military region base since April 5th. It once occupied Hejin and Yumenkou, which have now been recovered. The national army is now using strong forces to intercept them in sections.

Recommendations for Improving Taiwan's Administration; Submitted to Chairman Chiang for Approval

Question: Has Minister Bai's suggestion for improving Taiwan been approved by the Chairman? Has Chen Yi's resignation been approved?

Answer: Minister Bai's suggestion has been submitted to the Chairman and is under consideration. I believe that most of it will be approved and implemented quickly.

Question: One of the common policy guidelines agreed upon by the Kuomintang and other parties states: "As long as the Chinese Communists are willing to make peace and national railway transportation is restored, the CCP issue will be resolved politically." What is the government's interpretation of this article? Some smaller parties believe that when the railway transportation of mainland China is restored, but the Northeast has not been restored, the above conditions can be met. Does the government agree with this interpretation?

Answer: Please read the original text of Article 4 of the National Government's policy guidelines for clarification. "The CCP issue will still be resolved politically as a basic principle. As long as the Chinese Communists are willing to make peace and railway transportation is fully restored, the government will seek domestic peaceful unification through political means." This policy guideline will be announced by the National Government tomorrow.

Question: When will the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan be reorganized?

Answer: The list of the National Government Committee will be decided and announced in the next few days. The reorganization of the Executive Yuan will be decided by the new National Government Committee.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] At the Central Propaganda Department's press conference on the 16th, Director Ye Gongchao of the Foreign Ministry answered the following questions from reporters:

Question: Has the Soviet government given a written or oral response to the memorandum recently submitted by China to the Soviet Union regarding the reception of Dalian? According to a report in the Da Gang Bao, although the Soviet authorities have allowed the Chinese government to immediately take over the civil administration of Dalian, they do not allow Chinese troops to enter the Lushun-Dalian area except for the police.

Director Ye replied: Regarding the administrative rights of receiving Dalian and the Lushunkou naval base area, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Soviet government on March 31 of this year. A reply has now been received. The Soviet government has agreed to assist in sending administrative personnel to Dalian and the naval base area, but the opinions of the two sides are still inconsistent regarding the stationing of Chinese troops in the naval base area and are still under discussion.

I wish to state the attitude of our government on the Korean issue. The future of Korea is of vital interest to China and is a matter of great concern to China. The Chinese people and their government have always believed that the Korean people should be granted independence as quickly as possible. It has been a long time since Japan surrendered, but a government of the Korean people has not yet been established in Korea, which we deeply regret. We believe that the establishment of the Korean government and the commencement of its work should not be delayed any longer. In order to enable the Koreans to realize their desire for freedom and independence as soon as possible, the Chinese government believes that if the countries occupying the country cannot reach an agreement as soon as possible, the four countries, the United States, Britain, and China, that participated in the Moscow Agreement of December of the previous year (regarding the Korean issue) should immediately engage in comprehensive consultations. I have also instructed the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union to send a copy of this letter to Mr. Molotov and Mr. Bevin."

### Dutch Financial Authorities Reject Overseas Chinese Request to Increase Remittances to China

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 15th] Authoritative sources say: Dutch financial authorities have rejected a request submitted by overseas Chinese through Consul General Chiang to increase remittances (those remitted back to domestic municipalities). The Dutch refusal is due to "the difficult economic situation here." As such, the Foreign Exchange Administration continues to approve remittances of 1 million guilders per month or 3 million guilders per quarter. According to statistics, nearly 78,000 overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies applied for remittances in the first quarter. This also means that the remittance for each applicant is less than 40 guilders.

### Remittances from Overseas Chinese in Singapore Suddenly Increased in March; Believed to be the Result of Austerity Measures

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 16th] The number of remittances from overseas Chinese in Singapore to their families in China increased sharply in March, totaling 4.7 million Singapore dollars, reaching a record high. In January, it was only over 900,000, and in February, it was 1.73 million Singapore dollars. Financial circles believe that the emergency economic measures have stabilized the value of Chinese currency, which is an important reason for the surge in remittances.

### US Foreign Food Relief Fund; 50 Million Allocated to Our Country; Methods are Being Considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee

[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th, United Press] Official sources say: Truman requested that Congress, after the end of UNRRA, continue to allocate 50 million US dollars to China from the 350 million US dollars emergency relief fund for countries suffering from war and natural disasters. This plan, together with Truman's 400 million US dollar aid plan for Greece and Turkey, is being considered separately by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. According to Secretary of State Acheson, the plan is for food relief to Australia, Greece, Italy, and China "which may also be included" after the end of UNRRA, and other officials have confirmed that China is included. It is also said that the provisional allocation to China is 50 million US dollars. The State Department refused to announce the allocation of the 350 million US dollars, even to members of Congress, believing that if any country receiving relief knew its total amount, that country would immediately regard it as a debt, and if the future result were not the case, there would be a difficult feeling.

[This Newspaper, Hankou, 15th] The long-planned joint water and land transportation between Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Zhengzhou officially opened this afternoon.

Editorial

### The Necessity of Strengthening Economic Administration

Undoubtedly, our country's economy is still in a state of emergency. The Economic Emergency Measures Program passed on February 16th is a clear example of this. Furthermore, the antagonism between various agencies, whether at the central or local level, is quite evident. They compete for power and shirk responsibility. This habit is inherently a difficult-to-cure cancer in politics. Moreover, the endless back-and-forth of official documents is a consistent practice of bureaucrats. Therefore, unifying and streamlining economic administrative power is truly necessary for our country's economy at this stage.

Don't we see many extremely common cases? A matter is transferred from Agency A to Agency B, and then from Agency B to Agency C. After such repeated twists and turns, with each party passing the buck, and sometimes requiring meetings, reviews, investigations, and requests for instructions, it often takes several weeks to obtain an empty, perfunctory reply. By the time actual action is to be taken, all relevant agencies must go through a similar set of procedures again. As time goes on, all timeliness is often lost. The general public feels very troubled by this situation. The government also feels this way, so it constantly calls for simplifying procedures and improving efficiency.

The central government has already established the National Economic Commission as the highest guidance body for all economic administration and as a comprehensive agency. According to this organization, close connections and cooperation could be achieved by each economic administrative department. If another similar agency were added on top of it, it would only create more obstacles to unification and simplification. Wouldn't this contradict the original intention? However, despite this, in order to realize the unification and simplification and directly improve the administrative efficiency of the economy and indirectly promote the production industry, we cannot help but hope that each economic administrative agency will find ways to improve and maximize its functions.

How can the above objectives be achieved? We believe that: First, the layers of management organizations should be reduced. For example, the recent proposal to eliminate the functional departments of various financial institutions, allowing them to develop separately while abolishing the Joint Treasury or turning it into an advisory body, is a practical example. Second, management agencies that do not live up to their names should be abolished. For example, the Fuel Management Committee does not actually control resources or adequately supply civilian use, but it restricts coal merchants and prohibits them from freely extracting and transporting coal, which seems quite unreasonable. Third, all duplicate agencies should be merged. This can be easily found in both central and local governments. If they can be merged based on their nature, not only can the power of affairs be unified, fundamentally reducing the malpractice of procrastination and shirking responsibility, but also expenses can be saved, reducing the financial burden. Fourth, the various relevant committees should be reduced. Committees have many advantages, but they also have many weaknesses, such as delays, procrastination, and irresponsibility. Their drawbacks are especially evident in implementation. Fifth, laws and regulations should be reorganized, and contradictory or repetitive provisions should be eliminated. Currently, various economic laws and regulations: (1) Some were promulgated before or during the war, and their current circumstances are obviously not very suitable, such as the fines or handling fees, which are too small. (2) Some have been repealed or shelved, but are repeatedly invoked, such as the compulsory membership order for industrial and commercial groups and the laws and regulations promulgated under the Economic Emergency Measures Program. (3) Some have not been formulated or have been formulated but have not been implemented, such as the Housing Rental Ordinance and the Minimum Wage Law. Social economy evolves with the times, and if all relevant laws and regulations cannot adapt to the environment and fit the facts, difficulties will inevitably arise during implementation, and the result will affect the implementation of policies.

As the saying goes, laws cannot enforce themselves. If any laws or systems are not earnestly implemented, then even if there are good laws and good intentions, they will be nothing more than waste paper. Therefore, the most important point is that each department can earnestly perform its duties and truly promote things. As long as someone handles things seriously and takes responsibility, the laws can gradually be repaired even if they are not complete, and the malpractice of procrastination and perfunctoriness will not occur everywhere. The key to the effectiveness of administrative unification and simplification mentioned above is nothing more than this. Not only is this true for economic administration, but it is also true for all other administration.

We particularly emphasize strengthening economic administration for two reasons: first, due to the severity of the current economic situation, and second, due to the increasing urgency of this need. This can also be explained from two aspects. One is the need of the government itself, such as various controls, restrictions, allocation, rationing, state-owned enterprises, etc., which require the cooperation and connection of all parties to smoothly complete their missions. The other is the need of the industrial and commercial sectors. As far as labor is concerned, even the dismissal or payment of wages for one or two individuals requires the support and handling of local authorities. If it is not accepted, a small spark may turn into a storm. As for merchants engaged in production, they need even more government assistance. Such as financial turnover, foreign exchange supply, raw material acquisition, power maintenance, and even how to sell products, how to circulate transportation, how to deal with foreign dumping, and even how to transport and sell by-products, and how to purchase production machinery all require government assistance or mediation. It seems that today's government has become the general management office of the industrial and commercial circles, which is not a coincidence. Because as agricultural economy gradually enters into industrial production, the relationship between officials and merchants will naturally become increasingly complex. Especially in this extraordinary period, industry and commerce have entered a semi-controlled state. According to the laws and regulations on price evaluation, wage evaluation, suppression of hoarding, agricultural, industrial, commercial and mining management, and even countless registrations, almost every important action must go through reporting and approval procedures. Therefore, if the organization and personnel of economic administration cannot be strengthened to adapt to this urgent need, the suffering of merchants and the people will not be alleviated, and the country's economic policy will inevitably become a dead letter, unable to be implemented effectively, which is obvious.

### Impressions of Northern Jiangsu (4) The People Eagerly Await a "Just Official"

— Our Newspaper Reporter Zhang Shengzhi

Speaking of local administration, it is also a headache. Being a county magistrate these days is easy to get scolded and difficult to please. However, the common people still eagerly await a "just official" to come.

When it comes to county magistrates, the first thing they say is that everything is in ruins and there is insufficient funding, making it difficult for even the most skilled woman to cook without rice. But the common people say that taxes are too heavy and the budget is too large, making it truly unbearable. To a third party, it is indeed a case of each side having its own reasons and difficulties. But the bottom line is that in the current situation of seven parts military and three parts politics, it is difficult to be a county magistrate and even more difficult for the common people.

We have long said that the biggest problem in the counties of Northern Jiangsu is the unsoundness of grassroots work. Often, a good plan from above is already greatly diminished by the time it reaches the bottom, completely losing its original form.

Here is an example: The Provincial Government wanted to cooperate with the militarization of Northern Jiangsu and issued an order to encourage people to purchase guns. This motive was originally a good plan, but when it came to the local level, the people had to pay money and risk their lives without being able to speak out about it. For example, the Gao County Government once sold 300 guns for 350,000 yuan on orders, but the black market price was selling for 800,000 to 1 million yuan, and the value of a light machine gun was as high as 10 million yuan.

Good township chiefs often run away because they are unwilling to violate their conscience too much and cannot get things done. Therefore, the local areas often lack leadership, allowing some local thugs and ruffians to take the opportunity to rise up and exploit the villagers. Even worse, the communists use these ignorant people to set up an intelligence network, which is a major blow to the military.

Local evil forces are a major obstacle to handling local administration. Here, Hai'men County can be taken as the "chief representative." Although this third-class county is smaller in area and population than other counties, the small citizens of this "small city" are divided into the "East Faction" and the "West Faction," each with its own background and spokesperson. Scolding and fighting openly and secretly at all times.

It is said that in the past, Hai'men County accounted for the largest number of lawsuits in Jiangsu Province. At the same time, none of the past Hai'men County magistrates left office without being flattened.

It is said that interim council meetings have been established in all counties in the province, but Hai'men County has not yet organized one. It is expected that there will be another major dispute between the "East Faction" and the "West Faction" in the future.

The Hai'men County magistrate once said to reporters with great emotion: "Although I have only been in office for a few months, most of my time has been spent resolving disputes for the local people." From his words, we can easily understand the complexity of the situation in Hai'men.

This time, the reporter group ran through four counties. Except for the Nantong County magistrate, who is from Dongtai, Northern Jiangsu, the county magistrates of the other three counties, Hai'men, Rugao, and Dongtai, are all from Hunan. From the general tone of the people, everyone still inevitably has some local concepts. At the same time, these county magistrates have all worked in the army in the past, which should be more suitable for cooperating with the military.

Among them, the Rugao County magistrate, Jian, and Commander Li are fellow townsmen from Changsha. In the past, he was the director of the confidential room of the Pacification Commander's Office and also an "editor" in the news industry. He is eloquent, shrewd, and capable. He talked to reporters at length about his land policy, endlessly. He is particularly interested in the Soviet collective farm system. According to him, he had seriously studied it in books for a considerable period before becoming a county magistrate. Before we left Rugao, he specially printed a "Rugao County Yongan Cooperative Farm Reclamation Plan," which contained charts and explanations, making it clear at a glance. If this matter is truly successful, it will of course be a very good work. However, what is worrying is that in the current situation, it seems impossible to be as easy as in the ideal.

This time, we ran a big circle among the counties. In addition to what we heard and saw, we also received many reports and printed materials from the responsible authorities, which piled up into a thick package. Of course, all the plans are good, but whether they will be effective is another matter.

Finally, quoting Commander Li's words: "Everything depends on the cadres."

"Having only military affairs without politics only makes the people suffer more."

### Foreign Ministers Conference Approaches Final Stage, Marshall Meets Stalin, Speculation Abounds Regarding the Contents of the Talks

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] US Secretary of State, Marshal Marshall, visited Marshal Stalin at 10 pm today and had a conversation with him. US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, US State Department Assistant, Bohlen, and Soviet Foreign Minister, Inlottov, were also present.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th United Press] US Secretary of State Marshall, after accusing the Soviet Union of being responsible for the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference to reach a basic agreement, has submitted the US-Soviet dispute over the Four-Power Pact to Prime Minister Stalin. Marshall arrived at the Kremlin at 10 pm. He instructed his staff not to announce the details of his talks with Stalin to the press. The only thing the press liaison secretary of the US delegation, Dermo, could announce was that Marshall arrived at the Kremlin at 10 pm and returned to the embassy at 11:45 pm. Other details of the meeting are unknown.

[Our Newspaper] Moscow, 16th Broadcast: The results of Marshall's meeting with Stalin are being kept strictly secret by both parties. Diplomats here are pessimistic, believing that this meeting proves that the Foreign Ministers Conference has reached a dead end. If the Marshall-Stalin meeting yields no results, the Foreign Ministers Conference will end immediately. What follows will be even greater opposition and animosity among the powers in Europe. Another report: Willis, the director of the Soviet branch of the US Information Service, was forced to resign due to suspicion of being pro-Soviet. It is said that the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and his subordinates are extremely anti-Soviet, making it impossible for the two countries to get closer. US Ambassador Smith has denied this.

[Our Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: It is reported that Marshall's meeting with Stalin lasted ninety minutes last night and did not break the deadlock caused by various issues at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. From Marshall's standpoint, the main value of this conversation lies in the fact that Marshall frankly and directly stated the US policy toward Germany to the Soviet head of state.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th Dispatch] The "Daily Telegraph" recently published a telegram from a Moscow correspondent, hinting that US Secretary of State Marshall may have requested an audience with Stalin to express his regret over the lack of achievement at the Moscow Conference and to take the opportunity to bid farewell.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th Dispatch] State Department officials declined to comment on Marshal Stalin's meeting with Secretary of State Marshall tonight, pending detailed reports from Moscow. However, US diplomatic circles believe that the two not only discussed the German issue, but also the entire issue of US-Soviet relations. Semi-officials said: If Marshall had requested to meet with Marshal Stalin, he would certainly have thought the timing was appropriate. The general impression is that although Marshall spoke slowly, one hour and forty-five minutes was enough for him to express the US government's views to Marshal Stalin, namely that the attitude of the Soviet delegation was hindering the progress of the Moscow Conference, and to explain the characteristics, limits, and actual results of the Truman Doctrine. Washington officials emphasized that Marshall is a believer in "direct diplomacy." On the Soviet side, in the absence of Ambassador Novikov, they also refused to comment. However, people close to the Soviet Embassy fear that the differences between the US and the Soviet Union are too great, and the Stalin-Marshall meeting may not produce the hope of immediate improvement in relations between the two countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] Regarding Marshal Marshall's visit to Marshal Stalin, political observers here commented that Marshal's request for an audience with Stalin shows that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference has reached its most critical period. The conversation between these two politicians can determine the duration and success or failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has proposed a counter-proposal to the US Four-Power Pact draft, which is sufficient to cause the US draft to fail. In fact, Marshall had already foreseen this difficulty, because what he requested was only that the four powers give a reply in principle to the US proposal.

### Molotov Proposes Amendments, Four-Power Pact Runs Aground, US-Soviet Disagreements Obvious

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] Marshall said today: Molotov's amendments to my proposed Four-Power Treaty for the Prevention of German Aggression are sufficient to completely change the scope and purpose of the treaty. Molotov suggested amending the treaty to allow it to involve other matters, such as the permanent elimination of Nazi regimes, the elimination of trusts, and the completion of the collection of reparations. These matters should be handled by the Allied Control Council or the peace treaty. To stipulate them in the Four-Power Treaty will change the scope and purpose of the treaty.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held a meeting today, with US Secretary of State Marshal Marshall making a final effort to get the Foreign Ministers Conference to immediately begin discussing the Four-Power Pact, but it was met with strong opposition from the Soviet Union. As a result, the US proposal has been shelved indefinitely. It is already obvious that the four powers cannot agree. Regarding the coal issue, Marshal Marshall stated that effective control of coal production and distribution by the Allied Control Council will not be possible until the economic unification of Germany has been achieved. French Foreign Minister Bidault also issued a statement, commenting on the attitude of the British, American, and Soviet foreign ministers towards France's proposal on the Ruhr region.

### British Official Goes to Soviet Union to Discuss Trade Issues

[United Press, London, 15th Dispatch] British Secretary for Overseas Trade Cripps reported to the House of Commons that Soviet Head of State Stalin has agreed to commercial talks between British and Soviet representatives. Cripps declared: British Foreign Trade Minister Willis will fly to Moscow on the 18th to exchange opinions on the future of British-Soviet trade. Britain urgently needs to import raw materials such as timber from foreign countries. Before the war, timber came from both the US and the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet Union seems to hope to obtain machinery and equipment from Britain for the reconstruction of the Soviet Union.

### Agreement on Austrian Peace Treaty May Be Reached

[United Press, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] The agenda for tomorrow's Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is the issue of the Austrian peace treaty, which is a topic that has not yet been discussed by the Foreign Ministers in full session. It is widely expected that after five weeks of the Four-Power Conference, a substantial agreement may be reached on this matter.

### US Senator Advocates Immediate Severance of Relations Between US and Soviet Union

[Reuters, Washington, 15th Dispatch] Mississippi Democratic Senator Rankin advocated in the House of Representatives today that the United States immediately sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

### US-Soviet Lend-Lease Accounts to Be Negotiated Soon, Soviet Union Should Pay More Than Other Countries

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th Dispatch] Official responsible officials said today: The settlement of the US-Soviet Union's lend-lease accounts of more than 11.4 billion US dollars, which has been delayed for a long time, will be negotiated one day. The Soviet side should pay more than other allies. The reason is not due to the dispute between the US and the Soviet Union on current world issues, nor is it due to the Kremlin's refusal to discuss the settlement over the years, because the Soviet Union has obtained more civilian goods than other allies. On the side of other allies, the United States has already agreed to repay the 50 billion US dollars of supplies used to defeat the Nazis during the war at a rate of less than 30 cents per dollar. But it is expected that the Soviet Union will pay at a higher rate. As for Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's amendment to the US proposal, it cannot be accepted.

### Brazilian Communist Youth Ordered to Cease Activities

[Agence France-Presse, Brazilian Capital, 15th Dispatch] Brazilian President Dutra today ordered the Communist Youth Movement to cease activities for half a year.

### Truman's Message to Congress Requests Amendment to Neutrality Act, Prohibiting Arms Shipments to Aggressor Nations

[United Press, Washington, 15th Dispatch] After proposing his suggestion to "check the communist plague," President Truman then sent a special message to Congress, requesting authorization to prohibit the shipment of US military equipment and war materials to countries with aggressive intentions, and requesting that the 1939 Neutrality Act be amended, stating: US arms must no longer fall into the hands of potential enemies. If war is imminent and our country is still in its current state, bound by its own laws, it will be an intolerable situation to provide assistance to countries that may launch an attack. I am now making this proposal to prevent the arms trade from being unrestricted, so as to avoid the Pearl Harbor incident that occurred due to aid to Japan.

[United Press, Washington, 15th Dispatch] Authoritative sources stated today on President Truman's proposal to amend the Neutrality Act to prohibit arms shipments to aggressor nations that Truman's new proposal indicates that the United States may not necessarily take a completely impartial path when war breaks out in other countries, but will cut off US aid to any aggressor nation. Truman did not specify the countries that would be hit by the arms embargo, but the meaning seems to refer specifically to the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states, whose policies were condemned by Acting Secretary of State Acheson as "aggressive and expansionist."

### Arab Committee Will Send Representatives to China and Other Places

[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 16th Dispatch] The Arab Higher Committee has decided to send representatives to China, India, Iran, Turkey, France, the Soviet Union, Britain, Spain, and Scandinavian countries in order to express the Arab people's views on the Palestinian issue. Representatives to North America have already been appointed and are scheduled to depart next week.

### The Bomb Completes a Round-the-World Flight; Reynolds Sets a New Record; Total Time: Slightly Less Than Seventy-Nine Hours

[United Press International, New York, 16th] Reynolds, aboard his airplane "The Bomb," landed at LaGuardia Airport here at 5:06:56 Greenwich Mean Time (2:06 PM Shanghai time), setting a new speed record for round-the-world flight, totaling 78 hours, 55 minutes, and 50 seconds. This is 12 hours, 18 minutes, and 4 seconds faster than the record held by Howard Hughes in 1938, and the route was 6,000 miles longer than Hughes' flight. When "The Bomb" arrived at LaGuardia Airport, it had only a half-hour's worth of fuel left in the tanks. Reynolds, upon disembarking, stated: he did not sleep during these three days and three nights, nor did the other two crew members. Even if he were given one hundred million dollars, he would not be willing to repeat the same flight. When asked by the welcoming crowd why Reynolds made this flight, Reynolds replied: He wanted to break the record. Reynolds gave away more than two hundred ballpoint pens along the way as a courtesy to reporters.

[Associated Press, New York, 16th] Reynolds' plane was flown by young pilot Auden Amend. Upon arriving at the airport here today, when Amend, along with the 54-year-old Reynolds and co-pilot Seely, emerged from the plane onto the right wing, the crowd broke through the police line, surging forward to welcome them enthusiastically. Women especially vied to kiss the three men. After a long while, a path was cleared, and Reynolds was finally able to meet his wife, Edna. Auden jumped for joy when he met his wife. Seely passionately embraced his lover, Miss Hulihan, who is nineteen years old and scheduled to marry tonight, a request Seely wired to her during the flight.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 15th] When Reynolds arrived in New York, and was asked what Reynolds and the pilots would do in the short term, head pilot Auden replied "Sleep." Reynolds replied "Eat and Sleep." Co-pilot Seely replied "Eat and Get Married."

### Wallace's Whereabouts

Plans to Speak in Northern Europe and France

[United Press International, New York, 15th] London dispatch: Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace is currently concluding his tour of England and preparing to travel to Scandinavia and France to continue his speaking campaign. Wallace also stated that the congressional attacks against him have only strengthened his resolve to voice his opinions and to criticize U.S. policies that could lead to a war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 16th broadcast: U.S. congressional figures continue to criticize Wallace's activities abroad, believing that Wallace is "endangering the country" and that his passport should be revoked and his U.S. citizenship rescinded.

### Britain Expresses its Attitude Toward Wallace's Statements

[Our Newspaper] Broadcast on the day: The British Foreign Office today issued a statement regarding Wallace's activities in Britain. It stated that Wallace is visiting Britain in a private capacity and the British government cannot accept any responsibility for his statements. Wallace's activities in Britain have only gained the sympathy of a small number of cultural figures and will not affect British foreign policy.

### Rice Shop Manager Arrested for Hoarding Over Two Thousand Rice Sacks; Exploiting Market Shortage to Speculate and Repeatedly Raise Prices; Ling Defu Will Be Sent to Court for Prosecution

[Our Newspaper] The Garrison Headquarters has dispatched large numbers of police officers in recent days to assist the municipal government in monitoring the market and suppressing prices. Yesterday, the headquarters received a tip-off that Yuanmao Rice Shop at No. 6, Lane 344, Fengyang Road, was raising prices and hoarding over two thousand sacks of rice. The Administrative Division's Fourth Section of the Police Bureau sent officers to investigate, arrested the shop's manager, Ling Defu, and took him to the police station for questioning. Ling vehemently denied hoarding and raising prices. The case has now been transferred to the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau for further investigation. On the 9th of this month, rice prices in the city market skyrocketed. On that day, Ling Defu had over ten boats of Lihli rice, totaling over two thousand sacks. Seeing that the market supply was scarce that day, Ling raised the selling price to 137,000 yuan per sack and was unwilling to sell in large quantities. The next day, Ling intended to continue raising prices, but after persuasion from Xu Songren, the market management director, he reluctantly agreed to maintain the original price from the 9th. Economic inspection authorities were extremely angry after receiving this tip-off. They stated that although the surge in rice prices was due to rising prices at the source and a shortage of supply, Ling Defu dared to take advantage of the situation to raise prices, withhold goods from sale, and incite unrest, which was illegal. Yesterday, an order was issued for his arrest, and he will be transferred to the District Court within days for severe punishment according to law.

### Witness in "Golden Tide" Case Detained; Ying Minghe Suspected of Crimes; Investigation into Possible Collusion and Perjury Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office

[Our Newspaper] Since the first public hearing in the "Golden Tide" case at the District Court on April 4, secret investigations have been intensified in recent days. Yesterday, Judge Wang Jiazhuo summoned Zhan Yunsheng at the notary office and summoned Ying Minghe, the actual person in charge of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, Ni Zuguang, the manager of Fang Jiuxia Changji Silver Shop, Xie Bingquan, the manager of Taikangrun Gold Shop, Wang Songtao, the former assistant manager and cashier of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, and Wang Mingju, a shareholder of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, for questioning. According to Zhan Liansheng's testimony, all of Tongfengyu's business and accounts were managed by Ying Minghe, so Judge Wang paid special attention to Ying's interrogation yesterday. The interrogation began at 10:00 AM and ended at 2:00 PM. According to his testimony, Tongfengyu closed its shares in February of the 34th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the capital was 4.5 million yuan in puppet Central Reserve Bank notes, with each share being 300,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Zhan Yunsheng's son, Zhan Dacheng, took two shares, one of which was transferred to Wang Mingju. Further questioning about the various details of the Central Bank's covert sale of gold, Ying's testimony was inconsistent with the testimonies of other witnesses and contained many self-contradictions. Judge Wang believed that Ying Minghe was highly suspected of collusion and perjury, and immediately ordered his temporary detention and transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After interrogation by the prosecutor on duty at the District Prosecutor's Office, he was detained at the Sinan Road detention center. The other four witnesses, Ni, Xie, and others, were ordered to return home. At the same time, in order to facilitate further questioning, Zhan Liansheng was transferred to the temporary detention center attached to the District Court on North Zhejiang Road.

### Ministry of Finance and Taxation Informs District Prosecutor's Office to Investigate Juxingcheng Deputy Manager; Where Did the Huge Sums of Gold and Cash Come From; Huang Hanliang's Appeal Against Confiscation of Gold and Cash Rejected

[Our Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office yesterday received an official letter from the Ministry of Finance, stating: According to the report submitted by the Ministry's audit personnel and the Economic Supervision Team, an inspection of the Shanghai branch of Juxingcheng Bank revealed that the office cabinet of the bank's deputy manager, Yang Xirong, contained US$36,000, 350 taels of gold, US$2,000 in money orders, and US$4,000 in U.S. savings bonds. According to Yang, these gold and cash items were deposited by others, but he could not provide evidence of the deposits. Also, because Yang Xirong had opened an account at the bank and used cashier's checks to purchase gold, and had overdrawn 1,053,000 yuan from the bank between January 18 and 25 of this year, the Ministry requests the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate according to law. The original letter included two lists of the gold and cash items.

Also, in the case of Huang Hanliang, the former Minister of Finance, for disrupting the financial system, in addition to the criminal liability portion being dropped, the prosecutor applied for the confiscation of all U.S. dollars and gold. Yesterday, Huang Hanliang appealed, arguing that the Emergency Economic Measures Plan had not gone through legislative procedures and could not be regarded as law. The District Prosecutor's Office has transferred the appeal to the District Court for a ruling.

However, these units lack a coordinating organization. The establishment of this Children's Welfare Promotion Association to engage in coordination work is very necessary. I would like to express my gratitude to UNRRA, CNRRA, the American Aid to China Association, and all relevant sectors. Today's society is unstable, and relief efforts are even more important. I feel quite ashamed. However, the greater the need for relief efforts, the lower the socio-economic situation, and therefore the greater the need for assistance from all parties.

Subsequently, Yen Hui-ching, Edward, and Director Huo of CNRRA's representative, delivered speeches. Then, the articles of association were approved, and the responsible persons were elected. The elected honorary presidents were: Mayor Wu, Yen Hui-ching, Qian Baoshu, Edgerton, and Edward. The president was Chen Heqin.

### Father Hubbard Visits Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] The world-traveling Father Bernard R. Hubbard arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Father Hubbard is a world-renowned glacier and volcano explorer, with the nickname "Glacier Priest". He is particularly familiar with the geography, culture, and customs of Alaska in the Arctic Ocean, where he spent twenty years, reluctant to leave.

### Love Triangle Drama; Real Estate Company Manager's Vicious Scheme; Fabricating a Communist Party Transfer Order; Attempting to Frame His Love Rival, the Landlord; Investigation Reveals the Truth

[Our Newspaper] The Political Section of the City Police Department received a confidential letter at the beginning of this month, addressed to Zhang Jian, Xinzha Road, containing two mimeographed "transfer orders from the Personnel Section of the Shanghai Communist Party Office", one addressed to a Mr. He, marked with the code "Mi F 144", ordering him to report to Fang Yibi, the team leader at the Shanghai office of the China National Aviation Corporation on Nanjing East Road, and the other addressed to a Mr. Xu, marked with the code "Mi F 145", ordering him to report to Wang Zhaohua, the organizer at 502 Lane 43 Weihaiwei Road. After the police department opened the letters, they paid close attention to the case and immediately sent officers to conduct a secret investigation, but they did not obtain any results. Therefore, on the 14th, they summoned Fang Yibi to the bureau for questioning. Fang denied being a member of the Communist Party, denied being a team leader, and denied knowing Wang Zhaohua. When Wang Zhaohua was questioned, nothing was found either. However, Fang Yibi stated that he had also received an anonymous letter a month ago, signed only with the word "Yuan," slandering his girlfriend Li Yuying. After investigation, it was found that the letter was written by Cao Zhongli, another boyfriend of his girlfriend, attempting to sow discord between the two.

Cao Zhongli is the manager of the Yuan Di real estate company, and his address is the same as Wang Zhaohua's. At this point, the police department understood and immediately summoned Cao Zhongli for questioning and compared his handwriting. Cao knew that his scheme had been exposed and confessed the truth. Fang, Li, and Cao's love triangle had been going on for a long time. Seeing that Fang Yibi and Li Yuying were getting closer and closer, and that he himself was about to fail, Cao Zhongli used an anonymous letter to Fang, fabricating facts to damage Li's reputation, in order to sow discord. However, this plan was seen through by Fang, not only was it ineffective, but it also promoted the combination of Fang and Li. So, he

devised a vicious scheme to frame them. Wang Zhaohua is Cao Zhongli's landlord. Because of a housing dispute, he took this opportunity to slander them together. After the police department understood the facts, they severely reprimanded Cao Zhongli. Cao was also quite remorseful and immediately wrote a letter of repentance and was released on bail. The criminal liability for forgery and false accusation has been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday.

### Lai Lingnai, Instigator in the Zang Case, Appeals; Case Concluded

[Our Newspaper] Lai Lingnai, a Spanish national and instigator in the Zang Da'er case, was originally sentenced to one year and nine months in the District Court. The defendant appealed, and the case was concluded in the High Court yesterday. The verdict will be announced on the afternoon of the 22nd.

Lai Lingnai testified yesterday: Because I drank too much, Watercull动手, I did not instigate it and it had nothing to do with me. The prosecutor stood up and said: The appellant's statement is inconsistent. The US sailor and the appellant came out of the dance hall together. The victim was asking him for money. At the time of the 料缠, after the appellant spoke with the US sailor, he suddenly punched the victim. The fact proves that the appellant did instigate the incident. Now the appellant does not admit it and overturns his previous testimony. According to the original trial's application of Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for conviction, and given amnesty and commutation, the sentence is already light. The appellant's grounds for appeal are insufficient. Then defense attorney Le Junwei stated: The testimony of the six witnesses in the first instance is inconsistent and cannot prove instigation. At the same time, the appellant and the US sailor did not know each other. The US sailor has been acquitted. Public opinion mostly refers to the scene. The original judgment's assumption of the case has slightly inappropriate points. Because the appellant cannot be held responsible for the matter, please acquit him. The court ordered the debate to end and set the sentencing date for the 22nd.

Ms. Huang has been studying painting with Elder Hongwei for six years.

### Trial of Former Puppet Statistics Department Vice Minister Xia Zhongming; Vivid Accounts of Atrocities Against Bank of China Employees

[Our Newspaper] The case of Xia Zhongming, the suspected traitor and former Vice Minister of the Puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, was heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Judge Ding repeatedly questioned him about the "76th" puppet secret service's arrest and killing of Bank of China employees, and summoned Ma Chunzhuang, a guard at the Bank of China dormitory, and Chen Zhaogui, a messenger, to testify. According to Ma's testimony, "76th" sent 60-70 men one night, the date of which he could not remember, and arrested over 100 Bank of China dormitory employees, who were later released. They then arrested another ten or so, and shot Zhang and Cao, two Bank of China employees, inside the dormitory as a warning before returning them. The court ordered him to look at Xia Zhongming and asked if he was the one who led the arrest. Ma replied that it was difficult to see clearly because of the strict air raid precautions and darkness at the time. Another witness, Chen Zhaogui, testified that he had been arrested by "76th," the date of which he could also not remember, and detained for eighteen days, before being released on March 18th of the lunar calendar. He did not see Xia Zhongming at the time of his arrest, nor did he see him inside "76th." Only Wu Shibao came out and said to us, "Don't be afraid, it has nothing to do with you, you will be released in a few days." Xia Zhongming was then brought up for questioning. Xia claimed that he knew nothing about the arrest of Bank of China employees. He was mostly in Nanjing at the time, and did not know what was happening in Shanghai. The arrests were carried out secretly by Li Shiqun's men, and he was only a translator with no power to intervene in the operations. Defense attorney Chen Zhen stood up and requested that the imprisoned Ye Jiqing, Ye Yaoxian, and Wang Manyun be summoned to testify at the next hearing. The court ordered a postponement of the trial, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

### Former Puppet Secret Service Guide Handed Over to Police by Victim

[Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of the 14th at approximately 9:00 PM, Jin Quangan handed Chen Qiutao over to the Yangshupu Police Precinct, claiming that Chen served as a guide for a puppet organization's secret service in April 1945. On April 16th of that year, Chen encountered him in Yangshupu and, upon learning that he was participating in the "Special Operations Unit of the Patriotic Army," reported him to the Pingmin Transit Company in Hartung Garden on Jing'an Temple Road, as this company was actually a secret service agency of the puppet Security Command. The next morning, Chen led Li Song and others to arrest him at Room 67 on the third floor of the Zhongshan Hotel on Tianjin Road and transferred him to the puppet Security Command, where he was sentenced to imprisonment. That same afternoon, she led accomplices to arrest his neighbors Zhou Leshi and Wang Chongqing on Chaoyang Road. He only regained his freedom after the victory.

### General Labor Union Requests Adjustment of Index; Social Affairs Bureau Has Forwarded Request to Central Government

[Our Newspaper] According to reports, the General Labor Union, due to the recent soaring prices and the fact that workers' lives have been greatly affected by the freezing of the index, has requested the authorities to appropriately adjust the cost of living index without violating the principle of the economic emergency measures program. Yesterday, this reporter visited Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to inquire about his opinion. According to him, the economic emergency measures program stipulates freezing the cost of living index, and requesting an appropriate adjustment would violate this program. As the Social Affairs Bureau itself, it also hopes to improve the situation so that labor-management disputes can be reduced. However, the Social Affairs Bureau has no authority to make this decision and has forwarded the request to the central government for instructions.

Recently, employees of the Shanghai Power Company, due to difficult living conditions, specifically requested that the company provide a universal cost of living allowance. The Social Affairs Bureau rejected this request, as it amounted to a disguised increase in the cost of living index, which is against the law.

In addition, rickshaw rentals are calculated based on a base rate of sixty cents per vehicle, calculated according to the cost of living index. When the cost of living index was frozen in January, the rental was calculated at 4,750 yuan. Recently, rickshaw operators, due to the soaring prices of hardware materials, requested adjustment of the rental, but the Social Affairs Bureau did not agree due to the frozen index.

### Reader Consultation; Legal Clarification

Inheritance

Wang Yu asks: A is seventy years old, with one son and one daughter. The daughter is married. Both the son and daughter-in-law died last year, leaving behind a granddaughter. Later, a nephew of a collateral relative, B, was adopted as a son. Now there are several legal questions, please answer: (1) Who should inherit A's estate after his death? (2) If B inherits the estate, is he entitled to a special reserved portion? (3) If only the village head was present to certify A's will, is it valid? (4) The will states that B should receive a special reserved portion but must be responsible for funeral expenses. If B does not fulfill this responsibility, can the payment be stopped? (5) Can the will be filed with the court, what are the procedures, and is it necessary for the agency filing the will to investigate property rights? Can a private announcement in the newspaper stating an objection to the property have legal effect?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) A's estate should be legally inherited by his married daughter and the granddaughter who inherits by right of representation. If B has obtained the status of A's adopted son, he can also legally inherit his estate, but his inheritance share is one-half of that of a legitimate child. (2) As A's adopted son, B already has an inheritance share of one-half of that of a legitimate child and is not entitled to a special reserved portion. (3) Witnesses to a will are not limited to relatives, and the village head can also serve as a witness. (4) The will states that B is entitled to a special reserved portion but must be responsible for funeral expenses. If B does not fulfill the funeral responsibilities, payment of the special reserved portion can be stopped. (5) The will can be notarized at the court, and the property must be investigated during notarization. There is no legal basis for applying to the court for filing. (6) A private announcement in the newspaper stating an objection to the property is an expression of opposition and has legal effect.

Black Market Prices Rampant for Days, Yarn Market Chips Become Scarce, Yarn Merchants Association Temporarily Suspends Membership Applications.
[Our Report] Recently, the black market price of cotton yarn and the listed price of the Textile Construction Company have been diverging daily. Generally, yarn merchants who can obtain a piece of cotton yarn from the spinning company can make a huge profit simply by reselling the purchase permit. Moreover, some manufacturers are using the black market to transfer raw materials for profit. It is reported that chips are scarce in the yarn market these days, and many depend on these people for adjustment. Moreover, yarn merchants are happy to move in because they can still obtain considerable profit by purchasing and handing over to customer groups for sales in the north.
Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was shouting prices outside the market, and under the monopoly of profiteering merchants, the chips were very scarce. Although the shouting prices were strong, there was a lack of business. The 42-count Blue Phoenix rose to 10.5 million, the 20-count Special Double Horse was 5.7 million yuan, and the Double as Price was 5.4 million yuan.
Recently, there has been an increase in applications to register as members of the Yarn Business Association. It is reported that the association currently has 738 registered members. However, only about 600 are actually operating. Of these, only about 200 are genuine yarn merchants. The rest are mostly merchants who deal in both yarn and cloth or brokers. However, only over 300 are registered with the Textile Construction Company to receive yarn allocation rights. In order to assist the authorities in managing yarn prices and to conduct investigations of applications for membership to the association, as well as to organize various affairs of the members, the association has temporarily suspended applications for membership since the 15th. Those who have already received application forms but have not yet submitted them to the association must submit them within three days, otherwise, applications will be temporarily suspended.
Textile Construction Company Yarn Sales Process: [Our Report] A responsible person from the business office of the China Textile Construction Company must explain the company's repeated routine allocation and sale of yarn and cloth. He said: In the past half month, the prices of yarn and cloth in this city have been rising steadily, while the price of cotton yarn sold by the company has adhered to the regulations of the authorities and has not changed. The prices of cloth sold are also lower than the market price. Moreover, the allocation and sale of these yarns and cloths have never been interrupted. The quantity of each allocation and sale has also remained balanced. However, the market price has been rising endlessly, resulting in a widening gap with the company's listed price. According to the current difference, each time the company sells yarn, it receives approximately 2-3 billion yuan less, calculated at the market price difference. Each time cloth is sold, it receives approximately 600-700 million yuan less. This difference in reduced revenue is all taken advantage of by intermediaries, providing no benefit to direct consumers and representing a loss to the national treasury. However, the outside world does not understand the truth and instead blames the Textile Construction Company for not selling effectively. He also listed the amount by which the prices of yarn and cloth sold by the Textile Construction Company from April 1st to the 15th were lower than market prices for reference. For 20-count yarn, the price difference each day was: 2nd, 350,000 yuan; 4th, 400,000 yuan; 7th, 750,000 yuan; 9th, 780,000 yuan; 11th, 750,000 yuan; 14th, 1,550,000 yuan. For 42-count thread, the price difference each day was: 2nd, 1,200,000 yuan; 4th, 1,100,000 yuan; 7th, 1,500,000 yuan; 9th, 1,550,000 yuan; 11th, 1,550,000 yuan; 14th, 2,850,000 yuan. For 12-pound fine cloth, the price difference each day was: 1st, 4,500 yuan; 3rd, 5,000 yuan; 5th, 6,500 yuan; 8th, 18,000 yuan; 10th, 15,000 yuan; 12th, 26,000 yuan; 15th, 27,000 yuan.

Mr. Xi Yushu Issues Statement
[Our Report] Recently, people in the community have expressed deep concern about the high price of yarn and the insufficient supply of raw cotton. This reporter specially consulted Mr. Xi Yushu, who said: The purchase price of cotton yarn and the free sale price of manufacturers should be as close as possible; otherwise, manufacturers will raise the free sale price in order to compensate for the losses caused by the low purchase price, regardless of the government's purpose of purchasing, it will have an adverse effect on prices directly and indirectly. As for a reasonable purchase price, it can be listed as follows: 3.5 dan of raw cotton + 1.14 million yuan + manufacturing cost + 15% unified tax = reasonable purchase price for each purchase. As for the supply of raw cotton, since September of last year, cotton textile industry personnel in this city have been calling loudly and consulting with Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, hoping that the government can be prepared. After Mayor Wu, who also served as the head of the Textile Control Commission, took office last October, cotton textile industry personnel again requested the government to guarantee the continuous supply of raw cotton. However, by February of this year, the government had not ordered any foreign cotton in this half-year period. From the government's perspective, there were practical difficulties, but for the sake of the entire national economy, it is hoped that the authorities will have a long-term vision and have a complete plan. As for the cotton provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), totaling 160,000 bales, approximately 50,000 bales have already arrived in this port.

Ji Mingqi, the head of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, met with Mayor Wu at 3:00 PM yesterday to request instructions on measures to suppress rice prices. It is reported that the China Trust Bureau has agreed to allocate approximately 30,000 to 50,000 bags of medium-grade Saigon rice to the city from today for sale on the market in order to suppress the rising prices. The selling price is to be announced temporarily this morning by Section Chief Ji after he arrives at the market, and it will be lower than the market price, approximately 110,000 yuan per stone. The Social Affairs Bureau has strict regulations for rice stores and rice merchants to avoid hoarding and ensure that citizens can truly benefit.
Foreign Rice Arriving Soon: Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the bureau will sell white japonica rice when necessary, so that it and red glutinous rice will appear in the market in rotation. The main problem currently is still asking the Jiangsu Provincial Government to effectively assist in suppressing prices in the producing areas. Tens of thousands of tons of foreign rice will arrive by the end of April, and another 100,000 tons will be imported in May. Vice Minister Pang of the Ministry of Food has agreed to allocate a portion to Shanghai to stabilize rice prices.
White Yuan Rising Wildly: Yesterday, more than 4,700 stones of rice and grain arrived in the north and south markets. The prices in various producing areas rose sharply, and local prices followed suit. Japonica and glutinous rice became a rare commodity, continuing to soar by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

Qingdao Yarn and Cloth Soaring: [Central News Agency, Qingdao, 16th] Qingdao is a yarn and cloth producing area. Recently, speculative capital from various places has poured in, and yarn and cloth prices have fluctuated sharply. 20-count cloth has risen to 220,000 yuan per bolt, and yarn has risen to 5.6 million yuan per piece. It is reported that the reasons for the price increases are: (1) Merchants are transporting goods out for profit. In the past month, the Jiaohai Customs exported over 11,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 360,000 bolts of cloth, far exceeding Qingdao's production. (2) Affected by the soaring prices of yarn and cloth in Tianjin and Yingkou. (3) The prices of raw cotton, coal, hardware, and other materials have increased more than threefold compared to mid-January, while yarn and cloth have only increased twofold. (4) At the beginning of this month, the Qingdao branch of the China Textile Corporation suspended 100,000 spindles due to the interruption of Western raw cotton supply, resulting in supply falling short of demand. Now, the company's raw cotton has arrived, and it is striving to restore raw cotton production and is consulting with the Qingdao Municipal Government on provisional measures for the allocation and sale of yarn and cloth to meet the needs of citizens and line cloth twill factories and production cooperatives.
Tianjin Bans Yarn and Cloth Exports: [Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] Tianjin's yarn and cloth prices have been soaring for two months. To crack down on speculation, the municipal authorities issued measures on the 15th to control the sale of yarn and cloth, prohibiting exports to Qingdao and Shanghai. Exports to the Northeast, except for the return sales by the China Textile Corporation and the permission for merchants to provide security to exchange cloth for grain, are also prohibited, and public price negotiation is implemented.
National Bank and China Trust Bureau Order Coal from the United States: Estimated 50,000 Tons, Transportation Issues Under Consideration
[Our Report] It is reported that the Central Bank and the China Trust Bureau have decided to order 50,000 tons of bituminous coal from the United States and Canada in order to replenish the city's coal reserves so that they can be adjusted when coal is in short supply. The price of this coal is approximately US$20 per ton in the United States if we transport and load it ourselves. If we entrust the United States to transport and load it, the price per ton in Shanghai is approximately US$35, requiring a total foreign exchange outlay of US$1.75 million. It is heard that the transportation issue is currently under consideration. After the coal arrives in Shanghai, it will be temporarily stockpiled for emergency allocation and sale.
Coal Dust Continues to Rise: The market for bituminous coal dust is still tending to be brisk. The price of Kaiping No. 1 has been quoted at 700,000 yuan. Bituminous coal lumps are also stable and firm, with more people inquiring. Tongmei, which had been sluggish for a long time, has also rebounded, with the price rising to 670,000 to 680,000 yuan. The market for various types of white coal is still stable, and market prices have not fluctuated much.
Holders of US Dollar Bonds Can Freely Remit Foreign Exchange Earnings
[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance: Article 5 of the Regulations on US Dollar Bonds of the 36th Year of the Republic explicitly stipulates that "the principal and interest of this bond shall be paid in US dollar foreign exchange by the National Government." The Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Central Bank and the Import Management Committee in accordance with this stipulation. The payment of the principal and interest of the public bond will be left to the discretion of the bondholders, and they may be freely remitted without restriction. Bondholders may also use this foreign exchange to order various goods from abroad within the scope of the Import Management Regulations and import them into the country. If the goods purchased are production tools or production raw materials, the Import Management Committee should provide special facilitation.
Money Supply in This City is Tightening: In the past week, the money supply in this city has not been as loose as in the past. Over the past two days, speculative capital has become slightly active, and the money supply is tending to tighten. According to yesterday's exchange, the amount that various banks and Zhuang were lending to the national bank was 1.7 billion yuan, which is gradually tightening compared to the more than 1 billion yuan that was being lent out two weeks ago. However, compared to the previous 25 billion yuan that was being lent out to the national bank, it is still a big difference. It is heard that the reason for the slight tightening of the money supply this time is that price fluctuations are a factor. In addition, the fact that businesses had to pay income tax before the 15th of this month, which was also a major reason. According to financial industry sources: the government is determined to stabilize prices, and the money supply will not be excessively tightened. However, it is expected that before the end of the month, in order to catch up with the interest on the US dollar treasury bonds for this month, the purchase of treasury bonds will definitely be enthusiastic, and a large amount of speculative capital will be absorbed at that time, and the money supply may be more likely to tighten.
Dyestuffs Climbing to New Highs: Under the stimulation of certain positive news in recent days, although market sales have not been very prosperous, market prices have climbed to new highs. Yesterday and today, the prices of Wuma vermilion, vulcanized yuan, and water indigo have been soaring, and there is no possibility of stabilization.
Hardware Flat After Being Brisk: The hardware market, which had been climbing to new highs in recent days, has now stabilized slightly. However, barbed wire cloth is in season, and the price is still rising continuously. Lead wire is also very firm.
Fir Timber Price Increases Have Stopped: The price of fir timber previously rose due to high prices in the Fujian producing area and because sales in Shanghai were brisk and people were encouraged. This increase had reached 15%, but yesterday the price increase stopped. Sellers of foreign pine also have a positive outlook due to the high price of fir.
Biluochun New Crop Arrives: Among various domestic teas, in addition to Longjing and Dafang, the Biluochun produced in Dongting Mountain is also a famous and expensive green tea. Every year, it has been selling well on this street. The new crop for this year has finally arrived in Shanghai, which the various stores have been eagerly awaiting. It is heard that the price among the industry is 36,000 yuan per catty for Dongshan goods and 24,000 to 5,000 yuan per catty for Xishan goods, and sales are very brisk. As for the new Longjing from Wenzhou and Hangzhou, the market is softening again because the goods arriving are becoming more mature. As for domestic aged tea, the market continues to be the same because purchases and sales are about equal, regardless of quality. Buyers in the foreign tea market are still trying to suppress prices, and sellers are reluctant to sell, so trading has decreased sharply, and the situation remains unchanged.
Dutch Quinine Resumes Production: During the war, Dutch quinine bark could not be exported, and there was a shortage everywhere in the world. Recently, the Dutch government stated that quinine bark and crude products are available, and production will resume, with supply reaching four-tenths of 1938, at a price of US$25.54 per kilogram.
Dispute Between Southern Goods and Other Four Industries: Social Affairs Bureau's Handling Measures.
[Our Report] The Southern Goods Industry Association of this city recently reported to the economic supervision agency that the United Office of the Seafood, Northern Goods, and Longan Industry Associations was illegally organizing and monopolizing the source of goods, hindering the economy, and raising prices. The Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau specially summoned the responsible persons of the three industries for questioning yesterday afternoon. Four handling measures were decided: (1) The boycott by fellow traders should cease immediately. (2) The鏢期 (escort payment) method will be decided after convening the four industries for consultation. (3) The United Office of the Seafood, Northern Goods, and Longan Industry Associations will be banned. (4) The matter of price increases for seafood will be thoroughly investigated by sending personnel.
According to Director Wu, the United Office of the three industries has not been registered according to law, so it will be banned. As for the Southern Goods Industry's accusation of monopolizing the market and raising prices, if the investigation is true, they will be dealt with according to law.
City Chamber of Commerce Asks to Raise Interest Rates; Receives Reply from Ministry of Finance: The Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance, requesting to raise the legal interest rate in order to guide speculative capital into the right track. In addition to the previous instructions from the Ministry of Justice, it received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday: "We have received your telegram. The bank interest rate should be handled in accordance with the 'Regulations on the Management of Bank Deposit and Loan Interest Rates' promulgated by the National Government, which is a legal interest rate and not just an administrative remedy. Moreover, Article 4 of the regulations clearly stipulates that 'If the bank loan interest rate exceeds the discount rate of the Central Bank on that day, the creditor has no right to claim the excess.' According to the legal principle that special law takes precedence over general law, the debtor shall not use Article 205 of the Civil Code as a reason for litigation against the bank interest rate. As for other agreed or unagreed interest rates, they will still apply before the relevant articles in the Civil Code and the Negotiable Instruments Law are amended, but if their original effect is obviously unfair. There are remedial measures in the 'Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery.' Special reply is hereby given."

As for the 14,000 tons of oil extraction raw materials supplied by the China Trust Bureau each month, there are no problems now, and it is expected to be implemented monthly. The oil mills can rest assured about this. Also, for the general needs of the citizens, the Cooking Oil Joint Distribution Office has decided to resume distribution from today (17th), with the price being 400,000 yuan per load. The retail price at the store is 4,400 yuan per catty. This negotiated price will be reduced immediately after raw materials arrive in Shanghai continuously and production increases. All retailers who receive the allocated oil should supply it all for store sales and should not exceed the price limit. Anyone who violates this will be severely punished.
Also, it was reported that the oil market was still supplying at flat prices yesterday, but the delivery was not fast. Stores were in tight demand, and there was little movement outside the market.

500,000 Japanese Soldiers Deported to Siberia Translated by Our Office
Because time was tight and transportation was lacking, the Soviet army still desperately used tanks to transport precision machinery, resulting in 20% of it being damaged.
In addition to the execution or deportation to Siberia of over a hundred prominent anti-Soviet figures such as Semenov, the remaining White Russians have become the Soviet Union's fifth column in the Northeast.
General Stankaevich First Reveals the Truth About the Soviet Army in the Northeast
In the looted and war-torn city of Shenyang, stands a tall granite monument, topped with a bronze model of a Soviet-style tank. The monument is inscribed with these words: "Eternal glory to the martyrs of the tank corps who sacrificed their lives for the Soviet victory in defeating Japanese imperialism."
This is not only a monument commemorating ten Soviet heroes of the war, but also a symbol of the Soviet expedition to the Northeast.
This corner of Northeast China was once one of the world's largest granaries, a major producer of Chinese coal and iron, and the industrial center of Asia. But today's Northeast is unrecognizable. When Japan surrendered, it was still "untouched," but after the Soviet Union "took over" for eighteen months, the Northeast became a mess. Except for Lushun and Dalian, strategic areas that the Soviet Union seemed to want to permanently occupy, no place was spared. Industrialized Northeast has been stripped of all its industrial equipment and turned into a scorched earth.
Swollen Corpses Float, Contested by Dogs
The author personally witnessed the situation in the Northeast under Soviet occupation, during the final days of the largest looting in modern history. Endless trains and ships were seen loaded with grain, machinery, and raw materials heading towards the Soviet Union. Under the watchful eyes of the Red Army, the author accompanied the first group of Chinese receiving personnel to the Northeast, touring the ruins of Shenyang after the looting.
We arrived in Shenyang as uninvited guests, but General Stankaevich, the commander of the Soviet army in the Northeast, warmly welcomed us and accommodated us in the luxurious Yamato Hotel. Although there was no hot water (because the Soviets had dismantled the generators), the food was delicious, and there was plenty of Japanese beer.
Shenyang had become a filthy and dangerous city. In the suburbs, we saw several swollen and blackened corpses, with dogs fighting over them. These corpses had been exposed for months, their faces blurred, and their nationality could not be identified. According to the Chinese who accompanied us, in the first few days of the terror, the Soviet army killed foreigners indiscriminately, regardless of whether they were friends or foes. They had buried 6,000 corpses in the three weeks since their arrival in the Northeast.
Garbage piles were everywhere in Shenyang, making cleanup work extremely difficult. General Stankaevich estimated that there were about 400,000 tons of garbage piled up throughout the city, and several roads were completely blocked by garbage. Although the authorities intended to clear the garbage, they lacked vehicles for transportation. All 600 buses in the city had disappeared, only twelve of the 200 trams remained, and all private vehicles had been requisitioned by the Red Army.
In its heyday, Shenyang's industry accounted for 40% of the entire Northeast's industry, and Northeast's industry was roughly equivalent to the rest of China. Shenyang produced 4 million tons of steel and 3.5 million tons of synthetic oil annually, mined 15 million tons of coal from the nearby Fushun coal mine, manufactured 100 aircraft per month, and had factories for automobiles, textiles, rubber, and Asia's largest tobacco factory. According to the Japanese, Shenyang's warehouses stored 5.6 million tons of supplies. Now, all of this is gone.
Dismantling Work Rushed
During the fourteen years of Japanese occupation of the Northeast, Shenyang and all the industrial areas of the Northeast were built from the ground up. The imperial government and Japanese business tycoons invested huge sums of money and built many industrial zones around the ancient city. When the Soviet army entered, Shenyang had 1,500 factories, of which 900 employed more than 200 workers. Now, two-thirds of the small factories have been dismantled, and 90% of the large factories have been damaged or completely destroyed. The large factories were of course solely owned by the Japanese, while the small factories often had Chinese investment.
We spoke with many Chinese, Japanese, and White Russian residents who witnessed or helped the Red Army move industrial equipment from the Northeast.

Li Yao passed it from 80 yards away from the goal to the center. Unexpectedly, the ball was too high, and Hong Deyong's vision was blocked by the sunlight, so it jumped into the net, 1-0. The Railway team opened the scoring, only one and a half minutes after the start of the match.

Seoul Falls Again After Losing Two Goals

Seoul's counterattack was unsuccessful. In the 12th minute, a visiting team defender, eager to save the ball at 30 yards, used his hand to touch the ball. Fei Chunhua took a free kick, Xiao Ziwen waited in front of the goal and added a kick. Hong Deyong was stunned, and the ball had already entered the net. The visiting team lost another city, 2-0.

Mutual Attacks, No Achievements

In the second half, Seoul counterattacked. Railway goalkeeper Zhang Qu blocked the shots from the left and right, saving the day. In the 10th minute, the Railway team's luck turned around, and the attack was fierce, but it was unsuccessful. In the 18th minute, Railway defender Xu Shengxuan left the field to rest and was replaced by Cao Liming. At this time, the Railway team's key defensive position suddenly became tense. In the 20th minute, Zheng Guozhen shot from the crowd eight yards in front of the Railway goal, but unfortunately, the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. The visiting team's failure to score this goal was fate and luck. The melee continued until the 28th minute. Fei Chunhua and Lu Qingxiang cooperated and attacked again, but they were all saved by the enemy defense. Li Yao's shot flew out like a shooting star, but it was a little off the mark. Eight minutes before the end of the match, the visiting team attacked again, but the Railway team put all its efforts into defense, to no avail. The Seoul team eventually suffered a defeat with a score of 2-0.
