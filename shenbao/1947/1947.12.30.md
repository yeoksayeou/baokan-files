[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th dispatch] Ambassador Stuart Leighton is scheduled to fly to Nanjing by special plane on the morning of the 30th.

[United Press, Beiping, 29th dispatch] Ambassador Stuart issued a "Letter to the Chinese People" at a conference of the Journalism Department of Yenching University here, stating that if China's progressive elements persist in striving for democratic reform, then American aid during this critical period can not only provide technical and material assistance but also inspire new hope.

To avoid external misinterpretation, Ambassador Stuart reiterated the outline of his speech, stating: "If there is a plan that can prevent all American aid from being wasted," then the United States would be very hopeful of approving it. The State Department is currently drafting this plan, preparing to submit it to Congress next month, but "it is still too early to express any more specific opinions."

The Ambassador stated: "I have pointed out that the Constitution of China is now in effect, but some people doubt whether it can be more effective than the Constitution on paper. I believe that this depends on the efforts of the Chinese people."

"Although most people are too busy with their daily lives to be interested in this, intellectuals, non-party members, liberals, and journalists should rise up to defend the rights and

A single government, on the one hand, cannot make the constitution work. Reform that is essential cannot be achieved solely by the government taking the initiative, but through freedom of speech, publication, and assembly, as well as the correct execution of elections, the people can achieve reform through democratic means, and many responsible officials in the government are also eager for effective reform."

"What the American government and people want is also what most Chinese people seek - unification, peace, economic recovery, and a truly democratic government. Under these circumstances, there can be American aid, and there is great sympathy for China among the American people."

### Soviet Strategy Towards China Forewarns of Change

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] Neutral political observers here stated on the 29th that the Moscow radio station's criticism of the Kuomintang and China's new constitution is the strongest attack made by the Moscow official agency on the Chinese government to date, reflecting a shift in the Soviet Union's strategy towards China.

### Ji Xuetang is in Taiwan; Says Dalian is Becoming Increasingly Desolate

[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 29th dispatch] Ji Xuetang, the mayor of Dalian, arrived in Kaohsiung from Tainan at 2:00 PM on the 28th. After visiting the Kaohsiung Commercial Port factory today, he took a car to Taipei. Mr. Gong told reporters that Dalian, two years after its restoration, has been unable to be taken over due to unexpected international influences, forming a special zone. The people are suffering from political and economic oppression and are fleeing abroad. Qingdao, Yantai, Shenyang, Jinan, and other places are full of refugees from Dalian. At the time of victory in the Anti-Japanese War, Dalian still had a population of over 1.3 million, but by the end of last year, it was only 1 million. According to recent news, it is now less than 600,000. The large-scale exodus of refugees has caused Dalian to become desolate and decline. While in exile, they all hope that the government will seriously negotiate and actively proceed with the takeover, so that the exiles can return to their hometowns and those in their hometowns can be relieved of their hardships.

### New Post of Xiong Shihui Announced; Appointed Member of the Strategic Advisory Committee; Luo Zhuoying and Feng Qinzai Appointed Deputy Directors of Two Headquarters

### Chief of Staff of the North China Headquarters Talks to Foreign Reporters; Soviets Assist Communist Rebellion in the Northeast; National Army Will Eventually Defeat the Communists

[United Press, Beiping, 28th dispatch] Xu Qiming, Chief of Staff of the North China Headquarters, stated to United Press reporters on the 28th that the Soviet Union is supplying the communist bandits in the Northeast with advisors, light weapons, and communications equipment. If the Soviet Union can control China through the Communist Party, then Vietnam and Burma, and in fact the entire East Asia, will be lost. The United States will only have one ally, Japan, in the Far East. CCP leader Zhou Enlai is prepared to go to Moscow to discuss barter trade between the Northeast and the Soviet Union. Although the commanders of the National Army welcome foreign aid, they also know that it is not reliable, but they will eventually be able to defeat the communist bandits. The situation in the Northeast is very tense. The great battle of Shenyang is expected to begin within a week in Xinmin. However, it is believed that Shenyang can be defended, as the National Army has sufficient forces there. Only the forces on the section of the BeiNing Railway outside the customs are relatively weak, so Suizhong has been reinforced. The communist bandits believe that with Soviet assistance, they can conquer China, but they must obtain the support of the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people all resent the communist bandits. Although they are forced to obey in the communist areas, they will side with the National Army as soon as they have the opportunity. Mr. Xu does not believe that the communist bandits will attack Tianjin and Beiping, because the National Army has sufficient forces to defend them, which the communist bandits know. Therefore, their target may be Baoding and the destruction of the PingSui Railway.

### Reward Talent and Improve Administrative Efficiency; Year-End Performance Evaluation Must Be Serious; Chairman's Handwritten Instruction Transferred to All Agencies by the Executive Yuan for Compliance

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] Chairman Chiang recently issued a handwritten instruction to the Executive Yuan, ordering it to transfer it to all agencies. At the end of the year, the practice of rewarding outstanding personnel should be carried out seriously, and strict assessments should be made to emphasize the dignity of the government. The text of the instruction is as follows: "It is found that the year-end performance evaluations of various agencies, especially the selection of the most outstanding personnel, are intended to encourage the officials and commend special achievements. However, since the implementation in previous years, many have engaged in it seriously, but it is inevitable that some have merely gone through the motions. It is deeply felt that there are cases of favoritism and indiscriminate selection, or rotating to fill the numbers, or work achievements are not listed with concrete facts, or the submission of forms is not done within the prescribed time limit. How can we achieve fairness and obtain practical results? A special telegram is sent for reference, and it is hoped that it will be transferred to the subordinate ministries, commissions, departments, bureaus, and the responsible officials of the provincial and municipal governments, so that they must handle it seriously and strictly assess it in the future. All statements must be verified and in accordance with the facts, and meet the people's expectations, in order to meet the purpose of rewarding talent and improving administrative efficiency. A special order is given for compliance." It is learned that the Executive Yuan has ordered all responsible agencies throughout the country to comply.

The garrison retaliated, and the two sides engaged in fierce fighting for five hours. By around 2:00 AM on the 28th, the bandits left over a hundred corpses and retreated, fleeing north across the BeiNing Railway, attempting to meet up with the bandits in the northwest area of Shenyang and harass the suburbs again.

Editorial

### Accusation Against Hideki Tojo

The individual trials conducted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, which began on August 4th of this year, have now entered their final and most important phase. Former Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo appeared in court on the 20th of this month for trial. On the 22nd, Prosecutor Bligh announced the 245-page statement of charges, and on the 26th, the war criminal Tojo presented a 60,000-word defense. The defendant's lawyer, Dr. Ichiro Kiyose, delivered eloquent arguments, striving to exonerate Tojo, and in recent days, a small number of Japanese newspapers have even rallied to his support. The trial of Tojo is the central trial for all war criminals; the establishment of Tojo's war crimes is the establishment of the crimes of all war criminals. Now, the whole world is focused on Tojo's trial. China suffered the most tragic and profound invasion by Japanese militarists. Tojo's poisoning and persecution of China are unforgettable to our 400 million people. Today, as Tojo stands trial in an international court, and as Tojo and Kiyose unleash their eloquence, we should, based on facts and truth, straightforwardly and solemnly accuse them. Moreover, we want world public opinion to unanimously condemn them, condemning them for the sake of truth and justice, overwhelming Tojo before the sacred law!

We Chinese advocate not dwelling on past grievances and not going too far. However, on the issue of the Japanese invasion of China, we can forgive innocent Japanese civilians, but we insist that war criminals, especially the chief culprits like Tojo, must never be forgiven. Hideki Tojo was the chief instigator of the Japanese militarists. Japanese soldiers and high-ranking officials revered him as the "Sei-i Taishogun" (Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians). He served as the Minister of the Army in the Konoe Cabinet twice, and in October 1941, he forced Konoe out and appointed himself Prime Minister. He was the mainstay of the Japanese wartime cabinet, and his iron fist could command the army and air force. Japan's continuous invasion of China was initiated by him. Japan's invasion of Burma and Vietnam, the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the launch of the so-called "Greater East Asia War" were also masterminded by him. Shattering Japan's party politics, implementing military interference in politics, and establishing a fascist regime were his masterpieces. Adopting Axis hopefulness and joining the Tripartite Pact with Yosuke Matsuoka and others, declaring war on Britain and the United States, were all led by him. Tojo's crimes are well-documented, cunning, and notorious worldwide. The writings of Japanese people after the defeat exposed the crimes of the rampaging militarists, and they all unanimously blamed Tojo, knowing it without the prosecutor's accusations. Tojo is the number one Class A war criminal. His sins are unprecedented, his accumulated power and wickedness have spread far and wide. His crimes are a concentration of the crimes of the Japanese militarists. Today, even if he has a 60,000-word defense and Kiyose Ichiro's eloquence, the facts are undeniable, and they cannot absolve him of the slightest bit of his crimes. People all over the world are his plaintiffs and witnesses to his crimes!

Tojo has been in custody for more than a year, embracing Buddhism in an attempt to prolong his life and shift the world's hatred of him. However, his rationality has long been extinguished. Today, although he uses a false Buddhist heart to publish crazy theories and unleash his eloquence, intending to escape punishment, we believe that the judges of the International Court have conscience and reason and will certainly not be deceived by him, confusing their own judgment. We hereby vehemently denounce Tojo and Kiyose's evasions, to uphold justice.

1. Tojo stood before the International Military Tribunal and admitted that he was fully responsible for the Pacific War and Japan's defeat but denied committing any crimes. He defended the attack on Pearl Harbor by arguing that Japan had prior knowledge of the United States' plan to wage war against Japan, so Japan's war was out of self-defense. This is nonsense. We can point out from the "Konoe Diary," Tanaka Ryukichi's "The True Story of the Japanese Militarists Ruining the Country," and Mori Masazou's "Twenty Years of Whirlwind" that the Pacific War was the result of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, a pre-determined plan by Tojo and Matsuoka. As for the negotiations between Nomura and President Roosevelt, and Konoe's dealings with Ambassador Grew, they were merely attempts to ease the tense situation between Japan and the United States; but they ultimately failed due to Tojo's obstruction. Tojo and Matsuoka advocated making a desperate gamble to fulfill their promise to Hitler. He said to Konoe: "Sometimes in life, you might as well close your eyes and take a risk!" However, Konoe ultimately resigned due to a lack of courage to fight against Britain and the United States. Tojo, with the support of the inner circle, formed a cabinet in October 1941, a Japanese cabinet that fought on two fronts. On the night of the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt sent a telegram to Tokyo hoping for peace. Tojo firmly believed that the blitzkrieg could win in three months. He eliminated all resistance within the country and resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, making a desperate gamble. Later, the American military counterattacked and won, and the Tojo cabinet resigned, but Tojo's power did not fall. He still controlled the will and actions of the army and the inner circle of high-ranking officials. He was ultimately a leader of the war against Britain and the United States. On the ninth day after Japan surrendered and signed the surrender document, Marshal MacArthur's first arrest warrant was to arrest Tojo. He had attempted suicide out of fear of guilt but failed. This shows that Tojo had realized the magnitude of his war crimes, a fact that could not be escaped. Undoubtedly, he was an accomplice to the rampant evil of Hitler, no "weaker" than Hitler. He waged war against Britain and the United States, harboring the sinister intention of dominating the Pacific and entering the American mainland. Tojo and his colleagues should bear full responsibility for the war crimes!

2. Tojo defended himself by saying that Japan was "encircled" by the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands, making it impossible to resolve the "China Incident." Lawyer Kiyose even defended that the main purpose of the Tojo cabinet was to peacefully resolve the China Incident and wildly claimed that the signing of the Tripartite Pact was to resolve the China Incident and avoid a Japanese-American war. This is another set of familiar lies. In Tanaka Ryukichi's writings, it is clearly pointed out that Tojo advocated fighting China to the end. During the Battle of Hankou, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, through Shumei Okawa, attempted to end the Sino-Japanese War, but it was rejected by Tojo. Konoe's support for Wang Jingwei's puppet regime stated that Chongqing was not a negotiating partner, and Tojo was Konoe's accomplice. Konoe supported the puppet regime in exchange for Tojo and his army's support. In 1941, Konoe intended to compromise with the United States. The United States set the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China as a condition. Konoe hesitated and repeatedly had earnest talks with Tojo. Tojo replied, "The issue of stationing troops is the life of the army and cannot be conceded absolutely" (see Konoe Diary). These are all facts of Tojo refusing peace. After Tojo formed the cabinet, Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko also suggested to Tojo to negotiate peace with Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek, but Tojo firmly said, "Absolutely opposed! Our situation is very good now, let's not talk about those issues anymore." Higashikuni wanted to use President Chiang as a medium to mediate the American-Japanese war, but Tojo said with an even firmer attitude: "That time has not yet arrived. We don't know how optimistic the situation will develop if we continue like this. Anyway, now is not the time to hope for peace" (see Higashikuni Diary). It can be seen that Tojo consistently advocated using force to carry out the invasion of China and had no intention of peace. According to Tanaka Ryukichi's accusation, Tojo was a person who strongly advocated fighting on two fronts as a means to resolve the "China Incident," and he always wanted to enslave the Chinese people. The facts are very clear. Tojo and Kiyose's sophistry is simply irrefutable. Undoubtedly, he is the main culprit in the invasion of China. He commanded his army colleagues to massacre the Chinese people and cruelly kill the innocent. Tojo should bear full responsibility for the war crimes!

Other acts, such as the invasion of Burma and Vietnam, the killing of prisoners of war, and the torture and execution of American Air Force officers, were all consistent with Tojo's barbarity. How can these undeniable facts be whitewashed today? Tojo stood before the International Military Tribunal, using a "Buddhist heart" in an attempt to escape punishment or hoping that the Allied countries would reduce his criminal behavior. It is truly shameless! We will make a brief statement of these ironclad facts to the world to overthrow Tojo's clever statements and Kiyose's false evasions. We demand that truth and justice be upheld; we insist that the principle that "aggressive war is a crime" remains unchanged; we have the right to demand that the International Military Tribunal for the Far East sentence all Japanese war criminals as soon as possible. We have the facts as honest witnesses, demanding the trial of Hideki Tojo, so that he falls before truth, justice, and the law, and is not spared in the slightest!

### Strike Wave at Central University; Students and School Officials Have Not Yet Reached an Agreement to Resume Classes

[Reported by this newspaper in Nanjing on the 29th] Since a partial strike began on the 25th by Central University students in protest of the expulsion of eight students, the number of striking departments and grades has reached 109 as of the 29th. At 11:00 p.m. on the 28th, the school officials appointed eight professors to hold negotiations with representatives from the department and grade associations, resulting in four resolutions: 1. Whether to restore the Department and Grade Representative Council and the Party Establishment Committee will be decided by a vote of all students and faculty; 2. If the vote decides to restore them, their responsibilities will be the same as in the past. The candidates and organization of the Student Union Council will be decided by the newly elected Department and Grade Representative Assembly; 3. The eight professors will convey to the school affairs meeting a proposal to withdraw the order to expel the students; 4. During the negotiation process, students must not publicize to the outside world and must not march or strike. Another decision was made during the negotiations: The professors believed that the students should resume classes first, and then use these four resolutions to request the school to implement them. The students insisted on obtaining a conclusion first before resuming classes. However, both sides held their own views and failed to reach a conclusion. A second negotiation was scheduled for 12:00 p.m. on the 29th, and as of 12:30 a.m. this morning, the two sides had still not reached an agreement.

### Students from Eight Universities in Peiping and Tientsin Oppose the Student Union Regulations

[Reported by this newspaper in Peiping on the 29th] Student unions from eight universities in Peiping and Tientsin (Tsinghua, Yenching, Peking University, Sino-French University, Teachers College, Nankai, Peiyang, and Hebei Institute of Technology) jointly issued a statement yesterday opposing the student union regulations announced by the Ministry of Education on the 14th, requesting that the order be rescinded.

### Explanation of the Key Points of the Education Authorities' Amendment to the Student Union Regulations

[Reported by this newspaper in Nanjing on the 29th] This newspaper's reporter inquired with the education authorities about their opinion on the student union regulations announced by the Ministry of Education. According to the discussion: In order to enable student unions to fully develop an atmosphere of academic research and foster the spirit of student autonomy, and in view of the fact that some clauses in the student union regulations announced in November of the 32nd year (1943) were not in line with the current situation, the Ministry of Education decided to make important amendments after several months of detailed study: First, to delete the original Article 7, "Whether they are members of the Chinese Kuomintang or members of the Three People's Principles Youth League"; Second, to abolish the indirect election system and adopt a direct election system; Third, to relax the number of directors, and stipulate them separately according to the proportion of the number of students in each school, up to a maximum of 45, so that students' opinions can be expressed more widely; Fourth, to comply with the ideal of selecting the virtuous and capable, stipulating that directors should be elected from those who have excellent conduct and academic performance and who have leadership abilities. Although the wording of the other clauses has been slightly modified, they are mostly the original regulations. In summary, the key points of this amendment are based on the following principles: 1. To comply with the implementation of the Constitution and abolish the regulations concerning party members and league members; 2. To train the spirit of student autonomy and adopt direct elections so that student opinions can be expressed more widely, making it more democratic; 3. To encourage academic research and allow students with excellent academic performance to serve as directors of the student union as a model. Students should focus on academic research and enriching their intelligence during their time at school; students at school should not be used by others as tools for political struggle. In the past, the organization of student unions in a small number of schools did not fully comply with the regulations, and their actions were often excessive, even interfering with school administration and neglecting their studies, and they were controlled by a small number of individuals with ulterior motives, serving as tools for political struggle. In order to achieve the true purpose of student unions in the future, it is necessary to thoroughly implement the amended regulations.

### Boy Scout Martyred in Anti-Banditry in Shimen; Boy Scout Association Decides to Grant Preferential Treatment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Boy Scout Association learned that the Shimen City Branch of the Boy Scouts of China in Hebei Province mobilized more than 1,000 boys and girls from the city on the 4th of last month during the Battle of Shimen to organize a battlefield service team led by Yang Guoying. They took on the work of battlefield stretcher-bearers, rescue, nursing, and transportation, and assisted the National Army in constructing fortifications, checking household registrations, and preventing the movement of spies. Unfortunately, due to the large number of bandits compared to our forces, after nine days and nights of fighting, the National Army finally withdrew, resulting in heavy casualties among the military and civilians. The scout group suffered 13 casualties, including Yan Fahe and Du Ping. Eight people, including Xu Duo, were injured and are being treated in hospitals. Shan Zizhen was captured and his whereabouts are unknown. The scouts who died, were injured, or captured were all students at various middle schools in the city. Their loyalty, service, and spirit of sacrifice are admirable. The Party and the Military Association have decided to grant preferential treatment and relief.

### Tragedy in the Seas off Jiangsu and Zhejiang; Dozens of Fishing Boats Capsize

### Hai River Freezes Again; Strike of Tientsin Ships Under Mediation

[Central News Agency, Tientsin, 29th] The Hai River ice freeze is getting worse again. After the initial melting of the heavy snow, the northwest wind is strong. The Hai River generally froze on the evening of the 28th, especially near Gugu. Although the icebreaker from the Hai River Engineering Bureau was dispatched to break the ice, it has a sense of powerlessness. Four ships remaining in Tientsin, Huangxing and Nansheng, etc., are scheduled to try to sail out on the 30th. If they can break through the ice, they can sail to Shanghai. Otherwise, the Tientsin-Gugu shipping problem will reach the most stable stage.

[Associated Press, Tientsin, 29th] The strike of employees of various transport ships in Tientsin has reached its third day on the 29th. The reason is that a small boat carrying some soldiers was overturned by a ship of the China Merchants Bureau, and several people fell into the water. The soldiers then fired at the ship, so the sailors and drivers went on strike to protest. A total of eleven ships are on strike. The striking sailors are demanding that the soldiers involved be punished. The striking sailors claim that the ship had sounded its whistle as a warning, but the small boat stubbornly ignored it and refused to move aside, leading to the accident. After the soldiers opened fire, they confined the captain and officers to the barracks, stripped them of their clothes, and poured cold water on them. The striking sailors are demanding compensation for the injured employees and guarantees that the same incident will not happen again in the future. The Mayor of Tientsin is currently mediating.

### Truman Severely Criticizes Anti-Inflation Bill; Believes It Interferes with Presidential Authority and is Insufficient to Curb Prices; Signs It Nevertheless Due to Factual Need

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] President Truman believes that the anti-inflation bill passed by Congress is completely inadequate to cope with runaway prices and has indicated that he will sign the bill with extreme disappointment. Truman pointed out that the anti-inflation bill passed by Congress only includes three minor points of the ten-point plan submitted to Congress in November. However, as the measures listed in the bill are still necessary at present, he will still sign it. However, he feels that the bill does not include key measures, cannot become an effective anti-inflation measure, and is insufficient to curb prices or prevent prices from rising further. Truman also pointed out that inflation and the high cost of living pose a very serious danger to the American people. If inflation is not stopped, it could cause an economic panic and bring indescribable suffering. Truman also pointed out that the bill passed by Congress attempts to interfere with the President's historical authority. Article 6 stipulates that the President should submit to Congress extremely detailed and specific recommendations on the allocation of scarce items, and Congress may decide on a case-by-case basis whether to adopt the measures proposed by the President and the details of the measures, and then pass legislation to allow their implementation. Truman further criticized the bill's rejection of giving the government the power to compel agriculture, industry, and commerce to comply with government orders, pointing out that the fight against inflation can never rely solely on voluntary action. Truman then urged Congress to take effective and implementable anti-inflation plans when it resumes its regular session in early January. At the same time, he listed the price increases since the special session of Congress on November 17, pointing out that Washington butter was 88 cents per pound at that time, and has risen to $1.05 last week. Men's leather shoes in Pittsburgh were $8.72 per pair, and have now risen to $9.38. The price of pork in Chicago has risen from $24.75 per hundred pounds to $26.40 in six weeks. White House Press Secretary Ross announced that Truman will sign the anti-inflation bill passed by Congress on Monday, which includes export controls, brewing, control of grain use, and scarce items for industrial estimation, etc.

### How to Curb High Prices Will Be a Major Platform in the US Elections; Democrats and Republicans Begin Blaming Each Other

[United Press, Washington, 29th] How to curb high prices seems to be one of the important political platforms of various parties in the upcoming US elections next year. For this reason, the mutual accusations between the Democratic and Republican parties are becoming more intense. After Truman accused the Republican anti-inflation bill of being weak, powerless, and very inappropriate, House Republican Leader Halleck and House Banking Committee Chairman Wolcott retorted: The bill advocated by the President and his powers also cannot bring down prices. Wolcott added: "If prices cannot be brought down, then it must be the fault of the President, not Congress."

[United Press, Washington, 28th] When President Truman issued a statement on the 28th, House Republican Leader Halleck even attacked the President for being responsible for high prices, and strongly stated that the Democratic Party would suffer a severe blow in next year's general election. Halleck claimed: The fundamental reasons for high prices are, first, the loose financial policy of the administration, and second, the excessively large quantity of goods exported to foreign countries.

### Vandenberg-Taft Coordination Not Impossible; US Republicans Strive for Cooperation Between the Two

[United Press, Washington, 29th] According to various indications, Senate Republicans will do everything possible to reverse the opposition between the two Republican leaders (Vandenberg and Taft) on the European Recovery Program in the election year. Political observers say: This division, even if the Republican Party disagrees on a major issue, will make it difficult for the Republican Party to draft an outline of foreign policy at the national convention next summer. The Republican Party believes that there is no insurmountable gap between Vandenberg and Taft's views, because there is reason to believe that both of them are seeking mutual coordination on the issue of foreign aid. The Republican Party may have a clear understanding when it convenes a policy committee meeting next week.

### US State Department Forms Expert Committee to Review European Recovery Plan; Government Leaders Plan to Get Congress to Pass It

[Our Dispatch] New York Radio, 29th: Washington News, government officials say that if aid to the European Recovery Program fails or is rejected by Congress, resulting in Europe being controlled by the Communist Party, the United States will have to spend $20 billion annually to strengthen its national defense. The plan to aid the recovery of 16 European countries requires $17 billion, which is not a large price, although it is difficult to say how effective it will be at this time.

Government leaders are currently studying the aid to Europe plan in detail in order to persuade Congress. If Congress reduces the amount of aid to Europe, the recovery of Europe will be delayed. In particular, the first year of aid is the most important. The US military budget depends on whether Soviet power will expand to the Atlantic coast. If Europe is controlled by the Soviet Union, the United States will have to double its current annual military expenditure of $11.79 billion.

[Reuters, New York, 29th] Officials at the State Department responsible for guiding and reviewing Europe's recovery needs have formed a so-called "Technical Experts Committee for the European Recovery Program." According to Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thorp at the American Statistical Association, the review of Europe's recovery needs and the study of the United States' own economic capacity is Washington's most difficult and complex task in history.

### US Policy Toward the Soviet Union; Appeasement is Not the Best Policy, But Neither is Hardline; Sayre Expresses His Views

[United Press, Washington, 28th] UN Trusteeship Council Chairman Sayre presented four plans on the 28th as the basis for US policy toward the Soviet Union. He emphasized that the United States can neither "appease" the Soviet Union nor be "hardline toward the Soviet Union." He said in a speech to the American Political Science Association: 1. We must implement policies that conform to public reason, humanity, and justice, otherwise the United States will lose its leadership. 2. The United States must decide its own path regardless of the Soviet Union's condemnation. The Soviet Union's condemnation is partly due to panic, partly due to deeply rooted inferiority, and partly due to widespread ignorance. 3. The United States must not appease, otherwise it will lead to a tragic situation. The path to peace depends on adhering to public reason. 4. But this does not mean that we should be hardline toward the Soviet Union. The United States must try its best to win the assistance of the Soviet people. We really cannot recognize that this is impossible.

He also said that a hungry and miserable Europe could become a "Soviet Europe," but if the Marshall Plan for the recovery of Europe is implemented to allow Europe to regenerate, the Soviet Union will be forced by the current conditions in Europe to fundamentally change its foreign policy. Mr. Sayre finally said that although the Soviet Union's words and deeds are provocative, it is not currently prepared to fight any major power, and there is still a glimmer of hope for a peaceful solution.

### Chen Lifu and Chiang Ching-kuo Arrive in Shanghai Together from Nanjing; Instruct on Party-Youth League Merger During Memorial Week; Emphasize Close Cooperation Among Comrades

[Report from this Newspaper] The personnel of the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the Kuomintang and all its subordinate levels will have considerable adjustments on the 12th to promote the smooth progress of various tasks after the Party-Youth League merger. Minister Chen Lifu and Instructor Chiang Ching-kuo arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to jointly guide the progress of this matter. When Mr. Chen met with reporters, he said: After the merger of the lower-level organizations of the Party and the Youth League, everything must be brought into order. The general registration of party members must be actively carried out, because in the past, party members had party membership cards and Youth League members had Youth League membership cards. After the merger, new cards must be issued separately and the old cards must be cancelled.

Unsatisfactory Review of Work

Yesterday, the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Department held an enlarged memorial week at the Municipal Gymnasium to welcome the arrival of Mr. Chen and Mr. Chiang for instruction. In addition to cadres at all levels, Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Director Wu Kaixian also participated. Mayor Wu arrived before the ceremony to meet with the two gentlemen and then left first. Chairman Fang Zhi reviewed the work of the past year and believed that there were several unsatisfactory points: The general registration of party members was originally scheduled to be completed this month, and Nanjing has basically come to an end, but this city is still in the preparatory stage; After the merger of the Party and the Youth League, the work of some district party departments has not yet been launched; Party members have failed to actively assist the government in suppressing the rebellion, but have shown a negative attitude, which is really inappropriate. After the resignation, Minister Chen Lifu was invited to give instructions. [Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Wei, director of the Municipal Health Bureau, Huang Zengshan, director of the Penglai Branch of the Third District Health Center of the Health Bureau, and Liu Yixun of the Materials Section of the Health Bureau were previously sued by Lu Shusheng, a citizen, in the Civil Court of the District Court, filing a lawsuit to vacate the house. The reason is that the front and rear buildings of the municipal house at 584 Zhonghua Road are Lu's property. During the fall of Shanghai, it was occupied by a puppet health agency. After the victory, it was taken over by the Health Bureau, and a health branch was set up there. Lu then submitted a property certificate to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, requesting its return. After investigation by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, it was confirmed that it was Lu's property and was approved for return. However, due to the large number of health equipment in the branch, it was impossible to vacate it for a while, resulting in a lawsuit. Yesterday, He Xianzhang, a judge of the Civil Court of the District Court, ruled that the defendants Zhang Wei, etc. lost the case. The rear building should be returned to the plaintiff within one month, and the front building should be returned to the plaintiff within one year and six months. The advanced house compensates the plaintiff with a monthly rent of 200,000 legal currency from December 20, 1945, until the date of relocation. During the rental period of the front building, the plaintiff will be given 150,000 legal currency per month from the day after the relocation of the rear building. The plaintiff provides a guarantee deposit of 10 million legal currency, which is allowed for provisional execution. The remaining lawsuit and provisional execution are dismissed, and the litigation costs are borne by the defendants.

Do Not Hinder Cooperation for Private Gain

Mr. Chen then reviewed the results of the establishment of the Youth League and the need for the merger of the Party and the Youth League today. His words were frank, and he briefly said: For twenty years, the Kuomintang has been a revolutionary fighting body. Its strategies and tactics have often changed with the times and environment, and it has finally defeated the warlords and bureaucratic traitors. The current major enemy is undoubtedly the Communist Party, and the experience of twenty years of struggle proves that only the Communist Party can be the Kuomintang's opponent. The objective environment when the Youth League was established was that the Communist Party could obey the Three Principles of the People and cancel the Red Army. Therefore, the establishment of the League was to unify the small organizations within the Party and to unite the youth outside the Party. At that time, I repeatedly advocated that the Youth League should be "organized for training, not organized for the sake of organization." Today, the objective situation has changed, and revolutionary forces must be concentrated again, so there is the merger of the Party and the Youth League. In fact, the emergence and merger of the League are all strategies of the revolution. Comrades must never hinder their cooperation for personal gain today, otherwise they will make mistakes, etc. Chiang Ching-kuo then delivered a speech, emphasizing that after the merger of the Party and the Youth League, comrades should cooperate closely and should not affect unity due to prejudices. The memorial week ended near noon.

### Apprentice Fooled by a Gambling Den in a Restaurant; Impersonating the Daughter of the Manager of a Rubber Factory, He Cheated Six Diamond Rings from a Jewelry Store

[Report from this Newspaper] At about 9:00 am the other day, a young girl came to the Hukong Jewelry Store on East Zhongzheng Road. She was about twenty years old, dressed luxuriously, and had a beautiful appearance. She claimed that her father was Wang Zutong, the manager of the Dachunghua Rubber Factory, and was currently at the Jinmen Hotel. The owner, Da Qingbin, immediately ordered his apprentice, Da Mingzhong, to bring the diamond rings and accompany her in the store's three-wheeled vehicle. Upon arrival, they did not meet him, so they went out together. The girl said clearly that my home is at 27 Lafay Fang, Fuxing Middle Road. Please take the goods back temporarily, and I will look at the goods and negotiate the price when needed, etc. That afternoon at 6:00 or 7:00 pm, a waiter from the Xin Sanhe Restaurant on West Tibet Road suddenly brought a note to the store asking them to send someone to the restaurant to look at the goods. The store still ordered the apprentice to send it. Sure enough, there were two tables of food in a certain room on the second floor, and the girl was sitting alone in the room. After looking at the goods, the girl falsely claimed that her father was entertaining guests here tonight and was talking with friends next door. She planned to send the diamond ring over and let them choose, and asked Da to wait here for a while, placing the leather tube on the table and leaving in a hurry. Unexpectedly, she never returned. After more than ten minutes, the apprentice realized he had been fooled. He asked the waiter, who said he did not know the girl. He had come to the restaurant in the afternoon to order two tables of food to entertain guests. He quickly rushed out to chase, and according to the rickshaw driver at the entrance, he caught a glimpse of her acting flustered and heading south. The apprentice Da Mingzhong returned to the store to report and then went to the police station with the owner Da Qingbin to ask for investigation. It is reported that the six diamond rings are worth more than 100 million yuan.

### Deputy Manager and Four Others of Tongyuan Bank Subpoenaed for Illegal Activities

[Report from this Newspaper] The Tongyuan Bank was accused of violating the Banking Law and was previously transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation by the Ministry of Finance. When the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to audit the bank's business, it was found that the bank had privately established secret accounts, such as the Dechang branch in the Jiufeng Silk Weaving Company. There was actually no such business. After the death of Chen Shengwu, the former manager of the bank, his medical expenses and burial expenses were all paid from the Dechang account, which did not comply with regulations. In addition, when the bank had a shortage of funds, it falsely used the name of a business to discount Shanghai Bank's funds. All of this violated Article 43 of the Banking Law. In addition to the non-compliant aspects of the business, the Ministry of Finance ordered corrections, and the remaining violations were referred to the District Procuratorate for investigation.

### Movie Ticket Prices Must Rise; Another Delegation Sent to Bureau for Consultation Yesterday

[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the issue of movie ticket price increases, the Cinema Business Association sent another delegation to the Social Affairs Bureau for consultations yesterday. According to Zhou Hongguang, secretary-general of the association, the Social Affairs Bureau advocated deciding on price increases based on the profit and loss situation of the cinemas. The association could not agree, because the equipment and location of each theater are different, and the profit and loss situation of the business is also different. It is really difficult to comply. The authorities have always divided the control of general commodity prices into three types: limit price, negotiated price, and quoted price. The lowest ticket price for movies is the limit price, and the rest are quoted prices. Therefore, even if the Social Affairs Bureau approves it locally, each cinema is scheduled to increase prices starting on New Year's Day. In order to comply with the limit price, the first-class seat will only increase from 10,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan, while the rest will increase by a higher percentage. However, it will not exceed 80% at most.

### Snow and Fog in Shenyang - Eyebrows Covered with Frost, Hats Covered with Ice

"When the sun is up for a while, it's cold enough to freeze the little devils to death." This is a Northeast saying that compares the terrifying cold of the sunrise in winter. Yes, the cold of the Northeast night is terrifying, and the morning is even more frightening. The chilling wind really makes people uncomfortable.

The trees on both sides of the road are covered with ice and frost, with rows of "snow trees and silver flowers," which are extremely magnificent. The low trees are all wearing white hats, which is another kind of fun. In addition, the hazy fog renders the morning time even colder and more mysterious.

The horse-drawn carriages on the street

Come out early to do business. The horses are covered with raincoats, and the coachmen are wearing silver armor. The wheels press on the snowy streets, making a creaking sound.

Elementary school students and civil servants hurried to school and the office. The girls with their mouths covered breathed on their hair, covering it with white frost, turning them into old women. The young men became white-browed and silver-haired grandpas.

As the sun rose higher, the haze and frost gradually disappeared. The stalls selling tofu, cabbage, and corn flour gradually increased. The shouts of "roasted sweet potatoes" and "candied haws" continued.

The vegetable market has frozen pork and beef, and pitifully few fish and shrimp mixed with ice. The green and white cabbage and red carrots are all covered in cotton-padded baskets. Garlic sprouts and spinach are hidden like treasures. The young ladies with servants and attendants are rarely seen in the vegetable market.

After noon, the peddlers selling coal and kerosene lamps shouted one after another in the streets and alleys: "Buy kerosene lamps, change lampshades, fill up kerosene..." Because there is no electricity, they are doing this

Abnormal business

Making the streets and alleys their world.

The "Kasuga-cho Night Market" during the Japanese era was said to be very lively and prosperous. In recent years, this area is still the prosperous area of Shenyang, but because the peddlers selling groceries on the street have been driven to the nearby streets and alleys, and the source of goods is blocked, it has gradually declined.

During the day, the shops with their doors and windows covered with a layer of thick frost have sparse customers. The "Youth Cooperative" is one of the places with more people coming in and out. The Koreans selling American lighters, pens, cosmetics, and some Shanghai goods - some of them are our compatriots - have glass cabinets filled with novel little things, but because of weak purchasing power, it is far from what it used to be.

The medical books and daily necessities left by the Japanese are now like antiques, and some people are still selling them from hand to hand. Beierma Road in Heping District is where they set up their

Headquarters for street stalls

This autumn was their golden age for a while. Now, they only do business for a while around noon on sunny days. In the weather of minus twenty or thirty degrees, many people don't have that leisure.

In front and behind the seven-story building of the former "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association," now renamed the "Shenyang Guest House," there are some cafes and snack bars that broadcast popular songs, and some even have small orchestras performing. In the past, many people drank tea and ate curry, especially under the Rainbow Bridge, which was very lively. Now, it is cold, there is no electricity, and there is martial law, so it only does business for a short time in the afternoon.

The business of the big hotels is declining. There are few people treating guests, and the girls who sing and buy happiness are secretly filled with endless sadness. All entertainment venues also have poor business and no prospects.

The night, the winter night, comes especially early. At five o'clock, it is dark. At six o'clock, there is martial law. Every family closes their doors and windows. There is no electricity, and it is pitch black. The people sitting under the kerosene or bean oil lamps are calculating

Tomorrow's expenses

Everyone is saying: "Today, every pound of sorghum rice sells for 4,000 circulation coupons (about 42,000 legal currency), every pound of rice sells for 5,000 yuan (about 60,000 legal currency), and every pound of kerosene sells for 12,000 yuan (144,000 legal currency). I don't know how much it will jump tomorrow. Alas, how to live!" The night wind is blowing, and the temperature is dropping, constantly falling from minus seventeen or eighteen degrees, twenty degrees, thirty degrees... The people patrolling and sounding the hours, the police enforcing martial law, and the soldiers have frost on their shoulders and ice on their hats. Holding their guns, they stomp their feet, frowning, bearing heavy and tense hearts, hoping for the dawn. (Special Correspondent Han Qingqi)

### Inside Story of Fire at Guiyang Clothing Depot

[Report from Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 25th Telegram] The Second Clothing Depot of the Joint Operations Headquarters outside Nanmen Racecourse in Guiyang (belonging to the Chongqing US Aid Management Office) and the Eighteenth Clothing Depot (belonging to the Yunnan Supply Bureau) suddenly caught fire at 8:00 p.m. on the 20th and burned down. The fire was extinguished at 5:35 a.m. the next morning. According to estimates, the loss of military supplies is estimated to be more than 100 million yuan. After the reporter quickly inquired from all parties, according to reliable reports, the inside story is complicated and bizarre, and the behind-the-scenes news is still developing gradually. According to Liu Hanyu, director of the Guizhou Supply Bureau: The cause of the fire was that the guard on duty in the depot poured gasoline on cotton to wipe his clothes with a foreign candle and accidentally knocked the candle into an uncovered gasoline barrel, causing it to ignite.

Unable to extinguish

At that time, Major Gao, the person in charge of escorting the goods, was in the Far East Hotel in the city and had not returned. Although nearby people went to help, the guards were afraid that someone would take advantage of the fire to loot, and without orders, they were not allowed to enter. When the fire spread from the Second Clothing Depot to the nearby Eighteenth Clothing Depot, the people feared that the fire would spread and rushed in to help, but the guards opened fire to stop them, preventing them from entering. It was not until the fire at the Eighteenth Clothing Depot intensified that the two depots reported to the Provincial Capital Police Bureau Fire Brigade at 8:40. By the time they arrived at the scene, the fire had been burning for more than an hour. The two depots

Delayed reporting the fire

Whether there are other reasons is being paid attention to by all parties. Liu Ying, director of the Guizhou Supply Bureau, went to accompany the Provincial Party Headquarters Director Huang Guozhen to entertain all provincial staff members that night, and returned to the bureau at 8:30 after the banquet, where he heard of the fire. According to Liu, the two depots were not under the jurisdiction of the Guizhou Bureau, nor were they under supervision and command. He could have ignored them, but because they both belonged to the Joint Logistics Headquarters and in order to cherish national resources, he urgently gathered officials in the bureau. The fierce fire could not be approached, and the officials and soldiers of the bureau jumped into the fire and tried to rescue it, so the fire was extinguished at 12:00 midnight, and

Rescued the supplies

Most of them were also captured on the spot. Two duty depot soldiers and five escort officers were detained together. The depot soldiers were sent to the police station for interrogation, and the officers were taken to the bureau for interrogation. Later, at about 2:00 a.m. that night, the fire broke out again, burning the previously burned houses. A total of five houses in the two depots were burned down, and the loss of supplies, according to Director Liu's oral report and the Fire Brigade's written report to the police局局方之, differed greatly. After reporters investigated from various parties, the total value of the materials burned this time actually exceeded 100 million yuan (the fire brigade's report). The supplies burned at the Second Depot were transported from Kunming through Guiyang to Chongqing, and then transferred to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The supplies burned at the Eighteenth Depot were transported from Chongqing through Guiyang to Kunming.

Losses of the two depots

The materials included typewriters (Director Liu told reporters that the value of this material continued to be 600 billion yuan, fortunately most of it was rescued, but the fire brigade reported that very little was rescued), typewriter paper, Roosevelt wool, white wool socks, parachutes, cotton quilts, rubber shoes, and towels, among which rubber shoes and wool socks were the most lost. The broken shoes and socks after the burning piled up like earth. When they were transported from Chongqing and Kunming to Guiyang, they were divided into forty large trucks, which shows the large quantity.

The Guizhou Supply Bureau has now decided to seriously investigate on behalf of the higher authorities of the two depots. On the 23rd, the bureau sent Judicial Officer Yao to the Provincial Police Bureau to conduct a joint interrogation. Since criminal cases value the initial confession the most, this point must be taken seriously. (Special Correspondent Liu Xiangqi)

Yarn Control Committee's Cotton Purchase Business Entirely Entrusted to Textile Construction Office; Cotton Merchants Can Also Contact Textile Construction for Selling Stocked Cotton [This Newspaper's Report] Over ten representatives from the Shanghai Cotton Merchants' Association, including Liu Pingsun, went to the Yarn Control Committee yesterday morning to inquire about the future survival of cotton merchants and how to handle stocked cotton. Chairman Yuan stated that the cotton purchase business has been entirely entrusted to the Textile Construction Company. The previous idea of entrusting general cotton merchants as agents is not currently under consideration. The price of cotton sold by cotton merchants to the committee must be reasonable. Those who do not wish to sell immediately can do as they please. Those who wish to sell immediately can contact the Textile Construction Company. The representatives then visited Wu Weijing, the Deputy General Manager of the Textile Construction Company, to discuss the sale of stocked cotton and requested three points: The purchase price of cotton should be reasonable. The unemployment of cotton merchants' clients is concerning, and it is hoped that they will be used more when unified procurement of raw cotton occurs in the future. When transporting cotton to Shanghai, convenience should be provided when issuing Shanghai identification certificates. Mr. Wu stated that although the Yarn Control Committee has made a decision to entrust agents for purchase, no formal agreement has been established, and funds for cotton purchase have not been allocated, so there is nothing to discuss at this time. He also stated that all the requested points must be decided by the Yarn Control Committee, and he will speak on their behalf to leave more room for activity for cotton merchants. Cotton merchants still have business to do in the future, but they must find ways to grade cotton, strive for improvement, and refuse to purchase adulterated cotton. There is still hope for the future. It is heard that the representatives of the Cotton Merchants' Association have scheduled to continue discussing the direction of action at the association at 2:00 PM today. [Another Dispatch] The Hankou Cotton Merchants' Association, regarding the unified cotton purchase, sent a telegram to the Shanghai Cotton Merchants' Association yesterday, the text of which is as follows: To the Cotton Industry Association: Recently, the communist bandits have been disrupting the Hubei region, and Tianmen Zaoshi has been captured. The cotton-producing areas in western and northern Hubei have been affected, causing cotton merchants to hesitate and the purchase routes to be cut off. Recently, it has been heard that the government intends to control purchase and sales, which will not only cause a large amount of cotton to fall into the hands of the bandits, but also leave all cotton merchants with no hope of survival. How to jointly discuss a rescue plan relies entirely on your association's leadership to strive for unity. Our association pledges to be a backing and requests instructions on appropriate measures to take in response. Hankou Cotton Merchants' Association, Cotton Transport Industry Association, respectfully. Cotton Merchants to Register All Stocked Cotton with the Textile Adjustment Office [This Newspaper's Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee began registering all stocked cotton owned by cotton merchants yesterday. The registration period ends on January 8th of next year. The following matters should be noted when declaring registration: Companies, firms, and warehouses will be issued registration forms by the committee, which will be distributed by the industry associations for filling out. The industry associations will be responsible for reviewing and forwarding them to the committee. Individuals and those who have not joined an association should directly declare registration to the committee. When declaring registration, the amount, weight, type, packaging, and storage location of the stocked cotton should be accurately and clearly filled out. After declaring registration, if there are continued arrivals, the continued arrivals should also be reported in accordance with item 3. After declaring registration, if a transfer is necessary, the committee should be notified for record before the movement is allowed. It is heard that the committee has ordered all relevant industry associations to strictly comply with the above within the specified time. Yarn Industry Association Provides Opinion Paper The National Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Management Regulations have been approved and implemented by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd of this month. Tang Zhiliang, Chairman of the Yarn Industry Association, submitted a draft opinion paper to Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, for reference yesterday afternoon. The content is summarized as follows: The unified sale of cotton yarn should be done by yarn merchants. The business of yarn merchants is not limited to replication industries in this city, but also relies on yarn merchants to supply small cloth factories in various cities and rural areas across the country. In the unified sales methods, the quantity of yarn distributed to yarn merchants should be handled in accordance with the current distribution methods. The price regulations must have the participation of yarn industry members. All yarn merchants registered as members of the Textile Construction Company should be the main targets of unified sales. Interest Rate on Reserves for Native Banks Slightly Increased by the National Bank [This Newspaper's Report] The three industry associations of silver firms, money shops, and trust companies in this city, based on the requests of their members, stated that the interest rate on deposit reserves paid to the National Bank has been 2% per week. Over the past two years, the operating expenses of the members have increased, and the deposit interest rate on the market has gradually increased to 9 jiao per 1,000 yuan. They jointly sent a letter to the National Bank requesting a slight increase in the interest rate on deposit reserves to subsidize their expenses. It is now learned that the National Bank, in order to consider the cost of operations for native banks and money shops, has approved the adoption of the interest rate approved by the bank's Audit Department as the standard. The interest rates for the previous month and December will be calculated based on the interest rates at the end of May and November, still settled in two phases (the accumulated amount after every 20 days is included in the accumulated amount for the first month of the next phase for calculation). The Shanghai interest rate will be used as the standard for the entire country, and this regulation will be implemented starting next year.

Remittances from various places are still handled in accordance with the regulations of the Four Joint Offices, and the name of the remitter and the purpose of the remittance must be strictly reviewed before the remittance can be made. This method is purely to prevent the excessive concentration of funds in Shanghai, but it still takes into account the development of production and the circulation of materials. Currently, remittances from commercial banks and money shops in Shanghai, regardless of where they are remitted to, do not require review. Remittances from national banks and bureaus from various places to Shanghai require review procedures and are handled by the responsible persons of the local banks and bureaus. Remittances from Shanghai to various places, except for South China which is subject to restrictions, do not require review.

As a result, prices rose sharply by 120,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to last week. Transactions with Tianjin merchants remained sluggish due to hesitation from buyers. Input of Industrial Soap the Association Requests Withdrawal of the Order [This Newspaper's Report] The Fourth District Soap Industry Association, on the grounds that the Transport Control Committee approved the import of industrial soap without consulting the industry's opinion, which affects the industry's survival, immediately convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors, and unanimously decided to first request the Transport Control Committee to withdraw the order immediately, and listed the three points of the harm caused by the approval of industrial soap imports as follows: Domestic products already have a phenomenon of oversupply. Therefore, the above imports are obviously not necessary, and it disregards the waste of foreign exchange. Allowing foreign goods to be imported and compete with domestic products, the costs are     , and the situation is weak. It will not only harm the industry, but also go against the country's production and construction policies. "Fatty compounds with damaged structure" have a broad meaning, including many types of soap. All kinds of soap can be imported in large quantities under this name, which is unavoidable. Money Market Eases [This Newspaper's Report] The money market eased yesterday, with an overnight interest rate of 2.3%, and a Huagu share interest rate of 2.4%. The net inflow of the Four Banks and Two Bureaus was 105.1 billion yuan, the inflow of the Central Bank was 79.5 billion yuan, the inflow of large exchanges was 69.9 billion yuan, and the inflow of foreign merchants was 30.3 billion yuan.

Liquidation Transactions Predominate, Yarn Market Continues to Decline, Cotton Cloth Sales Are Sluggish, and the Market Narrowed [This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation was dominated by liquidation transactions as the Gregorian New Year approached. The industry's intention to accept deliveries was slack, replication factories were watching and waiting, and customers rarely made purchases. Business was very sparse, and the market continued to decline. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell slightly to 49.1 million yuan, a decrease of 900,000 yuan compared to the weekend price. The remaining coarse and fine yarns also fell by varying amounts, ranging from 120,000 to 670,000 yuan. The cotton cloth market opened with sluggish actual sales. Customers from the Yangtze River region, due to transportation obstacles, were selling. Industry and dyeing factories were all watching and waiting as the New Year approached.

The stock exchange will be closed for the New Year's holiday starting today and will reopen on January 4th, for a total of six days including Sundays. The market performance yesterday was mediocre, and the process was relatively uncertain. The     price was not considered expensive, and it was easy to rebound in the middle. Small-cap stocks became active again. China Silk, Sino-French, and Xinyi hit the limit, but due to the long holiday, many parties in the industry liquidated their positions, and floating long positions also sold. Near noon, Yongsha seemed unable to support the price, but small-cap stocks still showed good performance. The morning opened slightly strong, with spot transactions at 543 yuan and deferred transactions opening at 560 yuan. After the opening, prices rose from 539 yuan for spot transactions to 544 yuan and 566 yuan. The off-market interest rate opened at 1.95% and 2.4%, and the spot interest rate was even cheaper in the market, with spot transactions rising to 550 yuan and deferred transactions reaching a high of 573 yuan. However, they were sold down to 545 yuan and 567 yuan. At this time, people, due to rumors that deferred transactions would continue in the afternoon, small-cap stocks reappeared with glee. China Silk and Sino-French both hit the limit, and Xinyi also rose to the limit. Yongsha rose to 549 yuan and 572 yuan. Sellers rose up one after another, gradually falling back to 540 yuan and 564 yuan. The noon closing prices were 543 yuan and 568 yuan. China Silk hit the limit again.

Underwear and matches     declined, while the rest rose slightly. Xinguang stocks in deferred transactions rose by 15%. Jingfu, Quanyu, and Hua     each rose by 10%, while Yongyu, Xinyi, and Meyer rose by half a percent. Various old stocks in the off-market market remained firm, especially Dasheng, which rose another half a percent, showing unique performance. Cigarettes Continue to Rise Yesterday, the cigarette market saw strong buying as industry players covered their positions and new buyers participated. The market was increasingly     , with more buyers than sellers, and the rising trend intensified. As a result, ten brands of British American Tobacco and Old Knife tobacco soared by 1.35 million to 1.6 million yuan compared to Saturday. In addition, Sino-foreign cigarettes and canned cigarettes also rose by 2,000 to 10,000 yuan.

Match prices also rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, and candles also rose by 10,000 yuan.

Interpretation of the Title "Great Learning" in Xuejin, Not Biased The "Great" character in "Great Learning" used to be pronounced like "Tai," based on Zheng Kangcheng's commentary, referring to its location, in contrast to elementary school; Zhu Xi later changed the pronunciation to the original character, referring to its book, in contrast to the learning of children. Zhu Xi said: "The Book of Great Learning is the method by which the ancient great learning taught people" (Preface to Chapters and Sentences of the Great Learning); he also said: "Great Learning is the learning of great people." (Commentary on the Classic in Chapters and Sentences of the Great Learning) The so-called "ancient great learning" and "learning of great people" were the highest level of the ancient education system. Their age was above childhood, and their learning progressed from "the etiquette of sweeping, responding, advancing, and retreating, and the literature of rites, music, archery, and chariot driving" to "the way of investigating things, rectifying the mind, cultivating oneself, and governing others." The age stipulated by the education system was such, and the teaching materials were also such. Considering that what it teaches is the way of governing others, the opposition between "great people" and "small people" is precisely like the opposition between "those who govern others" and "those who are governed by others." The learning of great people is the learning of governing others, just as the learning of small people is the learning of being governed by others. Those who are governed by others only need to learn "the etiquette of sweeping, responding, advancing, and retreating, and the literature of rites, music, archery, writing, and arithmetic"; as for those who govern others, they must further learn the way of "investigating things, rectifying the mind, cultivating oneself, and governing others," and the age for learning it cannot be above childhood. From this perspective, the Great Learning is the book in which our Confucian scholars speak of governing others. Because its governance is based on people (according to the Confucian school, people govern), it also extends to cultivating oneself and rectifying the mind, and since there is no way to correct oneself without learning, it details the matter of investigating things; this is why its book goes from speaking of governance to speaking of being a person and learning, and ultimately returns to speaking of governance. Summarizing the method of governance, it lies only in practicing benevolence, so Chapter 3 of the commentary says: "For the ruler, stopping at benevolence." Benevolence means being benevolent to the people and loving things. We and things are both born of heaven and earth. The forms and bodies are different, but the nature and principles are the same. Therefore, from a small perspective, we distinguish between people, things, self, and others. From a large perspective, people, things, and I are all one body. The difference in forms and bodies arises from the obstruction of the senses of the ears and eyes; the sameness of nature and principles arises from the communication of the senses of the mind. The senses of the ears and eyes are the small body, and the senses of the mind are the great body, so Mencius said: "Following the great body is being a great person, following the small body is being a small person." (Gao Zishang) Extending it, my small body, people and things are the great body
