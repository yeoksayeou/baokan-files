### The Need for U.S. Dollars for the Three Gorges Hydropower Project is Too Great

Weng Wenhao States Work is Temporarily Suspended

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] After reporting on the recent developments of the National Resources Commission, Weng Wenhao answered questions from the councilors, as summarized below:

Xue Mingjian raised three points:  The National Resources Commission's institutions can now manufacture locomotives themselves, but the Jinpu Railway still uses foreign locomotives and awaits the purchase of foreign goods to solve the problem. I asked the railway why they don't use domestically produced goods. The person in charge of the railway said: because the manufacturing plant is not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, they still have to buy foreign goods. Please inform me of the actual situation and why coordination is not being carried out.  How will the government seek remedial measures for the coal shortage problem?  Many machine factories have stopped work, reportedly because there is nothing to do. Can the National Resources Commission lead state-owned factories and design a project while also leading private factories to engage in production to reach pre-war production levels? Yin Shuxian asked why the Savage Three Gorges Hydropower Project has been suspended. Weng replied as follows:  The locomotives produced by the Shenyang Locomotive Manufacturing Plant use some foreign exchange for materials, so the price is slightly more expensive than foreign goods. However, the freight cars are entirely domestically produced, so they are much cheaper than foreign goods. The plant has already sold all of the more than 900 freight cars it has produced to the Ministry of Transportation.  Regarding the remedial measures for coal, there are currently several approaches: first, to strengthen the transportation capacity of northern coal to the south, and to increase the production and external transportation of several coal mines in Huainan, Hunan, Taiwan, and other places. The second is to replace it with diesel.  The machine factory has already manufactured spinning spindles (the factory is privately run and is the only large factory in the country). 4,000 spindles will be delivered by the end of the year, but concrete design and manufacturing are still difficult. Regarding the Savage Hydropower Project, because the need for U.S. dollars is too great and the U.S. loan to us cannot be used solely for this construction, the government has not abandoned this project, but due to the facts, it cannot but be temporarily suspended.

After arriving in Japan, in addition to the mission to Japan being responsible for supplying non-staple food, the staple food will still be transported from the Shanghai Port Command.

To Explain Our Country's Constitution After Arriving in the United States

When asked by reporters whether he intended to visit the US government authorities, Zhang said: "If necessary, I would be happy to exchange views with the US government on general issues." Regarding the political system after the implementation of the constitution, he said that in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, there will be major changes in the organization of the government at that time. The functions of the Legislative Yuan will be greatly strengthened, and the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan will become closer. With the proper application of the responsible cabinet system, China's politics will undoubtedly enter a new stage. Zhang also said that the organization of various departments of the new government has been largely drafted, and the only thing that remains to be resolved is the organization of the Presidential Office. The Presidential Offices of the United States and France are very simple, so the decision should not be made to make our Presidential Office too large. Zhang analyzed the progress of the negotiations between the three parties on the list of candidates for legislators and supervisors. He said that the Democratic Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party can each obtain 75 legislative seats, which the Kuomintang has agreed to. What is currently being discussed is only the issue of regional allocation.

It is expected that the announcement of the list of legislators and supervisors can be realized soon. Zhang also said that the National Assembly will not be postponed, but the official opening date will be determined after a sufficient number of National Assembly representatives have registered.

### U.S. Foreign Aid Bill

A Republican Congressman Requests Amendment

[News Report] New York, 5th Radio: Washington News, Republican Congressman Jonesman told the House today that he will propose an amendment to cut the $590 million in emergency foreign aid by $290 million. If this amendment is proposed, it will become the largest cut. Republican Congressman Zeb, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, believes that $590 million is too much and the committee will reduce it. Jackson, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that emergency aid alone is not enough to stop communism, but if this bill is not passed, France and Italy will be controlled by the Communist Party this winter.

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] As a result of the House vote, the debate on the $590 million foreign emergency relief bill was limited to twelve hours, and the initial victory was won on the 4th. It is expected that the general debate will end on the night of the 5th. After that, the case will be publicly amended. At least six congressmen have already declared that they will propose amendments. Republican Congressman Jude, who is responsible for including $60 million in aid to China in the foreign aid bill, said that if China does not have US aid, it is completely subject to Soviet control may. He went on to say that if this happens, the Soviet Union will be able to turn around and conquer the world. Democratic Congressman Cox also urged the passage of the bill as a gamble that the United States is forced to undertake for its own security.

[US Information Service, Washington, 4th] The House of Representatives' handling of its temporary assistance bill for China, Austria, France, and Italy has reached the amendment stage today.

### Date of Convening the National Assembly to be Determined by the Total Number of National Assembly Representatives Elected; Hong Lanyou Explains the Significance of Constitutional Governance

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] There are many rumors about whether the National Assembly will be held as scheduled. Chairman Chiang and Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the Election Commission, have repeatedly stated that it must be held as scheduled, but based on recent signs, it seems that it has to be postponed. According to Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Election Commission, the statement about the postponement of the National Assembly is actually based on the assumption that the National Assembly will be convened on December 25th. The implementation of the constitution and the convening of the National Assembly on December 25th cannot be confused. He said that the convening of the National Assembly will be determined by the number of representatives elected. If the number of elected representatives reaches two-thirds of the total, then an order can be issued to convene the meeting in accordance with the law. He further said that since the promulgation of the constitution on New Year's Day this year, our preparations for various constitutional governance, as well as the handling of general elections, can also be said to be constitutional governance. According to someone's conversation, it is clearly pointed out that the convening period of the National Assembly is not yet determined to be December 25th, so there is no so-called postponement.

### The Provisional Council Requests Personnel Adjustments; The Members of the Hebei Provincial Government Resign En Masse; Speaker Liu Yaozhang Speaks on This Matter

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] The Hebei Provincial Government's personnel issues have finally led to the heads of various departments and offices resigning for two reasons:  The Hebei Provisional Council has always been dissatisfied with the provincial government and has requested personnel adjustments. Last night, during a dinner with 29 councilors, one councilor made an informal survey, and the results showed that 19 councilors supported a partial reorganization of the provincial government, 8 supported a thorough reorganization, and 2 had no opinion. However, they all expressed their support for Chairman Sun. This result was presented to the General Assembly this morning for a resolution. Speaker Liu Yaozhang will first consult with Chairman Sun before making a concrete vote.  The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters is about to be established. In view of the necessity of future military-government cooperation, the Hebei Provincial Government has expressed its intention to resign to Chairman Chiang, who has not agreed. This method is now being proposed. It is reported that Sun Lianzhong's intention to resign is also firm.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] All members of the Hebei Provincial Government (concurrently Secretary-General) and the heads of various departments submitted their resignations to Chairman Sun Lianzhong in two memoranda today. The wording of the two memoranda is similar. The former reads as follows: Dear Sir, Ai Song (Secretary-General) and others were ordered by the Central Government to follow you, participate in provincial affairs, and serve the people of Hebei. We originally hoped to do our best to overcome difficulties together, but since taking office, we have found that our abilities are insufficient, and things have not gone as we wished. We have failed to meet your expectations and are filled with trepidation. Now, at the opportunity of the development of the overall situation in North China, it is an opportunity for the political renewal of our province. Ai Song and others followed you to rescue our hometown and relieve difficulties, and should now retire to promote the construction of our hometown. Our humble sincerity has been stated repeatedly in person. We now earnestly request that you immediately telegraph the Central Government to approve our resignations from our concurrent posts, and appoint other capable people to replace us. We are waiting anxiously for your special order.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] After learning that the heads of various departments and offices of the Hebei Provincial Government had resigned en masse, Liu Yaozhang, Speaker of the Hebei Provisional Council, invited reporters and said: This is expected. Many within and outside the Provisional Council believe that personnel adjustments are necessary. The question is how to adjust them. Vice-Speaker Hao Zhuo has been asked to meet with Chairman Sun to report the situation of the General Assembly. It is believed that Chairman Sun will adopt the opinions of the General Assembly.

### Japan Plans to Implement Secret Plan to Use the Peace Conference to Obtain Former Territories and Disintegrate Existing Democratic Institutions

[United Press, New York, 4th] The New York Post today published a Tokyo special dispatch saying that someone has obtained secret documents, learning that the Japanese authorities are preparing to use the future peace treaty with Japan to eliminate the various reforms implemented in Japan by the Allied occupation policy, and to shatter Japan's existing democratic institutions beyond recognition. This secret document was drafted by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a means of implying the ambitions of the Japanese authorities, attempting to prevent the various reforms that the United States has made it accept from being permanent, and to preserve its industrial strength and recover its lost territories.

(United Press, Tokyo, 5th) Japan has several secret action plans for the future peace treaty. One of them was revealed by insiders today. According to reports, Japan plans to launch a movement demanding the most favorable terms. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now drafted several contingency steps.

### The First Batch of Compensation Equipment from Japan Can be Applied After Repair

[News Report] According to people who have seen the first batch of compensation materials from Japan: "The essence of this batch of industrial equipment is not bad, but because the Allied personnel's management is not strict, allowing it to rust and be lost, the cost of repairing and installing it after it arrives in our country in the future will inevitably be astonishing. I hope that all sectors of our public and private sectors who are preparing to use this material can be prepared. The second batch of materials is mostly Japanese aviation industrial equipment, with excellent quality, but it is still difficult to estimate when it will be distributed to various countries."

### Japan Intends to List Industrial Equipment Left in China as Compensation Items

Allied Headquarters Investigation Delegation to Come to China Soon

[News Report] It is reported that the Allied Headquarters in Japan will soon entrust a consultant expert-level investigation delegation to investigate the Japanese compensation issue. The delegation of twelve people, led by delegation leader Mr. Wyeor, will come to China on the 15th of this month. It is said that the delegation's mission has three purposes:  Investigate the amount of Japanese property originally in China.  Whether China has the ability to absorb and utilize the compensation materials obtained from Japan.

It is reported that the Japanese have explained to the Allied Headquarters that Japan may list half of the materials that can be listed as compensation from domestic and foreign sources, so they requested that all industrial equipment originally belonging to our country's Northeast, Taiwan, Korea, etc., also be included in the list of compensation materials.

Relevant parties expressed their opinions to reporters yesterday on this matter, believing that if the Allied Headquarters does follow Japan's request, our country will not be able to share the remaining compensation materials at the future peace conference with Japan. In fact, the Japanese proposal is purely absurd. Because:  The depreciation rate applied by the Japanese to industrial equipment is generally between eight and ten years. Most of the industrial equipment left in China has exceeded the prescribed depreciation period.  The original industrial equipment in China, such as the textile industrial equipment in the coastal provinces, is now being utilized to the fullest extent.  The industrial equipment left in China by the Japanese was greatly damaged during the war and was mostly bombed by the Allied forces. Most of the equipment that is now being taken is equipment that our country has repaired and re-added itself. Based on the above points, the Japanese proposal to transfer the industrial equipment left in China to compensation materials is of course untenable.

### Katayama Expresses Welcome for Hu Shih's Visit to Japan

### Welcome to the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe

The Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and is scheduled to meet the people of Shanghai tonight for the first time with their singing and dancing skills. We express our sincere welcome to the arrival of this troupe. The historical relationship between China and Xinjiang has existed since the Han Dynasty, spanning thousands of years. Over these two thousand years, there has been contact between the Chinese interior and Xinjiang from time to time, but due to traffic obstructions, the Chinese interior and border regions have not been able to achieve the ideal state of cultural integration. Our understanding of Xinjiang is still insufficient; even the border regions inevitably have misunderstandings about the interior. For the sake of the nation's future, this regrettable phenomenon should be eliminated as soon as possible. Although there is more than one way to eliminate this phenomenon, nothing is more important than increasing contact between each other so that mutual understanding can be enhanced. The Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe's coming east has the mission of promoting mutual understanding. It is in this sense that we welcome the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe's coming east. However, as we see this song and dance troupe coming from the northwestern border, traveling thousands of miles east, arriving in Shanghai, and about to meet the people of Shanghai with their ethnic songs and dances today, in addition to expressing our sincere welcome and wishing them a safe journey, we would like to reiterate a few words, hoping to encourage each other: First, according to the Constitution formulated by the National Assembly last year, the Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, governed by the people, owned by the people, and enjoyed by the people; therefore, the Three Principles of the People are the basic guidelines for our country's establishment. According to the nationalism of the Three Principles of the People, there are two aspects: external and internal. On the external side, the nationalism of the Three Principles of the People seeks the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation; on the internal side, it seeks the freedom and equality of the various ethnic groups that make up the Chinese nation. Xinjiang is far from the border, and there are different ethnic groups within the territory. The various ethnic groups within Xinjiang should be free and equal; that is, the various ethnic groups within Xinjiang should also be free and equal with other ethnic groups within the Chinese territory. The Chinese nation is a nation that includes many ethnic groups. The various constituent ethnic groups may not necessarily be the same in terms of language and culture, but they are all constituent members of the Chinese nation. Since they are all constituent members, they are as close as brothers. Today, we welcome the coming east of the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe, as if we have the feeling of welcoming a brother returning from afar.

Second, the ethnic policy of the Three Principles of the People is to support the self-development of border compatriots, and especially to pay attention to the development of their inherent culture. The constituent members of the Chinese nation are not simple, and the various constituent members often form unique lifestyles and cultural characteristics due to their historical and geographical factors. The upright and peaceful ideals of the Three Principles of the People lie in maintaining the development of the inherent cultural life of border compatriots. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang convened the Second Plenary Session and resolved: "Our party's intention towards border compatriots has always been to help them develop, join hands and move forward, and strive to achieve a prosperous and happy situation together." In July last year, the central government adhered to the established national policy and reorganized the Xinjiang Provincial Government; all nineteen members of the provincial government were filled by people from the Han, Han-Hui, Uyghur, Mongol, Khalkh, Uzbek, and Kyrgyz ethnic groups. Although the development of the situation in Xinjiang after this has not been as expected, with the openness of the policies adopted by our government, we hope that all compatriots across the country can jointly support the central government's decisions, intensify cooperation, and unite the interior and border regions.

Third, as far as Xinjiang is concerned, although the ethnic groups inhabited by the residents are not the same, the Uyghur ethnic group is undoubtedly the main ethnic group in Xinjiang. Regarding the exchanges between this ethnic group and China, historical records show that since the Huihe of the Tang Dynasty, through the Uyghur of the Yuan Dynasty, to modern times, the influence of Uyghur culture on our Han culture has been profound and significant. The so-called "national music" today contains many Uyghur components. The old erhu and the like are all from the West, that is, musical instruments passed down directly from the hands of the Uyghur people of Xinjiang. At the same time as these musical instruments were passed down, there was also "Western Regions," that is, Xinjiang music.

There is also "Western Regions," that is, Xinjiang music. Although many of the musical scales have been lost, the musical instruments are still preserved. The coming east of the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe today makes us recall the prosperity of the Han and Tang dynasties. May the coming east of this cultural mission be able to re-generate the interaction in the development of our national culture, thus emitting a new brilliant light.

Cultural exchange is originally a two-way matter. Today, we welcome the coming east of the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe, and hope that after this song and dance troupe, the contact between Xinjiang and the interior can become more frequent. In addition to the song and dance troupe, there can also be other inspection and visiting groups coming east one after another. On our side, there should also be various organizations to go to Xinjiang in response. Only in this way can mutual exchanges achieve the practical effect of enhancing mutual understanding and promoting cultural exchange. We hope that the interest in the border regions caused by the coming east of the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe this time can also promote the organization of similar visiting groups to Xinjiang, so that the people of the border regions can further increase their understanding of the interior, and achieve the purpose of mutual exchange.

### Misunderstanding Between Hubei Provincial Assembly and Provincial Government Dissolves, Assembly Held as Usual Yesterday

### Shaanxi Provincial Assembly Closes, Preparing to Welcome Newly Selected Senators

[This Newspaper, Xi'an, 5th] The Shaanxi Provincial Assembly opened this morning.

### Zhejiang Administrative Conference, Policy Reports from Various Offices

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] At today's Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference, the directors of various offices reported on their respective policies and elaborated on the five central proposals put forward by Chairman Shen. First, Ruan reported on civil affairs, saying that the abolition of four special districts this year, the reduction of county government staffing, and the merger of townships were all inevitably biased towards financial purposes. However, the salaries of county-level personnel still failed to meet the central government's standards. Funding collected under the land tax was still far from the amount needed. The election was considered smooth because administrative personnel at all levels were fair, detached, and legal. No bloodshed or election lawsuits occurred throughout the province during this election. Efforts to ban opium still need to be strengthened. Next year, when the Constitution is implemented, provincial and county people's representative conferences will be convened to formulate provincial and county self-government laws and re-elect provincial and county councils. County and city mayors will be popularly elected, so efforts should be doubled to promote local self-government, and the organization of household registration and the improvement of township and baojia systems are especially important. Subsequently, the persons in charge of finance, education, construction, social affairs, land and grain, accounting, security, and the military control district headquarters respectively reported on their policies and reviewed various issues.

### The Four Foreign Ministers Will Begin Discussions on the Economic Unification of Germany, and Discussions on the Austrian Peace Treaty Have Again Reached a Stalemate

[Report from this newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: Secretary of State Marshall requested in the Foreign Ministers' meeting today that the fundamental issues of Germany be discussed, so as to end the current state of division in Germany. He said, "I suggest that we should abandon the general discussions on the establishment of a German central government, and should frankly explain the true intentions of the representatives of various countries. Do the participating countries hope to create a situation that makes the political and economic unification of Germany possible? We do hope that the provisional government can be established, but the question is whether the establishment of a central government can truly solve the current problems. We hope that Germany has a real government, and do not care if it is just a self-deceiving organization."

[Reuters, London, 4th] The Foreign Ministers' meeting discussed the Austrian issue today. Due to Molotov's refusal to issue a detailed statement on the Soviet Union's request to acquire German assets in Austria, Marshall suggested that the Austrian issue be put aside for the time being, and that the next item on the agenda, the economic principles of Germany, be discussed instead. The latter will begin to be discussed tomorrow.

[United Press, London, 5th] Officials attending the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting today declared that US Secretary of State Marshall had a fierce quarrel with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday. This was the first time in this meeting, and as a result, the meeting again reached a stalemate. First, Molotov directly mentioned the Marshall Plan, accusing the United States and Britain of attempting to "enslave" Austria through aid measures. Marshall was very indignant upon hearing this, and immediately declared that the distortion of the motives of the United States had been heard many times, and that such accusations were unfounded. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also refuted Molotov's word "enslavement". Marshall, Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault successively questioned Molotov about how much the Soviet Union wanted to claim for German assets in Austria. Molotov replied after listening, "10% less than what we deserve." When asked 10% of what? He said, "What was decided at the Potsdam Conference." Marshall said that the United States had no intention of abandoning the Potsdam Agreement, but it would not allow it to be misinterpreted. Molotov wanted to take over German assets in Austria by force, coercion, and other illegal means. Finally, Bevin asked Molotov to come up with a concrete plan for the assets in Austria for the Foreign Ministers' meeting to review, but Molotov refused. It is believed that Marshall is about to suggest dismantling the current occupation zones in Germany.

### Britain Presents Draft Four-Power Treaty to the United States to Guarantee the Disarmament of Germany for Fifty Years

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] It is reported that the British government has presented a detailed draft of the Four-Power Treaty to the US government to guarantee the disarmament and demilitarization of Germany. The drafting of the treaty began a considerable time ago and is only now being announced. However, officials still refuse to disclose its details. The Chicago Sun published the main points of the draft treaty today. The two most interesting points are: Britain suggests that the period for ensuring Germany's disarmament should be fifty years, which is ten years longer than the original US suggestion. The British suggestion does not give any of the four powers a veto power to oppose the enforcement of the disarmament of Germany. The consensus of three of the four powers is sufficient. The newspaper also said that Article 4 of the draft treaty proposed by Britain goes a step further than the original suggestion of former US Secretary of State Byrnes, and advocates extending the disarmament of Germany to the economic and political aspects.

### Allied Control Council Approves Austrian Currency Reform

[Reuters, Vienna, 4th] After meeting here on the 4th, the Allied Control Council for Austria has approved the Austrian government's recently announced currency reform and resolved three items regarding the method of considering the placement of Austrian currency held by the Allied countries: The Austrian government will issue 11 million schillings (Austrian currency name) of new currency to each Allied High Commissioner and withdraw the equivalent amount of new currency for Allied personnel to exchange. The old Austrian currency held by the Allied forces will be exchanged according to the methods stipulated by their commanders-in-chief, without going through Austrian new currency exchange. Austria shall treat the bank deposits of each occupying country equally and shall not discriminate. The Soviet authorities also reached an agreement with the Austrian government that Austria would pay the Soviet Union 500 million schillings to redeem the deposits in the Soviet State Bank. In addition, it was stipulated that the Austrian debt of 600 million schillings to the Soviet Union would be settled to repay the German marks loaned by the Soviet authorities to the Austrian government in April 1945. The US representative to the Allied Control Council made a special statement that the United States' agreement to approve the Austrian currency reform did not mean that it also agreed with the agreement concluded between the Soviet Union and Austria. It is believed here that the United States is dissatisfied with the part of the agreement that resolves the debt.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: Paris News, 10,000 French colonial troops are stationed at various strategic points in Marseille today to deal with strikers. The anti-strike bill has been submitted to the French Republic's upper house and is expected to be passed soon. The situation is tense throughout France, and clashes have occurred between strikers and the police in many areas.

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] After the National Assembly passed the government's anti-strike bill by a vote of 413 to 183 in the early morning of the 4th, the bill is scheduled to be submitted to the Senate for discussion on Friday. The National Assembly will also discuss two other emergency measures starting on Friday to give the government greater power to maintain law and order: one is a bill to reorganize the Republican Security Corps, a semi-military police force formed shortly after the end of the war to absorb wartime postal teams, so many of its members are communists; another measure is to propose a supplementary budget to enable the government to subsidize local governments to strengthen the police force.

[United Press, Paris, 5th] The strike of 1.2 million civil servants began to be implemented.

European Countries Receiving US Aid Must Still Be Self-Reliant [Reuters, Hollywood, 4th] US Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Thawlby, gave a speech here to the Association of American Investment Bankers on the 4th, stating that under the Marshall Plan for European aid, the United States will be a "smart" banker, and will not only appear as a "rich" banker. Thawlby strongly stated that the sixteen European countries that have obtained US aid must not allow any "country" to have the impression that "because there is a rich uncle across the ocean, it is okay to reduce their own efforts." The main part of the economic effort must be undertaken by the European countries themselves. Thawlby continued that the experts from the sixteen European countries estimated in their research in Paris that the import surplus of these sixteen countries in trade with the rest of the world in 1948 was 8 billion yuan. Assuming that 1948 is the first year of implementing the Marshall Plan, the United States estimates that it should bear 6 billion yuan of this import surplus in the first fiscal year of implementing the European aid plan, which is about 10% of the US national income. The European recovery plan should be based on European efforts and its success should be transformed by the assistance of the United States and other countries, but Europeans must recognize that the United States will not donate a cent to Europe that does not care about self-reliance.

### The Independent State of Burma Will Be Born in Five Days, and the Communist Party Is Rampant in Central Burma

On the 22nd, the news was disclosed in the newspaper, and the defendants returned the check." The court asked, "How did you find Zheng Gongda?"

The court then questioned each witness again and began the debate. Among the defendants, only Miao Boyan, a Tax Bureau supervisor, was granted bail, and the rest were ordered to be taken back into custody. The sentencing is scheduled for the 12th.

### New Dispute Arises in the Widening of Tianmu Road; Xiang Sheng Company Voluntarily Demolishes Houses, Neighboring Residents Surround and Prevent It

[Report from this Newspaper] Another dispute suddenly arose yesterday regarding the demolition of houses on Tianmu Road. Previously, the demolition of houses on Tianmu Road had faced several twists and turns. Later, the Mayor personally went to the site for inspection. As a result, to consider the residents, apart from Xiechang Timber Company and Huizhong Tobacco Factory, which still had ample space after demolition and were required to demolish themselves before the end of this year, the remaining households were allowed to demolish after the old lunar new year. However, at 4:00 PM yesterday, Xiang Sheng Transportation Company's houses in the area began to be demolished voluntarily, which aroused dissatisfaction among nearby residents, who went to question and surrounded the area to prevent it. When reporters arrived, neighboring residents rushed to tell them that Xiang Sheng and the Public Works Bureau had privately negotiated, and the originally planned demolition area was very large. Later, after the Public Works Bureau sent people to inspect again, it agreed to relax the requirement to 8 meters. Xiang Sheng Company, in order to take advantage of this, proceeded with the voluntary demolition. However, according to the person in charge of Xiang Sheng, it was completely executing the orders of the Public Works Bureau. He also said that He Guanghan of the First District Public Works Management Office of the Public Works Bureau had visited twice yesterday morning at 10:00 AM and afternoon at 3:00 PM, ordering the demolition to be carried out immediately. The dispute had not been resolved until last night, and it is still waiting for the Public Works Bureau to send someone to negotiate and handle it today.

[Another Report] Regarding the demolition of houses on Tianmu Road, according to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau yesterday: Xiechang Timber Company and Huizhong Tobacco Factory have been ordered to demolish before the end of the year because they have ample space. The traffic situation on the section where Fujian North Road connects to Tianmu Road is still good. Xiang Sheng Company previously applied for permission to change the 10-meter demolition requirement. After approval by the Municipal Council, it has been approved to reduce the demolition by 2 meters.

[Report from this Newspaper] Overseas Chinese in Japan have recently returned to the country one after another, and their living problems are worrying. The living problems of 160 refugees returning from South Sakhalin have yet to be resolved.

It has not yet been decided whether they can land today. The authorities have no specific plans for their accommodation and meals, so it is expected that another major problem will arise after landing. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office will send personnel on board today to investigate and send those who have family homes in the country back first.

As for the relief problem for refugees returning from South Sakhalin, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Social Affairs discussed solutions in Beijing a few days ago. It was resolved that the Executive Yuan would supply materials, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office would handle registration procedures and send them back to their original places of origin, and the Ministry of Social Affairs would send personnel to Shanghai to preside over the matter.

Also, a Japanese woman of Chinese descent who arrived in Shanghai last time was said to be suffering from meningitis.

### Promote Culture and Enhance Art; Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe to Perform Starting Today; Grand Welcome Reception Held at the Lido Yesterday

[Report from this Newspaper] All circles in Shanghai held a grand tea party at the Lido Garden yesterday to welcome the Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Troupe. Those present included Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, Director Fang, Yu Wen, Yang Hu, Stuart, Xu Jilou, Wang Yunsheng, Wu Yunxu, Zhou Xinfang, Jiu Ailian, Xie Renzhao, Liu Deming, and other representatives from all walks of life, about 500 people. Fu Wei Baoerhan and Liu Mengchun, Secretary-General of the Northwest Headquarters, also attended the event. At 3:00 PM, the song and dance troupe arrived at the Lido, and the masses rushed to watch, in high spirits. Inside the venue, red silk banners were hung high, reading "Promote National Culture", "Connect National Feelings", "Enhance National Art", and "Unite National Spirit", creating a solemn and dignified atmosphere.

Outstanding People and Excellent Art

After the meeting began, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, saying: "The birthplace of King Wu of Zhou is said to be the Queen Mother's Jade Pool in history, which is actually the northwest of our country today. It is said that the scenery there is more beautiful than any modernized scenery in the world. The land is blessed with outstanding people, so the Northwest nationalities not only have lofty achievements in art, but also make extremely important contributions to national defense. In the past, transportation was inconvenient, and there were fewer opportunities for contact between various nationalities in the country. Now, the whole country is one family, and I believe that cooperation and understanding between various nationalities will become closer in the future. This time, the song and dance troupe visited the inland, and I hope that we will not only achieve the exchange of art and culture, but also that Xinjiang compatriots and Southeast compatriots will take this opportunity to exchange views and fully express their fervent love for their compatriots."

Visiting from Afar; Extreme Gratification

Speaker Pan then delivered a welcoming speech, roughly dividing it into three points: China is composed of several major nationalities. Due to historical and cultural factors, although they are far apart from each other and there are differences in language and writing, they have always been harmonious for thousands of years. This time, the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe has come to Shanghai from afar. The citizens of Shanghai feel as if they are reuniting with family members who have been separated for a long time. In addition to gratification, they warmly welcome them. I hope that the song and dance troupe can take this feeling back and tell it to the compatriots in Xinjiang. When Wallace visited the Northwest during the Anti-Japanese War and returned to Chongqing, he said, "I come from China's door." The Northwest is China's land gate, and Shanghai is China's sea gate. They have the same importance in national defense. Now that the country is moving towards democratic construction, it is especially hoped that Northwest compatriots and Southeast compatriots will cooperate and share the arduous task. Shanghai is a gathering place for people from all walks of life. It is hoped that the song and dance troupe will introduce the living conditions of Northwest compatriots as much as possible, so that people from all walks of life can fully understand and promote genuine national unity.

Xinjiang Compatriots Have Awakened

Director Fang, Commander Xuan, Zhou Xinfang, Wang Yunsheng, Wu Yunxu, and others then delivered speeches in succession, expressing their welcome. Finally, Fu Wei Baoerhan, representing the song and dance troupe, delivered a reply, saying: "In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, Xinjiang was separated from the inland for a long time. Especially because we failed to receive cooperation and guidance from all parties, everything was regressing and lagging behind. In recent years, Xinjiang compatriots have awakened and launched anti-despotism movements several times. After General Zhang Zhizhong took charge of Xinjiang and resolutely implemented the principle of national equality, the people of Xinjiang finally regained their freedom. The song and dance troupe's visit to the inland this time was promoted by General Zhang. Although their artistic achievements are not deep, they can at least introduce the living conditions of the Xinjiang people to the Southeast compatriots. I can declare on behalf of the people of Xinjiang that Xinjiang will always be the territory of the Republic of China, and the people of Xinjiang will always be the people of the Republic of China. The entire people of Xinjiang have only one hope: to quickly establish a new democratic and independent China. I believe that starting from this visit of the song and dance troupe, everyone will be able to base themselves on this common understanding and work hard to build a new free China." Bao concluded by shouting "Long live the Republic of China" and "Eternal unity of the Chinese nation" several times in fluent Mandarin, his emotions overflowing, winning cheers from the audience. The Mayor rose to deliver a speech during the welcome meeting. (Photo by this newspaper)

Literary Evening Party to Host Guests

After the speeches, Xie Renzhao introduced all the members of the song and dance troupe to the guests. The youngest members of the troupe, Wuliya (10 years old) and Wuluhan (8 years old), also stood up and waved frequently to people from all walks of life, making them very cordial.

At 7:30 PM last night, all circles in Shanghai held a literary evening party at the Cultural Hall to entertain the troupe. Speaker Pan and Mu Hanmo De, Director of Construction of Xinjiang Province, also personally presided over the event. All members of the troupe were extremely interested in the performances of the Fuchen Dance and magic techniques, saying that this kind of pure Eastern-style performance was no different in Xinjiang and the inland, so they felt even more strongly that the unity between domestic nationalities would become closer in the future, in addition to being grateful for the enthusiasm of the Shanghai compatriots.

The troupe will officially perform at the Queen Theater starting at 9:00 PM tonight. Today is for guests from all circles in Shanghai to visit, and tomorrow tickets will be sold to the public for performances for a week.

The XTT39 planes fly the Shanghai-Peiping route, passing through Nanjing on the way. It should have taken off from Longhua at 6:00 AM, but it was specially delayed by three hours for them. There was not enough time to fly back and forth from Peiping that day. This plane was not their chartered plane. They bought tickets like ordinary passengers and invited 18 relatives and friends to go with them, including Hua Maohang manager Shen Baonian, who was the wedding emcee, and a photographer.

The staff of Central Airlines looked beaming.

The entrance to the plane was decorated in the same way, and a red paper with "The House of Jiang and Li is Celebrating" written in brush was pasted next to the door. A small red carpet was laid on the ground below the steps of the mobile ladder.

A radio was specially installed in the plane.

At 10:00 AM, the loudspeaker broadcasted "Please board the plane, bride and groom," followed by the Wedding March. The couple walked slowly from the waiting room to the side of the plane, signed the red silk on the table, and then stood on the ladder and at the plane door for photos. Air hostess Wei Delian smiled and served as their bridesmaid, also appearing in the photos. Then, amid congratulations, the groom clasped his hands in thanks. The bride hurriedly walked into the cabin, because she had taken off her coat during this process, and the thin white紗 wedding dress must have been cold enough for her in the cold outdoor air of December. It is said that she stayed at the Paramount Hotel last night and called a hairdresser from the Violet Beauty Salon at 3:00 AM to do her hair, which was not finished until 7:00 AM!

At 10:30, this "wedding plane" took off into the sky. They will hold a simple ceremony in the air to exchange rings and sign the marriage certificate. The seven air hostesses of Central Airlines also jointly presented a cake for them to distribute to the guests in the air.

According to the groom, they will get off the plane in Nanjing, use the Central Hotel as their temporary honeymoon suite, and return to Shanghai in two or three days, where they also plan to host a banquet at the Paramount to treat guests. The reason for getting married on the plane this time is said to be to "save" some money. The total cost is estimated to be 30 million yuan.

After the plane flew off, Central Airlines' Director Cai smiled and said to reporters, "We warmly welcome anyone who wants to get married on the plane!" Couples preparing to get married, what do you think of this method?

### Year-End Bonus for Employees Should in Principle Be One Month's Salary

But Can Be Adjusted Based on the Prosperity and Decline of Various Industries

[Report from this Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau's Year-End Bonus Research Committee met at 3:00 PM yesterday. The committee members present were Lu Jingshi, Zhao Banfu, Shen Zhi, Li Kaidi, Fan Zhenbang, Wang Jiashu, Zhang Yongqin, Gu Zusheng, and others. During the meeting, the various opinions obtained from the previous symposium with representatives of the Industrial Association, the General Labor Union, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were summarized and discussed, and the following preliminary points were decided: The year-end bonus for this year will still be in principle one month's salary, but can be adjusted based on the prosperity and decline of various industries. Labor and management should negotiate on their own. If the negotiation fails, it will be sent to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau for processing. Everything should be processed as quickly as possible. Pieceworkers, except for temporary workers hired on an ad hoc basis who will be discussed separately, will still receive a year-end bonus. The year-end bonus method for temporary workers has not been determined. In addition, because the amount of funds required for the year-end bonus is huge, the sudden need for such a large amount of money in the market will inevitably affect the money supply, so it may be issued in installments. The above points are subject to Director Wu's return from Taiwan to Shanghai and approval by the Municipal Government with the approval of Mayor Wu before implementation.

### On the People's Right to Health: A Personal Opinion on the Constitution of the Republic of China

— Fan Shouyuan

In democratic countries, the people are the main body of the country. All constitution-making, establishment of basic policies, and various political facilities should be centered on the people, and seek welfare for the people. The biggest root cause of the Chinese people's problems is poverty, illness, ignorance, and weakness. Therefore, our constitution-making, the establishment of basic national policies, and various political facilities should be centered on these four factors.

I have reread the Constitution of the Republic of China of the National Assembly of December 25th last year, and I feel that of the four root causes mentioned above, only half of them are given due attention. In other words, except for relatively correct policies and clauses regarding the poverty and ignorance of the people, the articles about the diseases and weakness of the people are vague and unclear, which makes people feel that they are not comprehensive enough. Therefore, I venture to attach importance to the two items of disease and weakness, and make some supplements to the Constitution of the Republic of China passed last year, so as to solicit the opinions of the people and political experts across the country. I hope that the experts will not hesitate to give their advice.

The introduction to the Constitution of the Republic of China states: "The National Assembly of the Republic of China, entrusted by all the people, based on the teachings of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, in order to consolidate national sovereignty, protect civil rights, lay the foundation for social stability, and improve the welfare of the people, formulates this constitution, implements it throughout the country, and eternally follows it." My opinion is that the phrase "ensure national health" should be added after "improve the welfare of the people." Because people's welfare can certainly include national health, but merely saying "improve the welfare of the people" does not emphasize ensuring national health, which easily makes people overlook and forget that the greatest root cause of the Chinese people's problems lies in their sickness and physical weakness. The impact of this leads to an increase in the people's mortality rate and a shortening of their average lifespan, which is a great and significant loss to the future of the entire nation. If this continues, the increased mortality rate will lead to a loss in the national economy, and the shortened average lifespan will affect the establishment of many social and cultural undertakings, making the people lack the spirit of permanent struggle. All of the above are objective facts and inevitable inferences, not deliberate alarmist remarks. Therefore, ensuring national health is the most fundamental principle of nation-building and one of the most basic national policies. We should pay special attention to it when formulating the fundamental law. Therefore, I advocate that this sentence should be added to the introduction of the Constitution.

Article 15 of Chapter 2, "Rights and Obligations of the People," states: "The people's right to subsistence, right to work, and right to property shall be guaranteed." I believe that the three words "right to health" should be added after "right to subsistence," because the term "right to subsistence" is relatively vague. If it is said that the right to subsistence already includes the right to health, then why can't the right to work and the right to property be included in the right to subsistence? Now that the right to work and the right to property can be established as separate items outside of the right to subsistence, why can't the right to health be added again to show attention to it?

Secondly, in Chapter 10, "Powers of the Central and Local Governments," Article 108, "The following matters shall be legislated and executed by the Central Government, or delegated to the provinces and counties for execution," the item "Public Health" in item 18 and the item "Relief, Pensions, and Unemployment Relief" in item 19 should have item 19 "Public Medical System" added between them, and the original item 19 should be changed to 20, and so on. In Article 109, "The following matters shall be legislated and executed by the provinces, or delegated to the counties for execution," the words "public medical" should be added after the words "education, health, industry, and transportation" in the first item. The same applies to the first item in Article 110, "The following matters shall be legislated and executed by the counties."

Chapter 13, "Basic National Policies," is originally divided into six sections: 1. National Defense, 2. Diplomacy, 3. National Economy, 4. Social Security, 5. Education and Culture, and 6. Border Areas. The article on national health is under the fourth section, Social Security, which also shows a lack of emphasis on national health. I believe that a fifth section, namely the National Health section, should be added after the fourth section, Social Security. In addition to the original Article 157, "The State shall universally promote health care services and a public medical system to improve national health," another article should be established, stating "The State shall provide appropriate treatment opportunities for people with diseases," which is opposite to Article 155, "The State shall provide appropriate assistance and relief to the elderly, weak, disabled, and those unable to live, and those who have suffered extraordinary disasters." Moreover, only with the addition of this article can the four words "public medical system" have clear and substantial content; and the state can confirm its responsibility for the people's diseases and health because there are clear provisions in the law.

The above is my opinion on the provisions of the Constitution, which I hereby put forward for reference when the Constitution is implemented and amended in the future. Perhaps some people will say that Article 157 of the Constitution has already clearly stipulated that "The State shall universally promote health care services and a public medical system to improve national health." All that is proposed now is already included in this article, so why bother with so much effort and spend so much time on the articles? I say no. I believe that improving national health and promoting health care services and a public medical system are only policies. If there is no provision for the right to health in the people's rights and obligations, then the legal foundation will be lost, and the foundation will not be very solid. Therefore, my opinion is that the establishment of the people's right to health is an indispensable key point for future constitution-making, and this is not only in medical policy - such as whether to promote health care services and the public medical system.

Perhaps some people will say that the people's health is a matter for the individual, and that diseases are half man-made and half natural, and that state politics has never hindered the people's health. Isn't the so-called establishment of a right to health a forced and far-fetched argument? I say no. Previously, U.S. President Roosevelt proposed the slogan of the Four Freedoms, one of which was freedom from want. If freedom from want is to be said by individualistic economists, then the individual's want is entirely determined by the individual's diligence and frugality, and what does it have to do with the individual, let alone the right to freedom? If this is also a kind of freedom, then no one in the world can be at ease in want; what freedom is there to speak of? It is not known that in modern society, the individual's position is closely related to the social system, and the state's legislation cannot but pay attention to this. From this point of view, President Roosevelt's call was far-sighted and deeply meaningful. My intention today in advocating that the people's right to health be clearly stipulated in the Constitution is the same. Because today's science is advanced, and society is complex, not only large-scale medical research and nationwide epidemic prevention work cannot be carried out without the power of the state, but also the dissemination of people's medical knowledge and the equipment for ordinary medical work must be decided by the state as a whole, and then guided and supervised separately, so that it can be completed. If the people's right to health is established in the Constitution, then all state administration should at all times think about the health of the people, and consider ensuring the health of the people as one of the most important tasks of state administration, and at the same time, as one of the most basic rights of the people, then the realization of an ideal politics and an ideal society can be achieved. In the past, French Confucian scholars advocated human rights, saying that human rights are innate, and that everything should be free and equal, which is very true. However, it is vague, and in the implementation, there are still difficulties and obstacles, and it is impossible to achieve the ideal. Our Premier Sun Yat-sen created the Three Principles of the People, and added the principles of nationalism and people's livelihood to civil rights, because if national oppression is not eliminated, the people's economy cannot be equal, and if their lives cannot be solved, then basic human rights cannot be realized. Our country has always been known for its poverty and weakness. Although it has recently defeated powerful enemies externally, the poverty and weakness of the people have not yet been eliminated, and the so-called basic civil rights may not be established. Moreover, we have already established the right to education for saving the ignorant, and the right to property and the right to work for saving the poor. How can we not establish the right to health for saving the sick and the weak?

Furthermore, the basic policies of modern countries and the consistent trend are also to seek the wealth and power of the country. If the people of the whole country are all in poverty and illness, how can this country be wealthy and powerful, and reach the road to modernization? Our past failures, and the oppression of the great powers and imperialism, are also closely related to the bad reputation of the sick man of East Asia. How can the planners of the country today, and the people who implement the democratic era, not pay great attention and vigilance?

I usually advocate the promotion of a public medical system, but I have recently realized that to promote a public medical system and to implement health care undertakings, it must start with establishing the people's right to health. Therefore, I propose the establishment of the people's right to health, and I hope that the people and political experts across the country will pay attention to it, and I hope that it can be adopted into the Constitution when it is implemented.

In addition, I would like to add "5. Those who have been engaged in medical and pharmaceutical undertakings for a long time and have achieved excellent results" to Article 167 of the Constitution, "The State shall reward or subsidize the following undertakings or individuals," "3. Those who have inventions in academic and technical fields," "4. Those who have been engaged in education for a long time and have achieved excellent results." Because before the public medical system has been implemented, or has not been thoroughly implemented, we should still encourage and reward private efforts. Since this is the case, why does the Constitution only pay attention to the achievements in education and academic medical research, and ignore the efforts and promotion of medical and pharmaceutical undertakings? But this is just an additional opinion. I also attach it here for reference.

### Travel Safety Room

— Zhu Min

On the 8th of this month, the local news column of the Central Daily News carried a report that pregnant women had given birth on the 74th train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway on the previous two days. After reading this, I had a few thoughts: 1. It is not uncommon for pregnant women to give birth or have sudden illnesses on trains. Although it is a coincidence that the same thing happened on the same train for two days, it is not something that happens every day; however, it is reasonable to say that such things can often happen! 2. Not only do pregnant women give birth on trains, but more dangerous things than childbirth can also happen at any time, such as acute infectious diseases! This is not only a matter of life and death for individuals who develop acute diseases, but also a matter of infection in the entire carriage! 3. Both of these pregnant women could not reach their destinations and had to get off the train midway. It is said that both mother and child are safe. This was the news at the time of the report. Are they healthy now? 4. Assuming that there was prior notice by letter, and they are not seen returning at the time, I am afraid that their families will be anxious. Therefore, for the sake of the health and safety of pregnant women, I suggest that our transportation department, which is actively improving railways, postal services, and telegrams, should first set up a travel safety room to solve the problems of first aid and isolation. This is really an urgent matter! The method is to set up a safety room in the middle of the train, with a simple surgical table that can reduce vibration, stretchers, first-aid equipment, and medicines, and to be responsible for a nurse who has both obstetrical knowledge and public health training. The railway authorities will not spend much, but the passengers will benefit greatly!

### About Vitamins (Continued)

— Yin Jiting

A noteworthy idea came in 1913. McCollum found a vitamin in a type of fat that was essential for promoting development. Thus, vitamin A came into being. Vitamin A is mostly found in fatty substances, such as cream and egg yolks. It is especially abundant in cod liver oil. In ordinary human food, as long as fat is not lacking, it is easy to obtain vitamin A, and there is no need to promote expensive cod liver oil. Vegetables such as carrots, spinach, and green peppers also contain this vitamin. A lack of vitamin A will hinder development, so it is also a vitamin that promotes development. Another characteristic is night blindness, where the eyes become blurry at night. In severe cases, dry eye disease and excessive keratinization of the skin can occur. In 1935, the American biologist Wald further proved that vitamin A and protein form the purple pigment on the retina of the eye. This purple pigment is an essential element for seeing in sunlight. This shows the importance of vitamin A to life.

Vitamin B was the earliest vitamin discovered. It is mostly found in the sprouts of grains, such as brown rice, barley, and wheat. Peanuts, liver, and meat have the highest content. There are many types of vitamin B. A lack of the first type of vitamin B (Thiamine) will result in beriberi. This disease is found throughout the country. Too much refining of rice and wheat flour is one of the reasons, and another is eating too little meat. This vitamin has the effect of promoting appetite, and its uses are indeed very broad. People with fever, hyperthyroidism, alcoholism, and those who do physical labor need more of the first type of vitamin B. The second type of vitamin B (Niacin) is for treating pellagra. Other than this disease, it is not necessary.

Scurvy has existed in Europe for a long time. Soldiers in battlefields and sailors on long voyages are particularly susceptible to it. It was not until 1912 that Holst and Frolich used animal experiments to learn about the existence of vitamins. Cabbage has the highest content, and there is also a lot in vegetables and fruits. A lack of vitamin C makes the skin and mucous membranes prone to bleeding, and there are often cases of continuous bleeding that endanger life. This is scurvy. Eating more vegetables is a simple and good way to obtain vitamin C.

Calcium and phosphorus are the main components that make up the bones of the body. Vitamin D can help the body absorb calcium and phosphorus. Rickets in children is the result of a lack of vitamin D during childhood development. Rickets is very common in our country and is not limited to children from poor families. The source of vitamin D is similar to that of vitamin A. Both exist in fatty substances, with egg yolk and cod liver oil containing the most. After the human body is directly exposed to sunlight, the subcutaneous tissue has the ability to self-produce vitamin D to maintain the needs of the body, so you should often see more sunlight.

Vitamin E has recently been discovered in silk-colored vegetables and wheat germ. A lack of this vitamin makes animals unable to reproduce. It remains to be proven whether humans can increase fertility by eating more vitamin E.

The discovery of vitamin K (ViamineKMenadione) has significant value in medicine. It has a curative effect on bleeding in newborns and bleeding in gastrointestinal diseases. Undoubtedly, the discovery of vitamins has brought a lot of benefits to disease prevention and health promotion, and is truly a gospel for mankind. However, the use of vitamins has a certain limit. Regardless of whether you are lacking vitamins or not, blindly using large amounts of vitamins is not only an abuse, but also a kind of so-called waste. In today's society, vitamins seem to be the only savior for malnutrition. When contacting patients, they will ask: Am I lacking vitamins? What kind of vitamin should I inject? Pharmacists are even using people's worship of vitamins to create a variety of products with clever names and false vitamin products, calling them tonic medicines, and selling them on the market to enrich their own pockets. Therefore, I don't know how many vitamins are being wasted. Look again at our villages, where beriberi, rickets, and night blindness occur, and how much vitamins are needed for treatment. It is not uncommon for people to become disabled or endanger their lives because they cannot get vitamin supplements. Our country is not really short of vitamin supply, but too much is wasted on a small number of people, and the benefits are uneven, with a huge disparity. This is really a disservice to the scientists' efforts in inventing vitamins, and is far from their original intention of benefiting the people. This is such a regrettable fact that urgently needs to be changed by our medical colleagues.

### The Origin of British Football (Part 1)

[— Le Xiurong]

Although there are many legends about the origin of British football, the most credible one is that modern British football is a continuation of an ancient Roman game called Haroastum. This ancient Roman game involved selecting two teams of similar strength and drawing a line behind each team's territory. Whoever brought the ball into and crossed the opponent's line first would win. This type of competition may have been passed on to Britain by Roman soldiers. Centuries later, it was introduced to students by monks who managed schools. In 1175, schoolchildren in London played football. Tuesday was designated as Football Day, and schoolchildren all over the city went to the countryside to play this sacred football on this day. The schools attached to the three major churches in London all prepared their own footballs, and public government agencies provided balls for general children's entertainment every year.

In the Middle Ages, football matches suffered a major blow, and the authorities enacted several laws prohibiting football and other similar competitions. Historian Stubbs also protested, saying: "Football matches are more of a friendly struggle than entertainment?" By 1666, football matches were actually considered to be against the law. However, this could not separate the public's general love for football. It slowly developed into competitions between church districts and competitions between cities and villages. In several villages and towns in Northumberland and Thebeshire today, there are still such ancient customs.

At the end of the 18th century, this universality gradually disappeared until general public schools used various ball games as physical education entertainment, and football matches were revived. In 1860, many large schools recognized football as a winter game competition. Each school stipulated its own competition rules, so football was also played in universities, and alumni of each school also formed teams to compete. Because the competition rules of each school were inconsistent, it was quite difficult to arrange inter-school competitions, so the Cambridge University Football Club began to collect various different rules and draft a general rule that included various key points. At the same time, football clubs sprung up everywhere, and a common set of competition rules was clearly urgently needed. In October 1863, responsible representatives of major urban football clubs and people interested in football held a meeting at the Freemasons' Tavern on Great Queen Street in London. The purpose was to organize a society "to formulate a formal set of competition rules." Everyone enthusiastically participated in this meeting and decided to establish this historical British "Football Association".

### Adjusting Exchange Rates and Supplying Cash, the National Bank Must Plan for Both

[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Economic Commission decided on the 4th that the Joint Treasury should fully plan to reduce the internal exchange rate as much as possible, facilitate internal exchange, clearly raise the Shanghai exchange rate, restrict large remittances, and the Ministry of Finance should formulate a resolution on the transportation of cash, and the National Bank should supply cash to the inland to cooperate with the case. Yesterday, the reporter visited a relevant authority of the National Bank to inquire about his opinion on this matter. It is said that the exchange rate of the National Bank's treasury is determined every Saturday by representatives of each bank's treasury at a small group meeting, based on the exchange rate situation of the past week, and the internal exchange rate of the next week is determined, and the elastic expansion of the exchange rate is made at any time according to the liquidity and tightness of funds in various places. He believes that the current expansion and contraction of the exchange rate is purely related to the supply of funds. If the funds are abundant, a large amount of exchange can be supplied, and the exchange rate will naturally be flat. Otherwise, simply raising the exchange rate to a certain place will slightly limit the transfer of funds on the one hand. However, the high exchange rate in a certain place will inevitably be passed on to the local prices, and the price level of the valley will be raised invisibly. Therefore, when adjusting the exchange rate, we must pay attention to the transportation of cash and take into account various factual environments and plan comprehensively in order to be effective.

### Chinese Stocks Were Once Tight, but Became Absent-Minded Near the Close

### China Trust Bureau Purchases the Fourth Batch of Frozen Eggs

The Export-Import Control Commission Entrusts the China Trust Bureau to Purchase a Large Batch of Frozen Eggs from Maochang Company

The Export-Import Control Commission has entrusted the China Trust Bureau to purchase a large batch of frozen eggs from Maochang Company for export. It is scheduled that 332 tons will be loaded on the Breconshirc this morning (the 6th) and shipped to England. According to the China Trust Bureau, since it has been handling the purchase of frozen eggs, it has reached the fourth batch so far. The first batch was 200 tons, and each ton was 48.9 million yuan. The second batch was 100 tons, and each ton was 56.775 million yuan. The third batch was 200 tons. Each ton was 59.4 million yuan. The fourth batch was 100 tons, and each ton was 62 million yuan. The selling price in the United Kingdom is 210 pounds per ton, and the shortfall in national currency is paid by the national treasury in order to strive for exports and maintain the international market. According to Zheng Xuejun, the person in charge of Maochang, the cost is slightly insufficient due to the price index and the rise in raw materials. The raw materials for the first batch of frozen eggs were only 1.6 million yuan per market dan, but now it has reached 2 million yuan. However, in order to assist the government in encouraging exports, it has to do its best. It is deeply hoped that the transportation situation will improve, and the cost can be reduced.

Yarn Price Lowered

The cotton yarn market was slack yesterday, because it was the period for Textile Construction's allocation and sale. There were 11 types of partners allocated to practical manufacturers, and transactions were scarce. However, the yarn number was not allocated, and people were soft-hearted, and there was little activity in the market.

### Charitable and Religious Organizations - Application Import Regulations

Management Committee Clarifies Original Provisions

[Our Report] Regarding Article 16 of the Import and Export Trade Regulations, which stipulates the application process for imports by "charitable," "religious," and "educational organizations," the scope is broad and may lead to abuses. The Import Management Committee has interpreted the implementation measures of the original provisions, dividing them into the following four categories:

(A) Charitable, educational, and religious institutions maintained by public funds or donated foundations, without private investment, may apply for import licenses in accordance with the provisions of Article 16.

(B) The aforementioned applicant organizations must submit a letter or attach a statement to the application, guaranteeing that the imported goods are for relief, religious, or educational purposes, or for the organization's own use, and not for the personal use of the organization's staff.

(C) The name of the consignee on the invoice and bill of lading must be the name of the organization, not the name of an individual staff member.

(D)  A certificate of origin must be provided by the applicant or the original shipper, proving that the payment for the goods has been settled abroad.

### Deadline to be Separately Defined

[Our Report] The Import Management Committee has slightly revised the provisions of Public Notice No. 7 of November 3rd regarding the handling of goods arriving at port with self-prepared foreign exchange without import licenses and the return of goods. The current public notice will amend the original Article 16, which originally stipulated that "if the importer wishes to re-export the goods, the 60-day period shall be calculated from the date of the announcement." The 60-day deadline will now be calculated from the date the Central Trust Bureau announces the allocation price for each category of goods.

Stable Foreign Tea Market

Domestic tea sales continue to be strong in this area and other regions, boosting confidence. The market remains stable.

As for the Keemun black tea from British firms, the prices are consistent as the main suppliers keep pace. There are no changes from before.

### Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association - Standing Committee Meeting

[Our Report] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held its 94th Standing Committee meeting on the 3rd. Wang Qiyu presided. Important reports included: A telegram from the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, announcing the cotton yarn tax schedule for the first half of December, effective from December 1st. The tax-paid price for 20-count yarn is 1,108,600 yuan per 100 kilograms, with a tax rate of 7%, resulting in a tax of 776,000 yuan. Regarding the allocation of American cotton to yarn factories with fewer than 3,000 spindles, the association drafted simplified rules and submitted them to the Textile Adjustment Committee for review. The Textile Adjustment Committee telegraphed back, approving the plan. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce responded to the association's statement regarding the difficulties in implementing the "method of affixing stamp tax tickets to invoices issued by manufacturers paying goods tax," stating that the matter has been forwarded to the ministry, and requesting that explicit supplementary measures be issued for cases where there is no sale, so that invoices for goods do not need to be created, in order to prevent disputes. The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee replied to the association's proposal to increase the allocation of American cotton by 611 bales, stating that the original ratio will be maintained, and all the remaining bales will be allocated to factories with fewer than 3,000 spindles, which has been requested to be handled by the head office. Important discussion items included: A telegram from the Textile Adjustment Committee instructed factories to submit daily yarn factory reports from December 1st. These reports were previously submitted daily during the cotton purchasing period for review by the association, but since cotton purchasing was suspended in April, the factories also stopped submitting the reports. The question now is how to handle this situation. It was decided that the association would wait for a form from the Textile Adjustment Committee with comprehensive content, then make modifications before sending it out to the factories for completion.

### Tung Oil and Bristles - Price Increases Make Export Prospects Unoptimistic

[Our Report] The prices of tung oil and bristles have risen sharply in the producing areas. The costs for exporters have increased. Sellers are hesitant to sell. The loss on the bristle trade has reached as high as 30%. Unless immediate measures are taken, the export prospects are not optimistic.

The Central Trust Bureau's Barter Department released a market report for tung oil and bristles from November 24th to 29th, 1947, stating: Tung Oil: Domestic tung oil prices rose during this period due to the exchange rate changing from 64,500 to 73,000. The price increases were particularly sharp in Guangzhou and Wuzhou. The price in Chongqing was 1.4 million yuan per picul, 1.68 million yuan in Hankou, and 1.98 million yuan in Shanghai. Speculators advanced 1.86 million to a planting factory for dozens of tons, with a January shipping date, calculated at US$0.235 per pound F.O.B. Shanghai. The price would be adjusted according to the normal exchange rate. The price in Changsha was 1.7 million yuan, 1.5 million yuan in Wanxian, 2.23 million yuan in Wuzhou, and 2.336 million yuan in Guangzhou. The overseas price in New York for spot goods has been done at US$0.265 per pound. The trend is orderly. The price for shipping drum oil from overseas is US$0.26 per pound CSF. Due to increased domestic costs, the military is watching the situation. Exporting oil at the current Shanghai market price involves a loss of about 5%. Because overseas sales prices are stable, the exchange rate adjustment situation is slightly better. However, smuggling in South China is rampant, and it is hoped that the authorities will take measures to stop it. Bristles: Domestic bristle prices increased in all regions during this period. Small 55s were 51 million yuan per picul, and Chongqing black bristles were priced at 22 million, with no market. Overseas prices for Tianjin large 55s were US$6.10 per pound CSF. Small 55s were US$4, and US$3 on the 26th. The trend remains weak. Chongqing black bristles were US$1.90 or 14 shillings. Flower bristles were stable at US$1.60 or 11 shillings and 9 pence. Hankou bristles were US$2.80, with buyers hoping for a slight reduction. Shanghai bristles were US$1.70. However, these prices are about 30% below cost, and how to promote exports depends on the authorities taking measures.

### Commercial Briefs

Since the issuance of the second tranche of short-term treasury bills for 1947, a total of US$2,141,250 has been sold nationwide as of December 4th, of which US$1,324,450 was sold by national banks in this city.

The cigarette market was quiet yesterday, with prices falling. Ten-packs of Great Britain and Old Knife cigarettes each fell by 4-500,000 yuan, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also fell by 500,000 to 1 million yuan.

Daily necessities and soap prices declined yesterday. Sales were good at the shops. Fixed and Arrow soaps each dropped by around 10,000 yuan. Matches and candles were stable.

There has been a sudden increase in applications for the return and export of materials brought to the port with self-prepared foreign exchange. There are about 600 cases to date. Very few applications for purchase have been received. It is said that all plan to transfer them to imports from Southeast Asia.

Literature and History

### Introductory Remarks

Our definition of "Literature" is broad, encompassing everything from the interpretation of language and writing to the study of ancient and modern books and literary works from China and abroad. We do not plan to publish purely artistic works or translations.

Our definition of "History" is also broad, encompassing everything from the narration and textual research of historical events to the introduction and criticism of historical books, as well as the exploration of any issue in political history, economic history, intellectual history, and the history of science.

As this publication is a supplement to a daily newspaper, we must consider the interests of the general reader. Therefore, we will strive to make the articles we publish popular, concise, and accessible, going deep while remaining simple. We do not plan to publish overly specialized textual research, overly difficult classical Chinese, or lengthy treatises of more than 4,000 words.

We do not advocate any particular historical perspective. We only wish to present everyone's academic achievements, whether large or small, and to address problems, using clear and fluent language to seek the correction of colleagues from all regions.

### Linguistics and History

— Ji Xianlin

Although linguistics and history are both independent sciences, they can help each other in many ways. We all know that history can help linguistics, because to study a language, the first step is to know the history of the people who speak that language: there is no need for us to elaborate on this. As for how linguistics can help historical research, and even solve some historical problems that can only be solved from a linguistic perspective, it seems necessary to discuss this in particular. I plan to give two examples below.

The first example I would like to cite is the problem of the original home of the Indo-European peoples and their subsequent migrations. These are certainly historical problems; but it was linguistics that raised and solved these problems. To describe this problem, we should first start with comparative linguistics. At the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, European scholars began to come into contact with Sanskrit. Soon they discovered that Sanskrit had many similarities with Greek and Latin. After careful research, they finally realized that the language used by the Indians, whom they had always considered to be a colored race, was originally related to their own ancient languages, and that the black-skinned Indians were originally one family with them. A brother who had separated and left thousands of years ago had now suddenly returned to the fold. This was such a great joy for the white Aryans. Therefore, a great European scholar said that the discovery of the formula Dyauspic (Sanskrit) = Zcus-pater (Greek) = Jupiter (Latin) was one of the most profound discoveries of mankind in the nineteenth century. Since they knew that Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and modern European languages all came from the same source, they continued their research based on this clue and finally reconstructed the so-called Proto-Indo-European language. This language is the ancestor of all later Indo-European languages. In this language, there is a series of velar consonants. For some unknown reason, these velar consonants later diverged. In the eastern branch of the Indo-European languages, they evolved into sibilant sounds; in the western branch, they became k kh g gh. For example, the word for "dog" is kuon in Greek and Canis in Latin, which is the western branch. In Sanskrit, it is Svan, and in Lithuanian, it is Szuo, which is the eastern branch. The word for "hundred" is Centum in Latin and Hekaton in Greek; in Avesta it is Satem, in Sanskrit it is Sata, in Lithuanian it is Szimtas, in Old Bulgarian it is Suto, and in Russian it is Sto. Scholars usually use the word Centum to represent the western branch of languages, and Satow to represent the eastern branch. Although these languages all evolved from Proto-Indo-European, they each have their own characteristics. Occasionally, there are two that are particularly close, such as the ancient Persian Avesta and Sanskrit. All of the above facts are purely derived from the study of languages. If we apply the results of this language study to history, we can get a clear picture of the migration and differentiation of the Indo-European peoples: the white people now scattered across Europe and Asia were originally one family thousands of years before Christ. They settled in a certain place on the Old World, and the population was probably not too large. Later, perhaps due to conflicts of religious opinion, or perhaps due to conflicts of political opinion, they finally separated. One branch went west, and over thousands of years, their descendants multiplied and formed many countries. One branch went northeast or southeast. On the way to the southeast, they stayed in what is now Iran for a period of time. Probably another internal conflict arose. So, one part stayed in place, and another part crossed the high mountains and rushed into India, becoming the ancestors of the present-day Indian Aryans. Anyone who reads my brief account will know how significant this fact is in world history; but this fact, which is so significant in world history, is not told to us by history, but by linguistics.

I mentioned above that the Proto-Indo-European people once settled in a certain place on the Old World. If we now ask, where exactly was that place? This is certainly another important historical question. Archeology, prehistory, and anthropology can all help to solve this problem; but without linguistics, other sciences can only give us a little fragmented knowledge. Only linguistics can connect these fragmented pieces of knowledge and give us a clear and concrete answer. So we still have to start with linguistics first. Let's first take a look at what words are in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European language, especially the nouns for animals and plants. Animal nouns include cow, horse, sheep, dog, pig, bear, etc.; but there are no tiger, elephant, lion, donkey, or camel. Plant nouns include willow, birch, beech, etc. Since there are no tiger, elephant, or lion, it can be seen that the Proto-Indo-European people had not yet seen these animals; and thus, it can be inferred that their original home would not have been in the tropics. At the same time, because there is no word for "sea" in Proto-Indo-European, it is evident that they did not live near the sea. There is no "camel," so it can be seen that they did not live in the desert. But from these words, we still cannot pinpoint a location. Let's take another look at the plant nouns. Among these words, the most important is the word "beech"; because according to scholars' observations and research, if we draw a line from the large German city of KonigsbCrg in northern Europe southward through Kiew in Russia all the way to Odessa on the Black Sea coast, then only on the west side of this line will there be beech trees, and there will be none on the east side. So the Proto-Indo-European people's home must have been on the west side of this line. Putting all of the above together, we can say that the original home of the Indo-European people was probably in the central to northern European region, and also slightly to the east. With this knowledge given to us by linguistics as a foundation, then other scientific research in this area will have something to rely on, and the results obtained will not be boundless. So, when studying this extremely important historical problem, linguistics is the main focus, and other fields such as archeology and anthropology can only help linguistics. The problem of the original home of the Proto-Indo-European people is an extremely large problem. Although I have said a lot above, and have arrived at a seemingly definitive conclusion; but this problem is not as simple as I have said above, and that result is not yet a conclusion. Future developments still depend on the efforts of scholars. However, no matter how far the research progresses in the future, those results observed from a linguistic perspective will never be overturned, and scholars can only supplement and revise these results to bring them closer to the truth.

Connected to this problem is another problem, also raised by linguistics, that has not yet been solved. We mentioned above that the Indo-European language family has eastern and western branches. In the western part of the Eurasian continent, they belong to the western branch, and in the eastern part of the Eurasian continent, they belong to the eastern branch. This seems very natural and there is no problem at all. Many languages of the Indo-European language family that were known and studied by comparative linguists in the nineteenth century conformed to this division. In other words, their grammatical phenomena and geographical locations were not in conflict. But at the beginning of the twentieth century, scholars discovered several new languages in Central Asia, Tocharian was one of them. There is no doubt that these languages belong to the Indo-European language family. Geographically speaking, Tocharian should belong to the eastern branch, because the Tocharian texts were all discovered in Xinjiang, China. But the grammar of Tocharian does indeed belong to the western branch. The word for "hundred" in Tocharian is Kant, which is enough to show that Tocharian is a Centum language. Why is there a western branch of people among the eastern branch of Indo-European people? We currently have no way to answer this question. But we believe that if this problem is solved in the future, we will have a very deep understanding of world history, especially the history of the migration of the Indo-European people.

Another problem is also somewhat related to the Indo-European languages, and we will also discuss it here. Mr. Gang Hetai once pointed out that several words in the Chinese language seem to have some relationship with the Indo-European languages (see Mr. Hu Shih's translation of Sanskrit books and ancient Chinese sounds in the first issue of the Peking University Quarterly). For example, the word "dog" seems to be cognate with the Greek Kuon and the Latin Canis. If more of these examples are found, we might be able to prove that Chinese and the Indo-European languages come from the same source, and perhaps we can draw the Chinese and Indo-European people into one family. Although I dare not say that this is definitely possible; but I dare not say that it is definitely impossible either. I can only say that it is not possible to prove it at present. If we really want to solve this problem, we can only follow the methods of European scholars, study ancient Chinese sounds, reconstruct the Proto-Chinese language, and then compare it with the Proto-Indo-European language. This is certainly another historically very important problem. Here, we can only take one path first, which is the path of linguistics.

The above discusses the first example. For the second example, I would like to cite the problem of the ancient inhabitants of the Western Regions. We all know that the people who live in Central Asia and Xinjiang, China today are of Turkic origin. But who lived here before the Turkic people arrived? Although our ancient history books pay special attention to the Western Regions and devote a special chapter to the affairs of the Western Regions, it is difficult for us to get a glimpse of which race these so-called barbarians belonged to from those records. The Book of Wei's Biography of the Western Regions, under the section on the country of Gan, gave a relatively concrete description of the appearance of these barbarians: "West of Gaochang, the people of various countries all have deep eyes and high noses. Only this one country does not look very barbarian, and is quite similar to the Han Chinese." But only the four words "deep eyes and high noses" can only tell us that they are different from the "Han Chinese." White people certainly have "deep eyes and high noses," but don't the Turkic people also have them? We still cannot determine their race. Since the excavation of ancient artifacts and documents in Central Asia at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, our research basis has increased. We can see the faces of these "barbarians" in the murals; but the impression given to us is still only the four words "deep eyes and high noses." Even the skulls dug out of the ground can only tell us that before the Turkic people arrived, the people of Central Asia must have belonged to the white Indo-European people. We still cannot know which kind of white people they were. Here, only linguistics can help us answer this question.

Among the three newly discovered ancient Indo-European languages in Central Asia, Tocharian is an independent branch. Scholars' opinions on the question of the affiliation of the people who speak this language are still very inconsistent, and we cannot discuss it in detail here. The remaining two, Khotanese Saka and Tumshuqese, have been studied by scholars and recognized as belonging to the Iranian language family of the Indo-European language family. Therefore, the people who speak these languages probably also belong to the Iranian ethnic group. Now let's go back to the question we raised above: before the arrival of the Turkic people in the ancient Western Regions, what kind of people lived there? We can answer that at least a large part of them were Iranian people.

The above discusses the second example. Of course, there are many more examples that can be cited; but these two are enough to show how linguistics can help historical research. Some of what I said above is just old news; but why did I especially mention that linguistics and many sciences can serve as auxiliary sciences for history; but linguistics does not seem to have been valued enough. I especially bring it up just to call everyone's attention. In addition, I also feel that many purely linguistic scholars limit the scope of their research to language alone and do not take a step outward. I also think this is a pity. Of course, not every conclusion of linguistic research can be applied to history; but at least some can, and the results obtained by applying linguistic conclusions to history are mostly very reliable. In order to make linguists pay attention, I wrote this short article. (November 29, 1947, Peking University)

### A Study of the Stone Drum Inscriptions Carved in the Third Year of Duke Ling of Qin

— Tang Lan

(The Stone Drum Inscriptions are a type of Qin stone carving. For convenience, the old name is temporarily retained.)

The Stone Drums are the most prominent ancient artifacts among extant bronze and stone inscriptions. Since their discovery in the Sui dynasty, there have been inscriptions, debates, textual criticisms, and rubbings, totaling at least more than a thousand instances that I am aware of. The era they belong to is itself a subject of much debate. Upon their initial discovery, Su Xu made an inscription, roughly surmising that the script resembled the Great Seal script, and thus concluded that it was written by Shi Zhou. He stated:

"The world generally believes that the earliest extant calligraphy is that of Li Si. Little do they know that the traces of Shi Zhou are close at hand in Guanzhong."

Because Shi Zhou was said to be the Grand Scribe of King Xuan of Zhou, and the syntax of the Stone Drum Inscription's phrase "My chariots are well-made" ("沔車旣工") matches the "Carriages of War" ("車攻") section in the Three Hundred Poems, which is attributed to King Xuan, poets like Wei Huaiwu and Han Yu, and calligraphers like Li Sizzhen and Xu Hao, all believed it was created during the reign of King Zhou.

Ouyang Xiu was the first to doubt this theory, saying that from the first year of the Gonghe Era to the eighth year of Jiayou, there were 1914 years. The drum inscriptions are fine and shallow, how could they have survived? He also noted that scholars with a fondness for antiquities since the Han dynasty had made no mention of them, and that the Sui dynasty had the largest collection of books, yet none contained the Stone Drums. However, he also said, "The calligraphy could not have been done by anyone other than Shi Zhou," because he was unaware that the Stone Drums were discovered during the Sui dynasty. Dong You's "Guangchuan Inscriptions," and Cheng Dayou's "Yonglu" also claimed that they were made during the reign of King Cheng, their only basis being the "Cheng had a hunt at Qiyang" mentioned in the fourth year of Duke Zhao in the "Zuo Zhuan."

Zhai Qinian in "Stone History" said:

"When writing seal script, the brush should proceed where it should proceed and stop where it should stop. Now, the positioning is cramped and awkward, with some strokes shortened and others lengthened in an effort to achieve balance, as with the characters 'Liu', 'Bo', 'Jun', and 'Shu'. The meaning is fully expressed, yet the brush continues, as with the character 'Ke'. The Ten Drums are roughly similar; I will give one example. Those responsible should understand this themselves. Compare the character 'Wei' on bronze vessels with the 'Wei' in 'He Wei Wei Li' on the Stone Drum inscription, and it will become clear. The calligraphy lacks the pure, ancient air of the Three Dynasties. That is why I say this… Regarding this script, I directly say it is not the work of Shi Zhou."

Zhai viewed the Stone Drums with the perspective of examining bronze tripods. This argument is very correct, but he did not point out what era they should belong to.

Zheng Qiao used the script to prove the Stone Drums were in Qin seal script. Because the inscription contains "Successor King" ('嗣王'), he placed it after Huiwen and before the First Emperor. He probably didn't believe that King Yan was a King of Qin, so he dated it after Duke Xiang and before Duke Xian.

However, based on the opinion of the Jin person Ma Dingguo as conveyed through Wen Yanwei's biography, it was believed to be the work of Emperor Wen of the Later Zhou Dynasty, because Emperor Wen of the Western Wei had a hunting excursion in Qiyang in the eleventh year of the Datong reign. Most Qing dynasty scholars used the King Xuan of Zhou theory, but some argued for the Later Zhou. There were also those who were curious, like Wu Yi, who said it was made during the Han Dynasty, and Wang Fuyun, who said it was made during the Jin Dynasty. Yu Zhengbian, because Li Biao's memorial contained the phrase "Sacrificial fields in Qiyang," believed it was made in the seventh year of the Taiping Zhenjun reign of the Northern Wei, and Yao Darong said it was made by Cui Hao.

Based on the comparison of scripts, modern scholars have generally realized that it could not have been from the Western Zhou, and definitely not after the Han Dynasty. Everyone believes it is a Qin stone carving. However, there are still disputes about the exact period. Zheng Qiao's date is wrong, and Gong Feng's is too long. Zhen Jun and Luo Zhenyu directly set it as the time when Duke Wen of Qin hunted in the east. Ma Heng, based on the Qin Gong Gui, speculated that it should be during the time of Duke Mu. Guo Moruo argued that it was Duke Xiang, and Ma Xulun still believed it was Duke Wen. The two had argued about this. Recently, having seen Xu Zhuang's "Stone Drum Inscription Compilation," he also advocated for Duke Wen of Qin.

Apart from Zheng Qiao and Gong Feng, modern scholars advocate: Duke Xiang, Duke Wen, and Duke Mu. These periods are all before the mid-Spring and Autumn period (Duke Mu died in 621 BC). I think the dating is wrong.

From the literary style, these ten poems had no influence on the Three Hundred Poems. "My chariots are well-made" is obviously copied from the "Carriages of War" section in the Book of Songs. From the calligraphy, this square, upright, and restrained script, with particularly large characters, is completely different from general bronze inscriptions, and even more different from the Qin Gong Gui. I should agree with Zhai Qinian's statement: "Lacking the pure, ancient air of the Three Dynasties." The main reason why Ma Dingguo and others suspected it was a work from after the Han Dynasty was that they felt it wasn't ancient enough, so they wanted to place it later. We should also consider this intuitive statement.

The most important method is to look at the script used to determine its era. Zheng Qiao knew it was a Qin stone carving because of the characters "Yi" (殹) and "Zheng" (烝). Ma Heng used twelve types of scripts to prove it. This is an unbreakable line of reasoning. However, neither of them paid attention to its historical era. Zheng Qiao determined that it was after King Huiwen because of the two characters "Successor King." In fact, the Successor King was still the Zhou Son of Heaven, so his statement is fundamentally flawed. Modern scholars place it in the era of Duke Wen, Duke Xiang, or Duke Mu, but they completely fail to pay attention to the following issues in the script.

The first-person pronouns used in the Qin Gong Gui and Qin Gong Zhong are only "Zhen" (朕) and "Yu" (余). The character "Zhen" is used in the possessive case, and the character "Yu" is used in the subjective case.

The Stone Drum Inscriptions use the character "Yu" in two places, the character "Wo" (我) in two places, and the character "Wu" (吾) in eleven places. The character "Wu" is used in both the subjective and possessive cases, with the possessive case being more common. There is no character "Zhen." (To be continued in the next issue)

### A Letter on "Jueju"

— Hu Shi

Brother Pingbo:

Thank you for sending me your poems to read.

Jueju are the most difficult to write. But this "small poem" style is quite suitable for writing about a small topic, so I think this form will definitely continue to be used by people in the future. But jueju originally came from southern folk songs, and when they reach the hands of scholars, they often become stale. If jueju can be preserved in the future, it must be closer to folk songs, sweeping away clichés and expressing a fresh artistic conception or impression with the cleanest language - only in this way can it have new life.

More than ten years ago, Fei Ming especially praised this jueju by Li Yishan:

Candlelight deep behind the mica screen,
The Long River gradually sinking, stars submerged.
Chang'e must regret stealing the elixir,
Blue sea and sky, nightly heartache.

That day, Ms. Yu Dawei asked me to write a plaque and also recommended this poem. I feel that this poem is not a very good jueju; it has a bit of meaning, but it is not expressed very clearly. I asked several friends to try to translate this poem into English, and they said that the first seven characters are difficult to translate because "deep candlelight" can have many meanings. As for the last two lines, they seem easy to understand at first reading, but after careful thought, they are difficult to translate into colloquial or foreign languages.

Such jueju are already far removed from folk songs.

An example of what I mean by jueju close to folk songs:

Green willows, green, the river smooth and calm,
I hear my lover singing on the river.
The sun rises in the east, rain in the west,
They say there's no sunshine, but there is.

This is a folk song, perhaps slightly modified by Liu Mengde, but the flavor of folk songs is still completely present. Another example:

From afar, I know the osmanthus in heaven is lonely,
I ask Chang'e if she needs anything more.
Luckily, there's idle land in the moon palace,
Why not plant two trees in the center?

Of course, Xiangshan's poem has underlying meaning, but this style is still very much like a folk song. I think this jueju is much better than Xiangshan's. (Bai Xiangshan himself also liked this poem very much; later he had a poem "Listening to the Song of Osmanthus," indicating that this poem was quite popular at the time and became a song.)

Scholars obtained the jueju form from folk songs, added new insights, more profound observations, and richer content, so the jueju of poets often have new realms, realms that folk songs cannot easily reach or cannot reach. Du Fu's "Random Thoughts" is the best example:

The peaches and plums I planted are not masterless,
The old man's low wall is still home.
It seems that the spring wind is teasing us,
Last night, it blew down several branches of flowers!

The willows swaying gently outside the door,
Are like the waist of a fifteen-year-old girl.
Who says the morning breeze is unintentional?
The wild wind breaks the longest branch!

These are realms that are rare or absent in folk songs. But the language here is still the most simple and clean vernacular, not relying on allusions, not flaunting diction. The artistic conception surpasses folk songs, but the language is still the language of folk songs.

The best jueju masters are Du Fu in the past and Yang Chengzhai in the future. Next are Wang Jinggong, Liu Mengde, and Du Mu. Such a small poem of twenty-eight characters, with so few writers in a thousand years!

More than ten years ago, I wanted to select "One Jueju Poem a Day," to pick out 365 jueju poems. This matter is still shelved. I've only written a dozen or so, with seven-character jueju being the vast majority. In the future, I want to select some five-character folk songs from ancient folk songs, such as "Ziye Song," and then select some seven-character folk songs from the southern folk songs that have appeared in recent years. Added to the five and seven-character jueju written by poets over the past thousand years, perhaps there can be 365 poems.

There are very few truly good five-character jueju written by poets. I like Du Fu's the most:

Don't say that spring is good.
The mad wind is good at mischief,
Blowing flowers away with the water,
Overturning the fishing boat.

I also like Yuan Tong's poem:

Returning drunk from the village at dusk,
Stumbling three, four, five times.
Rubbing against the green moss,
Don't startle you.

I also like a poem by Fang Weng:

Rising water enters my hut,
Duckweed sticks to half the door.
The sun comes out and the water recedes,
I wonder how you will return.

These artistic conceptions are all absent from folk songs. If you remember any particularly beloved jueju, please write some to me.

Sincerely,

Shizhi

### "The Way of Former Heaven"

— Mei Bai

Reading the Wuxi correspondence in the 4th of the month's Shen Bao, Wuxi recently uncovered the so-called "Way of Former Heaven" organization. The ringleader has been arrested and interrogated by the police and has "directly admitted to being the head of the Way of Former Heaven without demur." According to the report obtained by the police, the old Taoist who headed this organization usually engaged in "false and misleading statements to confuse the public, as well as instigating robbery and other illegal activities."

Of course, we may read this news with the same attitude as reading "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple"; however, from another perspective, it is impossible not to recognize that this matter is quite serious.

First, this type of organization has been strictly prohibited by repeated orders, so how can it still exist in secret? The so-called "false and misleading statements to confuse the public" may just be the "invulnerability to swords and spears" spiel, nothing more than a kind of propaganda strategy for this type of organization. What is truly worth noting is the latent power that maintains these followers. Given the practical nature of Chinese farmers in all matters, this latent power must be related to their real lives. Looking at the original news cited above, isn't there also the more important "instigating robbery and other illegal activities" in addition to "false and misleading statements to confuse the public"?

All of the "Way of Former Heaven," "Yiguandao," as well as the old "White Lotus Sect," and "Boxer Rebellion," etc., all grew up in rural areas. Education is undeveloped, so even today there are "ignorant men and women" everywhere. Children's elementary textbooks are full of gods and demons, and theater advertisements often show "zombies worshipping the moon." The general state of mind seems to maintain only an extremely fragile balance, so "false statements" arise and the "public" is "confused," even in Wuxi, a major city on the most prosperous Beijing-Shanghai line, the "Way of Former Heaven" has occurred. Mr. Hu Shi was already urging Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy to come to China during the May Fourth era. Who knew that after more than thirty years, there would still be so many "ignorant men and women"!

However, has the state of the rural economy today indirectly stimulated the growth of these secret organizations? It is true that those who talk about fundamental solutions every day are deemed pedantic; however, treating a headache when it hurts and treating a foot when it hurts, while convenient for newspaper report deadlines, is ultimately not a way to deal with social problems.

### American Magazines

— Jing Wen

Although England and America share the same language and similar origins, their expressions in general culture are not entirely the same, and sometimes differ greatly. For example, when it comes to the publishing culture of the two countries, there are too many differences. Early American culture was of course derived from its mother country's culture, but as America gradually established its own domain in production and economy, the living culture of the American people gradually became unique. Although the history of the founding of the United States is still short, we cannot deny today that the United States also has its own unique national culture.

The style and characteristics of American magazines are a unique expression of American national culture.

Speaking of magazine-type publications, we must attribute the credit for constituting a major force in publishing culture to the United States. Although the origins of magazine-type publications can be traced back to ancient publishing methods such as gazettes, newspapers, pamphlets, and collections, their appearance in a brand-new form and widespread popularity is only a matter of the last two or three decades. And after the First World War, with its strong material resources and financial resources, as well as the result of universal national education, a large number of new types of magazines emerged in the United States.

Today, there is probably no disaster in saying that American magazines occupy the throne of the world's publishing industry, and their great influence on world culture (whether good or bad is another matter) is also undeniable. Although the number of people who read American novels and study American academia may not be so high, there are probably very few who can read English and have not read one or two American magazines.

Precisely for this reason, we must have a considerable understanding of the situation in the American magazine world.

America is a so-called American-style democratic country, and this is reflected in the American magazine world in its broadness of thought. However, I only want to introduce its classification by nature here.

Roughly speaking, American magazines can be divided into the following categories in terms of their nature:

Pulp magazines—This type of magazine accounts for the largest number of American magazines. The content is mainly detective novels, adventure stories, science fiction, love stories, and popular historical romances, etc. During wartime, many war novels or interesting front-line features are naturally added. These magazines have rich illustrations, but the price is very low, and there is nothing to say about literary standards.

Slicks—"Slick" refers not only to the content, but also to its binding and illustrations. Like "The Saturday Evening Post" (now slightly changed), "Women's Home Companion," "American Magazine," "The Family Friend," and the slightly higher-end "Cosmopolitan," etc. These magazines are finely printed, and each issue publishes many short and long stories, features, etc. They are magazines exclusively for middle-class housewives and young ladies to enjoy, and there are specialized writers for them. In terms of literary standards, they belong to the second and third rate.

Almost all of the above two types of publications are sold domestically, and they are not often seen abroad, because most of the readers are Americans.

Quality magazines—These are mostly academic and literary publications. Like "Fortune," "Harper's," "Yale Review," "Atlantic," "The Literary Review," "The Forum," etc. In addition, there are more local publications such as "The Southern Review" (founded in 1935), New Directions (a literary quarterly specially for a small number of high-end readers), etc.

Miscellany—The characteristics of this type of magazine include current affairs, political commentary, various opinions, book reviews, character introductions, features, and other multi-faceted content, such as "Time," "Newsweek," "The Nation," "The New Republic," etc., which we all know. Even "Life" magazine and "Reader's Digest" can be included in this category. This type of publication is the most influential American publication abroad.

Aristocratic magazines—Although the name "aristocratic magazine" is fictitious, magazines like "Esquire," "Coronet," and "Pic" are high-end, tasteful magazines, judging by their content and exquisite illustrations. There is really no other way to name them except to say that they are American aristocratic magazines. It is likely that most of their readers are middle- and upper-class people.

The above is just a brief introduction. In addition, there are countless magazines on film, entertainment, humorous comic strips, fashion, gardening, etc. Due to space limitations, I can only omit them for the time being.

### Hair Standing on End in Anger

— Li Li

In idioms, there is the phrase "hair standing on end in anger." Is there really such a thing? Can our hair really stand up?

According to the explanation of physiologists, it is like this: extreme states of intense emotion (high degrees of fear and anger can cause this type of state) can cause the cells directly under the skin to suddenly contract strongly, causing our hair to stretch out in a straight line. At these times, our sweat hairs stand up straight. As for the reaction in the hair, although it is very weak, it can still be barely said to fully describe the high degree of anger.

In other cases, like when two roosters are fighting, the neck feathers stand up straight; when two dogs are fighting, the neck hairs also stand up straight. This is also due to anger. When the anger subsides, the standing hairs will return to normal.

### Seals and Signatures

— Wang Baili

Among the ancients, those who used a long number of characters on their seals, apart from using seven-character poetic lines, etc., had more than seven characters, and now there are several people: eight characters, such as Yang Tieya of the Qing Dynasty's "Lake, Mountain, Wind, and Moon, Seal of a Fortunate Person," and Tang Liuru of the Ming Dynasty's "First Romantic Talent South of the Yangtze River"; nine characters, such as Xiang Kongzhang of the Ming Dynasty's "I Am Not as Good as Others, Others Are Also Not as Good as Me"; ten characters, such as Li Zhongshi of the Yuan Dynasty's "Seal of Li Qi, Master of Zhongbao's Restful Studio"; twelve characters, such as Zheng Banqiao of the Qing Dynasty's "Kangxi Graduate, Yongzheng Graduate, Qianlong Jinshi"; fourteen characters, such as Sun Chendong of the Qing Dynasty's "As for His Person, Bald, Broad Forehead, Many White Eyes"; and Xiang Kongzhang had as many as sixteen characters: "Adorning is Sufficient for Divine Principles, Drenching Exhausts the Feelings of Things, Self-Evaluation of Xiang Bozi, etc." As for those with the most self-given names, there are two people: one is Xiang Shengmo of the Ming Dynasty, whose given name was Kongzhang, and style name was Yi'an, also known as Bozi, Daxi, and Old Man of Guxu Mountain, a total of six. One is Jin Nong of the Qing Dynasty, whose given name was Shou, who styled himself Mr. Dongxin, Min of Jiliu Mountain, Unofficial Historian of Qujiang, Resident of Xixie, Taoist Guest of Longdu, Wealthy Old Man of One Hundred Twenty Inkstones, and Monk of the Hut of the Heart Coming Home, a total of eight.

### Thermos

The inside is very hot, but the outside is ice-cold, not expressing itself, so its heat can be maintained.

It was blown down by the ruthless wind, mixed in the soil, but it provides nutrients for the sprouting of new leaves in the coming spring.

### A Collection of Smiles

Housewife: "Look at the dust on the shelf, it's been accumulating for at least six weeks."

Servant: "That has nothing to do with me, I haven't been here for four weeks yet."

A Greek painter painted a picture of a child holding a basket of grapes, so lifelike that even the birds would come to peck at the grapes. Everyone said it was good, but the painter was still not satisfied. He said: "The child didn't scare the birds away."

### Random Notes of Someone Peeping in the Pavilion With Rats: The Great Prince Who Is Still Not Dead

— Yu Shou

The Western Empress Dowager, as a woman, was "bold and suspicious." She regarded deposing an emperor and establishing an emperor as child's play. Her scheming and planning were so skilled that even the writing of past worthies still cannot attain that level. Her relationship with Guangxu had already broken down beyond repair before the Boxer Rebellion. In January of the 26th year of Guangxu, she formally announced that Puyi, the son of Prince Duan, Zaiyi, would be the Great Prince, stating that he would succeed Tongzhi. In reality, she was storing him as a preparation to depose and replace Guangxu.

Examining the genealogies of the Manchu Qing imperial family, Zaiyi was the second son of Prince Gong Yixin. Prince Dun had previously been adopted out to the third younger brother of Daoguang. Therefore, in terms of the strict requirements of "imperial succession," Zaiyi already did not belong to the line of Daoguang. When the Western Empress Dowager expressed her dislike of Guangxu and wanted to establish another heir for Tongzhi, there were many imperial children who competed with each other with their arms. According to Duke Fu's "Double Record of the Gengzi Year," Puyi and Pudong, the great-grandsons of Daoguang's eldest son, were the most fiercely competitive. Pudong, that is, the Red Bean Hall Master, was regarded as a Qing luminary and was once imprisoned for treason. In the end, the plan to depose and establish an heir was completely based on the Western Empress Dowager's personal grievances and affections. Only then did she temporarily elevate Zaiyi and others to bolster her position. In the end, she disregarded this genealogical system and resolutely selected Pujun as the Great Prince. This occurred in 1899 AD, and Pujun was only fifteen years old, fierce, rude, and ignorant of human affairs. The first thing he did after being established was to send palace servants to the Zhengyang Gate to buy a pony to bring back.

When the uprising failed, the violent group led by Zaiyi completely collapsed. The Western Empress Dowager was already taking Guangxu far away to Xi'an. In order to seek peace, Zaiyi was bound to be punished, and Pujun's title of Great Prince was also revoked at the same time with a public edict. This year, Yu Shou went to Beiping and heard people say that Pujun is still alive, now 64 years old, with both eyes completely blind. His livelihood is impoverished, and he only lives by relying on a certain Mongolian prince's mansion on the edge of Shichahai. When guests talk to him about things from fifty years ago, he stretches his neck and cries out, saying that the Empress Dowager treated me with kindness as heavy as the mountains and peaks.

Most of the so-called close branches of the Manchu Qing imperial family have become impoverished and defeated in the turmoil of the 30 years of the Republic of China, because they do not engage in production and are extravagant. After the head of state visited the old capital after the war, he wanted to find virtuous Manchu people to employ, in order to show the harmony of the five races. Aside from Zai Feng, the other sons of Prince Chun, Zai Xun and Zai Tao, all seem to be still alive, but they have not shed their bad habits of being dissolute wastrels, and stubbornly refuse to accept orders. Only Pu Ru, the second grandson of Prince Gong, was able to become a senator. Ru's given name was Xinyu, and he was skilled in painting, and was as famous as the carpenter Bai Shi, Qi Baishi.

### Recognizing a Small Stipend

Candle

In order to bring light to others, it does not hesitate to endure the greatest pain, until its strength is exhausted.

### Poems on Plum Blossoms

— Xu Jin

The Little Spring October of the old calendar is about to pass. Thinking of the ancient people's lines, "The plum blossoms open first in October," I was reminded of Zhang Shuo's "purple calyx" village plums, Du Fu's "fragrant road" wild plums, and Lu You's "casually opened" garden plums. The elegant mood of chrysanthemum viewing in Fuxing Park last month unconsciously turned to the plum blossoms with "cold fragrance suspected to be in the bones."

Coincidentally, an old friend whom I had not seen for many years solemnly brought a fan surface on which words had already been written, asking me to casually paint some flowers. Not knowing my limitations, I casually picked up a brush and drew plum blossoms. Before I applied the brush, I thought this was a seasonal work inspired by elegant sentiments. Who knew that this fan surface was old and dull. Once the brush touched it, whether it was light ink or burnt ink, it all produced a decomposition effect. The plum blossoms on the fan surface showed an oily sheen, forming fluid droplets. I'm afraid no one would be interested in appreciating this blurry fan of plum blossoms!

"What should I do? I have no explanation for my old friend whom I have not seen for a long time who solemnly asked me to paint!" I thought about it for a while and came up with a way to cover up my mistake—wipe off the oil sheen in the upper left corner of the fan and inscribe a seven-character quatrain. The poem is like this:

"Bald brush dipped in ink on the fan,
Subtle fragrance floats in oily ink,
And take the meaning of clear snow and harmony,
Entrust it to the plum branches, dotting and flowing."

It is not necessarily that there is painting in poetry or poetry in painting, but viewed literally, it can barely be self-justified. Undoubtedly, this is relatively more satisfactory.

The painting manuals say that there are ten types of plum blossoms: withered plum, new plum, luxuriant plum, sparse plum, mountain plum, wild plum, river plum, garden plum, palace plum, and coiled plum. The painting methods are different, and there is a five-character quatrain to explain: "Ten kinds of plum blossoms, must rely on the ink color to distinguish, do not let them be indistinguishable, write them as the same spring." I am ashamed! The plum blossoms I painted on the fan are not among these ten types of plum trees. The ink color is oily and indistinguishable, and the snow plums are mixed as the same spring. Then I can only say that it is an accidental self-creation with a unique style.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Two: A Gentle Chat (6)

After a good while, Qi Wan finally came in from outside, wrinkling her shoulders and saying, "Being called to go at this hour is such a bother." As she spoke, she sat on the sofa, tilted her head back, and stared blankly at the small electric light hanging in the middle of the room. After another moment, she resolutely called Wang Ma in and instructed, "If Director Lin calls again, tell him I've gone to see the old master at number eighteen." Wang Ma smiled and nodded, then left.

Zhu Qi was about to ask who this Director Lin was when Qi Wan chuckled and said, "It's rare you've come today, so I had to tell him a little white lie and not go. Mr. Xu, weren't you just asking about my learning opera? I followed my mother to Shanghai when I was ten. My mother knew many friends at the Shanghai Film Company and sometimes made guest appearances on the screen. At that time, there was a Mingming Film Company, which had an affiliated Mingming Singing Troupe. Any family members of people in the film industry could participate in learning to dance and sing. I could already hum a few tunes back then, and everyone in the troupe said I was willing to learn opera and probably had some potential, so my mother hired Mr. Lu Guiyu to come to our house every day to teach me opera. The first opera I learned was "The Universe Peak." The whole opera, including the gestures and singing, took me two full months to learn before the teacher thought there was nothing inappropriate. After that, Mr. Lu taught me a few other pieces, bit by bit, and I made a few guest appearances on stage. The results were not bad. I really wanted to stay in Shanghai with my mother and learn a few more old operas, but my father kept urging me to go back in letter after letter, so I had to return to Beiping. Because my father came from a scholarly family, he didn't want his daughter to learn opera. Although I begged my father several times, he just wouldn't agree. Later, I went to a missionary school in Beiping. It wasn't until I was sixteen that my father signed a contract with a Shanghai theater, and I went to Shanghai with him. At that time, my father was working with Mr. Zhao Shunming, who was my father's best friend, and whom he trusted the most. He had seen me a few times and strongly advocated that I learn opera, letting me develop freely. My father was finally moved and said that after returning to Beiping, he would hire a famous teacher to give me advanced training. After my father's contract with the theater expired, we returned to Beiping, and the old man finally allowed me to openly learn opera. First, I studied with the famous martial arts actress, Mr. Yan Nanfeng, for a few months. I finally got a grasp of the physical movements and singing, but unfortunately, Mr. Yan passed away. Because Mr. Yan and Mr. Zhu Lanfen were relatives, after Mr. Yan's death, Mrs. Yan introduced me to Mr. Zhu Lanfen, and I formally became his student. Teacher Zhu was very cautious and serious. When teaching students, he never allowed himself to be sloppy or misleading. The first opera he taught me was "Farewell My Concubine." Because he himself had a background in martial arts, although he had followed Mr. Mei for many years, he was very clear about Mr. Mei's movements. As for the Mei school's singing style, he still didn't quite understand it, so he specially introduced me to Mr. Xu Guifen to teach me opera. Because both Mr. Zhu and Mr. Xu were very enthusiastic about me, my father specially invited them to a restaurant and repeatedly entrusted them with my cultivation. That's why I didn't find it difficult to learn the first Mei school opera, "Farewell My Concubine," and I learned it all in just a few days."

### "National Porcelain" and "Old Capital"

Since the victory, it is said that the government plans to order Jingdezhen, Jiangxi to set up commemorative porcelain, named "Victory Kiln." It was also heard that at the wedding of Princess Elizabeth of England, the 175 pieces of fine porcelain given by our head of state were exhibited in the hall, and representatives from various countries praised them in unison, regarding them as unprecedented works of art. The above news may give the people of the country a great deal of interest.

China's famous products, the world knows "silk, tea, porcelain" as the three major categories, especially porcelain as the representative of Chinese crafts. Our country's science lags behind, and manufacturing cannot catch up with imported goods, resulting in a very large trade deficit. Only in the porcelain industry has it been sold abroad for more than a hundred years, which can slightly make up for it. The word "China" contains both the meanings of "China" and "Porcelain," so how can the relationship not be important?

Jiangxi Jingdezhen is the most famous porcelain producer in the country. In the former Qing Dynasty, the Jiujiang Daotai concurrently served as the kiln supervisor, promoting it with all his might. Therefore, the porcelain produced by the famous kilns in the town can be roughly divided into three grades: imperial porcelain, official porcelain, and commercial goods. The imperial porcelain was sometimes made with precious stones and colors from the palace treasury, which were issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Beijing. After it was made, if it was slightly unsuitable or not very refined, it was ordered to be remade, so the imperial porcelain was exquisitely made. Next, the official kilns were also characterized by strict regulations, and the commercial goods, although they were ordinary commodities, were also superior to those made elsewhere.

In the Qing Dynasty, every new emperor who ascended the throne would first order the production of era-specific fine porcelain, and each time it could represent the style of an era. Such as Kangxi's three-color, Yongzheng's blue and white, Qianlong's bean color and sacrificial blue, Jiaqing's five-color, Daoguang's painted figures, etc., all have characteristics. As for Lao Yuan's "Hongxian" emperor, although he only reigned for eighty-three days, the Hongxian porcelain was made with materials from the imperial palace, so the manufacturing was almost as fine as that of Qianlong and Jiaqing. Moreover, because the "Yuan Emperor" period was short and the output was small, rare things are precious, so although porcelain production was in modern times, its value even exceeded that of Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu. Lao Yuan had this masterpiece, which did not betray the "ninety-five" position.

There are many porcelain products in Hebei, including Cizhou products and Tangshan products. Those that are slightly finer invariably bear the mark of Jiangxi. There are porcelain shops in each city of Beiping, the largest of which are Detai on Qianwai Street, Hengfa on Dongsi Pailou, and Demao on Xisi Pailou, all of which are large in scale and rich in goods. Their goods are divided into two types: locally made goods and merchandise from other places. Locally made goods are made by local craftsmen, and the methods are also modeled after Jiangxi. For merchandise from other places, people are sent to Jiangxi Province on a regular basis to purchase them.

In the early years of the Republic of China, "Jiangxi Porcelain Industry Company" began operations in the old capital, and the local stores that had always flaunted Jiangxi could not help but pale in comparison. "Jiangxi Porcelain Industry Company" was located at the intersection of Dong'an Market and on the upper floor of Qianmenwai's Quanye Market. The exquisite products were indeed the best in the industry, but the high prices were also staggering. Most of its products are artistic, such as plates, cups, bowls, and pots. Before they are sold, wooden frames and brocade boxes are made to install glass windows, which is actually a disguised "antique shop," so the prices are extremely high and they are becoming more and more distant from the daily lives of the public. During the Beiyang government period, its sales channels were mainly the decorations of aristocratic families, the treasures of elegant guests, and antique shops that purchased its imitation products, added forgeries, and sold them as antiques.

Since Nanjing was designated as the capital in the 17th year of the Republic of China, and Beiping was changed to a city, general commerce has seen a decline, and the porcelain industry has been particularly affected, but it has lasted for ten years. Until the sudden outbreak of the Japanese invasion in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the old capital fell, and the market conditions were unprecedentedly desolate. The antique porcelain imitated by Japanese goods also invaded this industry, so the two branch stores of the company in the East City and Qianmenwai closed one after another, and the local large porcelain shops such as Hengfa also closed down one after another, leaving only second- and third-rate porcelain and iron shops.

From then until the present after the recovery, the porcelain products sold on the market are extremely complex, including Jiangxi porcelain inventory left by large porcelain factories, Oriental porcelain sold in large quantities by Japanese merchants and Japanese residents before they left, and Cizhou porcelain, Tangshan porcelain, and Xishan porcelain produced near Hebei Province. Among them, Jiangxi porcelain "company products" are still displayed in antique stalls or high-end department stores. The prices of large porcelain shops are slightly higher, and merchants speculate, creating news, saying that the Jiangxi porcelain kilns have been completely destroyed by the war, so the inventory will all become treasures.

Reading the Nanjin news, it is heartening to know that the Jingdezhen kiln factory, although affected by the war, has not been completely destroyed. As for how to revitalize it, I think the sages and gentlemen in Nanzhong and the officials in power will have good strategies. The reporter is in a remote location, and can only wait and see.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Interpretation: Intention to Seize a New Contract, Old Contract, Brewing Disputes

Wang Jingyan asked: A friend of mine mortgaged two shops to someone named Jia in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, with a term of seven years. In the nineteenth year, the house was destroyed by fire. Jia invested in rebuilding it. In addition to paying back 30% of the original mortgage price according to local custom, the construction cost was used as the mortgage price to re-establish the contract, and the mortgage was extended to the thirty-fourth year. The friend claimed the contract signed in the twelfth year was burned and did not care. When the term expired and he went to redeem it, Jia suddenly took out the new contract and claimed that the old contract from the twelfth year was invalid and that he should obtain ownership of the house. After a friend presented witness testimony and material evidence, he filed a lawsuit in court. Both the first and second trials were won, but Jia refused to accept the appeal to the Supreme Court. After more than a year of official documents going back and forth, the house is still occupied by Jia. May I ask what remedial measures can be taken to make him move out first? After the judgment is made in the future, should Jia compensate for all losses in addition to litigation costs?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replied] After the lawsuit has been filed, you should wait quietly for the final judgment of the Supreme Court. If you want Jia to move out of the house first, you must determine whether the first and second trials have declared provisional execution. As for the aspect of damages, you should file a motion with the court for a ruling.

### Telecommunications Q&A

(Shu Baohua of Hankou Road and Zhou Zhen of Guofu Men Road asked) It is extremely difficult to get through on local calls at noon. Is there any way to remedy this? (Answer) It is not difficult to communicate on calls within the jurisdiction of this bureau. However, when dialing users of the Shanghai Telephone Company, the number of relay lines between this bureau and the various bureaus of that company, including the north and south districts, is currently only 220 pairs. According to statistics, users of this bureau account for more than 90% at noon. Dialing the company's users must be connected through these relay lines, resulting in line congestion and difficulty in getting through. When making calls at noon, users are asked to avoid unnecessary socializing and conversations in order to achieve mutual cooperation.

(Zhao Shuchuan of Bingxing Road asked) What are the procedures and methods for sending and receiving telegrams by telephone? (Answer) In order to facilitate users with more telegrams, this bureau has opened a new method of "sending and receiving telegrams by telephone." Users can use the telephone to directly read the telegram to the telecommunications bureau, and can specify a code to avoid miscommunication. This service requires registration and is of a subscription nature. A monthly fee must be prepaid. The fee is divided into six levels, namely 1 million, 3 million, 5 million, 10 million, 15 million, and 20 million. For details, please contact the Business Section of this bureau at 70 Fuzhou Road or call 11490-52.
