Describing life in the bandit areas, they said: secret agents run rampant, and a little carelessness can lead to death. They loudly sing "Dig up the poor roots, dig up the bad roots, and carry out bloody struggle!" The number of people who die unnaturally in the bandit areas is unknown. Their longing for the central government is indescribable. They call listening to government broadcasts "sugar cake," meaning that although it is not sweet, it still has some sweetness. They all hope that the National Army can recover the vast unrecovered areas, and even more hope that they can use airplanes to carry a large number of propaganda materials to distribute in the unrecovered areas. One of the more knowledgeable youths said: the bandits are quite good at propaganda.

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shenyang, 8th] Although the war on the Northeast front was very fierce on the night of the 7th, it was quite stable during the day of the 8th. In addition, the National Army in the Western Liaoning Corridor converged, and the head of state's visit to the Northeast has greatly increased people's confidence, but it has also increased vigilance. The great battle between Tieling and Kaiyuan in the Northern Route has gradually unfolded. Kaiyuan Station, which is the location of the new Kaiyuan, is surrounded by bandits. Although the old Kaiyuan has fallen into the hands of the bandits, the National Army is still firmly defending the new Kaiyuan and the station. On the night of the 6th, 130,000 bandits attacked Kaiyuan Station in several directions but failed. Although bandits on both sides of the railway a dozen miles south of Tieling constantly plot to cut off the rear of Tieling, trains between Tieling and Panjin can still pass thanks to the National Army's intensified expulsion by land and air forces. In addition, the war around Tieling has not stopped. More than 5,000 bandits from Faku are stirring up trouble around Panjin, and are currently confronting the National Army near Jinfo City. In the Southern Route, the bandit forces in Yingkou retreated slightly during the day on the 8th after efforts by the land and air forces. In the Western Route, after the bandits captured Zhangwu, the air force flew to侦炸 on the 8th, and Xinlitun is quite tight. The Beining Line is being partially opened to traffic, and the National Army attaches great importance to the transportation on this line. In the Eastern Route, bandits are thinking of stirring up trouble.

The staff of the Changchun-US consulate are working as usual and have no intention of leaving Changchun at present.

[Shenyang Dispatch from This Newspaper, 8th] It is reported that Fu Zuoyi's troops are going out of the pass to fight, and a part of them has arrived in Suizhong.

There are no traces of bandits between Xingcheng and Suizhong, and the railway is beginning to be repaired from both ends.

[Beiping Dispatch from This Newspaper, 8th] Relevant agencies report: The external transmission of the tense situation in Qinhuangdao is not accurate. The situation there is as usual. Only two brigades of the Communist army are northwest of Changli, but they have been entrenched there for a long time. The Guannei section of the Beining Line has always maintained a decent level of prosperity. Although there is minor damage, it does not hinder the overall circulation. In addition, after the National Army from Guanjin arrived in Suizhong, the National Army in Xingcheng is also moving south. They will converge in Suizhong tonight.

### $30 Million in Relief Supplies Agreement to be Signed in Nanjing Within the Week, Emergence of the New Comintern Will Prompt the US to Actively Aid China

[Washington Dispatch from the United Press, 7th] A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy announced today: China and the United States will sign an agreement in Nanjing this week stipulating that the United States will assist China with $30 million in relief supplies. This is part of the US's independent relief plan for China and several European countries after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), totaling $35 million. The relief supplies to China include approximately 43,000 tons of rice, worth $11 million, 150,000 tons of wheat, worth $15 million, and $4 million worth of medical supplies. The distribution sites are mainly Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Hankou, Beiping, and Tianjin. Relief supplies will be sold at fair prices under the supervision of US government personnel, and the proceeds will be used to continue purchasing supplies for resale. The International Food Relief Committee has already stored the above-mentioned quantities of rice and wheat for shipment. Among them, 28,000 tons of wheat and 43,000 tons of rice have already been purchased under contract and can be shipped to Shanghai as soon as the agreement is signed. The agreement also stipulates that US reporters in China may investigate the implementation situation.

[Nanjing Dispatch from Associated Press, 8th] According to the results of tests conducted here last night, Chinese officials believe that the reaction to the new organization of European communist parties is the dawn of the establishment of the Fourth International, which may stimulate the United States to adopt a positive policy of political, military, and economic assistance to the National Government of China. They also believe that this matter is enough to make other countries understand the true nature of the struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the result is enough to make the United States assist the National Government as soon as possible. They pointed out that although this communist organization is specifically designed to defeat the Marshall Plan in Europe, the Marshall Plan cannot be extended to Asia due to the emergence of the organization, especially to China and Korea. However, they also admitted that if the Marshall Plan were extended to China, it might force Moscow to include Asian communist parties in the new Fourth International.

Question: The Soviet Union suggested that the United States and the Soviet Union jointly withdraw their troops from Korea. What comments does the Chinese government have on this?

Answer: I have already stated last time that the Chinese government has always hoped for the early realization of the unification and independence of Korea. Now we still hope that a satisfactory solution can be achieved to promote this goal. The complete withdrawal of the occupying forces from Korea should be included, but it is still difficult to comment on this proposal before the details of the US and Soviet proposals on the withdrawal of troops have been obtained.

Question: Has the Chinese government received official notification of the content of General Weidemai's report to President Truman? Will the Chinese government publish it?

Answer: No. The Chinese government knows nothing about the content of Weidemei's report to President Truman.

### The Democratic International, Zeng Qi Advocates Speedy Organization

[Nanjing Dispatch from Central News Agency, 8th] Zeng Qi, leader of the Youth Party, recently issued a statement on the establishment of the new Comintern, saying: Proves that the abolition of the Third International in 1943 was a "strategic" retreat, and the old Lenin established the "Far Eastern Republic" to ease the attacks of various countries, and then announced the merger, which is the same conspiracy. After the war, totalitarian and democratic countries formed a clear confrontation, reducing the authority of the United Nations and increasing the threat to peace. The Chinese Communists, who possess military force, will accelerate their destructive movement with the support of this international organization in order to prevent the construction of democratic constitutionalism. The countermeasures, in terms of the world, are that democratic countries should break their habit of "acting on their own" and organize the "Democratic International" as soon as possible to counter the "Communist International." In terms of China, the constitution should be implemented on schedule according to the planned plan, and large-scale reforms should be implemented to crush the "destructive forces" of the Chinese Communists with strong "construction forces."

Editorial

### Further Discussion on the Reappearance of the Communist International

Our newspaper already discussed the reappearance of the Communist International in yesterday's article, focusing on the Communist International itself and how we should deal with it. Now, we would like to further discuss it from the perspective of international politics.

First, we must point out that the reappearance of the Communist International cannot be said to be a new division in the international arena. The Communist International has always existed, and its appearance on the international political stage did not begin today. As for the declaration of its dissolution in May 1943, at most, it only canceled its name to the outside world. In reality, it still existed as before. This was already pointed out in yesterday's editorial. If the Communist International was dissolved in May 1943 in law (do juro), it existed in fact (do facto). Therefore, the reappearance of the Communist International is not a new division, but an old division that has already existed, re-hoisting its flag and preparing for war. This cannot be said to be a new Communist International or the Fourth International. Because in all aspects, the reappearance of the Communist International is actually the re-emergence of the Communist International or the Third International, which was established in 1919. In theory and in essence, it is not a new organization. We cannot believe that a notice of dissolution from Moscow means that this is the Fourth International, established after the First International, the Second International, the Second and a Half International, and the Third and Fourth Internationals. This is a point that we should recognize.

There are several points worth noting about the reappearance of the Communist International. First, the Communist parties in the Nordic countries, such as Finland, Norway, and Sweden, did not participate. Second, France and Italy are also listed within the Communist world. Regarding the first point, the non-participation of the Communist parties in the Nordic countries can be explained in two ways: First, the Soviet Union still hopes that the Nordic countries can permanently maintain neutrality and not participate in the world's struggles. Second, the Soviet Union has already considered the Nordic countries as part of the Soviet Union, so the Communist parties in those areas do not need to participate in this new declaration of the Communist International. Under totalitarianism, the Soviet Union, which aims to establish a Communist world, does not allow neutral countries to exist. Therefore, from the essence of its founding, we do not believe that the non-participation of the Nordic countries in the reappearance of the Communist International is to ensure their neutrality.

Speaking of France and Italy, this is undoubtedly the arena for the competition between Western democracy and communism. The Soviet Union's Iron Curtain has already extended from Szczecin on the Baltic Sea coast to Trieste on the Adriatic Sea. Germany, west of this line, is under the occupation of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Therefore, Italy and France have become the first line of defense in Europe for Western democracy against communism. Of course, the Kremlin is trying its best to seize them. Therefore, the participation of France and Italy in this re-emerging Communist International is a very natural thing. Due to the participation of the Communist parties of Italy and France this time, it will inevitably affect the future development of the political situation in the two countries. The Communist parties of Italy and France have considerable strength in their respective countries, while the People's Republican Movement in France and the Christian Democratic Party in Italy also have strong strength. Due to the participation of the Communist parties of the two countries in the declaration of the Roman capital, it may further enhance the momentum of the People's Republican Movement and the Christian Democratic Party. However, after the war, the economies of France and Italy are on the verge of bankruptcy, and the people's livelihood is deteriorating day by day. If Western democratic aid does not arrive in time, the future is difficult to predict.

At this time, we see the reorganization of the British government. This reorganization of the Attlee government, apart from the dismissal of Shinwell, the Minister of Fuel and Power, did not have many noteworthy changes. The Labour government still maintains its stable tone. Originally, the British Labour Party had both left and right wings. People like Bevin and Morrison have the strength of local trade union organizations and are also relatively conservative figures. Intellectuals such as Health Minister Bevan are closer to radicalism. In this reorganization of the British government, Bevin, Morrison, Cripps, and others were not only not shaken but strengthened their positions. This can also be said to be a response from the United Kingdom to the reappearance of the Communist International. Although the United Kingdom lacks US dollars, and the domestic economic situation is also very difficult, the United Kingdom is still a major pillar of Western democracy. Looking at this reorganization of the British government, it further strengthens our belief in the world.

With the current world situation evolving in this way, the country that considers itself the "arsenal of democracy" naturally bears a greater responsibility. It should have a firm policy and timely use its strength to support its emerging countries, to respond to strength with strength, and to respond to organization with organization. We must not forget the Far East, because in the Far East, we see the outbreak of World War II. Only in this way can we ensure this democratic world and world peace!

### Party and Youth League Re-Registration

(Continued from page one) This method is formulated based on the "Current Organizational Outline of the Chinese Kuomintang" passed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. The outline states that in order to rectify party discipline, corrupt and evil elements must be eliminated. At the closing of the revolutionary curtain, it was declared: "After the unification of the Party and Youth League organization this time, the first step will be to conduct a general registration of party members. This registration must expel corrupt and degenerate elements from the party to prevent them from mixing within the party." The Kuomintang Central Committee decided to conduct a general re-registration of party members and Youth League members in order to refresh the party's ranks. According to the provisions of this general registration method, party headquarters at all levels above the county level are responsible for organizing the registration. All party members who hold party membership cards or temporary party membership certificates, and Youth League members who hold Youth League membership cards or temporary Youth League membership certificates, except those whose party rights or Youth League rights have been suspended, shall apply for registration with their respective party headquarters within the prescribed time limit, and fill out a registration form. Party members and Youth League members who apply for registration and are found to have anti-party speeches or actions, are affiliated with other parties, create or participate in small organizations within the party to undermine party unity, are involved in corruption, or fail to pass the general review or general appraisal, will be deemed unqualified. Furthermore, party members and Youth League members who do not participate in the registration or participate in the registration but are ultimately deemed unqualified by the Central Committee will lose their party membership. For party members who apply for registration and are found to be qualified, the party headquarters organizing the registration will compile a roster, re-swear them in, and submit it to the Central Committee for the issuance of new party membership cards. Those who are unqualified must be submitted to the higher-level party headquarters for review or submitted to the Central Committee for decision.

### The Northeast War Situation Will Soon Be Optimistic; Deng Wenyi Talks About the Current Situation

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th - Director Deng Wenyi discussed the current situation in the Northeast at the Government Information Office press conference this afternoon:

Motivation for the Offensive: Since the Northeast Lin Biao bandit forces' fifth offensive in July was crushed in the main battle of Siping Street, although they have actively replenished their forces in the past two months, they have not yet reached the strength to launch another offensive. However, there are four reasons why they recently launched a sudden offensive: First, to respond to the failure in Jiaodong within the customs and to cover up international views; second, to seize the opportunity to grab food; third, to launch the war in the Northeast before the national army advances into North China to reduce the pressure on the two provinces of Shanxi and Hebei; and fourth, to carry out a war of attrition before the national army's massive reinforcements and supplies are deployed to the Northeast.

Strength of the Bandit Army: Although the area occupied by the communist bandits in the Northeast is larger than the area recovered by the national army, they are all sparsely populated areas and it is difficult to recruit and replenish their forces. Their current strength, in addition to the eight columns formally organized by the Chinese Communist Party (each column is equivalent to a military unit), also includes 145,000 Korean communists, 35,000 Mongolian communists, and 15,000 Japanese communists, for a total strength of 440,000 people. Currently, the Korean communists are located east of the Middle East Railway, but they have not yet launched an offensive. The 27th column of the Chinese Communist Party has already taken action on the far western border. To the east are the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th columns, plus the new 8th column in Yingkou, southern Liaoning, and the 8th and 9th columns in Rehe and Jinxi, totaling more than 200,000 people.

Current Actions: The bandits, aware of the thorough success of the national army's strategy of attacking Shandong and the Jiaodong Peninsula, cutting off their lifeline of communication between inside and outside the customs, have also followed this strategy after a disastrous defeat, first by destroying transportation and cutting off the national army's supply line. They began launching attacks in late September, attacking between Yuguan and Jinzhou, attempting to destroy the railway transportation between inside and outside the customs. They first launched attacks in Wanjiatun and Xingcheng to cut off the Ping-Zheng Railway, and then launched offensives directly towards the railway line in Baiqibao, Raoyanghe, Kaiyuan, and Changtu. However, they do not know that the national army's communication between inside and outside the customs is not only the Beining and Middle East Railways on land, but also the air and sea supply, which cannot be compared with the bandits' Jiaodong Peninsula inside the customs and the Liaodong Peninsula outside the customs. Secondly, they want to isolate Changchun, Siping Street, Kaiyuan, Tieling, Shenyang, Liaoyang, and Anshan on the Middle East Railway line. Therefore, the 2nd and 7th columns west of the railway attacked Fakuchangtu, while the main force of the 1st, 2nd, and 6th columns attacked Xifeng, Bamiancheng, and Kaiyuan. The 6th column even turned towards the southeast of Changchun to harass, while the 4th column attacked and harassed east of Tieling, and the 8th column launched an attack from southern Liaoning. On the one hand, they destroyed transportation, and on the other hand, they tried to attack the field army of the national army. The national army has a predetermined plan for this kind of act and the deployment is already in place. Unexpectedly, the offensive has been frustrated, and the national army is fighting back against the bandits in all aspects.

Future Prospects: Judging from the bandits' background and situation in the Northeast today, both sides are still in a state before the main decisive battle, and the war is still developing. It is too early to judge the outcome of the battle, but from the perspective of the national army's morale of recovering territory for the country and maintaining the survival of the nation, although the bandits rely on constant reinforcements, and we cannot underestimate their strength, they have lost the sympathy of the people of the Northeast. In addition, the national army has strong morale and a firm determination and confidence in defending the territory and protecting the people. The future of the war in the Northeast will soon be optimistic.

### Analysis of the Movements of the Communist Army Within the Customs

Analysis of the movements of the Communist army within the customs in the past week:

Chen Yi's bandit forces' actions can be divided into four regions for explanation: Jiaodong, western Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and the border area of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu: The 9th and 13th columns of the Jiaodong bandit army, because the national army captured Yantai and Muping, went straight to Wendeng and Weihaiwei, and were in great danger of being annihilated by the sea. Therefore, its 9th column and a small part of the 13th column fled westward to survive, attempting to join the remnants of the 2nd and 7th columns who were trapped northwest of Zhucheng between Weihe and Gaomi. The remaining bandits of the 13th column have retreated to the area south of Weihaiwei. Currently, our navy and army are cooperating and have entered Weihaiwei and Rongcheng Bay. If the bandits fight desperately, they may be completely annihilated by us. The remaining bandits of the column were originally composed of local troops, and their combat power is extremely weak. They only lurk and move at night, and only serve to contain the national army and maintain the connection between the north and south of the Yellow River. The communist army in northern Jiangsu has no great strength. Whenever the national army is mobilized, they take the opportunity to sneak attacks on towns and villages, looting houses to seize supplies and recruit soldiers as a negative action. The bandit army in the border area of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu is the main force of Chen Yi's bandit army after its defeat in western Shandong. The bandit originally crossed the Dongyue Railway and infiltrated Lianghuai, but with only 10,000 people, it besieged Suxian, which was firmly guarded by only one battalion of the national army, and was still repelled after more than two days. It can be seen that its combat power has been greatly reduced after the battles of Juye, Chengwu, and Cao County in western Shandong, and it cannot engage in a main battle with the national army. At the same time, seeing that there is a strong national army force pressing southward in the Suqian Qiaoning area, if it crosses the Dongyue Railway, it will inevitably be forced into the area between the Shuanggou, Suining, and Huaihe areas, restricted between two lakes and two national armies, which is extremely dangerous. Therefore, it painfully abandoned this best strategy and transferred the remnants of the 3rd, 4th, and 6th columns westward from Mengcheng and Guoyang, and the remnants of the 1st, 8th, and 12th columns fled south of Fugou to seek to avoid being encircled and annihilated by the national army, reduce the difficulties of Liu Bocheng's army, and want to merge. However, this attempt has not yet been fully realized.

As for Liu Bocheng's bandit army, in the past week, the national army encircled and attacked the remnants of its 1st, 2nd, and 6th columns near Baique Garden. After days of hard fighting, with about six or seven thousand casualties, they finally broke through and fled to the southeast on the 3rd of this month, in a very embarrassing state. Recently, they have been forced to collapse to the Huang'an Macheng area, with little remaining. The remnants of the 3rd column, who were originally entrenched in the Gushi Sanhe Jia area, fled to Lihuang after the disastrous defeat in Jingshang, and then entered the Dabie Mountains. However, because the national army had already controlled the mountain city, the bandit's dream of rebuilding a mountain base area was temporarily unrealizable. Moreover, since the national army implemented a luring strategy from Guangshan, Huangchuan, and Shangcheng with superior forces, Liu Fei's 1st, 2nd, and 6th columns could not join its 3rd column remnants in the northeast, and could not coordinate operations with Chen Yi's bandit forces. His attempt is difficult to achieve.

Fan Qihua's army of Chen Geng's bandit army entered the Funiu Mountains because the national army advanced eastward from Tongguan and exerted pressure on it with powerful troops from Shangnan and Shangcheng. This was a passive rather than a planned action. As for Han Shi's bandit army's 4th and 9th columns, they have been attacked by the national army near Hancheng Town, northeast of Luoning, for several days. They have suffered six or seven thousand casualties, and they cannot retreat or advance. They are in extreme difficulty and had to transfer the bandit 26th Brigade, which had sneaked east to Yiyang, back to rescue. The main battle against the national army at Mingbi Town can be the prelude to the bandit's collapse.

[Our Guangzhou Office, 8th] The deteriorating situation in the local financial market continues to worsen.

The Hong Kong dollar is still hovering between 13,000 and 14,000, and the price of rice has also risen by more than 20,000 yuan per load, with top-quality rice costing more than 310,000 yuan per load, while the designated bank's foreign exchange rate has not changed.

The reporter visited Liu Zuoren, the head of Guangdong Province, and according to him, a satisfactory result has been achieved, but the details cannot be announced until the detailed methods are decided.

### Kawashima Yoshiko's Public Trial Postponed; Yesterday's Courtroom Crowded, Unable to Open

[Our Beiping Office, 8th] The public trial of international female spy Jin Bihui (Kawashima Yoshiko) was postponed today due to too many spectators. The trial was originally scheduled to open at 2 PM this afternoon. By 12 noon, the front of the court was already extremely crowded, with about four or five thousand people. Initially, the bailiffs guarded the door and refused entry, but then the side door was forced open and people poured in, leaving almost no space upstairs and downstairs. The judge's seat was also occupied, and chairs and railings were crushed. The old building creaked and groaned. If the people upstairs had not poured down, a tragedy would have almost occurred. The court temporarily announced the postponement. Jin Bihui was brought in at around 1 PM and was discovered and surrounded. Jin had short hair, wore a white top and green suit pants, and her face was red as if she was happy, not like someone in prison. She frequently nodded to acquaintances to signal her greetings. After the decision to postpone was made at around 2 PM, she was sent back to prison by the guard. Jin jumped into the car, and before leaving, she gave a private letter to a certain acquaintance.

### Statement from the Director of the Bureau of Supplies: Procurement of Cars, Refrigerators, etc., Absolutely Within Scope

[City News] Rumors have been circulating that the Bureau of Supplies successively purchased cars and refrigerators without completing customs declarations and inspections for import procedures, and that five Austin vehicles were priced for sale immediately after their arrival, exceeding the scope of their authority. Director Jiang Shao has stated the following: (1) The five Austin vehicles belonged to the former British troops stationed in India, who had borrowed five Jeeps from our government. Due to long-term wear and tear, they could not be returned. The British military in Calcutta allocated five old military Austin vehicles to our country as compensation. The Materials Reception Committee of the former Ministry of Economic Affairs transported them to Shanghai, arriving on September 6, 1946. At that time, based on general customs procedures for materials received from India, it was permissible to first provide a letter of guarantee and later complete the procedures. Indeed, customs were not declared at the time. However, after the bureau took over the Shanghai office's business, it collected evidence for customs declaration and submitted supplementary declaration under customs declaration number 3620. (2) Four Ford cars and one old Cadillac car arrived in Shanghai on February 28 of this year. The bureau declared customs under customs declaration number 495 and had import permits from the Import Management Committee (GOMC 64, 64). Apart from the Cadillac, which was transported on behalf of former President Song, the remaining four Ford cars were approved by the Executive Yuan for the bureau to retain for use and have not been sold to date. (3) The three refrigerators were entrusted by the China Merchants Bureau in June of last year. Since the bureau had previously purchased ships from Canada for the China Merchants Bureau without refrigeration equipment, they were purchased on their behalf. The import date was November 7 of last year, before the government's explicit prohibition on imports.

### Jinan Police Solve Bizarre Impersonation Case: Discharged Private Claims to Be Major General, Publicly Recruits Over Two Thousand Youths

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 8th] The First Battalion of the Eleventh Regiment of the Military Police in this area has recently solved a bizarre case in which Li Shitian, a former youth army private, impersonated a Youth Army Major General Commander, and recruited over two thousand youth students. It is reported that after Li's discharge, he impersonated the Major General Commander of the Training Corps for Youth Army Veterans of the Tenth Special District of Shandong, privately carved official seals and youth cadre symbol armbands, and established a Youth Veterans Training Brigade in Zhoucun, recruiting over two hundred youths. At the same time, personnel were also dispatched to Longshan, Mingshui, Jining, and other places, and they also recruited and trained a total of two thousand youths. The source of funding was mainly through extortion and fundraising. A certain theater troupe in Jinan City volunteered to raise funds for the troupe, performing a charity show. At the same time, Li took the opportunity to seize a building in Jinan. After seizing it, he first sold the furniture. Li recently also indicated to the press that he intended to start a daily newspaper. Even more seriously, on October 16, Li, on the grounds of disrupting military discipline, bullying superiors, and disobeying orders, shot and killed Zhang Xuexian, the attached first brigade commander of the corps, who had been deceived and imprisoned in Zhoucun. After the incident, when the military police went to arrest him, Li still said, "I am a dignified Major General, how dare you arrest me?"

### On the Current Form of Military Suppression of the Rebellion

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liu Guangyan

The military suppression of bandits has recently been actively developed. With the dedication of the National Army soldiers, the communist bandits in Shandong have been wiped out and recovered by the National Army. This is indeed a major achievement in the military suppression of the rebellion, and its significance is even greater than the recovery of Yan'an and Zhangjiakou. However, after suffering this major blow, the communist bandits have adopted a policy of fleeing around, harassing everywhere. During this autumn harvest season, not only are materials plundered, but the people are also subjected to the tragedy of killing and fighting. A few people who do not understand the truth, seeing the communist bandits spreading to such a vast area in a short period of time, may lightly believe the rumors made by the communist bandits themselves, thinking that their strength is quite large. This article will briefly discuss the actual situation and the communist bandits' attempts, so as to correct the readers who are concerned about the current situation.

First, let us examine the current military situation: The recent movements of the communist bandits that deserve our attention can be divided into the following points: 1. Chen Geng's troops are entrenched in the Funiu Mountains, with the intention of advancing westward or southward. 2. The remnants of the communist bandits in Shandong have not been cleared, especially the remnants in the triangular area of ​​the Bohai Bay, who are still reorganizing. 3. Chen Yi's bandit troops are fleeing southward, with a tendency to join forces with Liu Bocheng. 4. Liu Bocheng's bandit troops are coercing people on a large scale, seemingly with ulterior motives. These are all things that people concerned about the military situation of suppressing the rebellion are paying attention to. However, if we review the actual situation, we will know that the various actions of the communist bandits are nothing more than posing and exaggerating their strength. For example, Chen Geng's bandit troops are still lurking in the Funiu Mountains, proving that they dare not leave the Yellow River line. Although they have cut off the Longhai Line, they are constantly guarded by the surrounding National Army. If they go deep to the west or south, they will not be able to flee back in the event of an emergency, resulting in repeating the mistakes of Li Xiannian. For example, in the triangular area of ​​the Bohai Sea in Shandong, although the remnants are still posing, the certain columns that remain are all composed of militias and do not have much combat effectiveness. The bandits in other parts of Shandong are currently posing as strongly attacking Weixian; however, those who understand the bandit situation know that they dream of returning to the Yimeng Mountains. Not to mention that the National Army is constantly monitoring and will never let them succeed, and the food reserves in the Yimeng Mountains are all under the control of the National Army. Even if the bandits enter the mountainous area, they will not be able to find food. As for the recovery of Yantai and Weihaiwei, although the communist bandits boasted that there are still ports on the Yellow River that can be used for their north-south transportation; however, the ports on the north bank of the Yellow River that can be used by the bandits are small in scale and can only accommodate small sailing ships. Compared with Yantai and Weihaiwei, which can accommodate huge warships, the difference in value cannot be measured in miles. Secondly, regarding Chen Yi's southward flight. It is rumored that Chen Yi's bandit troops have joined forces with Liu Bocheng's bandit troops; however, there is actually a certain distance. Moreover, Liu's and Chen's bandit troops have very different strategic styles. Although we cannot list them in detail, we can point out that it is not easy for the two bandit troops of Chen and Liu to join forces. Finally, there is Liu Bocheng's troops. Liu's bandits were the first to flee south, which caused panic among the people in the rear; however, Liu's troops have been reduced from 80,000 to more than 20,000 after running for several months, and because they travel more than a hundred miles a day, their physical strength is exhausted, and the treatment of officers and soldiers is very different, resulting in a very depressed morale. Recently, Liu's bandits have only used Jingfu County as the center to harass the surrounding areas, without much major intention. It is said that Liu's bandits will flee into the Dabie Mountains as a base, which may be possible; however, the National Army has already seen through his treachery and will definitely be able to block and suppress it.

Second, let us look at the communist bandits' intention in this kind of fleeing policy: - For the sake of clarity, it can be explained in the following points: 1. The communist bandits' goal is to create refugees. In order to increase the difficulties for our government, the communist bandits have long decided to create refugees in large numbers, and this was used as a slogan when the communist bandits moved in the Cangxian area of ​​North China in July. Wherever Liu Bocheng's troops go this time, they rob everything and burn down the houses, forcing the people to leave, which is undoubtedly a continuation of the refugee creation policy. 2. The communist bandits' goal is to create chaos and riots in the rear to obstruct our military operations. After the communist bandits were heavily attacked by our military, they knew that their strength was far from enough to compete with us, so they turned to various cities in our rear to incite riots. In order to prepare for the implementation of this work, we must first shake people's hearts; and today, the best way to shake people's hearts is to destroy construction, obstruct transportation, and create economic panic. Based on this strategy, wherever Liu Bocheng went, he did his best to destroy factories and mines, and cut off railways. The recent soaring prices are directly affected by this. 3. The initial intentions of the communist bandits Chen Geng and Liu Bocheng to cross the river to the south or invade the east were to support Chen Yi's troops and maintain the Shandong Military Region's territory, especially the supply lifeline in the triangular area of ​​the Bohai Sea. However, this plan has now become a bubble, so they do not hesitate to flee around in order to vent their anger at being severely attacked and to take this opportunity to open up another way to survive, which is the so-called "a way out of no way."

Looking at the overall situation, we feel that the current military suppression of the rebellion can be optimistic. From the mainland point of view, it can be said that the first phase of the work of suppressing bandits has been completed. As for the important tasks in the future, in addition to military pursuit, so as not to let the embers reignite, the focus should still be placed on politics and economy. As long as the government can rectify officialdom and strengthen grassroots politics, the communist bandits will never be able to flee around as before. As long as the government accelerates production, saves expenses, and gradually improves the lives of the general public economically, the communist bandits will be abandoned by the people, even if they coerce them by force.

The above is in terms of the general situation in the mainland. As for the war situation in the Northeast, the communist bandits have gathered a larger force than before this time to attack the National Army, and its momentum is very fierce. However, the National Army has gathered a strong main force in Shenyang; and the reinforcement and supply are more complete than in previous times. Even in terms of the cold-proof equipment for soldiers, the situation of the National Army is far better than that of the bandit troops. Therefore, although the continued fighting time of the communist bandits in the Northeast may be longer than in previous times, their final collapse is still beyond doubt.

In summary, the overall military suppression of bandits can be optimistic. What we are now focusing on is: on the government's side: how to rectify officialdom, stabilize prices, and strengthen the general mobilization, launching a large number of grassroots cadres to the front, so that everything can cooperate with the military. On the people's side: how to contribute their strength and materials to help the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. (October 7)

### US and Soviet Union Coordinate on Greek Issue, United Nations General Assembly Shows True Colors, Debate in Political Committee Nearing Final Stage, Poland Advocates Direct Discussion of Palestine Partition

[Report] New York, 8th Broadcasting: Lake Success News, the Polish representative today urged the United Nations General Assembly to abandon all other proposals for resolving the Palestine issue and focus all its efforts on partitioning the land to establish Jewish and Arab states. The Polish representative also advocated allowing 250,000 European Jewish refugees to immigrate to Palestine. This method is strongly opposed by the Arab countries.

[Report] New York, 8th Broadcasting: Lake Success News, the Polish representative's speech at the UN General Assembly today for the first time showed that the Soviet bloc may reject the Arab demands and support the partition of the Holy Land. The Polish representative said that in view of the inability of the Arab and Jewish peoples to cooperate, partition is probably the only solution, although this method was not originally favored by Poland. But Poland still hopes that the Holy Land can still be a self-contained economic unit, and the partitioned countries should strive for cooperation.

[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The United Nations General Assembly's 57-nation Political Committee, after debating the Balkan issue, has created the most chaotic state in the history of the United Nations, and the possibility of compromise between the US and Soviet solutions to the Balkan dispute has clearly been lost, and the day of reckoning is approaching. Some representatives believe that the Political Committee will put it to a vote before the weekend and immediately submit it to the General Assembly for discussion.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 8th] After three weeks of eloquent accusations, the United Nations General Assembly has reached its climax on the 8th, and the two major proposals for Greece and Palestine have finally revealed their true colors. It is expected that regarding Palestine, the Soviet bloc will reject the Arab demand for the control of Palestine in the committee today and support the general principle of dividing the Holy Land into two states, Jewish and Arab. The long-awaited US policy statement on Greece may be revealed on the 9th or 10th. The general debate has ended, and the Political Committee has also begun to examine half a dozen or more proposals. In the last minute, small countries and countries in the middle of the US and Soviet Union, opposing the US-Soviet showdown, may cause the United States to demand that the General Assembly condemn the aggression of the three countries of South, Bulgaria, and Albania and blame the Greek situation on the efforts of the three countries, and all its efforts will be in vain.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 8th] When the UN Political Committee debated the Greek issue yesterday, the Yugoslav representative Bebler pointed out that the UK disregarded the Allied agreement in Greece, which immediately aroused the rebuttal of the British representative McNeil, accusing him of not using insulting words, and said, "I believe that after his neurosis recovers, he will definitely apologize." Swedish representative Unden proposed a compromise, not intending to blame anyone, and requested Greece and its neighbors to restore normal relations. Greek representative Melas denied that Greece was preparing for war, and he requested the United Nations to protect Greece, and the debate was immediately adjourned.

### Security Council Continues to Debate Indonesian Issue, Dutch Representative Surrounded on All Sides, Jiang Tingfu Refutes Klippens' Speech

[Reuters, Lake Success, 7th] When the United Nations Security Council resumed its debate on the Indonesian issue on the 7th, the Dutch representative Klippens' speech aroused severe criticism from several countries, including China. Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu led the offensive against the Dutch representative, saying: Klippens spoke too much, but weakened his position.

He mentioned various atrocities, but then jumped to his conclusion, saying that the entire Indonesian regime should be condemned. It must be known that the leaders of the Republic feel no less regret than we do for the atrocities. Although we are legally responsible for the Indonesian leaders, there is a distinction between them and they should not be generalized. Recently, there have been rumors from the outside world that the Netherlands intends to no longer recognize the current leaders of Indonesia. This move will be a strong motivation to continue Indonesian resistance. Jiang immediately requested the Security Council to fully support the Three-Country Mediation Committee and task the committee to start work immediately.

Indian and Polish Representatives Support Soviet Proposal

Indonesian representative Bila urged the Security Council to order both sides to withdraw to their positions before the conflict occurred. Bila also condemned the tone and substance of the Dutch representative's speech, believing that he had not paid sufficient attention to the necessary conditions for a peaceful solution. He pointed out that it was disappointing that the Dutch representative failed to explain how his government was prepared to implement the ceasefire order. Polish representative Kaczorowski supported the Soviet proposal, requesting the Security Council to order both sides to withdraw to the defense lines before the conflict, and he also pointed out that the main failure of the Security Council was its failure to treat both sides equally.

Indonesian Representative Requests Swift Action

Indonesian representative Bala said that when the Dutch army stopped advancing, it immediately drew an imaginary line, and began military action on towns and villages that unfortunately fell behind the line. Therefore, it is already very clear that the Dutch army has not respected the ceasefire order in its literal and spiritual sense. Bala put forward the following points: 1. Indonesia welcomes the Three-Country Mediation Committee, 2. Indonesia hopes that the United Nations can guarantee that its solutions are binding on both sides, 3. Indonesia requests swift action to prevent destruction and death; 4. The Three-Country Committee should work outside the Dutch and Indonesian areas to prevent direct influence.

The United States is Expected to Oppose the Demand for Both Sides to Withdraw

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] It is reported that the US will oppose the Soviet Union's request that the Dutch army withdraw to the area of ​​July 20 before the Three-Country Committee begins to resolve the Dutch-Indonesian dispute in a "mediation" manner in the Security Council. It is reported that the US intends to recommend that the Three-Country Committee immediately assist both sides of the Dutch and Indonesian sides, hoping to obtain a method to resolve the dispute from this.

### Captured Dutch Soldiers Have Been Released

[Reuters, Batavia, 7th] Three Dutch soldiers, who were captured by the Indonesian army because the American plane they were on was forced to land, have now been released by order of Yogyakarta and flew back to the Dutch-controlled area on an American plane.

### I Support India's Proposal on the Issue of Southwest Africa's Trusteeship

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] The dispute between India and South Africa over the difficult issue of Southwest Africa caused a heated debate at the meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Committee on the 7th, and China expressed its support for India's position. India's proposal last week was discussed in the Trusteeship Committee today. India advocated that the General Assembly should decide on a deadline, ordering South Africa to submit a proposal to place Southwest Africa under trusteeship. South Africa refuted that South Africa has "no legal obligation to place the mandated territory under trusteeship", and the Netherlands supported South Africa. Denmark put forward a proposal to support South Africa and set up a fact-finding group. Chinese representative Liu Chuo made a major objection to the Danish proposal, saying, "If the Danish proposal can be passed, what is the connection between the information obtained by this group and the United Nations' plan?" This group will achieve nothing, "but it can cover up the fact that there is no decision on the trusteeship of Southwest Africa, and it can avoid the topic and create a situation that violates the Charter."

### Muslim Youths, Ready to Fight for Palestine

[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] The president of the Muslim Brotherhood, Banja, sent a telegram to Azam, the secretary-general of the Arab League, telling him that 10,000 Muslim youths are ready to fight for Palestine. He said that this is the first division of the Muslim army, and he believes that fighting is the only way to save Palestine.

### US's New Proposal on the Korean Issue May Be Submitted to the General Assembly Tomorrow, Hodge Advises Koreans to Remain Calm

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] According to authoritative sources, the United States hopes to submit its motion on the Korean issue to the United Nations Political Committee on the 9th (Friday). In the motion, the United States advocates the establishment of a United Nations committee to monitor the South Korean elections and the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops. The United States will welcome the Soviet Union's proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of troops from the two countries, but will suggest that the United Nations say that there are still many issues that are best handled by the United Nations Committee. The United States will suggest that the US and the Soviet Union should not have representatives on this committee.

Previously, it was generally discussed that the United States would suggest that the Allied countries provide economic assistance to South Korea, but the United States will not mention this point in the motion, but will suggest that an agency should be established at the request of South Korea to cooperate with the organization that investigates the withdrawal of troops. The most senior officials in the United States firmly denied the rumors that the United States intended to suggest that the United Nations take over the trusteeship of South Korea. They said that this statement is completely contrary to the opinions of the US delegation at this time. The US delegation met on the 7th, and Marshall personally attended and immediately decided to submit the US proposal as soon as possible.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 8th] General Hodge issued a statement today, saying that regarding the Korean issue, because of the shelving of the US-Soviet Joint Committee, the United States submitted it to the General Assembly for discussion. Korean people requested to send representatives to participate in the United Nations conference. The US side did not know anything about it beforehand, and the US side did not appoint anyone to serve as a Korean representative. I have no right to elect a Korean representative. Regarding the Korean general election, because the United Nations is now waiting to discuss the Korean issue, and its results are still unpredictable, holding a general election now will lead to more difficulties. If the Korean people support the United Nations to resolve the Korean issue, they should be more calm and patient in order to smoothly resolve the issue.

### US Gains Preliminary Victory in Washing Away Accusation of War-Mongering

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] The United States gained a preliminary victory in the United Nations on the 7th in opposing the Soviet Union's accusation that the United States is a war-monger. Mrs. Roosevelt directed the operation in the Social Committee. The committee finally rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to restrict the freedom of the press to curb war-mongers by a vote of 34 to 6. Eight countries abstained.

### American Reporter Reviews Soviet New Policy

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] Now that the Comintern has been established, how will the Kremlin complete its new policy? According to New York Times political reporter C. L. Sulzberger, Moscow leaders are expected to adopt the following strategies in various processes: To sign bilateral military alliances with Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Albania, while standardizing military equipment and technology. The Soviet Union has already signed such agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. If the Communist Party gains control in Greece, Austria, or Italy, the Soviet Union will enter into similar agreements with those countries or traitors. Continue propaganda, while possibly providing other support to Greek rebels. Promote the most powerful Communist Party organizations in France and Italy. Delay the stalemate in peace treaty negotiations with Germany and Austria. Regarding Soviet activities outside of Europe, Sulzberger further observed: Soviet propaganda in the Middle East will be strengthened, but achievements will vary. The Soviet Union will maintain its position of dominance over the United States in Korea; in Outer Mongolia, Soviet influence is already above all else. Sulzberger received the Overseas Press Club of America award in 1941 for his outstanding reporting on the Soviet-German war. Sulzberger stated that it is believed that Moscow is not only paying attention to the tin and gold of the outside world, but also to the granting of base rights for passages to India (such as those obtained when China and the Soviet Union jointly controlled Xinjiang). Sulzberger stated that one of the reasons for this move by the Soviet Union is that the Communist Party firmly believes that non-Communist countries will fall into a dangerous period of depression within a few years; another reason is the orthodox doctrine of the Communist Party, that the war between capitalism and communism is inevitable.

### Australian Foreign Minister Visits Truman Advocates for Speedy Convening of a Peace Conference with Japan and Reveals Principles Already Drafted by the Far Eastern Commission

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 7th] Australian Foreign Minister Herbert Vere Evatt, while meeting with President Truman today, emphasized the urgent need for a peace treaty with Japan. After a half-hour meeting with the President, Evatt stated: Australia welcomes the United States' proposal to convene a peace conference. He explained: The major powers have reached a unanimous agreement on the initial actions of the Far Eastern Commission, but he declined to predict when the conference would be held. He stated: He had recently traveled in Japan and found that MacArthur was doing an "excellent job" in handling the occupation. He revealed: The Far Eastern Commission has drafted principles for resolving the Far Eastern issues, and commented that this solution should be simpler than the solution to the European problem. When asked about the possible impact of the new European Comintern on the Far East, he declined to answer, but stated that the announcement of this new organization was "merely a symptom."

### Conference to Handle Issues of Italian Territories Nineteen Countries Including China Granted Speaking Rights

[Reuters, London, 7th] The representatives of the four foreign ministers resolved today to allow nineteen countries, including China, to express their opinions on the issue of Italy's former colonies. These are countries that signed the peace treaty with Italy, such as Pakistan, which was established after the peace treaty was signed, as well as Egypt and Italy, which have territorial claims on Italy's former colonies. However, whether the aforementioned relevant countries may also express opinions on the procedures adopted by the four-power investigative committee to conduct on-the-spot surveys of public opinion in the former Italian territories has not yet been agreed upon by the four powers. According to a spokesman for the Italian Embassy in London today, the Italian government will soon submit a memorandum to the four-power conference, stating Italy's attitude and emphasizing political and economic reasons to request permission for Italy to participate in the administration of its former African colonies. If Italy is allowed to govern its former colonies under UN trusteeship, it would not only satisfy the aspirations of the Italian government but also greatly help solve the unemployment problem of tens of thousands of Italian workers.

### After the Establishment of the New Comintern, the French and Italian Communist Parties Face Difficulties The US State Department Purges Unstable Elements

[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] It is generally believed here that after the establishment of the new Comintern, the French and Italian Communist Parties are at a great disadvantage. Outside the Iron Curtain, only the French and Italian Communist Parties participate in this organization. This clearly indicates that the French and Italian governments will be the first targets of the new Comintern. The Communist Party has also obviously ruined its own future and will no longer be able to participate in the French and Italian governments or form coalition cabinets. The acquisition of key cabinet seats has traditionally been the Communist Party's way of "legally" seizing power.

[Associated Press, Rome, 7th] Italian Communist Party leader Longo stated: The organization of the Communist front indicates the sharpness and imminence of the danger of war. The organizational meeting of the Information Bureau is limited to Southern, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, France, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Italy, and the Soviet Union, because these countries are now most threatened by the imperialism that takes aggressive actions, and therefore these countries are most capable of resisting its attacks.

[Reuters, London, 7th] British Communist Party Secretary-General Pollitt issued a statement welcoming the establishment of the nine-nation Communist Information Bureau.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] The U.S. military newspaper Stars and Stripes stated: Nozaki, the second leader of the Japanese Communist Party, denied that the Japanese Communist Party is related to the new Comintern. He stated that this is a European issue and has nothing to do with the Japanese Communist Party, and that the Japanese Communist Party will not have any contact with it in the future. Nozaki stated that the Japanese Communist Party will issue a formal statement after obtaining more accurate information.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The State Department announced today that in order to prevent spies from spying on State Department secrets, it has ordered the Personnel Department to investigate the identities of all civil servants. Those who are members of the Communist Party, Nazi Party, or Fascist Party, or who have dealings with these parties, should be reported to Secretary of State Marshall for dismissal. So far, nine people have been dismissed, three have resigned voluntarily, and an unannounced number have been granted permission to resign. Those who are dismissed will never be rehired.

### Responding to the Economic Crisis The British Cabinet is Reorganized to Strengthen Its Lineup Five Giants Share the Responsibility of Leadership

[Reuters, London, 7th] Prime Minister Attlee recently announced the reorganization of the Labor government's lineup, bringing younger figures into the cabinet to strengthen its ability to cope with the economic crisis. The changes announced tonight have completed the reorganization work that began eight days ago with the appointment of Cripps as Minister of Economic Affairs.

The new cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting on Thursday. One of the effects of the reorganization is that the five giants of the cabinet will personally assume the responsibility of leading the five parts of the campaign to overcome the economic crisis, namely, Prime Minister Attlee assumes the leadership of general responsibilities, Deputy Prime Minister Morrison controls the Labor Party in Parliament and the government's legislative plans, Foreign Secretary Bevin is responsible for the supreme responsibility for all foreign affairs, Economic Minister Cripps controls various economic departments, such as commerce, transportation, fuel, and electricity supply, and maintains contact with the Ministry of Finance, and Finance Minister Dalton is solely responsible for financial affairs.

[Our Newspaper] New York, 8th Broadcast: The British public's reaction to the large-scale reorganization of the cabinet and the demotion of left-wing Fuel Minister Shinwell is mixed, with some welcoming it and others expressing dissatisfaction. Four of the twelve newspapers in London believe that this is a sign that the British Labor Party's socialist government is shifting to the right.

List of Cabinet Members

Prime Minister Attlee. Deputy Prime Minister Morrison. Foreign Secretary Bevin. Finance Minister Dalton. Economic Minister Cripps. Minister of Defense Alexander. Minister Without Portfolio Addison. Lord Privy Seal Jowitt. Home Secretary Ede. Minister of Health Bevan. Minister for Burmese Affairs Listowel. Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. Secretary of State for Scotland Woodburn.

### Cripps Talks About Emergency Economic Measures

[Our Newspaper] London, 8th Broadcast: British Economic Minister Cripps gave a speech to reporters today, stating that the British government's emergency economic measures must be thoroughly implemented, otherwise Britain will be in dire straits. Currently, our country has begun to use gold and dollar reserves, and the amount of these reserves is not very large. Once they are exhausted, it will affect the entire gold pound zone. Therefore, Britain has to reduce imports and increase domestic production, using the method of lowering the standard of living to overcome the difficulties, but this method is not enough to solve the economic problems of the entire world. The general lack of dollars makes international trade impossible to develop, which is something that our country alone cannot do.

### Problem of Occupation Military Expenses in Germany British and American Consultation in Washington Smith and Others Will Participate in Reviewing US-Soviet Relations

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] Four senior U.S. officials in charge of European affairs, namely U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, German Political Advisor Murphy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas, and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Occupation Forces in Germany Clay, arrived here on the 7th to participate in an emergency meeting on U.S.-Soviet relations and the future U.S. economic and diplomatic policies in Germany and Austria.

### Step Up! Step Up! Curb the Market Upsurge Mayor Reports Causes and Countermeasures A Large Number of Economic Police Officers are Mobilized Today Suggestions for Goods Imported with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange

[Our Newspaper] Recently, prices in this city have risen again, and the black markets for gold, banknotes, cotton yarn, and US dollars have become even more rampant. The city government held an economic inspection meeting at 11:00 yesterday morning to discuss countermeasures. At 4:45 p.m., Mayor Wu met with reporters from various newspapers in the city government conference room to report the resolutions as follows: (1) Gold and banknotes: In order to accurately destroy the black market prices, in addition to intensifying inspections and audits, it was decided to strictly inspect the wireless telegrams from Hong Kong to Shanghai and strictly prohibit the private establishment of radio stations to avoid affecting black market fluctuations. As for the reason for the surge in the foreign exchange black market, it is because rumors spread in the market that the central government would allow the opening of self-provided foreign exchange purchases of goods, and citizens believed it to be true, resulting in mass absorption. Now the city government has decided to make two suggestions to the central government: Goods that have been imported without a permit that are not necessities must be ordered to return to their original place, but it is strictly forbidden to transport them to Hong Kong to prevent them from being smuggled to Shanghai. Goods that have been imported without a permit that are necessary for industry must be uniformly distributed to various factories by the government, stipulating the legal profit for intermediate merchants. The mayor had consulted with Executive Yuan President Zhang and Central Bank President Zhang on the above methods, and he firmly believes that the central government is very likely to adopt them. (2) Cotton prices: The fluctuation of gold banknotes and US dollars is actually caused by the upsurge in cotton yarn prices, so the city government is determined to suppress them. It has ordered the police bureau and the cotton regulation committee to thoroughly investigate the origin and whereabouts of the yarn stored in various factories in order to crack down on transactions of a "kick the ball" nature. Once discovered, they will be severely punished. (3) Rice: The rice currently allocated to workers and the poor in this city has been implemented. The city government has recently requested the central government to allocate more rice, which will be transported to Shanghai soon. Furthermore, in order to dredge the source of rice in this city, it has been requested to the central government to order the Ministry of Food to transfer the rice-producing areas to transport rice to Shanghai as much as possible, and the price of rice will definitely stabilize. (4) Cooking oil: At present, there are still black markets and smuggling of cooking oil in this city. The city government has often requested the Executive Yuan to order the customs in Wenzhou and Ningbo to prohibit the transshipment of cooking oil to the south. Mayor Wu stated at the end: Starting from the 9th, a large number of economic police officers will be mobilized to earnestly implement the various points decided by the inspection meeting.

### Uniform Distribution and Sale of Cooking Oil, Limited Storage of Coal By the Kilo Two Methods Passed to be Implemented Today

[Our Newspaper] The city government's economic meeting yesterday passed two cases: the method for distributing and selling cooking oil to retail merchants of cooking oil proposed by the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association, and the Provisional Measures for the Storage and Management of Coal by the Kilo in Shanghai. The outline of the method for distributing and selling cooking oil to retail merchants of cooking oil is as follows: In order to assist the government in stabilizing oil prices, this association will implement the distribution and sale of cooking oil to retail merchants in this city in accordance with the provisions of this method. All retail stores in this city that have been registered with the Social Affairs Bureau, etc., and have obtained a business license, may register with this association to apply for distribution and sale. The quantity of cooking oil for distribution and sale shall be 1,200 market dans per day in principle, with members of this association responsible for 20,000 market dans per month. If the quantity is insufficient, the Central Trust Bureau shall allocate it from the storage of cooking oil from various factories that it has consigned. The quantity allocated to each retailer shall be determined based on the actual sales of its store. The type of cooking oil for distribution and sale shall be designated by each distributing factory. The price of each type of cooking oil shall be discussed and submitted by this meeting to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval, and then notified to the offices of each factory daily for posting. After the quantity for distribution and sale is approved, this association will issue an oil distribution certificate with an official seal card, designate the oil factory for distribution and sale, arrange the dates in groups, and distribute and sell in rotation. The detailed implementation rules will be formulated separately.

The provisional measures for the storage and management of coal by the kilo are as follows: These measures are hereby formulated to prevent the hoarding and manipulation of coal by the kilo in Shanghai, which affects people's lives. The storage of coal by the kilo (including bituminous coal, anthracite coal, and coke) in this city shall be governed by these measures, except as otherwise provided by the Measures for the Prohibition of Hoarding and Profiteering of Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Periods. The amount of coal stored by factories shall be limited to two months' consumption. The amount of coal stored by coal merchants shall be limited to one month's turnover (the average amount for each month in the first half of the 36th year shall be the standard), but those who purchase large quantities of coal from non-controlled mining areas may apply to the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (hereinafter referred to as the Fuel Management Committee) for approval to increase the amount of storage. The storage of coal in coal yards by depositors shall be limited to one month. If the time limit is exceeded, those with a quantity of more than 100 tons must be approved by the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee. Except for coal dealers, coal yards, and those who truly need coal by the kilo, no coal by the kilo shall be stored. If there is any violation of these measures, such as storing coal by the kilo, or storing exceeding the limit, or storing in a coal yard exceeding the time limit without clearing it, and other provisions, and if it has not been reported to the Fuel Management Committee for approval in advance, the Fuel Management Committee shall purchase it at the allocation price. All coal by the kilo that is purchased due to violations of these measures shall be deducted by 30% of the purchase price and used as bonuses for investigators. If it is discovered due to a tip-off, the bonus shall be equally distributed between the tip-off and the handling personnel. These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Shanghai Municipal Economic Inspection Meeting, and shall be reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs by the Fuel Management Committee for record.

A total of 127 staff members, 105 police officers, and 119 workers will be awarded. They will be given certificates and medals. The award ceremony will be held on National Day at the Majestic Theatre after the National Day Commemoration Meeting.

### Complex Parole Procedures: Shanghai Prison Explains Reasons for Delayed Implementation

[Our Report] "Parole," "parole," how many family members of traitors hope for the realization of "parole." Suzhou Prison has already paroled thirteen people, and a second batch of forty-nine people has been approved. Why has Shanghai Prison been slow to implement it? To find the answer to this question, the reporter visited the Shanghai Prison authorities yesterday. According to them: Suzhou Prison started the work of examining traitors earlier, so parole was also earlier. Shanghai Prison is actively carrying out the work of parole, and the roster and assessment forms will be sent to the Ministry of Justice for review within a few days. The parole procedure is quite complicated. The outside world does not understand the truth, which has caused misunderstandings.

Traitors in prison must meet the following conditions before they can be paroled: ☐ They have served their sentence, ☐ They have evidence of genuine repentance, ☐ For life imprisonment, more than ten years have passed; for fixed-term imprisonment, more than one-half of the term has passed. The so-called life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment refer to the executed sentence, which is limited to the actual number of days spent in prison, and the number of days of detention is not counted. Therefore, there are not many traitors who meet the parole conditions. As for the investigation of genuine repentance, it is assessed by the prison's education section, work section, and guard section. The standards for assessing prisoners are: ☐ work, ☐ sense of responsibility and will, ☐ conduct. The scores are divided into four levels, and those who pass are promoted to the next level. According to the provisions of Articles 75 and 76 of the Prison Regulations, when they are promoted to the first and second levels, they have the hope of parole. The prison's progressive treatment review committee will review and approve them, and then the prison affairs committee will pass them. The warden will submit them directly to the Ministry of Justice for approval, and the parole work will be completed. Those who are paroled must be placed under probation according to Article 94 of the Criminal Law to prevent them from relapsing. The purpose of parole is to enable people to correct their mistakes and start anew. If they commit a crime and are sentenced during the parole period, their parole will be revoked, and the number of days they were released from prison will not be counted in the sentence.

### Emergency Meeting of the Municipal Industrial Association: Discussing the Issue of Importing Goods Registered with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange. Decided to Ask the Chamber of Commerce to Lead the Effort to Secure Certificates and Open Up the Process Quickly.

[Our Report] Various industrial trade associations held an emergency meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to discuss the application for government-issued certificates for importing goods registered with self-provided foreign exchange. The following resolutions were made: ☐ For industrial raw materials and production equipment purchased with self-provided foreign exchange that have already arrived in port or were shipped before the end of September, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should lead the relevant industrial trade associations to strive for the quick issuance of certificates and the opening up of the process in order to maintain production. ☐ Each industrial association should immediately notify its members that if they have goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange, they should quickly register with their respective associations so that they can be reported to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for verification. At the same time, the meeting also discussed how to promote the implementation of the legal reduction of the business tax for manufacturing by half. It was decided to continue to argue reasonably and to jointly submit a petition to the relevant authorities in the name of the various industrial associations to request the legal reduction of the tax by half. Representatives will be sent to Beijing to petition if necessary.

Sixteen Associations Including Import and Export Associations Invite People from All Walks of Life to Hold a Forum

[Our Report] The sixteen trade associations, including the Import and Export Commerce Association under the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, held a forum at the International Hotel yesterday for the purpose of applying for certificates for the import of goods registered with self-provided foreign exchange. More than sixty people, including experts, scholars, and members of the press, were invited to attend and conduct a public review of the issue. Jing Wei chaired the meeting. Fan Heyan, Pan Shihao, Wu Chengming, Sheng Mujie, Pan Shijie, Ji Chaoding, and others spoke separately, expressing sympathy for the two requests made by the industry. The two points are as follows: ☐ For registered materials with self-provided foreign exchange that comply with the current trade control regulations and are items allowed for import, please issue permits as soon as possible so that they can be declared and imported early. Items that are prohibited from import should of course be prohibited. ☐ Extend the shipping deadline for ordered goods to the end of September, and allow manufacturers and importers to provide documents to complete the registration and release them.

### Luo Qinghua Writes to the Transportation Management Committee with Two Suggestions

[Our Report] Luo Qinghua, Standing Director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, wrote to Zhang Gongquan, Chairman of the Transportation Management Committee, yesterday, requesting a quick solution to the issue of goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange by various industries. He also discussed the Administrative Yuan's review meeting, which had suggested several processing principles, stating: ☐ Increase customs duties by 100% to serve as a fine. At a time when the national treasury is stretched, levying taxes through fines is a reasonable approach to increase revenue. ☐ Pay 50% of the value of the goods to the Central Bank as a deposit, which will be refunded in three installments within six months with an interest rate of 2%. This method aims to temporarily freeze part of the purchasing power, which is well-intentioned. However, in reality, the goods ordered by importers have been delayed for years. Under high interest rates, most of them have been mortgaged and borrowed again and again, with interest accruing on interest. Even if the goods are taken out for sale, there is no ideal superior profit beyond clearing debts. It is recommended to order the relevant industry associations of the Chamber of Commerce to supply the goods at a fair price within a certain period of time according to the registered types and quantities, and not to hoard and speculate. ☐ Thoroughly investigate the source of foreign exchange: Although this is a good idea, it belongs to the past. Instead of pursuing the past, it is better to strictly demand the future. Each importer should be required to provide a written guarantee stating that they will no longer engage in scalping foreign exchange or violating trade regulations, which is more practical and convenient. In addition, Luo also suggested: ☐ For materials shipped after August 16 and before the end of September that could not be stopped, it is proposed to uniformly complete the registration and handle them in the same way. ☐ For orders placed before November 17 last year that have valid documents and are verified to be true, even if they are not permitted import materials, they should also be completed for registration, and various situations should be considered to determine the processing method for different types of goods in order to resolve the pending cases.

[Our Report] The District Court received a self-accusation from Zhang Weifeng, residing at No. 2, Haichangli, Gongxin Road yesterday. The defendant is named Xu Zilu, who was her former neighbor. In the first half of the year, the defendant used the excuse of asking Zhang to do needlework in his room, led her to a secret room in his house, and seduced her in every possible way. Soon after, the plaintiff's husband, Gu Yijin, found out and moved to Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, but Xu still frequently went to Gu's house to flirt when Gu Yijin was out, and eventually succeeded three times in a hotel.

### The Glory of Shaoxing People! Standard "Lower River" People in Chongqing

[This newspaper's Chongqing 6th dispatch] People from the "Lower River" area who first come to Chongqing, this land and water transportation hub, few do not know Zheng Hongfu. This 47-year-old middle-aged man stepped into Sichuan province on August 1st, 1937. In just ten short years, he has become one of Chongqing's "celebrities" who occupies an important position.

When Zheng Hongfu was thirteen years old, he was an apprentice at the "Huichuntang" Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop in Cixi. At the age of nineteen, he went to Shanghai and worked as a junior clerk at the "Caitongde" Pharmacy on Henan Road.

A chance opportunity led him to work as an accountant at "Yipinxian" at the age of twenty-three. A friend from Hechuan, Mr. Yu Shaoqiao, invited him to help in the Sichuan Tax Bureau. As a result, near Jiudaomen on Linsen Road, he spent 570 yuan to acquire a shop.

The Hongfu Restaurant thus opened. It is said that Mr. Pan Gongzhan, who was with the Overseas Department and the Social Affairs Department at Jiudaomen at the time, often liked to eat a bowl of pork rib noodles at the Hongfu Restaurant.

He felt that killing living beings was never a good thing. Eventually, he returned to his original profession, inviting twenty friends to contribute capital, 50,000 yuan each, for a total of one million yuan, and transformed the Hongfu Restaurant into Chongqing Zhejiang Qingyutang Pharmacy. On the opening day, Chongqing newspapers carried a large advertisement for Qingyutang: "Preferential treatment for families of soldiers fighting the war, free medical consultations and medicine, without charging a cent, until the victory of the war." Even today, "Qingyutang" still provides free medical consultations and medicine, and patients can even specify the Chinese medicine doctor they trust to provide free consultations for them. On October 7, 1945, the Chongqing City

families of soldiers fighting the war held a ceremony at the Xin Yun Hui auditorium to present banners to General Chairman Jiang and others. Zhou Jingxiu, a representative of the families, specially presented Zheng Hongfu with a single banner because he "enjoys doing good deeds and has benefited the families of soldiers greatly." And "Vice Minister Dechun of the Ministry of Military Service specifically pointed out that Mr. Zheng Hongfu, manager of Zhejiang Qingyutang, has donated over ten million in medical expenses to the families of soldiers over the past eight years, which is admirable and respectable" (as recorded in the Xinshu Daily on October 7, 1945).

There was a period when he directly managed ten units of his own factories (including oil refineries, cigarette factories) and shops. And he was responsible for the management of no less than twenty or thirty. This

honest and simple businessman who started from scratch has a noble ideal: "Take from society, use for society." He believes that if one factory he runs can secure the livelihoods of five hundred employees, then ten factories would support five thousand? These five thousand could at least sustain over ten thousand family members. If every constituent of society could participate in productive enterprises, the city would be more prosperous and society would be more stable.

He has over a hundred letters of appointment, and the reporter carefully read each one. It can be said that

all are voluntary with no power. For example: finance committee member of the Raising People and Returning Home Assistance Association, director of the Chongqing branch of the World Red Swastika Society, director of the Chongqing branch of the Chinese Lijiiao General Association. He even worries about the affairs of the dead and is also the chairman of the committee for relocating deceased fellow villagers. The reporter frankly said to Zheng Hongfu:

"Instead of helping one person, it is better to provide relief funds to help the majority; instead of scattered charitable undertakings, it is better to concentrate efforts on opening schools and developing culture."

He nodded and replied, "I am planning towards this step. I have now opened a Kaihua Free Primary School in Nan'an,

which does not charge a penny and already has over three hundred students attending. In addition, I have recently donated ten million yuan to the city's relief agency to raise funds to take in street refugees."

If people from the "Lower River" area have any difficulties in Chongqing, they can look to Zheng Hongfu for solutions. Currently, he is the chairman of the Zhejiang Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing and also the chairman of the Shaoxing Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing. The Shaoxing people, who are thousands of miles away, may not have thought that this young fellow villager has indeed done something for the "Lower River" people. (Special correspondent Ouyang Zui)

[This newspaper's Fuzhou 8th dispatch] The financial staff of Changle County, Fujian, published a large advertisement in the Central Daily News in this city to bid farewell to the former financial chief, Qiu Hanping. The provincial government believes that in the midst of rectifying discipline, this act is close to flattery, and specially sent a telegram to reprimand it, and also instructed all counties and cities to prohibit it. In the future, if similar situations occur again, severe punishments will be imposed. Also: The custom of welcoming and sending off officials is very prevalent here. When a district chief takes office, some people even rent special cars to parade and celebrate with firecrackers, which is suspected of excessive flattery and is often strictly prohibited.

### Soong Tzu-wen in Guangdong, Shouldering 35 Million Citizens

[This newspaper's Guangzhou 4th dispatch] The golden wind of the South China Sea comes late, a wave of heat in the City of Five Goats, directly into people's hearts.

Chairman Soong took office. At exactly ten o'clock on the morning of the 3rd, amidst a solemn military music in the grand Zhongshan Memorial Hall, Chairman Soong received this "big golden seal" from General Lo Cho-ying. In his speech, the previous Chairman Luo, who "came in brightness and left in brightness," said earnestly: "Today's handover ceremony is not just a handover of seals and official documents, but also a sincere handover of the province's more than 50,000 civil servants to the new person, not just the handover of more than 50,000 civil servants who serve faithfully, but more importantly, the handover of 35 million brothers and sisters to the new person." What will happen? This political figure, who has been away from his hometown for twenty years, with half of his hair gray, read a short speech in Shanghai dialect, illuminated by the lights in the auditorium. He promised two concerns: One is "I hope that in the near future, the people of Guangdong will be able to live and work in peace and contentment," and the other is "There will be no major changes in the provincial government personnel, and I hope all colleagues will work with peace of mind." The short twelve-minute report seemed to have revealed half of the mystery and stabilized half of the people's hearts, especially the "brothers, brothers" sandwiched in the smile, which made people feel a bit "unusual."

Chairman Soong has plans, has prestige, and has money. What is on Chairman Soong's mind is also the "economic crisis in Guangdong," "four beauties, two difficulties," the 35 million people in Guangdong should have a chance to breathe a sigh of relief. Autumn is deep, everyone is thinking: Will there be a spring in autumn? (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)

### Supervisor's Report Full Text (Continued)

E. Recently, foreign merchants have been promoting that our government's trade policy discriminates against and oppresses them, but after investigating the facts, the opposite is true. Taking the quota allocation of five items such as automobiles, kerosene, tobacco, sugar, and movies as an example: Last winter, the automobile quota allocation for the largest number of imports was 45 automobile merchants, with a total import of 1,251 vehicles, totaling US$1,806,924.00. The American Ford Motor Company accounted for 382 vehicles, worth US$500,984.00; the American Lianhan Automobile Company accounted for 150 vehicles, worth US$195,934.00; the Madi Automobile Company accounted for 88 vehicles, worth US$133,827.00. These three companies accounted for half of the total amount. In total, the automobiles allocated to other foreign merchants accounted for more than two-thirds of the total quota. Taking the kerosene quota allocation as an example: Last winter, 22 merchants were allocated a total of 232,038,614 liters of oil, totaling US$6,907,901.00. Asia Petroleum Company accounted for 48,307,250 liters, worth US$2,387,682.00; Mobil Petroleum Company accounted for 41,544,160 liters, worth US$2,033,540.00; Texaco Petroleum Company accounted for 23,561,257 liters, worth US$1,003,662.00. These three companies accounted for more than 90% of the total amount. Taking the movie quota allocation as an example: Last winter, the total import of movies was 808,899 meters, totaling US$96,056.00. All of them belong to foreign merchants. The situation of the remaining two items, tobacco and sugar, is also the same (see Attachment 18). In addition, the import of other quota and non-quota commodities is based on certain standards and clearly stipulated. The facts are obvious. Chinese and foreign merchants are treated equally, and there will be no discrimination (see Attachment 19 for details).

F. Since November 17 last year, although all imported goods have been subject to prior review and import permits, which are the responsibility of the Provisional Import Management Committee, the Executive Yuan can directly issue import permits for certain items, notifying the Provisional Import Management Committee to issue import licenses. Some of the specially approved imports are necessary for national defense and special measures must be taken, but looking at the list of items from November 17 of this year to the end of May of this year (see Attachment 20), most of them are no different from general imported items, and there are various conflicts with laws and regulations in the specially approved automobile import item, which not only damages the government's legislative and law enforcement credibility, but also opens up opportunities for individuals to seek extra benefits. In the future, the Executive Yuan should be more cautious about the approval of specially approved imports.

G. In the past, the highest economic decision-making body of our government often included people who operated industrial and commercial enterprises, or participated in economic decision-making bodies, but took advantage of their special convenience to operate industrial and commercial enterprises. As a result, they cleverly seized and plundered, forming huge wealth. Therefore, domestic people regard them as bureaucratic capital, and others regard them as wealthy capital. Public opinion throughout the country believes that they should be cracked down on and eradicated. Recently, the government authorities have repeatedly issued orders to prohibit officials from engaging in commerce. The members of the recently established Economic Committee still inevitably include a few people who directly operate industrial and commercial enterprises. These people can provide certain conveniences to the committee in terms of the technical implementation of affairs, but in terms of the confidentiality of their decision-making, it is a great obstacle. For example, recently, the committee decided to change the official foreign exchange rate policy. It is widely rumored in Shanghai that some people have purchased US dollar short-term treasury bills in advance to obtain huge profits due to the convenience of news. Although there is no solid evidence, public opinion is formidable and is related to the government's credibility. It seems that it is necessary to carefully select the members of the committee again.

H. The capital of Fuzhong Company is entirely composed of investments from the Bank of Communications, Jincheng Bank, and China Guohuo Bank. Not only is its business nature not for production and construction matters, but it also has the suspicion of using the name of its New York branch to evade taxes and hide profits, as mentioned earlier. Furthermore, Article 18 of the Bank of Communications' charter stipulates: "In addition to the various businesses listed in Article 17, the Bank of Communications shall not engage in the following items and other businesses." Item 4 stipulates that it shall not "directly engage in various industrial and commercial professions" (see Attachment 21). Also, Article 11 of the "Financial Management of Banks" amended and approved by the Executive Yuan at the 736th meeting in March 1946 stipulates: "Banks shall not be shareholders of shops or other banks or companies, but this shall not apply to investments in production and construction projects approved by the Ministry of Finance." Article 12 stipulates: "Banks shall not directly engage in industrial and commercial businesses..." The joint organization of Fuzhong Company by the Bank of Communications, Jincheng Bank, and China Guohuo Bank is a clear violation of the above two laws and regulations. Now the business situation of Fuzhong Company is not for production purposes, but purely for import and export trade, which only gives Chinese and foreign people a bad impression. It is necessary to deal with the company in accordance with the law, and the Ministry of Finance should separately discuss the violations of the Bank of Communications, Jincheng Bank, and China Guohuo Bank.

I. Song Ziliang, the general manager of Fuzhong Company, Shen Henian, the associate manager, and Song Zi'an, the general manager of China Construction Bank, all went abroad as government officials at the time, each with a special diplomatic passport. Now, their original employing agencies have separately verified that they no longer have official status (see Attachment 17), but they still have diplomatic passports and continue to reside abroad. At the same time, they hold positions as general managers or deputy general managers of major companies. Whether they are engaged in commercial activities in the United States, as reported by foreign newspapers, the fact that they are current businessmen holding diplomatic passports and staying abroad will inevitably lead to criticism and accusations of taking advantage of special privileges. The above-mentioned diplomatic passports should be revoked to avoid criticism. In the future, the government authorities should be cautious about issuing diplomatic and official passports, and should separately investigate those who currently hold diplomatic and official passports but have not returned to the country to see if there are similar situations and deal with them in accordance with the law to maintain international reputation.

J. Since the implementation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan on February 17 of this year, the government has strictly restricted imported goods, whether they are settled in foreign exchange or not. On August 18, it further announced that all goods with self-provided foreign exchange would be temporarily suspended from issuing import licenses. However, according to Shanghai newspapers, the goods that Chinese and foreign merchants have already transported to Shanghai but have not been approved for import amount to more than US$100 million (according to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance, worth US$40 million). These goods include newspapers, lead sheets, unnamed machines, fertilizers, medicines, automobiles, and other materials. The import of these materials was not approved by the government in advance. After arriving in Shanghai, they were either placed in customs warehouses or scattered on the docks. According to the on-site inspection by the committee members, there are no less than 500 to 600 cars of various colors scattered in the Gonghexin Dock and other places. According to customs regulations, if an import license cannot be obtained within half a month, a fine will be imposed. After two months, it will be confiscated. If this situation is not properly handled for a long time, it will either be damaged or flow into smuggling. This is a loss to both individuals and the government. The authorities should decide on a proper handling method as soon as possible to avoid corruption. The above report is respectfully submitted to President Yu, Supervisors He Hanwen, Wang Guanwu, Du Guangxun, and Gu Fengxiang, Auditor Wan Rongbin of the Audit Department, and Assistant Auditor Chen Huayuan, October 1. (Note: The attachments mentioned in this report are all omitted.) End of full text.

When interviewed by reporters at the North Station, Lin expressed his opinion on President Hu of Peking University's ten-year education plan, saying: "University education should seek balanced development. Young people everywhere have the right to demand that the government build their local universities into excellent educational institutions. The government should do its best to support universities with a short history and poor equipment, so that they can catch up with universities with a long history and good equipment, and then seek the overall development of each school." Lin believes that if this goal is to be achieved, the fundamental solution is to increase education funding. He strongly agrees with Hu's no-study-abroad plan, using a large amount of foreign exchange to hire scholars from various countries to teach in China, which can still achieve "academic independence." Lin did not say: In the future, Chung Cheng University will decide to improve the quality of students, and the number of students per year will not exceed 1,500.

### Officials from the Stabilization Fund Express Determination to Eliminate the Black Market for Foreign Exchange

Negotiations to Ban Private Radio Stations in Hong Kong and Shanghai Have Been Conducted

[Our Newspaper] Officials from the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee stated: The sharp rise in the foreign exchange black market in recent days is largely due to psychological factors and not necessarily due to supply and demand. The market price of the Stabilization Fund is based on rational decisions made according to the income and expenditure of the national treasury and market conditions. The current black market exchange rate has entered a state of frenzy, so the market price will not blindly follow the black market. The recent tightening of the war situation in Northeast China and the rumors of opening up foreign exchange ownership are all important factors stimulating the exchange market. This committee hopes to obtain the assistance of all relevant parties and that the media will not make inflammatory reports in order to stabilize the exchange market. Regarding the unauthorized import of goods, someone believes that allowing imports will force everyone to sell at the black market price for foreign exchange, which will not help stabilize domestic prices.

Another Dispatch: According to officials from the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee, the undercurrent of the foreign exchange black market does hinder the export of exportable goods. This committee is responsible for the supply and demand of foreign exchange and cannot ignore it, and is trying to eliminate it. It is now approaching the stage of a "white-knuckle fight" and will give speculators a fatal blow. The current adjustment of the exchange rate will not follow the black market, but will still aim to promote exports. The rise and fall of the exchange rate will still be determined by factual needs. Varying the exchange rate is only one of the methods to promote exports. There are various other plans to cooperate in order to ensure that legitimate exporters have a way out and to increase the source of foreign exchange. The official also emphasized that there is absolute certainty in eliminating the black market, but the government must approve its plan and grant it special privileges. Furthermore, Hong Kong is the root of the foreign exchange black market, and speculators have secret radio stations to communicate news. Our government has negotiated appropriate measures with the Hong Kong government, which can be implemented immediately.

[Another Dispatch] A certain authoritative economist stated: According to the current foreign exchange black market price and the current number of government issues, the government only needs to use a portion of its existing foreign exchange reserves to recover all government issues. The government's property of the China Textile Company, the property of the enemy and puppets, and surplus materials, worth approximately tens of thousands of US dollars, are not included in this calculation. It is hoped that the government will take this opportunity to severely crack down on these unreasonable black market speculators. It is heard that black market activities are still centered on a group of commercial firms that use private radio stations in Hong Kong and Shanghai to communicate news and conduct mutual transactions. Financial authorities should strengthen inspections and impose severe penalties in order to serve as a warning to others. It is hoped that military and police agencies will strictly ban the private radio stations established by speculators so that black market activities can be completely eradicated.

Hesitation in Buying Newly Issued Chinese Stocks; Most Weaken at Closing

The Chinese stock market was erratic yesterday. Hong Kong and Shanghai Telecom continued to contract. Insiders took profits, and the market recovered after weakening. Loan news circulated again, and Yongsha returned sharply from its high, ending at a low. The weakness of small stocks and miscellaneous stocks became more and more apparent, and many were sold short. This is because the reduction of margin requirements has been hit, and except for Yongsha, they have all been eliminated.

Morning

The market opened slightly lower due to reports that the Ministry of Finance indicated it would be difficult to reduce the margin requirements for deferred transactions. After opening, Yongsha rose from 302.5 yuan to 315 yuan in deferred trading. No. 116 and others sold, retreating to 297 yuan and 311 yuan. No. 237 and others bought in deferred trading, and No. 163 and others bought for immediate delivery, rising back to 304 yuan and 319 yuan. Nos. 157 and 218 came to sell current and deferred Yongsha, and No. 226 and others also sold. The off-market interest rate opened low at 2.4 and 2.85 jiao, but because of the burden of four days, it was forced down to 296 yuan for immediate delivery and 313 yuan for deferred delivery. Later, No. 223 sold Yongsha and bought Xinhua, and No. 172 supplied current Yongsha, leading to an unstable situation. Nos. 89 and others bought current Yongsha, and No. 36 and others bought deferred Yongsha, and around noon they were pulled up again. No. 156 strongly bought current Yongsha, so the immediate delivery closed at a high price of 305 yuan, and deferred delivery reached 320 yuan, and then ended at 319 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsha, Zhongs, Huochai, and Rongfeng showed small gains in the immediate delivery stocks, Zhongxing and Lian rose by 0.5%, Neiyi, Shuini, Zhabei, Huaxin, and HengHu were all flat, and Xinguang, Jingfu, Zhongfa, Xinhua, and Zhongfang fell by 0.5%, and the rest all fell slightly. In the deferred delivery stocks, Jingfu fell by 0.5%, Yongsha rose slightly, and all others declined slightly.

Afternoon Market

News of American loans of 1 billion came overnight, causing deferred delivery to open lower. Current delivery opened higher because of small margin calls. No. 24 bought, but many parties began to close out, and immediate delivery of Yongsha fell from 310 yuan, and deferred delivery fell from 316 yuan, with Nos. 89 and others selling heavily. Although Nos. 24 and 23 bought, they were still forced down to 298 yuan and 307.5 yuan. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Telecom report was low at 6.6 yuan, and the national bank's exchange rate showed a difference. Nos. 171 and 232 bought and rose slightly, but in the end, Nos. 65 and others still sold deferred delivery, and Nos. 89 and others heavily sold current Yongsha. With confidence wavering, immediate delivery of Yongsha was forced down to 294 yuan, and deferred Yongsha reached 302 yuan before closing at 305 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Yongsha, Xinao, Maya, Huafeng, Zhongfa, Neiyi, Jinglun, Zhongs, Zhabei, and Hengfeng in the immediate delivery stocks declined slightly, Xinguang, Jingshi, Shangwu, and Rongfeng fell by 0.5%, Zhongfang and Tongyi rose slightly, Shuini, Xinhua, and Huochai were flat, and according to the regulations, Huafeng declined slightly, and all others fell by 0.5%. Among the off-market old stocks, Zhonghua rose slightly, while Dasheng fell by 0.5%, and the rest were flat.

Current Delivery

Arbitrage trading: Yesterday, the interest rate difference was approximately 0.18 to 0.2 jiao, and the situation was stable. Yongsha's low price was 14.4 yuan, the high price was 15.4 yuan, and it closed at 15 yuan. Maya ranged from 20 yuan to 23 yuan, and closed at 22 yuan. Xinao was between 7 yuan and 8 yuan, and Xinguang was around 1.5 yuan.

The Stock Exchange yesterday issued a notice stating: Broker No. 51, Zhuang Chongzhou, failed to pay overdue margin substitutes of US dollar bonds and was ordered by the Ministry to cancel his registration.

### Government Bonds Mediocre; Foreign Stocks Unstable

Government bonds were mediocre yesterday, with a trading volume of only 2 million. Room 552 advanced first and then retreated, while Rooms 551 and 503 advanced, but Room 230 retreated. Tongbing opened at 15,000 yuan and fell from 15,400 yuan to close at 14,400 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Tongbing was flat, Jiayi and Yi were down 100 yuan, and Dingwu was down 400 yuan each.

The foreign stock market saw gains and losses, and was particularly unstable. The Hong Kong-Shanghai Telecom report had narrowed to around 6.5 yuan, and confidence was mixed. Although the bank and foreign firms bought, the securities and Guangzhou firms sold. Yisha retreated from 168,000 yuan to close at 157,000 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Shipping fell by 10%, British United Paper fell by 0.5%, Xiangtai fell by a weak 10%, Jardine Matheson rose by 0.5%, and the remaining increases and declines were minor.

### Silk and Satin Negotiated Prices Unchanged; Cotton Yarn Stops Rising and Starts to Fall; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Retracts 500,000 Yuan

[Our Newspaper] The negotiated prices of cotton yarn at the silk and satin association remained unchanged yesterday. The 20-count yarn was still listed at 15.2 million yuan, while other counts were set proportionally, taking into account market conditions.

Yesterday's yarn market saw weak actual sales due to the fact that prices outside of Shanghai were not as high as in Shanghai, making it unprofitable for yarn merchants to transport and sell. There was not much activity in the market, and the market weakened. Eventually, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn retracted 500,000 yuan from the previous day to 30.5 million yuan. The 20-count Extra Double Mali was flat, while the Light Double Mali fell by 200,000 yuan. The 16-count Guangming was down 400,000 yuan. Except for the particularly good 40-count Blue Phoenix, all other counts of coarse and fine yarn fell by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan.

The Spinning and Weaving Construction Company Starts Selling Allotted Yarn to Other Provinces

The Spinning and Weaving Construction Company started selling allotted yarn to factories in other provinces yesterday. The types of yarn sold were 10-count, 20-count, and 32-count. The price for 10-count was 10.59 million, 20-count was 15.2 million, and 32-count was 18.5 million, plus a flood relief donation of 250,000 per piece.

Today, collect warehouse receipts from the Bank of China by paying with the purchase order.

Short Sellers are More; Cloth Market is Weak

Yesterday, in the midst of the government's efforts to suppress prices, everyone was wary and unwilling to buy. In addition, with the imminent opening of the silver future exchange, the funds were tight, and there were more short sellers than buyers in the market, which weakened the market and lowered prices. Throughout the day, except for popular bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and blue cloth, which continued to rise by 10,000 to 70,000, other types of clothing fabrics were generally stable, with most retracting 5,000 to 25,000 yuan.

Cotton Weathers Turning Soft as People Await A Reversal

Yesterdays Raw cotton prices were affected by soft yarn and cotton sales which caused a reversal in investor's enthusiasm. Though this has lead up to peaks over the past few days, cotton mills have remained unaffected, and the soft cotton shift is caused by a reluctance among merchants to sell cheaply. Only 1,100 bales traded. There was no opening price from factories, but the price offered for delivery was Lingbao at 4.2 million, 4.25 million, and 4.28 million; Metring at 4.65 million; Hanxi at 3.75 million, 3.8 million, and 3.85 million; Han Crude at a market price of 2.7 million and 2.74 million; Yuyao flower at 2.72 million and Zhoupu seed flower at 620,000.

### CITC Begins Processing Food Oil Order Loans

In order to help the government control materials and stabilize prices, CITC, in addition to purchasing food oil raw materials such as soybeans and rapeseed and entrusting oil factories to process them on its behalf, has also allocated 45.5 billion yuan from the National Bank to process food oil order loans. It is understood that: The Bureau has been approved to process the first batch of 10,000 dans of soybean oil, 10,000 dans of rapeseed oil, and 10,000 dans of sesame oil. The Bureau is currently signing two contracts: one to entrust the purchase of raw materials and one to entrust the processing of oil by the oil industry association.

### President Zhang Convenes National and Private Factory Owners to Discuss Current Yarn and Cloth Countermeasures; Changes to Textile Adjustment Pricing Await Consultation and Decision

[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon at six o'clock, President Zhang of the National Bank convened representatives from national and private yarn factories, including Wu Weijing and Liu Jingji, to discuss current yarn and cloth countermeasures, focusing on three points: The distribution of yarn and cloth should be directed to actual users, avoiding excessive profits for intermediaries. The price of cotton yarn set by the Textile Adjustment Committee should adopt a flexible approach. In reality, the negotiated price differs significantly from the cost. How to change the pricing strategy awaits a decision after consultation between President Zhang and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. For factories that have already obtained import licenses, strict sanctions should be imposed for cotton ordered from abroad where the procedures are not compliant.

### Sugar Negotiated Price Increased, Averaging a Little Less Than Thirty Percent Higher Than Before

[Our Report] The Shanghai Municipal Price Evaluation Committee's sugar subgroup held its fourteenth evaluation meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday morning at ten o'clock, chaired by Gu Bingyuan, the director of the Economic Administration Department of the Bureau of Social Affairs. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation (TSC) proposed that due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, the cost of importing machinery and fertilizer has increased, leading to a corresponding increase in TSC's costs. The current market price in the production area is more than double the allocated price in this city, and the allocated price is too low, resulting in excessive losses for the national treasury, while intermediaries are given the opportunity for excessive profits. Therefore, they requested a reasonable adjustment to the allocated price of TSC sugar.

After evaluation, it was decided that the allocation price of TSC sugar will be adjusted starting from the 36th period, averaging a little less than thirty percent higher than before. In addition, it was also decided that sales would resume every Thursday, starting from the 36th period. The adjusted allocation prices are listed below: (Unit: Municipal Dan)

[Name] [Allocation Price] [Wholesale Price]

Special Grade Refined White Sugar 8.5 Million 10.32 Million Yuan

Grade 1 Refined White Sugar 8.2 Million 9.98 Million Yuan

Grade 2 Refined White Sugar 7.9 Million 9.63 Million Yuan

Special Grade Granulated White Sugar 8.3 Million 10.09 Million Yuan

Grade 1 Granulated White Sugar 8 Million 9.74 Million Yuan

Grade 2 Granulated White Sugar 7.7 Million 9.74 Million Yuan

Grade 3 Granulated White Sugar 7.3 Million 8.93 Million Yuan

Red Sugar 7.4 Million 9.05 Million Yuan

Rock Sugar 12 Million 14.38 Million Yuan

### An Old Father Seeks His Son with Tears

Guo Hong, my son: It has been a full two years since you left without saying goodbye. Your father still doesn't understand. You, who have always harbored great ambitions, are willing to remain unknown like this. Please think calmly. Isn't a 27-year-old youth like the rising sun, waiting to do something earth-shattering in this dark society? However, you have erased everything – your responsibilities, your mission, and the kindness of your parents who have nurtured you for more than twenty years. This is simply inconceivable. In the past two years, your father has grown old. However, my desire for you to return is still as strong as it was two years ago. Can you bear to have your parents longing and waiting year after year? Come back, Hong'er, let's start anew and rebuild our old home, and become a new person. Father Xingnan Baibai.

### On the History of Chinese Social Economy

— Huang Xianglong

By Yu Jingyi, published by Dongxi Wenhua She

According to the publication date, this book can be considered a new book. It was first published in October of the 34th year after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan. According to the author's preface, his planned work on the history of the development of Chinese and Western social economies is divided into four volumes: the first volume is a new theory of world history, the second volume is a theory of the history of Chinese agricultural society (i.e., the history of Chinese social economy), the third volume is a theory of the history of Western commercial society, and the fourth volume is a theory of the history of dual-system culture in various countries around the world. As of the time I am writing this manuscript, Mr. Yu's third and fourth volumes have not yet been published; therefore, I have only read the first volume, "New Theory of World History," and the second volume, "History of Chinese Agricultural Society."

Normally, the first volume should be introduced first, but I am not prepared to discuss the new theory of history at this time. As for the second volume, it is not as much a part of the pure historical philosophy category as the first volume, and Mr. Yu also pointed out Guo Moruo, Li Ji, Tao Xisheng, Wei Juxian, Moriya Katsumi, Shi Fuliang, and others as objects of criticism in order to establish his own theory. Therefore, considering this book as a complete history of Chinese social economy, it does have its completeness and authenticity; I will first introduce it here.

The book is divided into five chapters: the first chapter is an introduction to prehistory, the second chapter is a critique of the theory of slave society in the Three Dynasties, the third chapter is on the feudal society of the Three Dynasties, the fourth chapter is on the nature of society from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Qing dynasty, and the fifth chapter is on the nature of society in the past hundred years. The division of chapters is also a periodization. Mr. Yu means that prehistory is one period, belonging to the era of primitive groups and ethnic societies; Xia, Shang, and Zhou is the era of feudal society; Qin, Han to Qing is the era of semi-feudal society; and the last hundred years is the era of semi-colonial society. As for the criteria for his division, in addition to Mr. Yu using the method of "destroying before building" to criticize Guo Moruo and others, there is his theory of agricultural cultural system. Although we dare not admit whether this dualism of historical development has complete validity, it is certainly valuable to use the agricultural cultural system to explain the history of Chinese social economy and to use the changes in the land system to divide the stages of Chinese society.

The primitive groups and ethnic societies of prehistory are generally not much of a problem. Since the Three Dynasties are the starting point of Chinese history, scholars of the valley school have also paid attention to them and have various different theories. First of all, because the social nature of the Three Dynasties is very difficult to analyze, they all admit that the Three Dynasties went through a stage of slave society. Mr. Yu first criticized Li Ji's "Theory of the History of Chinese Society," Wei Juxian's "Research on Ancient History," and Guo Moruo's "Research on Ancient Chinese Society" as the main objects of criticism. He inferred the mistakes of various schools, and from the distinction between slaves and slave society, the misunderstanding of serfs as slaves, and the quotations from Engels, Moriya Katsumi, and others, he judged that there was never a slave society in Chinese history. Mr. Yu's argument is that the Three Dynasties were a feudal society.

As for the nature of society from Qin and Han to Qing, there are Guo Moruo's initial advocacy of feudal society, Li Li's theory of capitalist production methods, and Moriya Katsumi's theory of one and a half stages of Chinese history, etc. The former generally commits errors such as regarding land ownership as state-owned, the parallel development of feudalism and commerce, and recognizing the native Chinese manor system as feudal. The latter, on the one hand, dissects Marx's "Asian method of production" and "pre-capitalist method of production," and on the other hand, fails to grasp the center of gravity of China, and develops into the theory of "immature feudal society." Mr. Yu believes that they either followed other people's models or completely entered the "four-stage formula," or they failed to grasp Chinese history, the "opposition between the feudal system and the prefecture-county system, the parallel existence of the aristocratic system and the bureaucratic system, the simultaneous existence of centralization and local decentralization, and the simultaneous development of the equal mountain system and the private property system" since the Qin and Han dynasties.

As for the nature of society in the past hundred years, there are Tao Xi's and Deng Chumin's semi-feudal theory, and Guo Moruo's, Li Ji's, and Shi Fuliang's theory of capitalist society. In fact, the former only looks at the feudal remnants of the past hundred years, and the latter seems to use the partial commercial cities to represent the entire society. Here, Mr. Yu quotes Mr. Xuan's article on the trends and characteristics of the changes in Chinese social economy after the Opium War, believing that the current stage of our country's social economy is played out by being attacked from both internal collapse and external corrosion. The trends are: from a closed-door economy to a passively open world economy, from a local economy to a national economy centered on cities, from a rural economy to a market economy with trade between China and foreign countries, from an old-style production economy to an industrial revolution economy, from a landlord group economy to a capital economy, and from a simple commodity economy to a monetary center economy. The characteristics are: transitionality, complexity, passivity, uneven development, semi-coloniality, comprador group, and social waste. From the above trends and characteristics, Mr. Yu believes that the current stage of social economy in our country includes four important contents: the invasion of the feudal social economy of agriculture by the capitalistic nourishment of commerce and industry will inevitably promote the collapse of feudal social economy and the growth of capitalism; the invasion of the inherent agricultural cultural culture by the external commercial culture will inevitably cause a complex change in the entire cultural system; the competition among the powers will make it difficult for the Chinese economy and society to advance even if it wants to become capitalist; and in the development process of all new capitalist economic constructions, it is bound to be affected by the competition and monopoly among the powers. These four contents are used by Mr. Yu to explain that China in the past hundred years is a semi-colonial society, especially the fourth point shows that China's new capitalist economy, which is growing up, is completely controlled by the powers of imperialism, which fully expresses the "semi-colonial" nature of China's national economy in the past hundred years. From recognizing that the past hundred years is a semi-colonial country, Mr. Yu pointed out that China must first remove all the shackles of the "semi-colonial" before embarking on national socialism in the future.

Although this book has its completeness and correctness, it can be regarded as a history of social economy, but it is obviously not enough for the adoption of historical materials. However, from the perspective of a constructive and authentic history of social economy, this book can be used as a wedge for a warning. I introduce this book, and I hope that scholars in China who have accumulated knowledge and deep thinking can write a comprehensive and in-depth history of Chinese social economy, because this kind of book is very much needed now, and it is still lacking.

### A Brief Discussion on Bibliography

— Xiao Lu

Bibliography covers a wide range and is complicated, making it difficult to study. What is a bibliography? The preface to the "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han says: "Whenever I finished reading, I would always list its chapters, extract its meaning, record and report it." From this, we can see that the so-called bibliography is just a list of chapters; in addition to recording the chapters, there is also a preface. Ordinary people think that a bibliography is the name of a book, but this is not the case. A bibliography is not just the name of a book; even an article has its own bibliography, and it must be categorized according to its nature, such as the nature of paintings, the nature of personal names, etc. This kind of compiling a bibliography has long existed in China. For example:

1. Bibliography: Liu Xin's "Seven Summaries" (main), Tu Mu's Ban Gu's "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han (secondary)
2. Calligraphy Bibliography: Book of Sui (involving art)
3. Metal and Stone Inscription Bibliography: Song Zhi (referring to engraving)
4. Author Bibliography: New Book of Tang (i.e., today's personal name card)

To study Chinese bibliography, we must first observe the motivation for compiling the bibliography. There are two motivations for compiling Chinese bibliography: one is historical; the other is practical. The historical bibliography takes academic thought as its object; the bibliographical materials obtained through textual research and investigation are provided for scholars to study or refer to. The practical bibliography is like a commercial inventory or sorting account book, which is convenient for management and inspection; so its function takes management as its object. Researchers should regard the former as important.

Regarding the beginning of Chinese bibliography, historically speaking, it began with Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty's policy of collecting books. The earliest special works to appear should be Liu Xiang's "Bie Lu" for inventorying and Liu Xin's "Seven Summaries" for sorting. These two kinds of bibliographical books are quite similar to modern library catalogs. Ban Gu took Liu Xiang's "Bie Lu" and Liu Huan's "Seven Summaries" and compiled the "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han, which is a historical document of books. He took the self-recording of books as his object, and narrated the deeds of his predecessors, which belonged to the historical category. Since Ban Gu's "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han, there have been no similar books as good as the "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Han Dynasty; it can be seen that compiling a bibliography is extremely difficult. Here, we already know that Ban Gu's "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han was compiled from the "Bie Lu" and "Seven Summaries," so these three books actually have a consistent system, and researchers should start from this point.

What is the purpose of bibliography? Let's cite a few monographs to illustrate, and we can also see how bibliographers compile bibliographies:

1. Ban Gu took the purpose of bibliography as "distinguishing the origin of academic knowledge" (see the preface to the "Yi Wen Zhi" of the Book of Han).
2. Ruan Xiaoxu (Shen Chao) wrote "Seven Records," he believed that the purpose of the bibliography is: In terms of quality: Distinguishing the origin of academic research, Clarifying the purpose of writing. In terms of quantity: The differences between names and volumes, Supplementing the omissions in the existing bibliography (refer to the preface to the "Seven Records").
3. Changsun Wuji's "Jing Ji Zhi" of the Book of Sui followed Ruan's regulations, Deleted names and prefaces, Deleted things that did not conform to the ideas of the time or were mixed up, and also removed things that were too cornered to the purpose of the book.
4. Xu Xinshan's "Seven Forests" mostly followed Ruan Xiaoxu's method to compile.
5. Shi Zhisheng's "Shi Jiao Xu Lu" made a great contribution to Chinese bibliography. He believed that the purpose of compiling a bibliography is: Distinguishing truth from falsehood, Clarifying right from wrong, Recording the past and present generations, Marking the number of volumes and parts, Collecting omissions, Deleting the duplicates.

Some people think that bibliography has become a thing of the past and does not need to be studied. This is wrong, because bibliography is the general summary of various academic knowledge; it has its own research value. From the statements of bibliographers quoted above, bibliography is also an introduction to reading. Wang Mingsheng said well in "Seventeen History Shang Que": "The study of bibliography is the most important thing in learning. You must start from this to enter the door," which proves the importance of bibliography.

### Rate the True

— From Zhou

By Feng Zikai, published by Wanye Bookstore

"Rate the True" is a collection of essays published last year by Mr. Zikai. Before this, Mr. Feng had two collections of essays, namely "Essays from the Yuanyuan Hall" and "More Essays from the Yuanyuan Hall," both published by Kaiming Bookstore. They were popular throughout the country. Mr. Feng's articles are filled with a leisurely and innocent atmosphere. I am one of those who has been deeply influenced. Because of Mr. Feng's articles, I further came to know Hongyi the Monk, and then further read art and literature. To this day, I still make a living in this circle, so I must say that I have been somewhat influenced. Everyone knows that Mr. Feng is an artist. However, this is because they have seen his overflowing green paintings. His writing is successfully integrated with religion, art, philosophy, education, etc. This is fully revealed in his dealings with people and his scholarship. Therefore, his articles are light, elegant, and profound, and can move people. This is the reason.

"Rate the True" is divided into two parts. According to Mr. Feng's own preface, ten of the articles were written during the War of Resistance, and nine were selected from the twenty essays previously published by Tianma Bookstore. Therefore, this collection can be said to be the essence of Mr. Feng's essays. Recently, I saw it in the library. It had been a long time since I had seen Mr. Feng's writing! So I spent half a night reading it by lamplight. After closing the book, I lingered in my thoughts, feeling that this book could serve as a guide for young people's self-cultivation, and I had to introduce it. The "Speaking of Hongyi the Monk for Young People" and "Mourning the Beggar Teacher" in the first volume are both worth reading for teachers and students alike in today's world where the Way of the Teacher is lost. I long for the music of stringed instruments in our time and sigh at the so-called "respect for teachers." "Leaving the Yuanyuan Hall" is undoubtedly a portrayal of the chaos and separation during the War of Resistance. What is difficult for people to say is fully expressed in writing. I love his description of the four seasons of the Yuanyuan Hall. "The Geese of the Shaping Cottage" shows that human feelings can extend to animals. The middle volume is mostly about art, so I will not introduce it further. I believe that a person who studies art and literature can be free from loneliness and decadence if they can embrace Mr. Feng's attitude towards learning, understanding, and applying. As the ancients said, "Observing all things quietly, one will naturally gain insights; the beautiful scenery of the four seasons is shared by all." Then, one will be happy at all times. Most of the articles in the last volume have been published before, talking about life and children. I hope that people who do not love children, people who study children's education, or middle-aged people with many feelings may wish to take a look, so that they may sympathize with the "heart of a child."

Some people say that Mr. Feng's writing is "the writing of an artist." It is true that Mr. Feng has achieved truth, goodness, and beauty. However, this seems to be only one aspect. If we read his articles carefully, we can say that he has melted art, old and new literature, philosophy, religion, and education into one furnace. In today's new literary world, this cannot be said to be anything other than a success.

### The Miser Grandet

— Ruofei

A Typical Character Created by Balzac

"Eugénie Grandet" is a masterpiece in Balzac's "Human Comedy" that focuses on depicting life in the French provinces. After reading it, Gao Ercha repeatedly mentioned it in his autobiography. In this novel, Balzac writes about the conflict between reason and greed, the distance between father and daughter, and the most vivid description is of Mr. Grandet's hoarding of money. The author treats Mr. Grandet as a typical miser. He writes about how Grandet treats his bankrupt nephew; how he is furious when his daughter secretly gives her cousin money; his wife is frightened by his anger and falls ill, but his first thought is that his wife's inheritance will fall into his daughter's hands, so he is extremely worried; late at night, how he locks the door and counts money in the warehouse, not letting anyone know; touching a coin seems to cure his illness; in old age, he asks for gold louis to be displayed on the table when he is dying, and his eyes stare blankly at them, saying, "This warms me!" After his death, he leaves his only daughter with the words: "Pay attention to the gold!... Put the gold in front of me!"

There are only two protagonists in this novel: Mr. Grandet and his daughter Eugénie. And they happen to represent two kinds of human nature; the former sees money as life, sees nothing but money, and is very mean in his actions and treatment of others, often unconsciously, believing that hoarding money is the only important thing in life; the latter is initially a girl who always takes her father's will as her own, but since her cousin Charles entered the family, she "breaks through the clouds and sees the sun," and realizes that many of her father's actions are contrary to human nature and violate the deep feelings between father and children. So, in her subconscious, she has a deep hatred for her father's greed. If Mr. Grandet's humanity has been submerged by money, then his daughter Eugénie is only a weak contrast. She feels that she should save her cousin Charles, she must sympathize with the weak, and she must fight against her father under the arrangement of love, but after living a life under Grandet's constraints since birth, she is still not enough to resist her father's greed. When Grandet finds out that his daughter has secretly given money to her cousin, he flies into a rage, and the daughter silently and bravely walks into the confinement room. If it weren't for Charles's love supporting her, who knows if she would have suffered a serious illness like her mother?

Charles's father went bankrupt and ordered Charles to seek refuge with his uncle Grandet in advance, but Charles himself was unaware and thought he was taking a winter trip. Grandet must tell Charles the truth.

"Yes, poor child, guess what, he's dead. But that's not all, there's something even worse, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head..." Charles told his nephew.

"My father?"

"Okay." Grandet continued loudly: "That's not so important, my dear nephew, that's not all, you can comfort yourself, but..."

"Never, never, my father! My father!"

"He ruined you! You don't have a penny!"

"What's the use of money? Where's my father?" Charles asked.

Painful cries echoed in the room, Charles ran away—he lay on his bed, covering his face with the quilt.

"I should let this storm pass," Grandet thought to himself, walking into the hall, "However, this young man is useless, he cares more about the dead than money."

Balzac used brilliant descriptions to write about Mr. Grandet's view of his brother's death. Misers are the most short-sighted. There is no "future" in their eyes. The present is everything to them. The society of money worship, the society with a strong decadent color at the end of the century, is fully active in Balzac's pen.

Charles took 5,800 francs from Eugénie but gave her a gold box containing a photo, asking her to keep it for him, and the main meaning was probably as a symbol of love. This gold box was later discovered by Mr. Grandet, so he said that the box was enough to offset the francs that Eugénie had lent to Charles, and he took a small knife to dig out the gold pieces on the box. At this time, Eugénie appeared very brave, even at the cost of fighting to the death. Balzac wrote this scene very beautifully. He wrote that in Grandet's eyes, the gold box was dazzling gold, and in Eugénie's eyes, it was a sacred symbol of love. The struggle between "practicality" and "idealism" resulted in the former prevailing.

However, what about the ending? After Charles wandered to India, he made a fortune by selling slaves, and he gradually moved from "idealism" to the stage of valuing "practicality" like his uncles. After returning to Paris, he took a fancy to the daughter of a certain duke, hoping to inherit his father-in-law's title, and had long forgotten Eugénie's love. In order to retrieve the gold box, he wrote a letter to Eugénie and sent a draft for 8,000 francs, as a repayment of the loan, with interest. As for the gold box, he asked her to send it by public carriage.

"Sent by public carriage!" Eugénie said, "Something for which I almost lost my life a thousand times for him."

Eugénie later married Judge Peng Feng, bringing with her Mr. Grandet's 17 million inheritance.

Naturally, as a female millionaire, she is happy, surrounded by people at all times, listening to others' flattery; but as a woman with a conscience, how lonely is she inside! How bleak is her life! In the eyes of the people surrounding her, she is just an incarnation of glittering francs, who can truly understand Eugénie's gentle, loyal, and sincere heart.

Balzac sighed: Long live utilitarianism!

### The Romance of Sleeves

— Weizhuang

Civilized people wear clothes, and two sleeves are indispensable. Since the Yellow Emperor first created clothing, the history of sleeves for thousands of years has been quite long.

In this autumn of rampant human desires and crumbling discipline, how often have we heard of an official who, after serving his term, steps down with clean sleeves? On the contrary, it is difficult to guard against people shooting arrows in the dark from their sleeves! Gentlemen sigh and sigh! Sleeves, sleeves, it is truly difficult to say!

Reading Emperor Chen Hou's poem: "Turning around, the pendant rings, pulling the sleeve, the fragrance of clothing rises," we seem to feel a graceful and beautiful woman, with a fleeting glimpse, arousing reverie. And the Mongols, after eating butter tea, wipe their sleeves around their mouths, and over time, they become as shiny as a mirror. Those who disrespect and stay away from them are few.

The story of Emperor Ai of Han cutting off his sleeve is a private matter in the palace. The language is inelegant and can be omitted. Those who see righteousness but do not act bravely and stand by are too indifferent and somewhat numb. In today's world, unsightly things are everywhere, and unpleasant words can be heard everywhere, so you will want to fling your sleeves and rise up. Those in power use public office for private gain, those below take advantage of opportunities, and those with hundreds of thousands of dollars (US dollars) are beautifully called long-sleeved good dancers, making people's hair stand on end.

A suit costs three to four million, and the buttons on the cuffs are worth a hundred times their weight in gold. Their origins must be carefully examined and described in detail to show solemnity. Do not underestimate these small buttons, they are still the legacy of the militaristic ruler, Frederick the Great of Prussia. At that time, he paid the most attention to the discipline of soldiers, and their uniforms had to be very neat. However, when soldiers encountered sweat on their faces, they repeatedly raised their hands and used their sleeves as rags, desperately wiping their faces. Needless to say, the two sleeves became unusually dirty.

Frederick came up with a plan and ordered a row of buttons to be nailed onto the sleeves. After that, even if the soldiers wanted to do something, they would have to give up because their faces would be scratched. It is said that the sleeve buttons on suits were originally used to roll up the sleeves and tie them up to make it easier to work, but later they gradually lost their effectiveness and became useless decorations under the sleeves.

Even gentlemen cannot avoid using their sleeves to wipe sweat, which is also a way to deal with emergencies. More than ten years ago, on a hot day, Guo Fuchu (Taiqi) was working in Shanghai and attended a public gathering. He stood on a high platform and gave a speech. Because it was hot, he was sweating profusely and unbearably. He reached into his arms, but was disappointed. He had forgotten to bring a handkerchief, so he had to resort to a more primitive action and simply wiped the sleeves of his linen gown repeatedly. As a result, the two sleeves became wet and stuck together, and the hands hidden in the sleeves moved unnaturally, as if a novice actor had just made his debut and his water sleeve skills were not yet up to par, and he did not know what to do with his hands, looking very embarrassed. Because I was also on the stage at that time, I saw it very clearly, and the impression is still deep to this day.

Whether news reporters use shorthand symbols to record speeches on their cuffs is seen in books but not witnessed, so it remains to be verified. However, it is true that pearl merchants make deals at tea parties. After they have made eye contact, they do not exchange a word. Both hands reach into each other's sleeves and use clear signals to bargain. If the talks are successful, the tense faces of both parties will gradually soften, like the rising sun in winter, first showing a ray of sunlight, then becoming brighter and warmer, until it reaches its climax. Both parties flick their sleeves, almost laughing out loud. This indicates: "The deal is done!"

### Fruits of Xinjiang

— Ashui

Xinjiang's fruits, melons, apples, grapes, pears, and peaches are the best. Melon refers to cantaloupe. Hami melon is one of the cantaloupes. People in Dihua call it "sweet melon," not much as "Hami melon." This is a cantaloupe as big as a pillow, but it is sweeter, crisper, and contains more water than any good variety of cantaloupe in the South. This melon is produced in early summer and can be stored in cellars until the end of next spring; Xinjiang people often say that eating this melon in summer and autumn will cause internal heat, but eating it in winter, such as chilled or frozen, is truly "icing on the cake."

Apples are produced in large quantities, and the best are those produced in Ertay, Yili. They are large and crispy, and their color and taste are very similar to imported Gold Mountain apples, but more fragrant.

Grapes from Turpan are the best, seedless, small and sweet, and dried, they seem to be even better than those produced in the United States.

Pomegranates are very large, and each grain is like a ruby.

Pears from Kuqa and Korla are the best, although not very large, they are sweet, crisp, and contain a lot of water. Even the best pears in Tianjin are not as good.

In the mulberry planting areas of southern Xinjiang, mulberries are also large and delicious, with black and white varieties; however, this thing is easily broken and cannot be transported elsewhere. Local Uyghur people who are idle often fill their stomachs with mulberries when they are in season.

### Various Aspects of America

— Pulun

America is not only a special country, but also a changeable and difficult to understand country; but many people say that if you don't understand America, you can't understand the times, don't you think it's strange? There are many poems and articles that desperately praise America, but it is easily praised and easily ridiculed. Yes, America, full of contradictions, often hides spiritual simplicity behind complex technologies, and behind this simplicity, there is unexpected complexity.

It is generally not a problem that people think highly of American literature, but the works published in those illustrated magazines are a literary vacuum, so low-level and terrible that even the most casual readers in Europe will avoid them.

America is constantly making great efforts to improve their intellectual level. They have universities with extremely complete facilities, and the best libraries and laboratories are attached to them. There, it is common to see scientists being valued by the market. However, Tennesee University is strangely unbelievable, because this school does not allow lectures on evolution; the law there prohibits any theory that contradicts the Adam and Eve myth in the Bible.

In large cities in America, there are "Lion" clubs. Famous businessmen gather there, and each person wears a sign indicating his business nature and location. Before eating snacks, they stand up and imitate the "whoo-hoo-woo" sound of a lion's roar. This kind of game is still considered a pure thing. Along with wealthy merchants, there are also many pure dreamers and noble idealists; they believe in utopianism, they forget meals and devote all their money and energy to realizing the mysterious plan of a "world government."

Everyone knows that respect in America is centered around money. In thousands of registered churches and denominations - money; but America also has people who don't buy new shoes or watch movies, but save people from being convicted and dying in the electric chair. However, there are organizations everywhere to protect the rights of black people; good people in America are always opposed to barbaric persecution.

Americans are full of childishness, they don't like pretense, they are frank, curious, noisy, and active; when they are sitting in a house, they often like to stand up and change seats; they move from this city to that city, from this state to that state without hesitation. The character and style of Americans are exactly the opposite of the British. The British are polite and quiet; they like to live long and die in the house left by their grandfather; they like to have clothes made of first-class materials, and if they can't wear them until they die, they will at least wear them until the next election. Americans only like new clothes, wear them once and throw them away. They often buy shirts that are not worth washing; they value old shoes and like bright new ties.

Everything in America is new; but in the legal district of New England, the buildings built in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are preserved; this "ancient district" is a place that people yearn for.

In America, annoying events often overshadow people's sense of history; for ordinary Americans, almost an era has changed between the morning paper and the evening paper, because the things that trouble them in the morning, they often forget in the evening.

Someone said that if you want to understand America, you must always remember its age; this sentence is quite thought-provoking.

### Miss America

— Xu Shuyuan

Miss America on the Screen

Due to the development of the film industry and the worship of movie actors by the public, I dare say that there is no American girl who does not want to climb the silver throne and taste the taste of being a star, except for those who are too old and ugly or have dedicated themselves as nuns. Indeed, Hollywood is the only tempting place in the world, with the highest salaries, the most affluent life, the most luxurious villas, and the newest cars, who doesn't want to enjoy it? However, although there are many opportunities in Hollywood, it is not easy to gain a foothold in the silver circle. If you have a skill, even a dog can become a star. If you have no skill, even if you are trapped in Hollywood for a lifetime, you will not be able to enter. The bosses of film companies are people who have turned somersaults in the snobbish circle. When they need you, they will kneel at your door. When they don't need you, they will kick you away. Every year, tens of thousands of wealthy girls bring a large amount of American dollars to Hollywood to socialize, wanting to step into the door of a film company, but the result is failure and return. However, if you know the secret, you don't need to climb the silver queen's throne. First, you must use the stage, nightclubs, model companies, and newspapers as stepping stones. Many stage actors, nightclub singers, model company models, and cover girls of pictorials are invited to Hollywood by film company representatives, and they rise from the ground to the sky, leaping to become red stars. Film companies would rather hire successful drama artists at high prices than spend money to train actors themselves. No matter what scientific method is used, they cannot test out true drama artists, so film companies are unwilling to spend a sum of money in advance. American women are all dramatic, and there is no difficulty in recruiting talents. Some female stars can't act, but they can skate, or ride horses, or swim, and they can also become popular stars. Directors and screenwriters specialize in skating, riding, or swimming as themes and shoot films. Such talents cannot be found in the Chinese film industry. The success of the American film industry cannot be entirely attributed to the organizational power of film giants. American women should be given the first credit. Few American film productions do not feature female actors as the protagonists, and films starring female leads must have thighs. Thighs are America's national treasure. Marlene Dietrich's thighs were once insured for two million US dollars, which was the price ten years ago, and now with inflation, it is certainly more than this number. Once a woman steps into the door of a film company, it is like ascending the dragon gate, her value is tenfold, and she has the title of Hollywood star. In addition to the generous salary in the company, they also broadcast on radio stations, record records in record companies, and serve as visiting lecturers at universities, so their income is multifaceted. Even if they fall from the silver screen, they will not lose their jobs. They can also develop to radio stations, stages, nightclubs, and model companies. Women who have been gilded in Hollywood seem to have an extra layer of protection in their lives. American society has always treated Hollywood figures differently.

Biographies

### Naval Veteran Sa Zhenbing

— A Wilderness

It is said that Admiral Sa Zhenbing, who was once very famous, has also become very destitute recently. The newspaper said: The alumni of the Wusong Merchant Marine School who work in the shipping industry in Shanghai, seeing the old principal's bleak old age, specially donated 500,000 yuan each, pooled funds for interest, and sent it to Fujian every month to maintain Sa's life.

Some people are surprised: Why is it that a high official who has served as the Minister of the Navy and the Governor of Fujian Province would be so impoverished? This is precisely the admirable thing about Mr. Sa. Anyone who has heard about Sa's character and behavior must know that his frugality and integrity are truly extraordinary.

When Sa was the principal of the Wusong Merchant Marine School in Shanghai, he also seemed to be serving concurrently in the Navy Department. In theory, he could have built a Western-style house and purchased a car in Shanghai, but Sa did not. He always took the tram and only booked second-class rooms in hotels. When he was the Governor of Fujian Province, he went to the small vegetable market in plain clothes every morning to personally purchase vegetables, meat, and fish, and returned home to hand them over to the servants to prepare lunch. Every time he went out, he always carried an umbrella and never had an entourage.

Sa graduated from the Royal Naval Academy in Greenwich, England in his early years. When the Qing court founded the navy, he was one of the first naval officers trained abroad. During the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, he personally participated in the battle. In the year of the Xinhai Revolution, he was serving as the Admiral of the Qing Navy, and was ordered by the Qing court to lead the Yangtze River Fleet to Wuhan to suppress the "bandits." However, he had already been "flirting" with the revolutionary army. When the fleet arrived in Jiujiang, he ordered the artillery to fire, but "only allowed to fire at the sky, not allowed to injure people." The late Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, was often under Sa's command at the time. Finally, Lin Sen, together with Sa, launched a "rebellion" to support the revolutionary army. The "skyward cannon" also stopped firing, the fleet changed its serial number, and came to Shanghai together.

After Sa left the political stage, he devoted himself to charitable causes, for about thirty years now, but he still maintained considerable prestige in the political world, and is still a senior advisor to the Naval Headquarters. The Incident of 1934 was able to be resolved quickly without bloodshed, and it was mostly due to Sa's efforts. Even three-year-old children in Fujian know what an amazing person this kind and amiable "Old Buddha" is.

I heard this story about Sa: Sa had a male servant who was quite diligent and was appreciated by Sa. As a result, Sa married his daughter to that male servant, and this "flattered" new son-in-law worked hard to make progress after marriage and actually became successful. - If these are facts, then Sa's mind, which does not have any class concepts, is worthy of our admiration.

When the War of Resistance broke out, the Central Government specially sent Mr. to be an envoy to Nanyang to comfort overseas Chinese. At the age of eighty, he traveled back and forth, working hard for the country. After the mission was completed, he went west to Chongqing to report, which was deeply appreciated by the Central Government. Later, he made a trip to the Northwest. General's footprints were everywhere in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Although his spring and autumn were high, he could still ride freely and look around at ease. In his spare time, he wrote poems and articles, and his ambitions were not shallow.

After the victory, he returned from the mainland and went to Shanghai, and soon returned to his ancestral home in Fujian. Last year, due to arteriosclerosis, his body weakened, and the doctor ordered him to rest at home, and he did not pay much attention to the current situation. Here, I wish General good health!
