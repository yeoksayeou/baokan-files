### Some State-Run Light Industries Will Gradually Be Changed to Commercial Operations; China Textile Company and Others May Be Offered for Public Sale

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] According to the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, all state-run production enterprises, except those belonging to the heavy industry sector and those that must be operated by the government due to clearly significant special circumstances, should immediately issue shares to the public or sell them to private merchants, according to the urgency of the situation. It is heard that Song Ziwen recently ordered Wang Yunwu to draft the sales steps within 20 days. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is rushing to formulate a plan. It is heard that there are two major parts of the state-run enterprises belonging to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. One is the China Textile Company, and the other is the China Tobacco Company. The branches of the China Textile Company are spread all over the country, with a total of 1.7 million spindles, and the estimated value of assets is 1 trillion yuan. It is easier to sell some of them that have independent characteristics. For other companies, shares will be issued gradually to increase private capital, so that they will eventually become private companies. Deng Hanliang, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry, is scheduled to take a train to Shanghai on the evening of the 19th to discuss this matter and other matters related to emergency measures with all relevant parties. In addition, the light industrial factories under the National Resources Commission, including four sugar factories, three paper mills, three electrical appliance factories, and four cement factories, may also issue shares to attract private capital.

### Prices of Public Utilities Will Not Increase Recently

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] When Chairman Chiang made a statement on the 16th, he said: "If the government continues to subsidize various public utilities, the budget cannot be maintained, so reasonable increases should be considered in the future." When a reporter asked relevant parties about this, they stated that the subsidy policy adopted in the past did reduce the burden on those who enjoy public utilities, but it is unfair to reduce the burden on a part of the people with the money paid by the entire nation to the national treasury. Therefore, it is reasonable for the government to reduce subsidies in order to balance the budget. As for the prices of general public utilities, although the authorities are considering making reasonable adjustments, they will not be realized in the very short term, and the amount of increase in the future will not be too large.

### Legislative Yuan Holds General Assembly Today

Because what the National Government submitted was only the detailed rules for punishing those who violated the plan, not the entire plan, the committee members believed that this would involve the rights, obligations, and freedoms of the people, and should be handled with caution. It was resolved that Luo Ding would report on the progress at the 315th plenary session of the Legislative Yuan on the 20th. In addition, the Legislative Yuan has invited President Song Ziwen to report to the Yuan during the plenary sessions on the 20th and 21st.

Newton claimed that, according to information he obtained from the Chinese side, the Soviet Union handed over to the Chinese Communists in the Northeast at least 48 Japanese aircraft, 17 tanks, and a number of artillery pieces.

[Further Dispatch] Moscow Radio commentator Osipov today also accused the continued stationing of American troops in China and other countries as "militaristic imperialism."

### American May Continue to Supply Materials Stipulated in Lend-Lease Act; Ambassador Gu's Speech Urges Increased Aid to China

[French News Agency, Washington, 18th] According to people close to the American government, Congress is expected to pass a bill on Monday allowing the government to continue supplying China and other countries with materials stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act to help their economic stability and complete reconstruction. In addition to China, there are also four countries: Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Australia.

[United Press, New York, 18th] Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun delivered a speech at the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Conference tonight, believing that Chairman Chiang will definitely be able to save China's economic crisis, and that the Chinese people and those related to China's economy will work together to achieve the expected results. He also called on the United States to increase its aid to China. His speech briefly stated: China, like other countries, has received financial assistance from the United States after the war, but the amount is limited. Apart from the UNRRA relief supplies, China has only received a loan of 143 million US dollars, while Britain has received 4.4 billion US dollars, and France 2.42 billion US dollars. The Chinese government needs at least 2 billion US dollars for post-war reconstruction and relief programs, but the UNRRA's plan only covers 21% of this amount, and the UNRRA will end its work before June 30 this year, so it will not be able to fully implement this limited plan in China. Some Americans have said that the current chaos in China is caused by itself, which is a big mistake, and it is not a unique phenomenon in China. Even "countries with well-organized economies" in Europe have the same situation now. It should be known that China has been at war for the longest time and has suffered the greatest losses, which is unmatched by any other United Nations member. Therefore, it is not surprising that the economy is in a serious state today. What China urgently needs now is foreign aid and cooperation, especially from the United States. Only in this way can the commercial relations between China and the United States be developed, and the future can be rapidly improved.

[Reuters, New York, 18th] Ambassador Gu Weijun said in a speech at the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Conference today that although the phenomenon of the sharp depreciation of the legal currency a week ago was heavily burdened, it should not be considered that the Chinese economy will inevitably go bankrupt, but if there is no appropriate assistance and cooperation from foreign countries, especially the United States, the situation cannot be controlled for a long time.

### Gu Agrees with Private Operation for Non-Defense Industries

[Associated Press, New York, 18th] Ambassador Gu informally expressed his approval of his country's government's decision to sell off industries other than important defense industries and return them to private operation. It is said that the National Resources Commission, established during the war, operates 300 factories producing various products. It has now been decided to sell all industries except heavy industries related to national defense to private individuals or sell their shares, which is commendable. At the same time, the establishment of a new exchange rate between the US dollar and the legal currency will be a factor in stabilizing the value of Chinese currency. China really needs cotton and other supplies to help its post-war industry resume production. Once the new measures are fully effective and China's purchasing power is stable, the purchase of imported goods will begin. China will be a major market for various consumer goods, various food products, and various heavy machinery and tools in the future, but this will depend on its foreign exchange surplus. On the Chinese side, it is preparing to immediately start exporting large quantities of tungsten, antimony, fur, bristles, tea, and raw silk products, hoping to make the United States its major market, where most of the goods had previously been mainly marketed in the United Kingdom.

### Marshall Attaches Great Importance to China's Difficult Situation

[United Press, New York, 18th] Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun told reporters after meeting with Secretary of State Marshall yesterday that Secretary Marshall was very sympathetic to and attached great importance to China's difficult situation. As for the content of their meeting and whether a decision had been reached, Ambassador Gu was unwilling to announce it, only saying that the meeting was of an "explanatory" nature. The 500 million US dollar loan proposed by the Export-Import Bank for China was also discussed, but no decision was made. The issue of American mediation of China's political problems was not discussed. Ambassador Gu continued that Chairman Chiang has now decided to transfer state-owned factories to private operation. This move will enrich the government's financial institutions better than selling them off. These factories were taken over by the government's wartime measures, and most of them were unwilling to produce for profit, causing the government to suffer losses. After returning them to private operation, the government will no longer suffer this loss.

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall told visitors that he had a detailed discussion of the situation in China with Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun yesterday, and Ambassador Gu had requested assistance from the United States, especially cotton and wheat.

### Jewelry Industry's Gold Ornament Transactions Will Be Limited in Quantity; Nanjing Silver Industry Proposes Four Points to Authorities

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] After the announcement of the measures to strengthen financial business control, operators in the jewelry industry are generally worried about whether they can continue to sell gold ornaments in the future. If their business scope is limited to silverware, their business will be unsustainable. In this regard, a reporter visited an official responsible for drafting the "Measures for Handling the Finished Gold Ornament Industry," who said that the jewelry store's operation of gold ingots and gold bars is beyond its business scope, and according to the new measures, it should be completely prohibited. As for the sale of gold ornaments, it may not be completely prohibited, but the weight of each item and the monthly and daily turnover may be restricted so that it does not become a disguised gold trading. The initial draft of the handling measures has been drafted and is now being submitted to the higher authorities for review, and it is expected to be announced by the weekend or early next week.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Jewelry stores in Nanjing continued to be closed on the 19th. In the morning, the jewelry stores sent representatives to discuss the future business matters and decided to petition the authorities, suggesting four points: (1) Please allow the exchange of gold ornaments, handled according to the central bank's listing price; (2) Gold ornaments received after exchange, in addition to being used for melting and still making ornaments, should be sold to the central bank if there is more, and apply to the central bank for allocation if there is less; (3) Jewelry stores shall not operate gold bars and gold ingots; (4) The profit of the silver industry shall be determined by the industry association based on the actual situation with the cost of living index as the standard, and submitted to the competent authority for approval by the association.

### Minister Peng Answers Reporters' Questions: Government to Reorganize Mid-Next Month; Zhang Zhizhong Expresses Willingness to Strive for Peace

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 19th. Minister Zhang answered reporters' questions as follows: Regarding the reorganization of the government, how is it proceeding? Answer: The reorganization of the four institutions will begin soon.

Question: Can the reorganization be completed before March 15th? Answer: Yes.

Question: Prior to his resignation, President Sun mentioned to foreign reporters that peace talks would depend on the conclusion of the Lunan battles or a new decision. Now that the Lunan battles have temporarily concluded, can peace talks be resumed? Answer: I have no knowledge of this.

[Our Hefei Dispatch, 18th] Zhang Zhizhong received reporters at the Provincial Government Guesthouse here at 4:30 PM on the 18th. He stated that if the Chinese Communists are willing to open the door to peace talks, he (Zhang referred to himself) would be willing to do his utmost to strive for it. The key to the peace talks currently lies in whether the Chinese Communists are sincere, as the government has never abandoned its peace policy. He has been back in his hometown for two weeks and has not communicated with Nanjing. If it is necessary to stay in Nanjing after arriving, he will postpone his return to his new post in Xinjiang.

[Central News Agency, this city] Chen Jiakang, Director of the Chinese Communist Shanghai Office, stated yesterday that he had not heard of the rumors that peace talks would be resumed. He also denied the news that Bu Lizhi had met with Dong Biwu during his recent visit to Shanghai. He stated that the Chinese Communists would not abandon the two conditions previously put forward.

### Democratic Socialist Party and Youth Party Refute Luo Longji's Speech; It is an Undeniable Fact that the Democratic League Sides with the Chinese Communists

[Central News Agency, this city] Luo Longji is currently giving speeches at Jinan University and other places, and his speeches have touched upon the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties. Authorities from both parties believe that Luo's speech distorted the facts and issued separate statements yesterday to refute it.

Democratic Socialist Party Statement

According to a spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party: Luo claims that our party should be held responsible for destroying the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). However, what power does our party have to destroy the PCC? On the other hand, our party also has no power to protect the PCC. He also believes that our party should not abandon the pursuit of peace and instead pursue a democratic constitution. This view is wrong, because democracy is a gradual process, and progress in democracy is definitely not impossible even during a civil war. Luo said that among all the constitutions, none were drafted during a period of national division. With Luo's "erudition," he is not aware that the German Weimar Constitution was drafted under conditions of domestic disunity. Luo also opposes our party's participation in the National Assembly "without a PCC foundation." It should be noted that the convening of the National Assembly was stipulated by the PCC. If it is not based on the PCC, then where is the legal basis of the PCC? He falsely claims that our party is conducting secret negotiations with the government. In fact, our party has no secrets to speak of, and all activities have been reported in newspapers. He believes that participating in a government organization is closing the door to peace. He should know that after gradual realization of democracy, the distance between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can be narrowed, and the realization of peace is even more possible.

Zuo Shunsheng's Statement

Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party issued a statement yesterday, saying: Luo's intention is that only the Kuomintang and the Youth and Democratic Socialist Parties should be held responsible for the current situation, while the Chinese Communist Democratic League seems to have no responsibility. Given Luo's position, he can only say so. But I believe that the PCC and war cannot coexist. Where there is war, there is no so-called PCC. Those who fundamentally destroy the PCC are those who wage war. Whoever fights is the one who wants to destroy the PCC. In recent months, the Kuomintang has initiated ceasefires at least twice. Once was a ten-day ceasefire regarding Zhangjiakou, and the other was a ceasefire voluntarily declared by the government before the opening of the National Assembly. Unfortunately, both ceasefires were rejected by the Chinese Communists. Who should be held responsible for the current situation caused by the inability to cease fire? This point should be seriously considered by Luo. The Youth Party has no armed forces, and neither do the Democratic Socialist Party nor the Democratic League. The responsibility for the current situation is very slight. We have no intention of shifting responsibility to the Democratic League, but two things are worth recalling. One is that before the opening of the National Assembly, people from the Third Force held long discussions at the Bank of Communications in Nanjing and formed a concrete plan, which was simultaneously proposed to the government and the Chinese Communists. When the government had not yet expressed its attitude towards this plan, Luo, as a member of the Democratic League, was severely criticized by the Chinese Communists and had to withdraw the plan automatically. The other is that the Third Force proposed a concrete plan to the government to postpone the opening of the National Assembly and continue consultations. At that time, people from the Third Force had all signed the plan, but before it was submitted, some members of the Democratic League, after contacting the Chinese Communist delegation, requested to withdraw their signatures. However, Luo did not withdraw his signature, which is admirable! These two facts show that some members of the Democratic League side with the Chinese Communists, which is an undeniable fact. To revive the spirit of the PCC, a ceasefire is a prerequisite. I wonder what Luo thinks of the Chinese Communists' repeated rejection of peace talks?

### Youth Party Holds Central Executive Committee Meeting

List of Participants in the Government Not Yet Agreed Upon

[Our Dispatch] The Youth Party held a Central Executive Committee meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the list of participants in the government. Attendees exchanged views extensively but were unable to reach a decision. It is said that discussions will continue this afternoon.

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's Central Executive Committee meeting of the Democratic Socialist Party was temporarily cancelled due to Zhang Junli's illness and the lack of important matters to be discussed. According to Xu Fulin, the list of additional members for the Legislative Yuan and the other four institutions has been submitted by the Democratic Socialist Party, but the government and the Youth Party, as well as eminent social figures, have not yet submitted their lists. According to law, they should be announced publicly, so it will take some time.

### We Stop Negotiations with the Philippines; Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Issue Statement; Overseas Chinese Unanimously Praise Firm Stance

[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] The Central Propaganda Department announced today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing to issue a statement within one or two days regarding the suspension of treaty negotiations between China and the Philippines.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 18th] The overseas Chinese here unanimously expressed their praise for the firm stance taken by the government of their home country in ceasing to prolong the fruitless negotiations with the Philippines on a treaty of friendship. Although the local overseas Chinese hope that a Sino-Philippine treaty of friendship can be concluded following the Sino-Philippine commercial treaty, so that both countries can benefit, they are not at all surprised by the repeated changes of the Philippine government officials, which led to the interruption of the negotiations. This can be seen from the fact that the Philippine side insisted on changing the entire draft at the last minute. One overseas Chinese commentator said: "At a time when overseas Chinese are suffering from Philippine intimidation and terrorist acts, and the Philippine government and Congress are constantly considering dozens of unjust measures aimed at completely excluding Chinese, it would be ridiculous to talk about friendship with the Philippines." At the same time, foreign observers here believe that the national prestige that the Philippines has gained since its independence will be diminished due to its recent capricious attitude in the Sino-Philippine negotiations.

Ye was originally scheduled to return to Yan'an on the 17th, but has repeatedly postponed his return. It is generally speculated that he is waiting to meet with Jilun before returning to Yan'an, and some speculate that Jilun's visit to Nanjing has an important mission. People close to Jilun told reporters today that Jilun's visit to Nanjing was in response to a telegram from President Chiang.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Personnel from the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation continue to withdraw. One plane flew to Yan'an today, carrying four Communist personnel and supplies. All personnel from the Changchun Executive Sub-Headquarters for Military Mediation arrived in Beiping by train today. Cai Wenzhi, the Chief of Staff on the government side, has scheduled a farewell party for the US personnel on March 1, as the US side will withdraw completely by the end of March.

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Naval officials indicated today that the US Navy may soon withdraw from China, following the US personnel of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation in Beiping and the Marines. Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Seventh Fleet, is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow to discuss the changing situation in China. Kirk's fleet originally consisted only of light aircraft carriers, destroyers, and cruisers stationed in Qingdao. Since the recall of Special Envoy Marshall, naval officials have expected that this fleet would also be withdrawn from China. The ships may be transferred to Guam or Saipan. It is not yet known whether the US naval personnel currently assisting in the training of the Chinese Navy in Qingdao will withdraw when the US fleet is ordered to leave China.

### Name of German Philanthropist During the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Troops Has Been Ascertained; Current Whereabouts of John Rabe Still Unknown

[United Press, New York, 18th] The German newspaper "New York State Pioneer Times" reported today that the name of the German philanthropist who saved the lives of countless Chinese during the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese troops in 1937, after a long investigation by the Chinese side, has now been determined. The newspaper's deputy editor, Aobussen Dorf, received two letters from Loson and Yanado, proving that the person was John Rabe, the former manager of a German trading company's branch in Nanjing. Loson is a former German staff member of the US Embassy in Beiping, and currently works at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York. Yanashi is a former German officer and advisor to the Chinese army, and currently lives in New York. After hearing the United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 6th that Mayor Shen Yi and others were making every effort to find the person and intended to provide him with financial assistance, and that American members of the International Relief Association also wanted to bring this German back to China and give him a pension to reward his merits, they sent letters to report. It is said that Rabe founded a refugee camp, saving the lives of thousands of Chinese, and presided over the Nanjing branch of the International Relief Association. He later returned to Germany in 1938, and was arrested and placed in a concentration camp by the secret police for giving speeches and exhibiting photos exposing the atrocities of the Japanese army in Nanjing. As for his current whereabouts, they also have no knowledge.

### President Song Refutes Rumors; We Have Not Requested the Sale of UNRRA Materials; UNRRA Central Committee Holds Special Meeting

[Central News Agency, this city] According to the United Press, the Chinese government has requested that UNRRA's US$200 million worth of materials be sold at black market prices. A Central News Agency reporter spoke to President Song and asked for his opinion. President Song declared that this unfounded report was due to certain parties deliberately misinterpreting the measures of UNRRA and CNRRA in order to provoke relations between China and the United States. Leaving aside other things, the claim in the news that Jackson, the Deputy Director-General of UNRRA who recently visited China, would consider approving the black market method, is enough to refute this rumor.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] Chinese officials here recently denied reports this morning that the Chinese government had requested the United States to allow it to sell UNRRA materials worth US$200 million on the domestic black market in order to obtain cash and overcome the crisis of national currency depreciation.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The UNRRA Central Committee of nine countries will hold a special meeting at 3:00 PM today (Eastern Standard Time, which is 4:00 AM on the 20th) to discuss the reported Chinese request to sell UNRRA goods worth US$200 million. In addition to the United States, the other members of the UNRRA Central Committee are China, France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, Brazil, and Yugoslavia.

### Chairman Receives Yang Jialuo and Others

Inquires about the Work of the World Encyclopedia

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Chairman Chiang recently received Professor Yang Jialuo, Director of the Chinese Encyclopedia of the World Academy, Li Shuhua, Deputy Director of the Beiping Research Institute, Zheng Chen, editor of the Chinese Encyclopedia, and others. The Chairman inquired about Yang's work on the World Encyclopedia. Yang first described the process, and then requested that the government implement the suggestion in the Siku Quanshu Encyclopedia (the first volume of the World Encyclopedia) as soon as possible, namely, to establish an institution to compile the Chinese Encyclopedia, as this suggestion had been passed by the Second Plenary Session and submitted to the National Government for handling. He then stated that when the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization met in Paris recently, it passed a resolution on the mutual translation of classical books from various countries. In fact, Professor Zheng Ting of the Chinese Encyclopedia has already translated the pre-Qin classics and philosophers, but due to printing difficulties, only two volumes have been published recently, and the rest have not been printed. He asked the government to provide assistance.

The trial had not yet concluded at the time of sending the telegram.

### Zhegan Railway Accelerates Track Laying; Can Reach Yiwu by the End of This Month

It will be possible to reach Dachen within days, Yiwu by the end of the month, and Jinhua in April. However, the lack of locomotives after reaching Yiwu has become a major problem. It is learned that UNRRA has allocated nine locomotives to the railway, all of which are in Hong Kong and have not yet been transported to Zhejiang.

### Tightened Funding and Rising Prices; Zhejiang Seawall Project is棘手

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 19th] Wang Huzhen, Deputy Director of the Qiantang River Seawall Project Bureau, told our reporter that the most difficult problem in the seawall project recently is that CNRRA has informed them that the flour ration for workers will be reduced from 12 kilograms per worker to 2.5 kilograms per worker. Once this is announced, the workers on the seawall may disperse in a commotion. The second major difficulty is that the salaries of the bureau's personnel were originally paid according to CNRRA standards, but recently they were informed that this was not approved, and project experts Tang Zhenxu and Shao Fu have therefore submitted their resignations one after another. In addition, only 2 billion yuan of the initial project cost of 6 billion yuan has been received recently. The prices of cement, lead wire, and hardware that were planned to be purchased have all exceeded the budget by several times, so the seawall project is deeply affected.

### Original Sentence in the Muk渎 Grain Hoarding Case Revoked; Provincial Government Orders Severe Punishment; Cooperating with the Government's Emergency Economic Measures

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 19th] The Muk渎 large grain hoarding case was previously lightly punished by the county government. When the provincial government learned of this, it considered it inappropriate. On the 19th, it urgently telegraphed Wu County Magistrate Shen Chenglong, ordering him to continue sealing up the hoarded grain, transfer the grain merchants to another place for interrogation and trial, and apply the "Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against Food Management During Emergency Periods" and the "Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations" to impose a severe punishment in order to cooperate with the government's new price policy.

### Wuxi Investigates Inventory; Discovers Concealment and Underreporting

The team has already dispatched an investigation and has now found that the inventory of various daily necessities in the shops does not match the reported quantity, especially the inventory of yarn shops is quite sufficient. Dingfeng alone underreported 146 bales, and Xintongtai raised the price of yarn. All of this has been reported to the command post by the investigators for record. As for the county government, it convened an emergency meeting on the 18th with the heads of the trade associations for firewood, rice, oil, yarn, cloth, five ocean goods, department stores, flour, Chinese and Western goods, and North-South goods to discuss suppression measures.

### Pacific Island Trusteeship

Regarding the issue of trusteeship of Pacific islands, the U.S. government, through its delegation to the United Nations, once again submitted a trusteeship plan yesterday, requesting the Security Council to consider it. This plan includes 1,500 islands in the Pacific, which were under Japanese rule and are now occupied by the U.S. military. The most well-known of these are the Marshall, Mariana, and Caroline Islands. According to this plan, these islands will remain under the sole control of the United States, and the U.S. will be allowed to establish defenses in certain areas designated as "restricted zones," free from the control of UN agencies. Furthermore, while the UN Charter stipulates that administering countries should submit reports on the areas under their trusteeship at any time, the trusteeship plan proposed by the U.S. this time includes certain reservations, namely, that the U.S. government may choose which areas the reports should be submitted on. This means that the U.S. government has the freedom to decide which areas under its administration should be reported on and which areas need not be. In addition, the U.S. proposal suggests that the trusteeship islands should establish financial, customs, and administrative ties with the areas governed by the U.S., integrating these islands with the U.S. administratively and economically. Although, according to the UN agency's broadcast, the Security Council's agenda is currently very crowded, so it is still uncertain when this plan will be submitted to the Security Council for discussion, there is no doubt that this plan will be submitted for discussion, no matter how busy the Security Council's work is.

In terms of sentiment and emotion, we naturally express full support for the U.S.'s proposed Pacific island trusteeship plan in general. On these islands, many American youths sacrificed themselves on their desolate beaches and in their dense jungles. These islands were mostly under Japanese mandate before the Pacific War. Since the American army has occupied these islands with bloodshed and sacrifice, for their own future security and the peace of the entire world, the fact that they have gained control of these islands as a result of the war should be unanimously recognized by the international community. Before the United States entered World War II, it had already assisted the Allied nations with the material resources of the Lend-Lease Act. Although the benefits China received from this were extremely small, after entering the war, it sent troops to assist in the war. The military control of these Pacific islands, acquired as a result of the United States' own military actions, should win general recognition and support from the international community. From a moral point of view, we have no objection to the trusteeship plan proposed by the United States.

However, emotion is one thing, and legal principle is another. The trusteeship agreement plan proposed by the U.S. government this time was originally announced on December 6 of last year, and has been submitted to the Security Council member states and the governments of the Philippines and New Zealand for their records. Subsequently, the governments of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Australia requested that the United States wait until the signing of the peace treaty with Japan before submitting it. However, the U.S. delegation to the UN agencies ignored the opinions of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Australia and submitted it ahead of schedule. Regarding this point, we feel that it does not matter much. The issue of trusteeship of the Pacific Islands must eventually be raised, and it is a good strategy to raise it before the peace treaty with Japan is signed. Some people believe that the U.S. government's proposal of this draft trusteeship agreement goes against the U.S.'s promise in the Atlantic Charter and the Cairo Declaration not to seek territorial expansion, and is also contradictory to President Truman's statement in Potsdam that he "does not seek an inch of territorial expansion." What we want to point out here is that trusteeship is one thing, and territorial expansion is another. At least in legal principle, trusteeship is not the same as territorial expansion. The United States occupied these islands with military force, and now it is submitting a draft trusteeship agreement to the UN agencies, which is precisely taking into account the collective security system of the UN agencies. For the United States, this can only be said to be a bitter pill. It was American blood that was shed on these barren islands in the Pacific, and yet it still has to submit its trusteeship plan to this international organization. For the sake of international justice, there should only be sympathy for this plan proposed by the United States, and no malicious criticism. However, some of the reservations proposed by the United States, such as the U.S. government's right to choose the areas where reports should be submitted, and the regulations regarding certain "restricted zones," seem to be quite different from the original purpose of creating UN agencies and establishing the trusteeship system. How to reconcile the provisions of this draft agreement with the spirit of the UN agencies is something to be hoped for from further consideration by the U.S. government and the Security Council.

As for saying that the U.S.'s purpose in obtaining the trusteeship of these Pacific islands is to counter China and the Soviet Union: this is an overstatement. There has always been a traditional friendship between China and the United States; it is too unimaginable that there will be a war between China and the United States. We must not be misled by this kind of rumor; in reality, this seems to be an anti-American act with an international background. The Pacific after World War II is completely different. Japan, which dominated the Western Pacific, has now declined; and there have also been extremely important changes in the situation in the North Pacific. The Kuril Islands, which served as a barrier to the North Pacific, have now been incorporated into the Soviet territory, and the Soviet Union's power has suddenly extended into the North Pacific. The transfer of the Kuril Islands is only found in the so-called Yalta Agreement. This was originally an agreement between the three great powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Since other countries that fought against Japan did not participate, and the disposition of the former Japanese islands was not approved by the UN agencies, it has no legal binding force in theory. But this is already a fait accompli. At this time, with the U.S. proposal of a Pacific island trusteeship agreement, we cannot help but admire that even in the handling of this issue, the U.S. government still respects the spirit of international rule of law to some extent.

Regarding the handling of the Pacific Islands, what we must raise is the issue of the Okinawa and Ryukyu Islands. These islands originally belonged to Chinese territory. In Cairo, the lack of a clear decision on these islands does not mean that we have given up our claims to these islands. We reserve our claims to these islands; if they are transferred to trusteeship without our consent, the Chinese people will rise up in unanimous opposition, which is what we must point out.

### Marshall's Reply Published: U.S. Rejects Soviet Protest, Says Acheson's Remarks Were Within the Scope of His Duty

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall has formally informed Molotov that Deputy Secretary of State Acheson's candid remarks to a Senate committee, stating that Soviet foreign policy has a "progressive and expansionist" nature, should not be deemed unacceptable in the democratic system of the U.S. government, and this is a matter of responsibility. Marshall's reply is in response to the Soviet note of February 14, which was delivered to the Soviet side by U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and published here today. According to the Soviet note, Acheson's remarks were "rude insults and extremely hostile to the Soviet Union," and urged the U.S. to pay attention to "Acheson's unacceptable behavior, as he disregarded his position and arbitrarily made these remarks." Acheson's remarks were made in response to a question from Senator McKellar on February 10, when the Senate committee was hearing the opinion of Mr. Lilienthal in order to decide on the recommendation of appointing Mr. Lilienthal as Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The Soviet note also stated that McKellar's question was a "rude attack" on the Soviet Union.

Full Text of the Note

The full text of Marshall's note is as follows: "The note of February 14th, conveyed by Ambassador Smith, has been received, in which you refer to the statement made by the Undersecretary of State to a committee of the United States Senate as an intolerable act and regard this statement as an impudent slander containing the intention of being hostile to the Soviet Union, etc. The remarks to which you object were not volunteered by the Undersecretary of State, but were merely in reply to questions by a member of the Senate. This reply was made in questions that were fully permitted by the Chairman of that Committee. The exchange was as follows: Senator McKellar asked: 'Now, assuming that the Soviet Union not only wishes to acquire the countries that it now has, but wishes to extend its territory further, do you believe that if the Soviet Union discovers the secret of the atomic bomb that country would not only seize the rest of Europe, but even encompass the rest of the world?' Acheson replied: 'I do not believe that this question can be answered in the manner you have asked. I am deeply aware that the Soviet Union's foreign policy is indeed one of aggression and expansion. I believe that one of the major efforts being made by all people in the United Nations is to attempt to find a way to resolve these types of problems. If such methods and agreements can be found, then it is hoped that there will be no large-scale conflict in the future, otherwise, I believe the situation will be very serious.'"

"You are fully aware of our country's constitutional system, including the respective limits of authority between the legislative and executive branches of our government. According to our system, officials of the executive branch, in committees of the legislative branch, have a duty to frankly answer all questions that do not involve secrets or violate public interests, and there has never been an exception to this situation. Therefore, the Undersecretary of State's frank and conscientious answer to the question cannot be called intolerable, but is in fact in line with his duty. You refer to the content of his statement as an impudent slander and hostile to the Soviet Union. According to our standards, expressing reasoned criticism of a public policy cannot be considered slander. Therefore, I know that if you reconsider, you will not mistake frankness for hostility."

### U.S. Still Hopes for Four-Power Treaty: Occupy Germany for Forty Years: Secretary Marshall Attends House Foreign Affairs Committee Meeting to Discuss Current International Emergency Issues

The United States has not yet given up this hope, and the State Department still believes that Byrnes' plan is feasible. Secretary Marshall attended a closed-door meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee this morning for two hours to discuss the urgent issues concerning international relations. At the request of several members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary Marshall will attend the committee again on Wednesday to answer questions from those regarding the general direction of U.S. policy.

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco 19th Broadcast: The Soviet Union submitted thirteen proposals to the Security Council today, aimed at realizing its original plan to separately draft agreements on the issues of prohibiting atomic weapons and transferring control of atomic energy to the Security Council.

Don Juan was en route from Lisbon to Rome, and the plane stopped at the airport for two hours.

### Indian Constitutional Work Encountering New Crisis: Britain Will Recall Wavell: It is Rumored that Britain May Withdraw from India Within a Specified Period

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco 19th Broadcast: The New York Times correspondent in London said that within one or two days, British Prime Minister Attlee will issue an important statement announcing that Britain will take the same steps towards India as it did towards Palestine, and completely hand over India to the management of Indians within one year.

[Associated Press, London, 19th] Authoritative sources claimed today that the British government, due to the new crisis in Indian constitutionalism, has decided to recall Indian Viceroy Wavell. Prime Minister Attlee will announce this in the House of Commons tomorrow, and will also publish a white paper. Tomorrow's announcement is "extremely important" to India. When an official answered a question, he said: "It is not impossible for Britain to withdraw from India within a specified period." The official declined to explain this statement in detail. The recent crisis in India was caused by the Muslim League's repeated refusal to participate in the Constituent Assembly. British officials said that the crisis is about to break up the Viceroy's interim government. Congress leader Nehru recently wrote to Wavell, strongly arguing that there are still five Muslim League members in the Indian cabinet, which is inconsistent with the Muslim League's policy of refusing to participate in the Constituent Assembly. The five Muslim League cabinet members then stated that they had no intention of resigning. Wavell asked the British government for instructions, and the British cabinet then held continuous meetings last week and this week to discuss the Indian impasse. Official sources also said that Nehru wrote to Wavell twice last week, requesting the London government to reply as soon as possible and warning Wavell that unless the Muslim League cabinet members resign immediately, all nine Congress cabinet members will resign.

### U.S. Oil Industry Workers: Suddenly Decide to Strike

### Restoring the Gold Standard: Combating Communism

American Business Tycoon Advocates

[Agence France-Presse, Chicago, 18th] Mr. Abbotting, President of the American Foreign Trade Association, delivered a speech at the World Trade Conference here today, advocating that the United States should use circulating gold coins as a way to combat communism. It is said that the time has come for the United States to seriously consider minting and circulating gold coins. The restoration of the gold standard will create confusion among international communist believers and immediately discredit them. Every commercial nation, except the Soviet Union, hopes to raise the value of its currency in the international market to stimulate foreign trade. Restoring the gold standard can eliminate the idea of ​​barter worldwide. The barter system is favored by the Soviet Union, while the United States is only concerned with a value-based system.

### Japanese Reparations Plan: Awaiting Final Decision from the United States

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The US policy on Japanese reparations is about to be decided, in order to facilitate Japan's economic recovery. The shipment of reparations materials will begin soon after the US policy is finalized. This plan will be the basis for Japan's general reparations plan, as the countries involved in the Pacific War have not yet reached an overall agreement on this issue, which must be resolved before Japanese industry can engage in a planned postwar economy. The main reason why the Allies have failed to reach an agreement is the Soviet Union's objection to deducting its "spoils of war" from Northeast China from its share of Japanese reparations. The US policy on Japanese reparations will be based on the report of reparations representative Pauley to President Truman and the reports drafted by the seven-member expert group. Pauley's report, based on political and other factors, advocates severely reducing Japan's economic power. The seven-member group's report is based purely on technical considerations, and the two reports are at opposite extremes. Although the US policy on Japanese reparations is about to be decided, the shipment of reparations materials will not begin immediately; formal shipment will have to wait several months. However, the planning work for dismantling, transportation, and loading is currently underway.

### Eisler Indicted

### The Beginning and End of the Palestine Conference

Britain will submit the Palestine issue to United Nations bodies, but will not request an emergency meeting before the UN General Assembly convenes in September of this year.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons today the British decision to submit the Palestine issue to United Nations bodies. He said that the breakdown of negotiations was due to the uncompromising attitudes of both the Jewish and Arab sides, and that a solution was currently impossible.

Bevin Announces the British Position

Other key points announced by the Foreign Secretary include: (1) The British government is well aware that it is no longer possible to establish a solution in accordance with the 1939 White Paper; (2) As a mandated power, Britain is in a difficult situation and does not want to impose an arbitral decision on either side, so it has decided to submit the entire issue to United Nations bodies; (3) Britain will detail to United Nations bodies the infeasibility of the mandate at present and present the various proposals that have been put forward by the British, Jewish, and Arab sides; (4) The British government is well aware of the difficulty for United Nations bodies to review the Palestine issue before the General Assembly convenes in September; (5) He specifically stated that the British government's recent proposal had a firm promise to gradually and rapidly complete the independence of Palestine, but it was still rejected by both the Jewish and Arab sides.

Finding a Solution is No Longer Possible

Foreign Secretary Bevin also detailed the previous handling of the Palestine issue, saying: Since taking office, I have been trying to solve the Palestine issue. Those who support the government feel that it is no longer possible to find a solution based on the 1939 White Paper. Because of the great concern of American Jews about the Zionist idea, an Anglo-American Palestine Investigation Team was appointed in November 1945, and it was also decided to allow 1,500 Jews to immigrate each month. In addition, 12,000 Jews were allowed to immigrate to Palestine after the White Paper ceased to apply. In total, 29,000 Jews have been allowed to immigrate since July 1945.

Negotiating Basis Emphasizes Partition

After the Anglo-American Committee's report was published, it was reviewed by British and American officials, and it was jointly suggested that negotiations with the Jewish and Arab sides be based on Morrison's provincial autonomy plan. However, the Jewish and Arab sides in Palestine did not accept it, and the representatives of the Arab countries finally held a meeting with the British side in London on July 31, 1946. The Palestinian Arabs participated in the meeting in January of this year, while the Jewish Agency consistently refused to participate. Only at the end of the meeting did it hold informal talks with the British government outside the meeting. Both the Jewish and Arab sides rejected Morrison's provincial autonomy plan, but the Arabs put forward a counter-proposal, advocating the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, permanently maintaining the Arab residents as the majority. The British government, knowing that the Morrison plan was no longer possible as a basis for negotiation, put forward a new proposal to establish two autonomous regions, Jewish and Arab, and another central government jointly participated in by the two ethnic groups. It also stipulated that 4,000 Jews would be allowed to immigrate each year for the next two years. In addition, there was a feature not found in previous plans, namely, a promise to gradually and rapidly complete the independence of Palestine five years after the trusteeship. However, both the Jewish and Arab sides refused to accept this plan. Here, I would like to state the reasons for the repeated rejections by the two ethnic groups. The independence of Palestine is inevitable. According to democratic principles, the majority of residents should have the right to decide the fate of their country.

Jewish and Arab Claims Are Vastly Different

The Arabs believe that the continued expansion of the Jewish people is sufficient to hinder the independence of Palestine Arabs, so they oppose the continued immigration of Jews and the establishment of a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. The ultimate goal of the Jewish Agency is to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, so it initially suggested that Britain continue to administer the mandate so that it could continue to expand the Jewish territory and allow Jews to immigrate, until it eventually demanded the independence of the Jewish state in Palestine. Later, the Jewish Agency proposed a compromise plan to partition Palestine, but demanded that Jewish immigration matters be controlled by the Jewish Agency. Therefore, the British government is faced with two irreconcilable principles. Palestine has 1.2 million Arab residents and 600,000 Jewish residents. The latter demand the establishment of a Jewish sovereign state, while the former firmly oppose it.

The Only Way is to Seek Arbitration

Judging from the negotiations in the past few months, it is well known that there is no possibility of establishing a solution through negotiation. According to the mandate provisions, Britain cannot dedicate Palestine to Jewish or Arab rule, or unilaterally decide on partition. Therefore, the only way is to ask United Nations bodies to decide. During the transitional period before the United Nations General Assembly convenes in September, we will still continue to fulfill our mandated responsibilities.

### The Supervision Team is Swift and Decisive: The Gongyi Rice Shop's Stockpiling of Rice is Uncovered; Shop Owner Jin Zhongliang is at Large; the Accountant is Detained and Sent to the Garrison Headquarters; It is Reported That He Has Bribed a Certain Government Agency

[Reported by this newspaper] The Grain Section of the Economic Supervision Team yesterday uncovered a rice shop that stockpiled a large amount of rice and bribed government officials. Xiao Fuquan, a member of the section, received a tip-off that the Gongyi Rice Shop at 982 Avenue Petain was hoarding a large batch of rice, attempting to sell it at a high price. After receiving the report, Xiao immediately sent personnel to investigate. The shop had already received wind of this at this time, and secretly moved the rice stockpiled at No. 1, Lane 624, Tianping Road to No. 982 Avenue Petain overnight. Xiao then sent personnel to search the address and found 235 bags of stockpiled rice. The shop owner, Jin Zhongliang, had fled beforehand after hearing the news, and his accountant, Yang Jingfang, was arrested. According to Yang, the shop had been discovered by a certain government agency for stockpiling rice some time ago, and at that time, it bribed them with 6 million legal tender and 12 dan of rice to settle the matter, and presented a certificate to this effect. After obtaining the confession, Xiao immediately sent him to the Garrison Headquarters, where he will be severely punished according to military law for the crime of disrupting the people's food supply by stockpiling rice during a time of emergency and for bribery.

[Another report] Yesterday, the Economic Supervision Team continued to send personnel to monitor the gauze market, and the market situation was stable. However, due to the scarcity of goods arriving at the North and South rice markets, prices tended to rise in the morning. Commander Xuan was very angry after receiving the report. He said that the rice price in the city fluctuated with the gold rush last week, and the rice merchants took the opportunity to raise prices illegally. Later, General Zheng Jiemin explained the stakes to the rice industry representative Wan Molin, and Wan immediately promised to lower the selling price day by day and restore the original price before February 1. The supervision team is executing this policy and there is absolutely no room for flexibility. He ordered Wang Zhongqing, the head of the Grain Section, to be responsible for thoroughly investigating, and anyone who commits a crime will be arrested immediately. After receiving the news, the rice merchants and vendors did not dare to shout high prices and automatically suppressed the prices, which were not much different from yesterday. Those who had already completed transactions at higher prices also suppressed them and settled the accounts at the market price of the previous day. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau's public rice did not sell for the past few days because the rice market was abundant in supply and there was no need to distribute it. If the market supply falls short of demand today, a considerable quantity will be released again, so the rice price should not tend to rise.

Investigating Large Households That Profited from Gold Purchases

[Reported by this newspaper] The three-person subcommittee composed of the Gold and Banknote Section of the Economic Supervision Team, the Ministry of Finance, and the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) continued to actively investigate the gold rush yesterday. The work on the Central Bank has come to an end. The supervision team is tracking down the quantity of gold bars sold by the Central Bank to five large silver shops, including Tongfengyu and Fang Jiuxia, then investigating the quantity resold by these five to smaller banking houses, and then investigating the accounts of the smaller banking houses to get to the bottom of who ultimately purchased the gold, and then compiling and analyzing this information. It is believed that the large households that made profits from gold purchases will be identified within days. At 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the staff under the command of the three-person subcommittee gathered on the second floor of the Central Bank to discuss and were given instructions on the work policy by Deputy Minister Xu Baiyuan of the Ministry of Finance. Immediately afterward, they were divided into eight units to investigate the accounts of private banks and money houses, paying special attention to illegal speculation using gold as collateral to purchase and resell. However, as of yesterday, no suspects have been arrested. The rumor that several managers of gold shops have been detained is not true.

### Silver Shops Request Resumption of Gold Jewelry Sales: Four Provisional Business Regulations Are Proposed

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Silver Shops Trade Association believes that the recent government ban on gold sales and the cessation of business by silver shops not only affects the livelihoods of employees but also makes it impossible for farmers to purchase ornaments, which is not a way to encourage them. Therefore, it has specially drafted four provisional business regulations to request that the Municipal Council uphold justice: (1) The weight of each piece of jewelry manufactured and sold by silver shops shall not exceed two liang (關秤) on the official scale, and small gold bars shall not be melted and sold. (2) Silver shops shall be allowed to collect and exchange gold jewelry, and the price shall comply with that stipulated by the Central Bank. (3) In addition to being used for the manufacture and sale of jewelry, any remaining collected and exchanged gold jewelry should be sold to the Central Bank. If there is a shortage, an application should be made to the Central Bank for allocation. (4) The business profit shall be determined by the Silver Shops Trade Association with reference to the business situation and the cost of living index and with the consent of the Central Bank.

[Another report] The representatives of the silver and jewelry industry petitioned the Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce the night before, arguing that gold jewelry is actually a kind of savings for ordinary people to prepare for emergencies, and not purely for decoration, so there seems to be no reason to prohibit it. Chairman Pan and Director Xu believe that what the industry has stated is true, and they have jointly telegraphed the Central Government through the Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the regulations on the collection, exchange, sale, and processing of gold jewelry not be prohibited, but that each piece be limited to two liang (關秤) to show restriction.

### February Salaries: Calculated and Converted to Legal Tender Before Implementation of Rationing System

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the payment of workers' wages in February, Director Zhao of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau said yesterday that it should be in accordance with the government's instructions, and the maximum should not exceed the index of January. Before the implementation of the fair price supply of daily necessities, the calculation of the three items of rice, cotton cloth, and fuel in the index is different, and the difference between the market prices in February and January should be converted into legal tender and paid.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegraphes the Government: Requests Continued Production Loans

After hearing this, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially submitted a petition to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, earnestly requesting continued operation to complete the mission of increasing production. It stated: Since the national policy has been set, it should be implemented consistently and should not be changed lightly due to temporary special phenomena. Please uphold the President's intention to assist production enterprises with loans, and approve the continued operation of the low-interest factory production loans handled by the United Banking Syndicate, and actively expand and relax collateral, simplify procedures, eliminate abuses, and strengthen supervision, so that the factories can strive to improve themselves and complete the mission of increasing production for the country.

### Commemorating the 13th Anniversary of the New Life Movement: Every Citizen Should Know How to Strive

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday was the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement. All walks of life in Shanghai held a grand commemorative meeting at the Grand Theater yesterday morning at 9 a.m., attended by Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, Chairman Fang, and more than 1,000 people from all walks of life. The venue was arranged solemnly and simply in accordance with the purpose of the New Life Movement. Five pots of fresh flowers were placed in front of the stage, and the party and national flags and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait were hung in the back, as well as the New Life emblem and the green characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame (禮義廉恥)" (see picture). Various slogans such as "Understand Propriety and Righteousness," "Know Integrity and Shame," "Take Responsibility," and "Abide by Discipline" were decorated around, which were solemn and brilliant under the reflection of the arc lights.

The meeting began at 9 a.m., and after performing the rituals, Chairman Wu, the Mayor, reported, saying: The New Life Movement has played a significant role in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and Shanghai especially needs to promote the New Life Movement today. The purpose of the New Life Movement is to revive old morality and promote the inherent spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, which is the right medicine for the current national malaise. Based on what I have seen in Shanghai in the eight months since I arrived, I deeply feel that the current turbulent situation lies in the people's decadent emotions. The formation of this phenomenon is caused by two words, one is "selfishness (私)," such as speculation and manipulation, hoarding and profiteering, stirring up the gold rush, and inciting civil war. The second is "hypocrisy (偽)," often pretending to be benevolent and righteous, and words and actions are inconsistent. How can we make the country rich and the people strong in this way? Therefore, I deeply feel that the two kinds of character of the Chinese people, "selfishness" and "hypocrisy," urgently need to be eliminated. We should transform "selfishness" into "public interest" and "hypocrisy" into "truth," so that the country and nation can have new hope.

Speaker Pan delivered a speech, explaining that the Council's suggestion that the Public Utilities Bureau brightly illuminate the four characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame (禮義廉恥)" on the International Hotel is to alert the people and implement the New Life Movement. However, it is meaningless to only make these four characters brightly illuminate. The promotion of the New Life Movement must be practiced by every citizen, and only by being diligent and thrifty and striving to improve ourselves can we achieve the goal of national prosperity and people's well-being.

Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters said in his speech: The essence of the New Life Movement lies in understanding propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, taking responsibility, and abiding by the rule of law. Today is the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement. Let us try to discuss the situation in Shanghai. Are there people who can truly practice the requirements of the New Life Movement? On the contrary, there are many who say one thing and do another. The life of the Chinese people is becoming increasingly corrupt. The way to remedy this is the New Life Movement, but the chaos of the situation is the biggest obstacle.

Commander Xuan said: The New Life Movement has been promoted in China for 13 years. Currently, most citizens in Shanghai have developed bad habits in their old lives. We must thoroughly practice the requirements of the New Life Movement to change the social atmosphere. The promotion of the New Life Movement is not only in slogans, but must eliminate all stubborn opposition. I am willing to follow the citizens of the city and implement it first. Councillors Zhang Zhongyuan, Fei Shusheng, Shao Yongsheng, and others then delivered speeches one after another. After the meeting, the movie "Iron Bone and Ice Heart" was shown immediately.

[Report from Our Newspaper] A fire broke out at 4:20 AM on the morning before yesterday at No. 77, Lane 1027, East Daming Road, Hongkou, claiming the lives of eight people. The details were reported in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. The detailed report on the fire has been prepared by the responsible fire brigade, and Zhang Qian, the brigade chief of Hongkou District, personally submitted it to Director Zhou for review yesterday. According to our reporter's investigation, the report states: The fire originated on the second floor of No. 77, Lane 1027, East Daming Road, starting with Zhou Xu, who is now on the run. The cause of the fire was an explosion of a kerosene stove. The residents in the house were extremely diverse, with a total of 27 people living in the "pigeonhole" apartments, with many attachments (mezzanines). When the fire started, the residents were busy rescuing their belongings and did not report the fire department. The fire spread for 20 minutes before it broke through the roof, at which point the fire department was notified by the lookout tower. After receiving the report, the Central Brigade immediately dispatched two fire engines, led by Brigade Chief Zhang Qian himself. When they arrived at the scene, everything except the attic room had collapsed. It is presumed that the eight victims were mostly crushed to death. When the fire engines arrived, the fire had spread to No. 79 next door, and four 2.5-inch nozzles were used to simultaneously extinguish the fire. The fire was brought under control after half an hour.

After the fire was extinguished, an examination of the debris revealed five bodies.

### China Wheel and Sail Company; Debt Dispute Leads to Lawsuit; Jin Runyang Implicated in the Case

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jin Runyang, a director of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's organizational affairs, was implicated in a civil lawsuit yesterday. According to the plaintiff, Zhou Yanling of Lianxing Trading Company, Jin and Tang Ruyao and others jointly established the China Wheel and Sail Company.

The District Court heard the case yesterday, and the defendant Tang Ruxiao stated that the money had been repaid, but the checks had not been returned.

### After the Victory Against Japan, the Ministry of Education Receives Important Cultural Relics; Section Chief Xu Bopu Delivers a Speech

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent] According to Section Chief Xu Bopu of the Department of Social Education under the Ministry of Education, which is in charge of cultural relics, after Japan's surrender, the receipt of cultural relics should be handled by the Ministry of Education in accordance with the regulations on the handling of enemy and puppet property. The Executive Yuan has also repeatedly ordered all its subordinate agencies to comply with this regulation. Recently, the National Government issued another circular stating that cultural relics must not be included in the auction of enemy and puppet property, and that cultural relics must be immediately transferred to the Ministry of Education. Those who violate this order will be severely punished. From all these measures, it is clear that the government attaches great importance to the protection of cultural relics. The Ministry of Education, recognizing that the preservation of cultural relics is crucial to the cultural lifeline of our country, has made detailed plans. In addition to establishing a temporary committee for clearing war-time cultural relics losses to formulate an overall plan for the preservation of cultural relics, it has also strictly ordered special commissioners in various regions of the ministry to pay close attention to the matter. It has also made every effort to negotiate the handover of cultural relics received by other agencies. Despite repeated setbacks, it has always sought to receive them as soon as possible for relevant agencies to organize and study them, in order to preserve them. However, since the beginning of the process, the public has been very concerned about how much has been received and what has been received. Therefore, the following is a brief account of the most important items: (1) The Mao Gong Ding: This ding is the crown jewel of bronze vessels in the world. After Japan's surrender, the original owner, Mr. Chen Yongren, considering that private collections had no guarantee during times of turmoil, presented it to the government through the introduction of Mr. Ye Yuhu and others, and specified that it be handed over to the Central Museum for management. However, after a year of twists and turns (early August of this year), it was finally handed down by the Chairman and has now been ordered by the Ministry of Education to be stored at the preparatory office of the Central Museum.

Haiyuan Pavilion Collection

(2) Haiyuan Pavilion Collection: This collection was owned by the Yang family of Liaocheng, Shandong. Around 1921, it was transported to Tianjin and stored in the warehouse of the Yanyeh (Salt Industry) Bank. Previously, local gentry in Tianjin and Beijing, including Pan Fu, Chang Langzhai, Wang Shaoxian, and Zhang Ting'e, organized the Cunhai Society to protect it. However, the Japanese had long regarded it as their own. In February of this year, President Song Ziwen visited Tianjin and, through the gentle persuasion of Mr. Zhang Ting'e, acquired it for the state at a cost of 20 million yuan. The collection consists of 92 titles, 1,207 volumes, all of which are fine editions of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. It has been temporarily entrusted to the National Beiping Library for safekeeping, and a special room of the Cunhai Society has been set up to commemorate the event. (3) Ze Cun Library: This is the collection of the traitor Chen Qun, said to contain a million volumes, stored in Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou. The part in Suzhou is currently being negotiated for receipt by the Ministry of Education. The part in Shanghai has already been cataloged. The part in Beijing has been taken over by the National Central Library for organization and opening to the public, and consists mainly of fine editions of the Ming and Qing dynasties, approximately 300,000 volumes.

Manchu Puppet Palace Books and Paintings

(4) Books and Paintings from the Manchu Puppet Palace and Awarded to Pu Jie: After the victory, the National Army took over Changchun and then withdrew. Upon withdrawal, Deputy Chief of Staff Dong Yanping, at the request of Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, selected the most precious books, a total of 13 boxes, from the puppet palace and airlifted them to Shenyang, where they were stored in the warehouse of the Central Bank. In mid-August, these were handed over to Mr. Jin Yu, representative of the Committee for Clearing War-Time Cultural Relics Losses of the Ministry of Education stationed in the Northeast, under the supervision of Mr. Jiang Fucong, Director of the Central Library, and Mr. Li Ji, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum. They are temporarily stored at the Shenyang Library of the Northeast Regional Education Rehabilitation and Counseling Committee of the Ministry of Education. Song editions account for nearly half of these books, such as the Song edition of the Xin Tang Shu (New Book of Tang), Tong Jian (Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government), and Tong Jian Ji Shi Ben Mo (Complete Account of Events from the Comprehensive Mirror), which are all complete sets. Furthermore, there are as many as seven types of Song edition of the Six Dynasties Literary Anthology. After checking against the list of books awarded to Pu Jie, it was found that they accounted for approximately one-third of the entire list. According to Deputy Chief of Staff Dong, the 13 boxes that were transported out were all fine editions of the Song and Yuan dynasties. There were dozens of other wooden boxes of books that were not transported out, which were slightly inferior to those transported out, but unfortunately, they were all destroyed when the Communist army entered Changchun. Regarding the books and paintings from the Manchu Puppet Palace awarded to Pu Jie, the Ministry of Education received a telegram from the Chairman ordering a secret investigation and recovery for national ownership. Today, only this part of the collection has been obtained, and it is said to be not easy to recover even this much after the catastrophe.

Cultural Relics in Pu Yi's Residence

(5) The situation of receiving the cultural relics stored in Pu Yi's residence: Pu Yi's old residence is located on Dihua Road in Tianjin and was occupied by the US military. After several rounds of negotiations, Mr. Shen Jiantu, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education in the Tianjin-Beiping area, Mr. Kerrcliff, representative of the US military, Mr. Ma Heng, Director of the Palace Museum, and Mr. Wang Shi, representative of the Committee for Clearing War-Time Cultural Relics Losses of the Ministry of Education, jointly received 222 boxes of cultural relics in Tianjin together with representatives from the Tianjin-Beiping Area Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. The items are still being sorted. In addition, 1,085 pieces of jade and several paintings were found in a safe:

(1) Song Gaozong (Emperor Gaozong of Song) and Ma Hezhi's painting "Postscript to the Red Cliff Prose" (Hou Chibi Fu Tu);

(2) Zhao Mengfu's calligraphy of the Tao Te Ching (Daodejing);

(3) Zhao Mengfu's "Autumn Outing and Drinking Horses" (Qiujiao Yinma Tu);

(4) Qian Xuan's "Lonely Hill" (Gushan Gang);

(5) Deng Wenyuan's cursive script authentic handscroll.

These five items are all missing items from the Palace Museum, and the "Autumn Outing and Drinking Horses" is listed in the "Catalogue of Books and Paintings Awarded by Pu Yi to Pu Jie" printed by the Palace Museum. All of the above items have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be temporarily preserved by the Beiping Palace Museum. According to investigation, there were originally 50 large wooden boxes in Pu Yi's residence, said to contain: 1. Seven large boxes of the original handwritten manuscript of the Records of the Guangxu Emperor of the Great Qing Dynasty; 2. Bronzes, porcelain from the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong periods, silverware, and paintings; 3. Imperial fur robes. After the victory, all were moved to Pu Xiu's home on Tianjin Road. The residence was sealed off by the Tianjin Garrison Command, and there seems to have been some loss of items stored inside. Some people have witnessed Kangxi porcelain bowls and other items circulating on the market. It is hoped that they can be received as soon as possible to avoid further losses.

### Open Badminton Inaugural Match, Exciting and Tense Men's Doubles, Tao Ni Team Wins After Three Sets of Fierce Battle

[Report from our newspaper] The inaugural Badminton Open Championship held its opening match at 6 p.m. last night at the City Gymnasium. The audience was more enthusiastic than during the league matches. The badminton game is a full-body exercise. Although the rules are different from tennis, the practice methods are similar. Its interest and excitement are not less than those of tennis games. There were three matches in the opening match last night: (1) Men's preliminary singles, Dao Nier defeated Yu Zhongyao, 15-2, 15-0. (2) Men's doubles, Tao Guanqiu and Ni Zhengyi defeated Wu Guotao and He Chuanlong, a hard-fought three sets, 18-17, 17-18, 15-14, tense and exciting, unprecedented. Mixed doubles, Cao Hongran and Ye Jingxiong team defeated Cai Kewen and Miss Ping Zhimeng, 15-10, 15-9. The battle situation of each match is as follows:

Men's Preliminary Singles

In the men's preliminary singles, Yu Zhongyao played against Dao Nier, which started at 6 o'clock and was the opening show of this session. Dao attacked more than defended, and the forehand smash showed strength. Therefore, the situation became one-sided. He quickly made it 12-1. In the first game, he won 15-2. In the second game, Yu changed his strategy and continued to smash, but because the opponent used position shots and feint methods, he won the second game 15-0 again.

Dao Nier 15-2 15-0 Yu Zhongyao

Men's Doubles

At 6:40, the men's doubles followed. The connection between Wu Guotao and He Chuanlong seemed better than the opponent, leading by 4-0. Later, due to the smashing of Tao and Ni, the situation became tense. The score was close, becoming 6-5, 9-8, 12-11. After a fierce battle, it quickly became a 13-tie. Wu and He were the first to get 13 points, so according to the rules, they had the right to use a wide-open deciding score of 5 points.

During the rematch, it was first one each. Wu and He's offensive was strong, making it 4-2. Due to excessive tension, they repeatedly self-killed, and Tao and Ni chased up, winning the first game 5-4, which was unexpected.

In the second game, the initial battle was tied at 4-4. Tao and Ni's movements were calm, making it impossible for the opponent to take advantage. They once made it 13-5, which was also a huge gap. By coincidence, another 13-tie came in the audience's shouts, which was not unique.

The matter was important, and the fight became fiercer. In each of the two rounds, the two sides fought a life-and-death battle. Those who lost their attacks took two minutes. After killing each other for 4 points, Wu and He made a hot shot, making the enemy 5-4, causing the air in the ball court to change instantly. The situation was evenly divided, and there was a third game dispute.

In the third game, Tao and Ni went down the current with 7-1. Mr. He and Wu were a pair of spectacle-wearing gentlemen, and the difference in eyesight may be a factor in the failure. Tao and Ni finally benefited from 15-4, laying the foundation for the overall situation.

Mixed Doubles

The mixed doubles was the final match last night. Cao Hongran and Miss Ye Jingxiong took the lead with 6-1 as soon as they entered the game. Cai Kewen and "Foreign Miss" Ping Zhimeng lost because of poor pairing, and Ping often missed the ball. Cao and Ye won the first game 15-10, and won the second game 15-9 in a row. Ping's actions were funny, and his strange laughter added to the audience's interest.

### Basketball League, Two Acts Tonight, A One Renyu Faces Quanhei, A Two Pei'er Battles Jia Shen

The basketball league will have three matches in the A group as usual tonight from 5:30 pm. However, the last match between Shantou and the Giants in A group one was requested to be rescheduled due to some reason. With the consent of both parties, the Basketball Committee approved the postponement. Therefore, there are only two matches today, namely A two Pei'er versus Jia Jia. A one Renyu meets Quanhei, tickets remain the same.

Starting at 5:30 pm, Pei'er of A two meets Jia Jia. The former once fought hard last week to defeat the heroes of Green Forest, and its momentum is strong. The people under its command, such as Yu Erjia and Wang Weigong, are young and strong, and their strength is still strong. The latter's lineup also has many good players, such as Tao Yingshi, Lv Miaosheng, and Sun Moxi, all of whom are basketball veterans. There will be a fierce battle at that time.

Starting at 6:30 pm, Renyu of A one meets Quanhei. After Renyu defeated the once-dominant Chunmao team with 40 to 34 a few days ago, its arrogance was high and invincible. Wu Xinyun, Wang Huaiting, Yao Wenyuan, Shen Pengju, Sun Guozheng, etc. have pure and hot connections and fast passing, and are the fastest growing and most accomplished basketball players in recent years. Quanhei was originally not Wu Xia Ameng, such as Jia Youliang, Lu Dazhen, Zhang Shaoqing, Xu Jusheng, Li Zude, He Xiaoguang, Yan Youling, Qu Qiaonan, etc., all of whom are basketball veterans, but they are scattered everywhere and rarely practice. He also defeated the Railway Beijing team last weekend, and his remaining power can still be seen. If he meets Renyu today, Renyu will be the winner. But Quanhei will also do his best to deal with it. The order of today is recorded later:

Pei'er — Jiajia (A Two) 5:30 pm

Referee Ni Xiaoben Jin Jiabiao

Renyu — Quanhei (A One) 6:30 pm

Referee Hu Zongfan Hu Hongxin

(Pei'er) Yu Erjia, Yu Ersui, Zai Junbing, Wang Weigong, Ge Xinghai, Zhou Huikai, Shen Beizhang, Zhang Xianping, Hu Huizhao.

(Jia Shen) Sun Moxi, Tao Yingshi, Zhu Zhonglin, Yan Shilu, Lv Miaosheng, Yu Liangzi, Hou Yongkang.

(Renyu) Chen Wei Yuan (Captain), Shen Pengju, Wang Huaiting, Yao Wenyuan, Liang Yongjia, Sun Guozheng, Wu Xinyun.

(Quanhei) Jia Youliang, Zhang Shaoqing, Xu Jusheng, Lu Dazhen, Zhou Zhi, Qu Qiaonan, Li Zude, Yan Youling, He Xiaoguang, Tao Shaosheng, Zhang Xianlun.

### Director Fang Wanbang of the Ministry of Education's Sports Committee Discusses the Sports Situation in Taiwan and Fujian: Taiwanese People Have a Generally Strong Interest in Sports

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 19th] Fang Wanbang, a member of the National Sports Committee of the Ministry of Education, flew from Shanghai to Taiwan on November 22nd of last year to inspect sports education. On December 5th, he flew from Taiwan to Fuzhou, Fujian, for inspection. In late January, he took a ship from Fuzhou, passing through Shanghai, and returned to Beijing in early this month to report to the Ministry of Education. Our reporter recently interviewed him, and he discussed the sports situation he observed:

Fang Wanbang inspected more than 60 schools and social education institutions in Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Changhua, Pingtung, Chiayi, and Hsinchu. He observed three main advantages:

Impressions from Inspecting Taiwan Province

(1) Taiwan has an excellent climate and environment. (2) Taiwan has excellent sports facilities (swimming pools, sports fields, gyms, large sports arenas, etc., are well-equipped). (3) The general population has a widespread interest in sports. What it lacks, as observed during the inspection, is a complete sports administrative organization and social sports groups, as well as sports leadership talent, teachers, and appropriate sports teaching materials. After contacting the province's education administrative authorities, he made the following recommendations: Regarding administrative organizations, he suggested that the province establish a "National Sports Committee" and province-wide sports organizations. This has now been adopted, and the committee and organizations have been formed. He also suggested training current substitute teachers to quickly cultivate national sports talent in order to improve and enhance the quality of teachers. This has been agreed upon and is being actively implemented. He also suggested increasing and strengthening sports teacher training institutions, and the normal college has been ordered to add a sports department. Regarding funding, he suggested that the sports budget be independent, and that special funds be allocated to subsidize the construction of sports facilities, to establish a sports equipment manufacturing plant, and to find ways to purchase and distribute sanitary supplies from the Central Health Administration. These items are also being prepared separately for implementation. Regarding teaching materials, he suggested organizing a "Sports Teaching Material Compilation and Review Committee" to delete inappropriate teaching materials, supplement and introduce new teaching materials, and stipulate standards for sports equipment in schools at all levels, all of which have been adopted and planned. Regarding social education, he suggested establishing sports fields at all levels in stages, and it has been decided to first prepare for establishment in Taichung, Taipei, and Tainan, and personnel have been assigned to strengthen management.

Opinions from Inspecting Fuzhou

In Fuzhou, Fang inspected 24 middle schools, 7 colleges and above, 2 national schools, and 2 schools established by other organizations, and also temporarily investigated two cases under the orders of the ministry. He felt that most principals and physical education teachers were aware of the importance of sports and worked hard, but due to limited funding and space, most schools were unable to achieve ideal standards in sports facilities. He made the following suggestions: (1) It is recommended that the education supervisory office add a sports supervisor with rich experience in sports administration and teaching to plan, supervise, and promote sports throughout the province. (2) Strengthen the equipment, curriculum, and faculty of normal schools and professional sports training institutions to cultivate primary school sports teachers. (3) Strengthen or adjust professional training institutions and sports fields to improve sports efficiency. (4) Strengthen the management of provincial sports fields to fully provide for school and community sports activities. (5) Stipulate minimum standards for fields and equipment for schools at all levels and complete them within a time limit. (6) Schools that have reached the standards, if sports funding is insufficient, may increase sports fees, but must budget separately and submit it to the competent authorities for approval. (7) Normal schools should not collect sports fees, and ways should be found to remedy this or allocate a special subject budget.

### Mobile Funds Display Dominance, Lack of Chips Reported, All Chinese Stocks at Limit Up, Special Settlements Said to Be Done Through Cross-Trading to Avoid Risk

Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose again amidst loose monetary policy and tight chip supply, with many reaching the limit up. The premium for Meiya was as high as 250 yuan, Yongsheng 100 yuan, Xinyi 25 yuan, and Jingfu Qinxing 10 yuan. It is said that cross-trading firms, seeing the great risk, will start doing special settlements to avoid danger.

The market opened high and then suddenly fell back due to overnight floating orders for selling, with Yongsheng falling from 2020 yuan to 1920 yuan. After Zhongfa reached the limit up, it fell back by more than ten yuan, and market sentiment was high. Numbers 105 and 217 both entered the market, causing prices to rise, and the price returned to 2020 yuan. Numbers 177, 218, and 47 then sold at 1970 yuan. Numbers 76 and 180 tried to maintain the price, and numbers 102, 145, 106, 196, and 85 purchased, with Yonggong by number 157, Jiufu by number 171, and Yongye by number 49 all reaching the limit up first. Yongsheng then rose back to 2065 yuan. Numbers 95, 177, and 218 sold, and the price fell back to 1980 yuan. Numbers 14, 145, 12, 180, 1, 154, 198, 35, and 224 purchased, and it was rumored that a loan of 500 million yuan had been secured. Number 145 re-entered the market after selling, and numbers 180, 52, and 149 vigorously purchased, causing the price to rise to 2120 yuan. Numbers 76 and 155 sold, but only struggled slightly. Shangwu reached the limit up by number 117, and Jinglun by number 219. Numbers 145 and 224 purchased vigorously, but the supply on the trading floor remained tight, and the price was close to the limit up by noon. Hanjingfu and Rongmeng also reached the limit up. At the noon closing, number 156 and others offered to sell, and the market turned sideways. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsheng, Xinyi, Huafeng, Xinguang, and Jingfu each rose by more than 10%. Meiya and Qinxing reached the limit up. Only half a day of delivery trading was conducted. It is estimated that Yongsheng, Xinyi, and Huafeng rose by more than 10%. Jingfu and Meiya rose by about 15%.

### Authorities Concerned About People's Food, Rice Prices Based on Yesterday's Market, Only Allowed to Fall, Not Allowed to Rise, Arriving Rice Still Plentiful, Market Suddenly Sees a Rebound, Flour and Miscellaneous Grain Prices Rise Universally

According to Wang Zhongqing of the Grain Group of the Shanghai Economic Supervisory Corps, from today, all rice prices in this city must be based on the prices reported on the 19th. They are only allowed to fall and not allowed to rise. Anyone who stirs up trouble or attempts to raise prices privately will be reported at any time and severely punished in accordance with the law. The heads of the North and South Marketplaces were also instructed to report the daily arrival, trading, and sales conditions on a daily basis.

Rice

The amount of rice arriving yesterday was 4920.20 shi in the South Market and 6918 shi in the North Market, totaling more than 11,800 shi in the two markets. Shipments from various gangs continued to arrive steadily, and the market suddenly saw a rebound. The previous days of decline had been significant, and the production price and the Shanghai market price were gradually closing in. Generally, vendors did not intend to sell lightly due to cost considerations, leading to stability in market sentiment. Rice shops had also been waiting for low prices for several days and took this opportunity to replenish their stocks. As a result, sales were indeed more active than the previous day, and transactions increased, turning the market from weak to strong. The prices of both japonica and indica rice rebounded by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. However, the dark rice was still not selling well, and the price was stable. It is reported that the market in the North Market was more bullish than in the South Market.

Flour

Slightly improved, but trading stalled because the personnel of the Social Affairs Bureau were stationed in the market, resulting in very little activity from flour merchants and few brokers. However, the underlying trend was supported by rice prices, and sellers gradually hardened their prices. However, actual sales remained sluggish, so no official transactions were reported throughout the city. Lirang foreign flour was priced at 72,100 yuan, and Bingshen flour was priced at 51,200 yuan, rebounding by more than 2,000 yuan from the previous day. The speculative atmosphere for wheat bran was heated up again, and the market price rose sharply by more than 2,000 yuan. Wheat was scarce and prices were firm, but no trading was conducted.

Cooking Oil

The market was also rising. In the general trend of various commodities turning upwards, the atmosphere of exhaustion in the market no longer existed. In addition, there has been no news of the resumption of oil allocation, so the street took advantage of the low prices to hoard oil, and the prices of those holding goods also gradually increased, and the market gradually became firmer. Finally, the price of Lousheng oil was 230,000 yuan, and the price of Jilong Sheng oil was 270,000 yuan. Sheng oil rebounded by about 30,000 yuan, and soybean oil followed closely by 10,000 yuan. Xiaoche vine oil also showed a 10,000 yuan rise, and Taichang Qing oil was traded at 210,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Universally rebounded. After the price of soybeans stabilized, both the factories and the merchants felt active, and the market rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The supply of broad beans was scarce, and the price rose steadily by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Tea beans rebounded by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and red beans also showed a firm trend. Sesame seeds were scarce, and the market also rose by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. The supply and demand of raw peanuts was relatively balanced, and the market was stable. Soybean cake remained lackluster, and the price was sluggish. Red sorghum was similar.

### Strange Tightening of Money Supply in South and Central China, Internal Exchange Rate Further Adjusted, Guangzhou Increased from 15 Yuan to 40 Yuan per Thousand

After the implementation of the government's emergency economic measures, the money supply in various places has become extremely tight, especially in South and Central China. In Guangdong, the black market exchange rate has increased to 120 yuan per thousand in recent days. Wuhan has risen sharply to 20 yuan per thousand. Qingdao in Shandong has also been affected, reaching 50 yuan per thousand. In view of this, the Central Bank specially readjusted the internal exchange rate on the 18th (the new exchange rate was only announced on the 17th and has been seen in the Times). In the Guangdong region of South China, Guangzhou increased from 15 yuan to 40 yuan per thousand, Shantou increased from 50 yuan to 60 yuan per thousand, and other places also increased from 50 yuan to 60 yuan. In the Hubei region, Wuhan and Wuchang were changed from 5 yuan to 12 yuan, Shashi and Yichang were changed from 6 yuan to 15 yuan, and other places were changed from 12 yuan to 15 yuan. In the Shandong region, Qingdao increased from 10 yuan to 30 yuan, and other places increased to 20 yuan. Wenzhou in the Zhejiang region also increased from 25 yuan to 30 yuan. Only the Jiangxi region was reduced by 2 to 3 yuan. The commercial firms in the highly black market exchange rate in South China can only maintain expenses and cannot make a profit. It is learned that the fluctuation in Guangdong was affected by the strict ban on gold and banknotes, and the fact that Macau and Hong Kong cannot directly exchange currencies is also a major reason.

### Zhongzhi Still Allocates Cooking Oil to Retailers at the Original Price

Yesterday, the Zhongzhi factory allocated cooking oil to retailers in Group B from No. 201 to No. 400, with each barrel weighing 360 catties. The price was still based on the original price decided above, which was 170,000 yuan per dan, plus a delivery fee of 6,500 yuan. The total price per barrel was 618,500 yuan. Payments were made by check on the 19th, and delivery will be on the 20th.

### Fresh Intestine Purchase Price Temporarily Set at 2,000 Yuan per Set

After the exchange rate revision, the price of fresh intestines rose from 1,700 to 1,800 yuan to 2,000 yuan per set due to the sellers' reluctance to sell, and various factories competed to purchase them as out-of-town goods arrived in Shanghai. The guild believes that the overseas selling price is currently still declining, and foreign merchants have attempted to lower the price to 40 cents per set in US dollars, but the official market price is generally more than 50 to 60 cents. Therefore, the guild temporarily sets the highest price for fresh intestines at 2,000 yuan in legal tender. Once the official overseas market price and transaction situation are determined within this week, the guild will prepare to convene an emergency meeting to discuss and determine the purchase price. The market price of processed intestines is also expected to be determined at that time.

### Unified Bonds Rebound Again, Class C Bids Exceed 10,000

Yesterday, public bonds rebounded, and the market rose again. In the afternoon, off-exchange trading saw Class C bids as high as over 10,000. Class C opened at 7,300 yuan, and there was competition to buy. Room 540 purchased, and rooms 503 and 604 sold first and then purchased, with the high price reaching over 9,000 yuan. Room 552 sold and retreated to under 8,000 yuan. The market was stable at closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, B, D, and E each rose by around 1,800 yuan, D rose by 1,600 yuan, and C rose by over 3,000 yuan, with a trading volume of approximately 14 million.

### Amount of US Dollars Redeemed Exceeds 2 Million in Three Days

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank continued to redeem gold and US dollars yesterday, but the number of people going to redeem US dollars was increasing day by day. In the past two days, more than a thousand people went each day. The amount of exchange has also expanded compared to before. The foreign exchange counter in the Business Bureau on the second floor of the Central Bank was insufficient. Therefore, starting yesterday, the Central Bank added three new counters to specialize in redemption. It is reported that since the 17th, the total amount received in three days has exceeded 2 million.

### Executive Committee of Export Promotion Council to Meet Today

It is reported that the opinions extracted by President Song during the meeting with the executive committee and consultants of the council will also be submitted for discussion separately.

### Banking Institutions' Cash Position Gradually Loosens

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, told reporters: The cash position in the market was very tight last Saturday and has now loosened. A large number of funds were remitted out of the city in previous days to purchase export goods at the place of origin due to the announcement of the export subsidy measures, and the city's cash position temporarily decreased. At the same time, after the announcement of the government's new economic measures, the transactions between banks and shops have been greatly reduced, resulting in a very loose cash position for banks and shops with a solid foundation and stable business, and a very tight cash position for banks and shops with a thin foundation. Now, more than two days later, the situation has gradually eased, so the cash position in the market has loosened. The work of inspecting banks and shops is still in the initial stage, and the results have yet to be announced.

It is also learned that after several days of tight cash positions in the market, it has gradually loosened starting yesterday. The Four Banks and Two Bureaus cleared out a cash position of more than 7 billion yuan at the clearing house yesterday. The cash position between banks and shops has also loosened. After several days of waiting and watching, the mobile funds in the market gathered in the securities market yesterday, resulting in many stocks reaching the limit up. However, the Textile Construction Company sold a large batch of cotton yarn yesterday, and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation will sell sugar in the same way today, so it may absorb another batch of funds from the market.

### Gasoline Approved for Price Increase, 3,500 per Gallon

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Gasoline Price has been approved by the Input Management Committee to rise to 3,500 per gallon starting yesterday. The distribution system will continue to be implemented. The number of car-owning class members registering and applying for purchase is very enthusiastic these days.

### Diesel Prices Also Adjusted

Texaco Asia and Mobile, and other gasoline companies in the city, have increased the import price of gasoline due to the adjustment of the exchange rate. With the approval of the Provisional Input Management Committee, the retail price of gasoline has been revised to 3,500 yuan per gallon from today. The price of diesel has also been set as follows: bulk light diesel 480,000 yuan per ton, medium diesel 467,500 yuan per ton, heavy diesel 455,000 yuan per ton. If the bulk is inclusive of barreling fees, light diesel is 515,000 yuan per ton, medium diesel is 500,250 yuan per ton, and heavy diesel is 490,000 yuan per ton.

### Tea Market Remains Stagnant

The tea market has been unusually quiet recently. Since the authorities adjusted the exchange rate against the US dollar to 12,000 yuan, sellers have been asking for prices that are astronomical and without any standard. Among them, especially the various export teas, almost all have an attitude of being reluctant to part with them. Therefore, although the buying interest has been strong and unabated in recent days, the negotiations have been difficult and ultimately the transactions have fallen into a standstill.

### Large Quantities of Food Transported to Tianjin

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haijin ship sailed to Tianjin yesterday, carrying over 5,400 bags of sugar, over 180 bales of cotton yarn, and 60 bolts of cloth. In addition, Landing Craft Utility No. 101, besides carrying gasoline, also transported 600 tons of salt to Hankou.

### Coal Briquette Rationing Quantity Difficult to Reach Newspaper Reports

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is learned that since the central government decided on the rationing method for daily necessities, the Fuel Management Committee has provided the Ministry of Economic Affairs with opinions on the rationing of coal briquettes. The quantity that may be rationed in the future may be difficult to reach the quantity reported in the newspapers; otherwise, it will affect other uses in society. The reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the amount of coal arriving at the port recently is slightly less than in the past. The reason is that the port of Qinhuangdao is frozen and transportation is hindered, and the work efficiency of miners in Taiwan has also decreased due to living conditions. The competent authority hopes to procure coal from Jiaozuo, Henan, and transport it via the Jinpu Railway to Nanjing, or first transport it from Pinghan to Hankou, and then transport it to Shanghai by waterway. However, the vehicles required for both routes are still under negotiation. As for the Hongji coal from Annam, which once supplied the city, it is now prohibited from being exported by the French, citing the reason of a coal shortage in Vietnam, and there is no hope of resumption in the short term.

### Industrial Oils Weak and Sluggish

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Spring Festival, industrial oils have risen sharply, with average prices increasing several times. Coconut oil has risen from 200,000 yuan to 850,000 yuan per dan, tallow from 180,000 yuan to 650,000 yuan, and asphalt from 250,000 yuan to 550,000 yuan. Soap factories have the strongest demand, so the market is quite strong, and prices have repeatedly surged. However, as credit has tightened recently, soap factories and oil factories have been reluctant to absorb the goods, and those holding goods are eager to sell them for cash, so prices have fallen one after another. The current market price for Tree Brand coconut oil is 550,000 yuan per sima dan, with transactions occurring between 500,000 and 520,000 yuan. Tallow is 400,000 yuan per sima dan. Asphalt from Jiaxing is reduced from 550,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan per shi dan.

### Taiwan's Fruit Exports Expected to be De-Controlled Next Month

### Although Retail Sales are Quiet, Trade Among Dealers is Quite Active: Yarn Market Rebounds Yesterday; China Textile Construction Acts as Agent for 2,136 Bales

[Report from Our Newspaper] The yarn market rebounded yesterday because the recent declines have been large, attracting dealers to absorb goods. 10-count yarn is considered good at 2-300,000, and 42-count at 300,000. However, retail sales are still quiet, with few purchases being made. Most of the transactions on the market are between dealers, and the market is not very stable. In the afternoon, China Textile Construction Co. acted as an agent for the Textile Control Committee to open sales, with a total of twelve types of yarn. Prices were similar to the previous period, and purchases were quite enthusiastic.

China Textile Construction Co. yesterday sold cotton yarn for the second time on behalf of the Textile Control Committee, selling a total of 2,136 bales, of which factories accounted for 1,232 bales and trading houses accounted for 904 bales. A total of 615 applicants, of which factories accounted for 429 and trading houses accounted for 186. This time, the company designated 16-count Golden Dollar, which was allocated to the towel, dyeing and weaving, underwear, and knitting industries. 20-count Blue Phoenix was allocated to the dyeing and weaving, canvas, and towel industries. 21-count Football was allocated to weaving factories. 40-count Real Light was allocated to the dyeing and weaving, knitting, handkerchief, and underwear industries, and the remainder was allocated as usual.

### Textile Control Committee to Discuss Yarn Purchase Price Plan Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Textile Control Committee is scheduled to hold its 25th regular meeting at the Municipal Government at 4:00 pm today, at which it will discuss the plan provided by the Six District Cotton Textile Association to adjust the purchase price of cotton yarn. It is learned that the hope of the factories to calculate the purchase price at 90% of the listed price of China Textile Construction Co. seems unreasonable, and the cost price will still be calculated based on the actual production cost.

### All Grades of Fine Cloth Increase Sharply and Uniformly

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw strong demand for all grades of fine cloth. Dragon Head fine cloth rose sharply by 9,000 yuan per bolt, and Five Blessings also rose by 7,000 yuan. Other brands of fine cloth increased by varying amounts of 4-5,000 yuan. Chick and Shilin cloth, due to abundant supply and sluggish sales, fell by 5,000 yuan per bolt. Bleached cloth and poplin were dull for both local and external customers, and fell uniformly.

### Ramie Sales Are Brisk and Prices are High

[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the small amount of ramie arriving and brisk sales, prices rose uniformly today. White ramie rose from 300,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan per shi dan, green ramie from 250,000 yuan to 360,000 yuan, and yellow ramie from 100,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan. Ramie rose from 210,000 yuan to 380,000 yuan. Other items such as linen and raw flax also increased by as much as 100,000 yuan per dan.

### Building Materials Rise in Price

[Report from Our Newspaper] American cement is becoming scarce, and people are competing to buy it wholesale. There is a severe shortage in the market, and there has been no market for many days. Only Ma Pi cement is being traded in the market, with a price of 80,000 to 82,000 yuan per 100 kg bag. Blue bricks have risen from 1.5 million yuan to 2 million yuan per 10,000 pieces. Blue tiles have risen from 1 million yuan to 1.2 million yuan per 10,000 pieces, and machine-made red tiles have reached around 1 million yuan per 1,000 pieces. The rise in lime prices is still moderate, due to excessive arrivals, with each dan rising only from 44,000 yuan to 46,000 yuan.

### Woolen Fabric Market Atmosphere is Tight

Yesterday, the woolen fabric markets on Changle Road and Qipan Street were all tight, and most merchants were unwilling to quote prices. Since the US dollar exchange rate was adjusted to 12,000 yuan, the impact on the cost of woolen fabric is quite significant. In general, it is necessary to see to what extent the factory prices increase before one can be confident in trading again. Therefore, some stores limit each person to one piece of clothing material. Buyers, due to both financial constraints and price increases and slow sales, can only wait and see.

### Post-War Exports of Raw Silk

### Prices of Major Export Goods in China Show Mixed Trends: Hog Bristles and Tung Oil are Consistently Prosperous

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the announcement of the new foreign exchange rate, the prices of major export goods in China have either risen or fallen. Among them, hog bristles, tung oil, tea, and fur have all risen by several tenths to onefold. Silk and eggs have slightly declined. The prices of various goods on Saturday of last week are compared with yesterday's prices below:

Hog Bristles: The price per dan was 1.67 million yuan last Saturday, and yesterday's price was 2.8 million yuan, an increase of 60%. However, most holders are unwilling to sell, so purchasing is difficult. Currently, the foreign prices of hog bristles have all slightly decreased. Exporting at the current market price yields a profit of 1% or 2%. Most exporters are watching and waiting, planning to export after the foreign prices stabilize.

Tung Oil: The price was set at 460,000 yuan per dan at a public meeting last Saturday, and there was no change yesterday. However, most tung oil merchants are unwilling to sell at that price, so purchasing is not easy. The export situation is the same as hog bristles.

Tea and Leather Show Improvement

The price of tea has changed drastically. The price of Wenzhou tea was 200,000 yuan per dan last week, but it has risen to more than 400,000 yuan yesterday, an increase of more than onefold. The price is unusually high and purchasing is difficult, so exporting is still difficult.

The average increase in leather is 40%. Hankou sheepskin was 550,000 yuan per dan last Saturday, and 900,000 yuan yesterday. Sichuan sheepskin was 700,000 yuan per dan last Saturday, and 1.25 million yuan yesterday. The price of cowhide last Saturday was 700,000 yuan per dan for large weight, 800,000 yuan for medium weight, and 1.2 million yuan for small weight. Yesterday's prices were 1 million yuan for large weight, 1.2 million yuan for medium weight, and 1.8 million yuan for small weight. Because the leather production season only has two months left, goods are scarce and prices are high. The export profit is better than other goods, about 5%, and many people are currently exporting.

The prices of wool products: The price of wool last Saturday was 40,000 yuan per 100 jin, and it rose to between 60,000 and 70,000 yuan yesterday. The price of duck feathers last Saturday was 280,000 yuan per dan, and it reached 300,000 yuan yesterday. Among them, wool has little foreign demand, so there is little export. Although duck feathers and hair can be exported, few large-scale exports.

Silk and Eggs Slightly Decline

The price of raw silk: The price of C grade last Saturday was 8.15 million yuan per dan, and D grade was 7.8 million yuan. Yesterday's prices were 8 million yuan for C grade and 7.6 million yuan for D grade, all slightly declining. The price of silk: 40-inch satin was 24,500 yuan per yard, and interwoven soft satin was 12,000 yuan per yard. The market prices last Saturday and yesterday were similar. In the past, silk exports all had to suffer losses. After this foreign exchange revision, there are no losses.

The prices of eggs: The price of private eggs last Saturday was 370,000 yuan per 100 shi jin, duck eggs were 350,000 yuan for 1,000 large, 330,000 yuan for medium, and 300,000 yuan for small. Yesterday's market prices were 330,000 yuan for chicken eggs per 100 jin, 340,000 yuan for 1,000 large duck eggs, and 260,000 yuan for small duck eggs, all declining uniformly. According to a certain egg company, egg prices may still fall in the future, so its export is relatively optimistic.

### Jinan Air News, 12th; Special Correspondent Li Tian: The Shandong War Situation After the Recapture of Linyi; The Xuzhou Campaign Has Reached its End; The Southern Shandong Campaign Has Officially Begun

The development of this war situation, in which the main force of the Communist army from northern Jiangsu sneaked into southern Shandong, and the main force of Liu Bocheng's troops south of the Longhai Railway retreated to western Shandong, undoubtedly shows that our Communist army's attempt to encircle Xuzhou has been crushed. The Xuzhou Campaign has reached its end, and the Southern Shandong Campaign, initiated by the National Army, should be taking its place.

The operational area of the so-called Southern Shandong Campaign should include the vast area east from the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Shandong to the edge of the Yellow Sea, west to the area north of the Xubian section of the Longhai Railway, and south of the Yellow River and the Jiaoji Railway. In this operational area, the National Army is launching a combined offensive with three powerful forces. Therefore, judging from the current situation, this operational area can be clearly divided into three theaters:

First, the main theater, centered on Linyi, east to the coast, and west to Linzhao (east of the Jinpu Railway). The Communist army has concentrated fifteen divisions, two independent brigades, and two columns, totaling about 200,000 people.

Second, the first branch of the theater, which is south from the Zibo branch of the Jiaoji Railway, to Laiwu and Xintai, with the aim of encircling the back of Linyi. The Communist army has coordinated three divisions, two security brigades, and two independent regiments here, totaling 50,000 people.

Third, the second branch of the theater, which is west of the Jinpu Railway, north of the Xubian section of the Longhai Railway, and south of the Yellow River. The Communist army has concentrated five columns and one independent brigade in this area, totaling about 60,000 people. In addition, in Jiaodong, which can threaten the rear of the National Army's first theater, the Communist army has 70,000 troops stationed; and in northern Shandong, 50,000 troops are stationed. The total number of regular Communist troops in the entire Shandong area has reached 430,000. The Communist Party, which claims to have 1.2 million regular troops, has already used more than one-third of its capital on the Shandong battlefield, making a desperate gamble.

As for the National Army's forces, their numbers may be slightly lower than the Communist army's, but one thing is the same: both sides have arranged their main forces in the main theater on the front of southern Shandong. The National Army's initial target is Linyi. The Communist army initially launched the Xuzhou Campaign with the strategic intention of ensuring Linyi with an offensive defense. Why is Linyi worthy of becoming the National Army's main attack target? And why is Linyi worthy of the Communist army ensuring it with the largest force? The importance of Linyi seems to necessitate an additional comment here.

General Wang Yaowu on the Front Line in Southern Shandong

The Importance of Linyi is Second Only to Yan'an, and Higher than Jiamusi

Linyi is an important town in southern Shandong, and has the most significant value in terms of military geography. As early as the Anti-Japanese War in 1938, the victory of the National Army's Taierzhuang victory initially relied on the victory of the late General Zhang Zizhong in the Battle of Linyi. This time, the Communist army launched the Xuzhou Campaign, and its left-wing corps, commanded by Chen Yi and Su Yu, also used Linyi as their largest base. In addition, Linyi has long been one of the three major base areas of the Chinese Communist Party in recent years (the other two are Yan'an and Jiamusi in the Northeast). It is the base area of the New Fourth Army, the second strongest force of the Communist army, and also the location of the CCP's East China Bureau, the pseudo-Shandong Provincial Government, and the Shandong Military Region. In short, it is the center of the CCP's party, government, and military south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River. It is the CCP's most important base east of Yan'an. Its importance to the CCP is second only to Yan'an and higher than Jiamusi. Therefore, the gains and losses of Linyi for the Communist army, whether in terms of military or political significance, far exceed those of northern Jiangsu and Zhangjiakou, and even more so the gains and losses of the battles of Siping Street and Changchun in April and May of last year. Therefore, Linyi has become a place that the Communist army must defend, and the National Army, in order to defeat its main force, has "attacked where it must defend," and the great battle has begun!

The war is still proceeding intensely. Since the 12th of this month, the National Army has advanced to Lijiazhuang, 45 li south of Linyi. All agencies in Linyi City have moved north, and all the Communist army has withdrawn to the mountains on both sides. Linyi City has long been an empty city. Therefore, the National Army is stationed in the city walls while clearing the Communist army in the mountains on both sides. The initial defeat of the Communist army is also predetermined by fate. However, what surrounds the hearts of the people of the country is no longer the issue of the recovery of Linyi, but the question of where the Communist army will go after withdrawing from Linyi? Where will the National Army go after occupying Linyi? When will the Southern Shandong Campaign end?

### How Will the War Continue After the National Army Recaptures Linyi?

Regarding the former, the Communist army in the encirclement in southern Shandong originally had the following four possible actions: (1) escape to the mountains, (2) retreat to Jiaodong, (3) cross the Jinpu Railway and merge with Liu Bocheng's force on the north bank of the Yellow River, (4) retreat to northern Jiangsu. Among the four, the first possibility was originally the greatest, but since the National Army on the northern route recovered Laiwu on the 4th, and occupied Xintai on the 8th, and broke into the heart of the Yimeng Mountain area, its attempt to escape to the mountains has had to increase its concerns. The Communist army concentrated its main force to attack Hao Pengju's troops the week before, and although it gained some small advantages, after the National Army's flanking attack, the dream of retreating to northern Jiangsu was clearly shattered. (But its opportunistic attacks to seize the National Army's weapons to expand its armed capital has clearly partially achieved its purpose). As for retreating to Jiaodong, it is like a mouse drilling into a cow's horn, which can only be secured temporarily. Unless absolutely necessary, the Communist army will never do this. As for crossing the Jinpu Railway and crossing the Yellow River to merge with Liu Bocheng's force, it will naturally be considered subjectively that the Yimeng and Taishan mountain areas have inflicted some losses on the National Army, and objectively it is impossible to gain a foothold after being encircled and suppressed by the National Army on three sides. Therefore, judging from the evolution of the war, there may still be a great battle in the Yimeng and Taishan mountain areas. The capture of Linyi is just a prelude to the Southern Shandong Campaign, or at most a conclusion to one stage, but not a closing ceremony.

As for how the National Army will continue the war after occupying Linyi, according to the analysis results of qualified military observers, it should not be outside of the following three plans: (1) Decide according to the whereabouts of the main force of the Communist army, not focusing on the gains and losses of one city and one place, but mainly on capturing and annihilating its main force. This is precisely the opposite of the Communist army's basic strategic principle of preserving strength and avoiding decisive battles. (2) After recovering Linyi and making some repairs, continue to move north with the main force and join forces with the National Army moving south from Xintai in Mengyin, dividing the Communist army's Yimeng base area into two, and then sweeping towards both wings to cooperate with the National Army in northern Shandong to complete the two encirclements and annihilate it. (3) Adopt a strategy of large encirclement. The National Army in the Linyi area only retains a force sufficient to block the Communist army from fleeing south and restrain the Communist army from transferring elsewhere, and instead transfers the main force to western Shandong, taking advantage of the thousands of miles of fertile land in western Shandong, a vast plain, which is conducive to both marching and supply. First, the main force of Liu Bocheng's troops is defeated, and then driven to the north of the Yellow River or the Yimeng Mountain area and the Taishan Mountain area east of the Jinpu Railway, so that it merges with Chen Yi. In this way, after the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway is opened, it is pressed from three sides, gradually reducing the encirclement. The Communist army is then annihilated. These three plans can be adopted simultaneously. The focus of the problem is only the main force, that is, whether the main theater is changed.

### When Will the Southern Shandong Campaign End? When Can the Xuji Section be Opened?

If someone must ask how long it will take for the Southern Shandong Campaign to end, it depends entirely on whether the Communist forces are increasing their troops again and how the two sides are conducting operations, strategic deployment, and tactical combat. If the National Army is not urgently capturing the main force of the Communist army, and the main hope is to restore the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway, then if the third plan described above is followed, it should not exceed three months. The disaster of the Jiaoji Railway, on the contrary, will probably deepen with the intensification of the Southern Shandong Campaign. Therefore, Jinan's land-based contact with the outside world may be cut off at any time, but this only shows that it may become an isolated city, but it will never become a second Changchun. Commander Wang Yaowu, who bears this heaviest burden, is using his highest wisdom, greatest efforts, and deepest perseverance to cope with the current situation with this most limited force.

### France: Increased Production Plan

— Marseilles, April 4th Airmail — Special Correspondent Hong Fu

Since the end of the Second World War, various countries, recognizing the needs of the times, have been determined to increase production efficiency. The Russian Five-Year Plan is one such example. Jean Monnet, Chairman of the French Modernization Production Committee, recently announced a grand plan for reforming production methods, requiring seven or eight years of effort to achieve self-reliance. The economic life of a country is no different from that of a family or an individual. Before the war, France was like a wealthy household, able to live comfortably by investing abroad. At that time, all French production enterprises could rely on profits from foreign deposits to cope. Now, war debts are piled up, and French funds deposited abroad must be used to offset wartime military expenditures obtained from foreign countries. Like a family or an individual, from rich to poor, with nothing to rely on, only work can ensure survival. Only by relying on domestic efforts to produce can surplus be obtained and used for production enterprises. This is the reason why French production must be rapidly increased.

The work efficiency of both French industry and agriculture has always been lower than that of other countries. Before the war, the productivity of a French worker was only one-third that of a well-trained and well-nourished American worker, and only two-thirds that of a British worker. Moreover, since the outbreak of the World War, one-third of France's total production capacity has been stagnant. Now, the implementation of a new work plan will not only replace old tools with new ones, but also adopt the most refined new methods. The primary goal of this plan is to quickly rebuild the areas destroyed during the war, and more importantly, to greatly increase production levels compared to pre-war levels.

Heavy industry occupies a particularly important position in the plan to reform production. A country without heavy industry can never rely on its own military equipment to maintain long-term security. The burden of military equipment should not be too high, but production capacity must be increased in a timely manner. In today's world, if heavy industry does not advance rapidly, it will inevitably decline quickly. If it is not modernized, it will inevitably collapse. According to the schedule predetermined by the Monnet Plan, heavy industries such as coal, electricity, steel, pig iron, trains, freight cars, and shipyards in France must reach the level of production in 1938 by the end of 1947. Subsequently, in the first half of 1948, it must rise to the highest point reached in 1929, which is 25% higher than the level of 1938. By 1950, it must be 25% higher than the peak period of 1929. It is predicted that France must produce 475,000 cars in 1950. The required gasoline will be a huge amount. At the same time, it is also necessary to establish a fleet of oil tanker vessels traveling to and from the sea, and to lay oil pipelines from Le Havre port in the north to Paris in the south. Other agricultural production will also be ordered to increase dramatically. The methods of increasing agricultural production are roughly as follows:

Looking at the above table, the areas for wheat, white beets, and sugar beet fields are smaller than before, but they can have larger harvests than before. It is clear that the neglect of new farming methods cannot be ignored when increasing agricultural production. In China, agricultural affairs are waiting to be developed, and water conservancy is particularly urgent. The plan for sufficient clothing and food must first be preceded by enriching agriculture and preventing floods. The good practices of advanced countries are available and there are many that can be learned from.

France was originally good at self-sufficiency. Now that the country has gone from rich to poor, the people must work hard to make a living. It is estimated that by the end of 1947, 480,000 workers will be needed for France to carry out this plan. In the three years that follow, 220,000 workers should be added, plus 500,000 prisoners of war who have not been sent out of France. The total of these three items is that by 1950, 1.2 million people will have to be employed. Once this plan is implemented, the labor market throughout France must be strictly controlled, and no one without a specific job is allowed to engage in other private businesses to avoid working. If the number of people is still insufficient, female workers must be added. At the same time, foreign immigrants residing in France must also be recruited. This refers to a 48-hour week system. If a new system is adopted, changing to a 44-hour week, it is said that another 500,000 workers will need to be found to be sufficient. What France now needs to import from foreign countries, in addition to indispensable daily necessities, are the machines and tools used to increase production. It is estimated that the cost of changing and deploying this new industry in the four years from 1947 to 1950 will be 3 trillion francs. This is equal to the total annual revenue of the current French government. This can be raised gradually in the next four years. But if new methods are indeed used to increase production, the national tourism revenue in 1950 can be increased to 3.7 trillion francs. The estimated investments in various sectors are listed below: Attached to this committee are small committees in 18 departments, which are responsible for researching various specialized issues and submitting their findings to the general meeting for approval and implementation. With a clear outline and detailed items, everything is in order. The investment amounts estimated in the table above require that the currency and commodity prices be stable at a certain level without fluctuations. There must also be no communist elements causing strikes and other disputes in the middle, so that progress can be made step by step and day by day. Happiness and suffering in the world are often cyclical. When a country is poor, the people must use their labor to fulfill their obligations as a citizen. The temperament of the French people is like that of the Chinese. When faced with great difficulties, there are always brave generals and resourceful advisors. Sometimes, it may still not be possible to be completely confident of victory. The problem lies in the difficulty of uniting the people's hearts.

Questioning the Fee for Repairing Water Pipes

Editor:

I live at No. 125, Chongde Road, in this city. Starting on the 12th of this month, all residents in this lane felt that the water supply was not smooth, and on the 14th, it was completely cut off. Later, it was learned that workers were digging in the road to repair the main water pipe, which had rotted and cracked. After the work was completed on the 15th, there was still no water. Suddenly, someone went door-to-door saying that an agreement had been reached with the water company that the lane should pay over 1.2 million national currency, with each household paying over 40,000 yuan. They also said that if payment was delayed, the water supply would be cut off. After my family paid, we only received a private receipt. I wonder if the cost of repairing the main water pipe in the road by the company should be borne by nearby users. If there is such a rule, the company should directly send personnel to issue receipts for collection. Why do we need to pay first and then get water? This inevitably opens the door for petty criminals to extort money. I would like to ask the French-owned Water and Electricity Company to investigate and announce the facts to dispel public doubts. (Acheng, Chongde Road)

A Suggestion to Reduce Tram Congestion Editor:

The population of Shanghai has increased compared to before the war, but the number of trams in the city has not increased. Therefore, passengers are very crowded at each stop. I believe that if the front door of the existing trams is used exclusively for passengers to board, and the rear door is used exclusively for passengers to disembark, this would reduce the degree of congestion and save time at each stop. As for the towed cars, because the door width is already wider and can accommodate two people boarding or disembarking side by side, they can remain the same. At a time when the number of trams cannot be increased, this method is easy to implement. I hope that the relevant authorities will order the British and French tram companies to try it out. (Wang Shengsong)

### Lack of Railway Locomotives and Cars: Northeastern Transportation Urgently Needs to Be Restored — Shenyang, 12th Airmail

— Special Correspondent Zhao Zhan in Shenyang

Last winter, due to coal shortages and severe cold, the railway transportation in the Northeast was almost frozen. Now that spring is approaching, the question of whether there is hope for improvement in transportation is of concern to the public. The coal problem seems to be less serious than in winter, but because the output is insufficient, it is not without problems. The biggest problem is the severe shortage of railway locomotives and cars. The current quantity is less than one-tenth of what it was before the restoration.

Before the restoration, there were originally 4,000 locomotives on the railways in Northeast China, but now there are only 300 left. There were originally 5,000 passenger cars, but now there are only over 250 left. There were originally 40,000 freight cars, but now there are only over 5,000 left, and only 3,000 are usable. Most of the existing locomotives are dilapidated and have very low operating efficiency.

According to people in the transportation industry, because the Northeast Railway suffered the greatest losses, coupled with constant sabotage by the Communist army, it will not be easy to restore the previous transportation capacity. It seems that it cannot be done in three to five years. According to the Railway Bureau's announcement, as of now, the national railways in the Northeast region that have been taken over by the National Army total 4,274 kilometers, of which 3,249 kilometers have been repaired and opened to traffic. The Northeast Railway originally had over 11,000 kilometers, but currently, only slightly more than one-third of what it was before the restoration is open to traffic.

Regarding the solution to the shortage of locomotives and cars, it has recently been heard that the Executive Yuan has agreed to allocate 50 locomotives and 800 cars. However, there is no definite date for when they will arrive. If this batch of locomotives arrives, it will be a small supplement to transportation, because the need to restore freight transportation is urgent, and the severity of the transportation problem is therefore increasing.

### Rising Wind in Guangzhou: Chaotic Situation Tends to Stabilize Under Emergency Economic Measures

— Guangzhou, 12th Airmail — Special Correspondent Liang Feng

In the past few days, as gold and foreign currencies have been galloping like unbridled wild horses, grain prices have also been rising along with the minute hand on the clock, and other commodity prices have also been increasing step by step. This "rise, rise!" sound wave has been pressing on the million-plus citizens of Guangzhou almost to the point of suffocation. They seem to be drifting in a small boat on the vast sea, and if they encounter a ruthless storm, they don't know where the shore is! Indeed, a terrifying atmosphere is now enveloping the entire city. The citizens are watching the crazy jumps of commodity prices, and they are all trembling with fear. People walking on the streets have pale faces with panicked expressions. Everywhere you can hear cries of mutual suffering. This chaotic situation is indeed an unprecedented phenomenon since Guangzhou's restoration.

The Thirteenth Hong, as the financial market of Guangzhou, seems to have become the place that determines the fate of over a million citizens. These days, it has been unprecedentedly tense and lively, with crowds of people all day long, squeezing back and forth. Even people who are usually not interested in financial ups and downs have gone there these days to listen to the news and see the market trends, because the dynamics of this market will directly affect everyone's life! Therefore, the eyes of all the citizens of the city are involuntarily focused on Thirteenth Hong Road. However, the more people pay attention to this financial market, the more restless people become when they see the crazy rise of gold and foreign currencies. Commercial firms with some funds have rushed to buy gold and foreign currencies to store, and even ordinary people would never keep the national currency that is depreciating minute by minute! So they rush to buy! buy! The gold and foreign currencies in the entire Thirteenth Hong have been snapped up, and coupled with the fact that some speculators are fanning the flames, buying in large quantities but not releasing, how could there not be a crazy rise? Let's first look at the prices last week: the highest gold price was no more than 540,000, and the Hong Kong dollar was only 1,500. But on February 11, the gold price rose to 1.4 million, and the Hong Kong dollar reached a maximum of 3,500. In just one week, the rise reached over 130 percent! Especially on February 10 and 11, the price of gold and foreign currencies jumped by more than 100,000 yuan every day. At the same time, grain prices were also pulled up, and the speed of progress was even faster. From 50,000 per unit, it rose sharply to a maximum of 280,000, and the rice shop owners were not very willing to sell. Other daily necessities, of course, followed suit. How could people not tremble in such a drastically changing chaotic state?

In the midst of financial excitement and crazy commodity price increases, Guangzhou's industry and commerce suffered the greatest blow, and most of them were close to a standstill. Because finance is changing rapidly and cannot be grasped, it is difficult for all industries to buy and sell. Should they keep the goods in stock? They lack the funds to circulate. Should they sell the goods? Holding the national currency will depreciate. Therefore, there have been very few transactions of various goods in the past week. And those related to industrial properties have suffered even more. Because the prices of various industrial raw materials have soared, the cost of finished products has naturally increased. After the factory manufactures sell their products, they often cannot make up for the value of the raw materials. In addition, there are several industries where workers are also demanding wage increases. On the workers' side, it cannot be said to be unreasonable to demand wage increases due to the impact of rising living costs, but most of the factories are really unable to bear it. Under such circumstances, they can only close down! Just to say that in this city's rubber factory, more than 30 have gone bankrupt so far, accounting for one-third of the city's rubber factories. Other industries are also preparing to close down. If there is no turning point in the short term, the future of Guangzhou's industry and commerce is feared to be even more unimaginable!

Not long ago, after the adjustment and reform of Guangzhou's public buses, they were completely renewed, which was convenient for the citizens. This was good news. However, the situation has been different in the past few days! The city's public buses have gone from partial suspension to almost complete suspension! The reason, needless to say, is also due to financial fluctuations.

In addition to industry and commerce, Guangzhou's cultural undertakings are also facing bankruptcy due to the impact of this round of crazy commodity price increases! Let's start with the newspaper industry! Since the announcement of restrictions on the import of foreign paper and the increase in foreign paper taxes, the price of foreign paper has soared, and with the soaring foreign currencies, the price of foreign paper has risen even more fiercely. In less than half a month, white newspaper paper rose from over 30,000 yuan per ream (500 large sheets) to 200,000 yuan, a difference of more than six times! At the same time, printing technicians also demanded a wage increase of over 100 percent at this time, followed by the increase in rice prices and other materials. However, the price of newspapers cannot be increased as quickly as other items. Advertising fees are too high when industry and commerce are facing difficulties. Now, the "Da Guang," "Yue Hua," "Guo Hua," "Shang Bao," and other newspapers that publish two sheets are priced at 500 yuan per copy, and the rest that publish one and a half sheets are also sold for 400 yuan. But the newspaper price still cannot catch up with other commodity prices, which makes the people in charge of the newspapers feel unable to support it! Recently, the "Da Hua Daily," "Tian Xing News," and "English New News" have already stopped publishing. I am afraid that several more will not be able to hold out within this week! Other industries such as bookstores and printing industries have also been almost completely suspended due to the excessively high prices of paper, rice, and wages! Even schools! During this spring season, many old students in schools at all levels have stopped attending, and very few new students have applied for admission. This is certainly because the tuition fees of private schools are too high, but the main reason is probably that people's lives are too difficult! Therefore, in general, the future of Guangzhou's cultural undertakings is truly a dark shadow!

In short, in the past few days in Guangzhou, the financial situation has been unprecedentedly turbulent, industry and commerce have been crushed, cultural undertakings are on the verge of danger, people are extremely panic-stricken, and crises are lurking everywhere in society. These are undeniable facts. Are we just going to let it develop like this? The question lies in the measures and strength of the authorities. We all know that this round of commodity price increases is due to financial fluctuations, and a part of the financial fluctuations is affected by fluctuations in other places, but the intentional stirring up trouble by local financial speculators to make people discriminate against the national currency is also a major reason. Therefore, as long as the authorities can exert their strength to stop the activities of these speculators and stabilize the financial situation, all problems can be solved. Let's see: since the provincial government issued emergency measures yesterday (11th), ordering a complete stop to the buying and selling of foreign currencies and gold, prohibiting the issuance and circulation of promissory notes and silver receipts issued by all money and silver shops, and prohibiting the export of gold and silver, all buying and selling transactions and contracts must not use gold and foreign currencies as the standard, and stipulating various severe penalties. At the same time, regarding the food supply: the headquarters and the provincial government have also consulted and decided on emergency measures for food supply: (1) Retail rice merchants in Guangzhou are ordered to sell grain at the stated price, and violators will be severely punished; (2) Negotiated pricing will be implemented in the Guangzhou rice market to supply retail merchants; (3) Negotiated pricing will be implemented at the Guangzhou grain customs to supply rice merchants and wholesalers; (4) It is stipulated that each county must transport a large amount of grain to Guangzhou for sale. These orders have had a great response as soon as they were issued. The price of gold immediately fell, the Hong Kong dollar also fell back, and grain prices also dropped. This all shows the strength of the authorities. However, although the prices of gold, foreign currencies, and grain have fallen, they are still more than double what they were before this round of price increases. Therefore, the people's lives are still difficult to relieve, and society has not yet returned to a state of stability. This is of course to be hoped for with greater efforts from the authorities!

### Yangtze River Basin Agricultural Irrigation (Part 1)

— Sun Fu Shi

For farmlands located in valleys and sloping terrains, the water source comes from natural rivers (supplemented by ponds when necessary). Due to the steeper slopes, water can be directed into the fields. There are two methods:

(1) Weirs and Canals

This method involves constructing a weir to dam the river, diverting a portion or all of the river's water into canals that lead to the fields. The Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which diverts water from the Min River to irrigate the Chengdu Plain, is a prime example of this method. The Hanzhong irrigation area in the upper reaches of the Han River and its tributaries is second in importance. This method is also widely used in the areas of southern Hunan and Jiangxi, as well as southern Anhui and western Zhejiang.

(2) Dragon Spine Water Lift (Treadwheel Pumps)

This method involves building a weir to raise the water level. A waterway is left along the riverbank, where a dragon spine water lift (treadwheel pump) is installed. The impact of the water flow drives the wheel, lifting water for irrigation. This is most suitable for farmlands along rapid streams that are not extensive.

The dragon spine water lift is made with a bamboo wheel ranging from six to twenty-one feet in diameter, depending on the height to which the water needs to be raised. The wheel is fitted with vanes and dozens of bamboo tubes around its circumference, each tube holding approximately half to three-quarters of a liter of water. The wheel's vanes are pushed by the water, causing it to rotate. The tubes on the rotating wheel scoop up water and lift it upwards. At the highest point, the water is discharged into a wooden trough, which then flows into the fields. Its structure is extremely simple, mainly using bamboo and wood, without any metal parts.

Dragon spine water lifts are very common in Sichuan, Guizhou, northern Guangxi, western Hunan, southern Shaanxi.

(3) Pond Fields

Ponds are about one mu in size (approximately 667 square meters) and two to three meters deep, storing water from mountain streams. Because seepage is minimal, water is easily conserved. Larger ponds can irrigate twenty to thirty mu of land, while smaller ones irrigate only a few mu. In the areas of Ankang and Hanyin, pond fields are abundant. From a distance, the glistening water connects with the sky, and the land is filled with ponds.

The Hanzhong irrigation area is the best representation of valley and sloping farmland irrigation in the Yangtze River basin. Separated by the Qinling Mountains, it avoids the cold and drought of the Yellow River basin. The soil is sticky and black, with low permeability. All these conditions are similar to those in the Sichuan Basin, with paddy fields throughout the region. The irrigation methods are mainly weirs and canals, supplemented by dragon spine water lifts and ponds. However, rainfall is relatively low, around 600 millimeters annually, with more than 50% occurring in summer. The water from the Han River itself is rarely used for irrigation. The benefits of irrigation come entirely from its tributaries. The most important are: the Yangjia River in Mian County; the Lian River, Bao River, and Leng River in Baocheng and Nanzheng; the Xu River in Chenggu and Yangxian; the Dang River, Mabu River, You River, and Jin River in Yangxian; the Muma River, Xiaoxia River, Faxi River, Fadong River, and Fengqu River in Xixiang; the Chi River in Shiquan; the Yue River and its tributaries in Hanyin; the Heng River and Huangyang River in Ankang; and the Ba River in Xunyang. The situation is as shown in the following table:

Yangjia River  Yangjia River Various Weirs  Total 6,000

Total  208,860 Mu

The above table lists the larger weirs. Other smaller weirs are not included. The total is about 300,000 mu, together with pond fields, it should be around 400,000 mu. Among the rivers, the weirs of the Bao River are the most uniform and organized. The Shanhe Weir outside the east gate of Baocheng is the largest in Hanzhong, rumored to have been built by Xiao He and Cao Shen of the Han Dynasty.

Second to the Shanhe Weir is the Xu River weirs, but their construction is many times more difficult, and the annual cost of repairing the weirs is considerable.

In the mountainous areas of Hanzhong, people build small, level plots in the valleys. If water can be diverted, rice is planted; if not, corn is planted. Therefore, the irrigated land is fragmented, but in aggregate, it is quite impressive. In Xunyang County, 3,600 to 3,700 mu are irrigated, mostly benefiting from the Xun River. In Zhen'an, over 3,000 mu are irrigated, mostly from the Xun River and Jinjing River, followed by the Qianyou River. In Liuba, less than 1,000 mu are irrigated, mostly from the Wuwen River and Zijin River. Feng County only has 300 mu of paddy fields, mostly irrigated by the An River. The Gudao River is flat and sandy and lacks irrigation benefits.

In order to maintain weir and canal projects, allocate irrigation water, and increase irrigated area, management is extremely important due to the large scale of the weirs and canals. During the Ming Dynasty, a Vice Prefect was established in the Yingzhong area, specializing in managing water conservancy in the twelve counties of Hanzhong, a system continued in the early Qing Dynasty. During the Jiaqing era, a Water Conservancy Office was established, managed by the Experience Secretary of Hanzhong Prefecture, with its scope changed to the four counties of Nanbaocheng and Yang. Since the Republic of China, each county government has been responsible, but in practice, the people manage it themselves. If there are disputes, the county government temporarily sends personnel to investigate and handle them. Most of these officials are inexperienced and have no specific responsibilities, resulting in uneven water allocation, damaged inlets, silted canals, incomplete embankments, and poorly maintained weirs. The situation is quite appalling. In 1934, the Shaanxi Provincial Government established the Southern Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau in Nanzheng to manage the weirs in the seven counties of Nan, Bao, Mian, Cheng, Yang, Xi, and Liu.

The new-style weir and canal projects created in the Southern Shaanxi region include the Han-Hui, Bao-Hui, and Xu-Hui canals. The following describes them in general terms:

The Han-Hui Canal diverts water from the Han River at Gaojiaquan in Mian County to irrigate 110,000 mu of land in the three counties of Mian County, Baocheng, and Nanzheng. The design began in 1924 but was halted due to turmoil. Redesign and construction resumed in 1938, with an estimated cost of over 710,000 yuan. Due to the difficulty of procuring and transporting materials and the continuous lack of funds, the project progressed slowly. After repeated additions, the total cost reached 1.9 million yuan, and it was completed in May 1941. The farmland in the area benefited greatly, and the farmers were all overjoyed.

The Bao-Hui Canal diverts water from the Heilongjiang River outside Baocheng to irrigate 150,000 mu of land in Baocheng, Nanzheng, and other counties. Surveying and design began in the spring of 1939, and construction began in September of the same year. However, due to the war, funds, workers, and materials were all in short supply, delaying the project. It was not completed until 1942, adding much beauty to the rivers and mountains of Southern Shaanxi.

The Xu-Hui Canal diverts water from the Xu River in Chenggu to irrigate 150,000 mu of farmland in Chenggu County. Surveying and design were also completed early in 1939. Due to the lack of manpower and financial resources, construction did not begin immediately. After the Han-Hui Canal released water in 1941 and the results were remarkable, the farmers' faith grew stronger. Local gentry jointly requested that construction begin as soon as possible, and local authorities also repeatedly urged them to start work in September of that year. However, progress has been slow. Most of the project has now been completed, and water has been partially released. The entire project should be completed this year.

### Please Government, Save the Publishing Industry

— Weiyan

The publishing industry in China is currently facing a very serious crisis. Due to the rising cost of living, typesetting has risen to 14,000 yuan per thousand characters, and the increase in the price of foreign exchange has pushed the price of newsprint to 120,000-130,000 yuan per ream. Several news newspapers in Shanghai have already suspended publication. The prices of bookstore publications have increased to 1,400 times the original listed price. Now that the government has taken emergency economic measures, who knows what the publishing industry will become in the future?

Originally, in a country like China where the people's livelihood is declining and production is backward, there is not enough time to focus on production and construction. How can we take care of the cultural cause? The need for material is still hundreds of thousands of miles away, and spiritual food will inevitably die! However, our country is a civilized country. On the one hand, we must consolidate the basic level of people's lives in the economic and political fields. At the same time, on the other hand, we must also establish education and cultural undertakings to the spiritual construction of the upper class.

On the twelfth of this month, Minister Wang Yunwu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs made a statement saying, "The British currently have strict control over the publication of newspapers and books, and they must be approved by the government before they can be published. At present, China's newspapers compete to expand their coverage, and various yellow books and newspapers are not necessary for publication, so there are measures to restrict paper." After reading it, we feel very doubtful. First, we don't know whether China's publishing industry is as developed as Britain's? Second, we don't know whether a country with a low level of education and culture like China does not need to encourage people to read newspapers and books? Third, is the expansion of newspaper competition a bad phenomenon that the government must restrict? Fourth, can restricting paper restrict unnecessary publications of yellow publications?

We believe that at this time, the government should no longer restrict legitimate publishing businesses. On the contrary, it should encourage it and actively help it. The way to encourage and help is to ask the government to release enough loans to legitimate publishers that are easy to use. In fundamental aspects, it is still as Minister Wang said, developing the paper industry in Thailand. The need for the government to actively assist with how to effectively develop the paper industry. In short, the publishing industry has reached a point where it cannot support itself by relying solely on its own operations. It desperately hopes for government assistance!

### New Trends in Mass Education

— Luo Gengsheng

Written by Gu Mei Published by Zhonghua Book Company

If you are someone who cares about China's future, or a young person who is preparing to lead the masses, you may want to read this "New Trends in Mass Education."

The rise of mass education is motivated by saving China. Look at the large number of illiterates in our country, which has hindered the progress of our country; to create a democratic China, to awaken the masses, we must first make the masses literate, knowledgeable, and organized; and the current schools cannot universally teach the general working class, so the rise of mass education is inevitable! The importance of mass education and the tasks and goals of mass education are explained in detail in this book.

Secondly, the author pointed out that if you want to actually do a little mass education, then you must have sufficient funds and talent. Because the success of every cause, the main factor is the combination of planning, funding, and talent, it is best to add the power of administration, the effectiveness can be greater, and the speed will definitely be faster. These administrative organizations of mass education, the source of talent, and the source of social education funds are all discussed one by one.

In fact, mass education can also be a kind of educational transformation, and it needs to be truly implemented. It is useless to just talk about theory! To summarize all the mass education institutions, according to its teaching methods, it can be divided into three categories:

(1) Mass Literacy Education: such as mass schools, vocational supplementary schools, etc., it is to give out-of-school masses, supplementary basic education, shallow learners expand their cultural wealth, and more skills and vocational guidance.

(2) Comprehensive Mass Education; the institutions that use this teaching method include mass education centers, mass education districts, mobile teaching, etc. Because these educational institutions implement a variety of education at the same time, such as mass education centers, in addition to teaching the masses to work, there are also art livelihood and other educational facilities.

(3) Separate Mass Education; this Shi Jiao Jiao divides various mass education separately and teaches only one kind. For example, the hip education center only implements health education, and the science museum only implements mass science education.

With the development of science and the needs of facts, mass education has several new developments:

(1) In order to reduce the consumption of the masses and increase the income of the masses, various cooperatives have been established. The establishment of cooperatives can improve the lives of the masses, and stable livelihoods can enable them to settle down and study, so the cooperative business has a great indirect help to mass education.

(2) Hygiene Education and Health Education: The bodies of the masses in our country are mostly weak, they do not pay attention to hygiene, and they do not know how to treat illnesses. To make the people strong, hygiene and health education are also very important implementations.

(3) Self-Defense Training and Civic Training: The passive aspect is self-defense, and the active aspect is autonomy and construction, which is also organizing the masses.

(4) Film and Broadcasting Education (Electrochemical Education): Film and broadcasting have a great power to influence the masses and are what the education authorities are actively promoting.

Other things such as drama, singing, family education, and childcare, etc., were rarely noticed before, but now they have become new facilities for mass education.

The tide of democracy is surging, democratic countries are being built, and China's mass education is cooperating with the needs of this era, moving towards improving national culture, stabilizing people's livelihood, and promoting civil rights!

### Introducing Student Geography Outline Maps to Geography Teachers

— Youyun

Compiled by the China History and Geography Chart Compilation Society Published by the Ya Bu Yu Geography Society

The joke in a certain university's geography exam paper that a certain student answered that Shenyang is the provincial capital of Shandong can just reflect how general people's geographical knowledge is today! Therefore, I would like to introduce the China Geography and World Geography Outline Maps recently published by Yaguang Cartographic Society.

An outline map is a map with terrain and symbols but no place names, and the printing is mostly relatively simple. Its function is specifically to give students practice filling in place names, and some people also use it to fill in maps for studying various sciences. Because the price is lower than ordinary maps, all schools and individuals interested in geography are happy to use it. Take it as an exercise to train and memorize place names, and it is indeed of great help in increasing geographical knowledge. However, good outline maps are rare in our country, and they have almost disappeared after the war. Ordinary geography-oriented schools use mimeographing to print their own, but this method is time-consuming, and the content is mostly simple and inaccurate, making it difficult to please.

The China and World Geography Outline Maps published by Da China Bookstore are each 16 pages in size, and their binding and design are exactly the same. Each contains 30 maps, and the content is quite new. All national borders that have been changed after World War II and newly established domestic transportation lines have been collected and included. The notable features are as follows: 1. Provincial and national borders are specially grouped to compensate for the lack of monochrome printing and make the scope still significant. 2. The water surface is indicated by water lines, making the land and sea eye-catching. 3. The drawing is accurate and clear, adding to the reader's pleasure. 4. The printing and paper are better than any previous outline map. However, the proportions of each map are not uniform, which makes it slightly difficult for scholars to compare. The selling price of the map is already very popular, and almost everyone can buy it, but printing a blank paper version to allow scholars to practice multiple times at a lower price seems even more necessary.

To strengthen your geographical foundation, it is best to use outline maps for practice more often.

### After Reading "Plum Villa Collection"

— Shi Chongpeng

Written by Wang Ciqing Published by Zhonghua Book Company in Song-style Type

Although Mr. Wang Ciqing of Liangxi grew up in a family of nobility, he was free from vulgarity and loved literature and art, and was straightforward and fluent, with a unique and indifferent demeanor. Mr. Tang Weizhi, a national scholar, called him a natural pastoral poet and writer, which can echo the poems and writings of Tao Yuanming of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. After reading Mr. Wang's poems, everyone praised him as a wise man. Recently, Zhonghua Book Company has sorted out all of his poems, lyrics, and manuscripts into the Plum Villa Collection, which is published in Song-style text, which will undoubtedly give people who love the quintessence of the country a beautiful spiritual food. The whole book is divided into three volumes. The first volume is the Apricot Rain Building Poetry Collection, in which the five-ancient and seven-ancient poems are very elegant, and the mind and spirit are no different from the rippling spring breeze and the horizontal autumn water.

"The meeting of minds is outside of things, the heart is willing to farm and fish, the crowns and carriages are not what is honored, and Ji Ying is in the same tone."

"Glory and profit are not in harmony with wishes, and the heart is willing to be indifferent, avoiding the world and obtaining nourishment, raising oneself to the clouds and cranes."

Looking at these poems, one is detached from the world, and the verses "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains" of Tao Yuanming, can reflect each other in ancient and modern times. The second volume, the Pear Cloud Hall Lyrics Collection, has questions about Moon Pavilion and Yellow Crane Tower, which are magnificent and have the spirit of Xin Jiaxuan and Su Zizhan. The third volume is the Leisure Garden Text Archive, which are all works of visiting and writing scenery. Whether it is high mountains, wilderness, plank bridges, or flowing water, they are mostly included in small and short pieces, which can be compared with Liu Zihou's Yongzhou Eight Records. Among them, there are also impassioned poems and essays that are worried about the world and the times. Mr. Yang Zhongyu commented that it is Yue Wumu's White Hair Yin and Wen Wen Mountain's Righteous Qi Song, which is not a private word. Mr. Gu Yiqiao collected a lot of historical materials in the postscript of the Plum Villa Collection to introduce the author's life experience, with a source and a source, and everything is in order. As for the elegance of the writing and the thoroughness of the argumentation, it is like the family essays of Shi Han, which is even more Add to the reader's interest.

### Publishing News

The World Semimonthly, sponsored by Mr. Li Shizeng, has recently been changed to a monthly publication. The content of the sixth issue of the journal includes Li Shizeng's "Taiwan View of the World and China," Shen Jingzhi's "US Aid to China Policy," Xu Kaishu's "On the Central System in the Constitution," and Li Wen's "The Ups and Downs of the Gold Rush," etc. It is said that the content is excellent and the sales are very wide.

### Reading "Tess of the d'Urbervilles"

— Peng Xingcai

Originally written by Thomas Hardy (England), translated by Lu Tianshi, published by Zhengfeng Publishing House

The British novelist Thomas Hardy is not an unfamiliar name to Chinese readers. Ten years ago, I read his "The Return of the Native" and "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" (i.e., "Tess of the d'Urbervilles"). I was captivated by the subtle and poetic descriptions, and I always felt an irreparable regret for Tess's unfortunate experiences!

Recently, I reopened Lu Tianshi's translation and managed to finish it amidst my busy schedule. When I closed the book and shut my eyes, the images and the tragic, bloody impressions constantly disturbed my peace. My heart felt inexplicably heavy, and I suppressed a sigh about to escape my lips, feeling that the author was unfair to Tess.

The author arranged for Tess a fate from which she could not escape. She struggled, she cried out! But she could not escape the tragic outcome, like Oedipus in a Greek tragedy. You may run, but the god of fate is waiting for you.

What crime did a pure and innocent child commit? Her "mistake" was not of her own making. Why should the sins of others be placed upon her? She possessed compassion and conscience, tenderness and passion. "She couldn't bear to hurt a fly or a small worm, and even shed tears for a bird in a cage." She was so unfortunate. She could endure Clare's abandonment, but she could not bear Alec's relentless temptation and pursuit. Clare was too harsh on her. Even a small lamb would get angry. She was hoarsely crying out for justice!

She could not bear the disappointment Clare caused her, nor could she bear to watch her widowed mother and younger siblings starve to death. Only then did she agree to cohabitate with Alec. If this can be called a weakness of her will, then Hardy had already said that she grew up in an environment of weak willpower. The author seemed to consider those erratic deeds as a natural development. Why should the inherited social predispositions, as well as the sins committed by her ancestors in armor during the reign of King Stephen, be repaid on her? Why did the tragedy of the D'Urberville family’s carriages have to replay on Tess?

According to the author's explanation, it seems that there is a certain fate in life, and naturally there is a master in the dark, which human beings cannot resist. After Tess was arrested, the author said, "Justice is revealed" and "the playfulness of the god of all things has also ceased."

The author is too pessimistic and believes in fate too much. Why not encourage readers to actively pursue "life"? Why insist on saying "I want to be" not born—earth on that side or elsewhere." "This living pain is serious."

If the author had not based Tess's unfortunate experiences on the control of fate, but rather on the problems of the social system, especially emphasizing that in the society at the time, a girl who made a mistake not of her own doing was not tolerated; the neighbors' spurning, the social exclusion, and the moral demands, if that were the case, then Tess's tragedy would be a social problem, not just Tess's personal problem, but the tragedy of more and more people in the world suffering the same misfortune as Tess.

In addition, in the depiction of characters and scenery, as well as the rigor of the structure and the meticulousness of the layout, it is unmatched by the novelists of the time. As the translator said in the preface, "Hardy's novel is like a complete organic object. Each part of the content, such as the layout, dialogue, characters, and scenery, is properly arranged, like a great building with balanced parts." This is indeed true. In the fatalism he created, for those impossible things and the stiff "coincidences," he had arranged a necessary reason in advance to make the development of the story more natural.

For example, when Tess was working at the farm, she went to Chaseborough alone one Saturday evening to have some fun (which was a trend at the time, and she had been there several times). She thought she could meet a companion on the street to accompany her back, but she happened to meet Alec. He volunteered to be her companion, but she refused, preferring to patiently wait for the crazed people to finish their dances before returning home together. Unfortunately, on the way, she had an argument with "Queen of Spades" because Tess said something hurtful to the crowd, and she was attacked by all of her companions. She was lonely and scolded, ridiculed, and teased. At this moment, Alec arrived on horseback and said, "Jump on! Sit behind me, and we can leave this group of screaming women immediately."

She felt a great sense of immediate danger. If it had been at another time, she would have definitely rejected him. But just at this moment of crisis, he invited her onto the horse, and with a simple movement, she could eliminate her fear and hatred of these enemies. So, she jumped onto the saddle without hesitation. By the time those combative, lecherous people realized it, they had already ridden far into the gray mist.

Under these circumstances, her loss of virtue seemed inevitable, not at all forced. An impossible thing was arranged very reasonably in Hardy's pen.

The scenery described by Hardy has the same value as the characters he portrays. The scenery in "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" is not only a decorative background but also a backdrop for a tragic or joyful atmosphere. Flowers, trees, wind, rain, and dusk all have their own characteristics, and these characteristics can affect the changes in the characters' psychology. "On that starry night, a great wind suddenly rose, and Tess felt that this wind was the sigh of an extremely tragic person."

When Tess narrated the story of her loss of virtue, "Everything in the room seemed to change color for her, the ashes in the grate showed a sinister and very strange look, as if they didn't care about her difficulties at all, the damper leisurely put on a cold smile, as if it didn't care about her predicament, the water bottle was busy flashing, and the surrounding objects repeatedly declared that they had no responsibility, but since he kissed her, nothing had changed, it could even be said that the essence of everything had not changed, but the spirit of these things had changed."

Clare, after listening to her story, did not forgive her because of her soft and plaintive voice. He considered her a vulgar woman lacking spirituality and prepared to separate from her immediately. At this time, Hardy wrote: "He quietly walked out of the room. The two glasses of wine he poured while eating—one for Tess and one for himself—were still on the table untouched. This was the result of their 'love' meal; only two or three hours earlier, they had shared a cup of tea due to a moment of impulse."

Tess's happiness vanished with her story. Two hours earlier, Tess was still immersed in a sweet dream. Who knew that after two o'clock, everything seemed to be buried in the flowing water? These two glasses of wine were a powerful irony, with sarcasm and sympathy, allowing the reader to deeply appreciate Tess's pitiful situation.

In fact, in "Tess of the d'Urbervilles," we can see that the author's pessimistic thoughts are not due to hatred of people or being greatly stimulated and disappointed. He has sympathy for everything he describes in the universe. He loves birds and beasts, he loves injured pheasants, and even more so, he loves all of humanity. In his pen, they are all pitiful and worthy of sympathy characters: John Durbeyfield, Angel Clare, Marian, Tess, Liza-Lu, and even Alec. Hardy sympathizes with them and nurtures them with tears.

### Soliciting Pattern Drawings

— Jie Ding

A certain cosmetics company published the following advertisement in major newspapers:

"Our company has been selling a type of face cream for many years with a great reputation. Now, to promote business and improve decoration, we are offering a reward of 20 million yuan to solicit trademarks. The characteristics are as follows:

(1) Lasting fragrance
(2) Does not harm the skin
(3) …………

…………

Any patterns with artistic flair, eye-catching appeal, and helpful in promoting business are welcome to enter. Deadline is × month × day. After the deadline, experts will be hired to determine the rankings. The first place winner will receive 10 million yuan in national currency, the second place winners (2 winners) will receive 3 million yuan each, the third place winners (5 winners) will receive 1 million yuan each, and the fourth place winners (50 winners) will receive one dozen of our company's ×× face cream each……".

On the day of the deadline, thanks to the reputation of the company's brand and the wide sales of the face cream, there were indeed many applicants. A total of 2,993 entries were received. After the deadline, the judging naturally took place.

In the general manager's office, the general manager, the advertising department director, the designer, and the attendant standing aside formed a judging committee.

The advertising director tore open the letters one by one and took out the manuscripts inside.

The first piece was a woman composed of soft lines, wearing a veil over her head and body, holding a ball of flowers, with some curved artistic characters next to her, somewhat like those used on neon lights.

"Not good, not good," said the general manager.

The second piece was an oval face, half painted white and half still dark, with curly hair and a soft face without a single crease. A terribly long and thin hand was applying face cream on the face. The picture had two large red characters, square and hard.

"Even worse!"

The third piece was just a few small flowers, with branches and leaves forming a picture frame, and several "artistic" characters that no one could recognize, with an illegible signature like crab writing below.

"No stimulation, no stimulation." The general manager took a hard puff of his cigar, and the fragrant smoke he exhaled formed a cloud over many of the entry letters. The designer, however, stared at the three patterns. The tea server stared blankly with his mouth open.

The fourth piece was a red V in the middle, two golden characters, and many Roman-style crab writings next to it.

"Cliché!"

The fifth piece had a scarlet mouth……

"Somewhat interesting."

The sixth piece was just a slender hand holding a bottle of face cream……

……

A yellow-bottomed pattern was pulled out, depicting a woman emerging from the bath, with long curly hair draped over her body, and only a narrow strip of cloth around her waist. "Interesting, interesting," the general manager hurriedly grabbed it, slowly took a puff of his cigar, and the smoke floated lightly from his nostrils. His fat head swayed, and the wrinkles on the back of his neck became deeper.

"Not a single word is bad, but it's a bit too stiff. The words in the last flower picture are not bad, haha… This woman is drawn pretty well, look at the two breasts, this pose is simply excellent! The others simply don't understand art, and have no advertising value at all. This one is good, this one is good!"

"Let's change a few words on it," said the advertising director.

"No need to look at the others," said the general manager.

A few days later, a notice from a certain cosmetics company appeared in the newspaper again.

"...The solicitation of trademark patterns has been judged and is now announced as follows:

"First..."

The trademark of ×× Cream has been changed, but no one has claimed the prizes. The company itself has gained a huge profit, and the general manager has become even fatter. (February 13, copied)

### Arts and Culture Scene

— Yu Chang

The songs performed by the acting troupe at the public performance were very well received, especially the composer Shu Mo himself, who took to the stage to sing his masterpiece "Wang Xiaoer Spends the New Year" accompanied by gongs and drums. The lyrics were colloquial and the flavor was rich.

Hong Mo was in great distress because of Yingzi's serious illness and cried bitterly backstage at "Guanghua" a few days ago.

There are rumors that Lan Ma will go to Hong Kong to collaborate with Jiang Junchao on a film.

On the morning of the 14th, Wang Ping returned home from filming "Paradise Dream" at the Second China Film Studio. While the car was crossing the Waibaidu Bridge, the driver fell asleep in the car, causing the car to crash into a power pole. Wang Ping suffered minor injuries.

Zhou Xuan will return to Shanghai soon to make a film for "Cathay."

"Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," directed by Shi Dongshan of "Lianhua," is scheduled to be screened simultaneously at the "Empress," "Huguang," and "Carlton" theaters starting on the 21st.

More than 100 people from the film and theater industry attended the drama festival's Municipal Drama School's party. The school's students performed the comic opera "Wang Da Niang Mends the Pot" during the entertainment program, which was extremely wonderful.

At the Drama School party, Hong Shen, after being enthusiastically requested by the guests, took to the stage to perform a section of Peking Opera, singing a young male role in a high-pitched voice. Hong was still in high spirits, and the audience below the stage was already in fits of laughter.

Kaixuan Film Company recently plans to film a movie at the Second China Film Studio, and the director has been set as Ma Xuwibang.

Ling Wang Mei Guanfang, who currently resides at No. 121 Sinan Road (i.e., Massenet Road), is rumored to be moving. The person moving in is He Jian, the former chairman of Hunan Province.

More than a month has passed since Li Shifang's tragic death in a plane crash on January 5th. It is confirmed that the theater circles in Shanghai are planning to launch a charity performance to express their condolences to Li's family. The charity performance program includes "Two Entering the Palace" by Mei's sons Baojiu and Baoyue.

Once, the humorous master Mark Twain visited the studio of the great painter Whistler and carefully admired the paintings. Later, he wanted to touch a canvas with his hand. "Hey," Whistler said loudly, "Don't touch! It's not dry yet!"

"It's okay," Mark Twain replied, "I'm wearing gloves."

### The Moon Shakes the Layers of Mountains: 100,000 Tons of Garbage Accumulated in Shanghai, Not Yet Cleared.

— Hulu

The painting is wonderful and full of "Ash Heap", the objects are numerous and the strange smells hit the sky! Little Sanzi sings "Xiaochongshan", in the layers of mountains, crowded with living gods.

Nonsense about health environment, no mention of sexuality; 100,000 tons accumulated over the years, let it go, donate money for cleaning.

Note: "Ash Heap" is a type of painting in Chinese painting, collecting and depicting various broken and old miscellaneous objects. "Xiaochongshan" is the name of a Ci poetic meter. The original meter is a combination of "Xijiangyue" and "Xiaochongshan".

### A Collection of Storms

— Li Shui

The Social Affairs Bureau has approved the unauthorized price increase of Shanghai cinemas, which is exceptional. Although cinemas can be allowed to increase prices, the Social Affairs Bureau should impose severe penalties on cinemas for disregarding the law and taking action without approval.

American goods are soaring, and joint commercial venues are not only experiencing sluggish business but also have scarce inventory. Insiders say that American goods have increased by an average of three to four times.

The income of a salaried class will never suddenly increase by three or four times. It is only natural that there will be no market for American goods from now on.

The method of rationing physical goods should extend to cultural figures and journalists. Their lives are no better than those of public educators!

Cultural figures and journalists should object to the authorities' measures.

After Shanghai entered wartime control, one must also be careful of the "Black Whirlwind". The activity of various goods-smuggling gangs in the past two days shows that the "Black Whirlwind" has swept Shanghai.

### The Department Store Owner Said: What's Sold Can't Be Restocked - They're All Watching for Price Hikes!

— Zhang Wen

The department store in the alley was tidying up the storefront, one clerk was wiping the glass, and another was changing the price tags.

I decided to go inside. I was familiar with the big boss, he was calculating accounts, sucking on his pen, and using his abacus.

"Is it time to close up shop?" I asked him.

"Almost, the weather is cold and business is slow, so it's better to close up early." He greeted me with a smile, took out a Great Britain brand cigarette from the drawer to offer me. I often come here to chat, and the boss is very talkative.

The topic started with rice prices.

"You shopkeepers are better off than us, what are you afraid of if the tide rises?" I said.

"Hey, brother! You can't say that. We'd rather do more business and earn less profit. The cost of living is high, and those of us who run shops also have to eat. How can we not be affected?"

"That's just the usual talk from you businessmen, trying to defend yourselves!"

He got anxious and shouted, "Then take a look at our business these past few days!"

Business was indeed very slow. Besides me, there wasn't a single customer, and I was just here to chat, not intending to "patronize" anything. The fluorescent light was shivering from the cold, making the three-bay storefront look even more miserable. Looking at the employees' faces, the yellowish skin was shrouded in a layer of melancholy. Looking at them made me want to cry. They wouldn't be happy about the price increases, would they? They still have to smile when customers come, otherwise the boss will scold them: "You're fed, why do you still have to look so gloomy all day?"

I remember before welcoming the God of Wealth this year, my colleague Xiao Zhang was worried about being laid off and even came to me to test the waters. Later, he wasn't the one who was laid off, so he was relieved. How long has it been, and he's standing by the counter again, worried that the money he sends home isn't enough. The boss is muttering behind his back, "People are never satisfied."

To dilute the atmosphere, I changed the topic and casually asked about the prices of some daily necessities.

The boss excitedly told me that a pair of ordinary socks that you could wear now cost more than 7,000 yuan. At the end of last year, they only cost more than 3,000 yuan. Woolen undershirts and the like have limited price increases. At the end of last year, they cost 7,000 yuan, but now they're only 9,000.

"What has the most dramatic increase?"

"Like thermos bottles, last year they were only 16,000, but now they cost as much as 32,000 yuan, and there's not much money to be made. The most dramatic increase is soap. Last year, you could buy it for 800 yuan, but now it's risen to 2,000 yuan."

"You can make a fortune with this inventory of yours."

"Hey, what's sold can't be restocked, brother."

"Then keep it and don't sell it."

"What will we use to feed the employees?"

"Borrow money!"

"High-interest loans are unbearable."

The topic came back again, and I quickly avoided it and asked him the price of toothpaste and handkerchiefs.

"Handkerchiefs have increased fairly well, from 2,000 to 3,000. Samsung toothpaste sold for 800 yuan last year, and now it's two yuan. If you want to buy some, I'll give you a cheaper price."

"I don't want to buy any, I want to see the prices drop." I joked.

He smiled, "In the past, we looked forward to daybreak for a better life. Now, it seems like we don't know when the prices will drop."

I felt a little embarrassed and asked him how much business he had done today.

"Only 400,000 or 500,000. Have you seen many customers come in since you've been here?"

I thought about it, only two or three people, some of them just looked and left.

I also wanted to leave.

The boss politely said, "Anyway, there's no business, come and chat when you're free."

### Goodbye! Cost of Living Index!

— Shengjie

Every month, we employees who rely on the cost of living index stretch our necks and wait for the "good news" of the index.

Now, thank goodness, "life" no longer has an "index." We no longer need to care about the "index." We not only approve of this policy but also praise this virtuous act because we do not hope to have any cost of living index. The index represents prices. A high cost of living index means that prices continue to climb, right? Although we also hope for a high index, we do not hope for prices to rise! In other words, do we really hope for high prices? No, absolutely not! We are forced by high prices, and we have no choice but to hope for an "increase in the index" to compensate for life. Now that the "index" is "frozen" from now on, we believe that "prices" will also be "frozen" from now on, and will gradually decrease as a result. In this way, we common people can rest easy and have no worries in the future.

But, what if prices do not fall with the frozen index, but instead increase several times? We will always calculate our salaries based on the January index. How will we survive?

These past two days, besides the fall in the official exchange rate of gold and US dollars at the Central Bank, other things are still jumping blindly upwards. Of course, this may be a temporary state. In a few days, it will definitely get better. We will only suffer for a few days. We have been able to endure for eight years, so what does it matter to us for these few days?

Therefore, I say: Goodbye! Cost of living index, we no longer need you from now on.

Film Talk

### "Far Away Love"

— Wen Shu

It is undeniable that the working technology of Chinese films is low and impoverished. We strive for "exquisite" to the greatest extent possible with limited financial and material resources, but it is still rare. In order to save money, the bosses welcome some "artisan-type" directors when releasing films, who cater to their preferences and handle things casually. As a result, "moving comic strip pictures" are mass-produced and fill the market. "Far Away Love" took more than half a year to produce. Judging from the entire film, it has indeed undergone some deliberation and polishing. It has set a good example and is worthy of our praise.

The director's strengths are his meticulousness and caution, but he loses out to triviality. The editing of the material could also be more concise. Controlling the development of the entire play appears to be insufficient in the second half. In technical terms, it "lacks power". After Yu Zhen and Professor Xiao parted ways in Wuhan, the ensemble concentrated its efforts on expressing the working scene of Yu Zhen's other side, the "broad love". The more concrete development of the central event with Xiao Yu as the main engine was neglected, and a few short meetings were not enough.

As for the actors, I don't think Zhao Dan is satisfying. His "acting" is just "acting". There is a need for discussion on the character modeling, especially in the first part. Why decorate a university professor with some superficial things? Those American-style small movements are not something a scholar should have. I think it would be better if Zhao Dan "objectively denied his role". Tai Yi has achieved great success, not as rigid as before, but not pretentious either. She is simple and real, and her performance makes a clear contrast to Zhao Dan. Wu Yin's role is like the main seasoning in a dish. The progress of the story relies heavily on her, and she has indeed fulfilled this responsibility, but in expressing the identity of the elder sister, she seems to be able to be more subtle – I mean the acting method. Those hmm-hmm-ahh-ahh sounds and the old-fashioned expressions on her face are really not endearing. Tang Yuanzhi's role is somewhat nondescript, whether it is the director's handling or his own design, especially his laughter, which makes the audience feel terrified when it appears in such a scene.

These are all more demanding requirements. The director, workers, and actors have completed such an exquisite work under such poor material conditions, which can be called a valuable harvest for Chinese films. Those are just flaws in the jade.
