[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] General Chu Xichun spoke about the situation in Shanxi Province, saying: "This time, the Communist army has gathered tens of thousands of troops, vainly attempting to invade Taiyuan. The National troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting with them in the Shouyang and Pingding areas. The people of Taiyuan are calm and peaceful as usual. I firmly believe that the Shanxi National troops, under the command of Director Yan Xishan, will be able to defend the famous city and inflict a serious blow on the invading Communist army. The situation in northern Shanxi is also very stable. Since the National troops overcame Zuoyun and Youyu, although the Communist army has attempted to continue their attacks, they have ultimately been repelled by the National troops with the full assistance of the people. Datong is undergoing reconstruction amidst the ruins. The 2,000-kilowatt generator imported from abroad has arrived in Shanghai and will be transported to Shanxi soon. When the Communist army raided northern Shanxi last time, they destroyed the industrial equipment everywhere, especially the Pingwang Power Plant, which suffered the greatest losses. It is now actively planning to repair it. After the 2,000-kilowatt generator arrives, small-scale industries are expected to start operating. The people of Datong, who survived the disaster, originally had a very difficult life, but after the Sixth Work Team of the Executive Yuan Branch began its work, they have generally received relief and are now barely able to make ends meet."

### Allied Demands for Japanese Reparations Will Exceed One Trillion; Allied Headquarters Are Sorting Out Japanese Assets

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd, United Press] According to Brigadier General Tangxi, Director of the Property Management Office of the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan: "The Allied demands for reparations from Japan are currently being prepared, and the amount may exceed one trillion yuan. Japan is unable to pay this amount. Therefore, sorting out the reparations issue, the most important part of solving it, will include the distribution of many items, determining 'who gets what?'" Tang believes that decisions regarding the restoration of reparations goods to their original state and the payment of reparations claims should be made as soon as possible so that a peace treaty can be signed and Japan can restore its position in the international community. Allied Headquarters has listed the procedures for property restoration so that various important properties can be sorted out before the Allied countries sign the peace treaty. Tang said: "Japanese assets abroad are listed at 40 billion yuan. The largest part of this huge industry is in the Soviet-controlled areas, including the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Island, and northern Korea. China also holds a large amount of Japanese property in Taiwan and the inland provinces."

Returning War-Time Looted Goods

[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] Tangxi, Director of the Property Management Office of the Allied Headquarters, told United Press: "The work of returning the looted goods during the war is now underway. There are a large number of looted goods, including cars, machines, artwork, antiques, books, and other items, which are still stored in Japanese warehouses. Before any item is returned, the government whose property was looted by Japan should first make a request, and the item must be proven to have been looted from its territory. There are still a large number of looted industrial machines that have not been identified by various countries. Therefore, no requests have been received for these materials. Some of the machines have already been proposed for reparations, but before the item is definitely assigned to a certain country, if definite evidence is presented to request its return, then the item will no longer be used as reparations, but instead will be returned to its original owner.

Looted property that has now been returned to its original owners includes the famous Pontianak crown, made of gold and diamonds, which has been returned to its original owner in the former Dutch East Indies. Another looted item returned to the Dutch East Indies is a collection of eighteen human skulls. Based on previous scientific research, it is inferred that these skulls belong to a person between the Java ape-man and modern human races. Other items returned to the Dutch East Indies include a war banner belonging to a certain cavalry regiment and several thousand books. Korea regained several ancient government seals and a ship. Australia recovered several books stolen from the Department of Agriculture and other government offices in Rabaul. Hong Kong recovered two firefighting machines, a large lathe, two bronze statues, a bronze drum, a ship, the Addies Moller, and 627 books believed to be owned by Major Boxer, the husband of American female writer Xiang Meili. The British Solomon Islands recovered a law library and books belonging to the Chief Justice's Library of the Western Pacific Commissioner's Court. China recovered books that previously belonged to the National Central Library, two chained iron anchors lost in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, specimens of Peking Man, and other books belonging to various schools, the Royal Asiatic Society, and individuals.

The Disposal of Large Amounts of Gold Bullion Has Not Yet Been Finalized

The delegations of compensation and recovery of original items from Australia, the Netherlands, France, the Philippines, China, and Canada have all arrived in Tokyo, and the delegations of the United States and other countries are expected to arrive in Tokyo within a day. The disposal of large amounts of gold bullion is awaiting a decision by senior authorities. The following ships are currently being repaired and equipped and are planned to be returned to their original owners: belonging to the UK are the Jintang, Torlys, Bias, Halman Moller, Yuexi Moller and Xin Yangzi, belonging to Panama is Romora. Belonging to the Philippines is Hilongdeler. Belonging to the United States is the Weivi. Belonging to Korea are fifteen fishing boats owned by Korea.

### Cargo Unloading at Qikou Raises Various Speculations

[United Press, Tianjin, 4th Dispatch] According to military authorities of the National Army, last night informed this reporter: They have obtained intelligence that a ship of unknown origin, possibly dispatched by UNRRA, is unloading goods of unknown nature at Qikou, which is 70 kilometers south of Tianjin and under Communist control. This news yesterday has caused rumors to spread in the Chinese press, claiming that the Soviet Union is arming the CCP at that location. However, these military authorities revealed that the initial intelligence claiming the ship belonged to the Soviet Union has since been proven to be false. The ship may be "a UNRRA vessel". This intelligence came from the coastal area above Qigu controlled by the National Army, stating that the ship docked there on April 25 and sailed away the same day after unloading a large amount of goods. Although further investigation is still underway, the relevant authorities do not believe the ship belongs to the Soviet Union. However, they also stated that the National Army has not received any notification from UNRRA that a ship is heading to Qikou.

### Zhang Qun Discusses Loan Issues: Balancing the Budget Cannot Rely on Foreign Debt; Foreign Loans Must Be Used for Construction

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan, when reporting at a Legislative Yuan meeting previously, mentioned the issue of American loans. Today, in response to reporters' inquiries, he further explained as follows: "How our government can achieve a balance of payments in the budget is indeed a major challenge at present. However, to solve this challenge, the government should first implement a self-help policy, gradually increasing tax revenues, reducing non-productive expenditures, and using methods such as domestic debt. It is harmful to rely on foreign debt to make up for budget overruns. However, our country has a vast area that needs to immediately begin economic recovery and construction work. The costs required for this type of work are naturally beyond the current capacity of our national treasury. In this regard, American loans are crucial. The government will strictly adhere to the common administrative guidelines declared by all parties participating in the government this time, that is, the raising of foreign debt must be limited to use for construction and production, as well as stabilizing and improving the economic life of the people."

### American Newspapers Comment: Praising Zhang Qun

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] The Washington Daily News today wrote a commentary stating that Zhang Qun, the Premier of the Executive Yuan of the reorganized Chinese government, is now "off to a good start" in his self-admittedly difficult position. First, Mr. Zhang and his cabinet members have attended the Legislative Yuan to report and have asked the Legislative Yuan to discuss his plans. This is a new and encouraging change in the procedures of the Chinese government. Second, the new Premier, when announcing "Our government firmly believes that we should rely mainly on our own efforts and should not rely solely on external assistance," showed a sense of self-reliance. This indicates a new courage being injected into the Kuomintang government. The newspaper believes that if this implies that Chiang's government has decided to stabilize China's economy through sound internal measures, then it is indeed good news and worthy of encouragement. China's post-war reconstruction will undoubtedly require some external assistance, but if the Chinese government can demonstrate its strength in implementing its own construction and reform plans, then external assistance will be more rapid and promising.

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd, United Press] The Howard newspaper system wrote a commentary stating that since Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan of China took office, he has been determined to innovate. He has attended the Legislative Yuan to report on his plans. At the same time, Premier Zhang has demonstrated his confident ability, which shows that new momentum has been injected into the Chinese government.

### Wu Tiecheng Speaks to Reporters About the Domestic Situation After the Reorganization

[Central News Agency, this city] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng came to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him about the situation after the reorganization of the government. He said the following: The expansion of the government is based on the foundation laid down in the Political Consultative Conference. It has been more than a year since then and it has finally come to fruition. The Kuomintang is certainly gratified, and the people of the whole country and friendly nations must also feel excited. The twists and turns of discussions in various aspects over the past year are well known to the people of the country. It is a great regret that the Chinese Communist Party refused to participate in the government and was unwilling to jointly promote constitutional democracy. In the end, they even denied the constitution and used force to undermine peace!

After the reorganization of the National Government, the various parties participating in the government will work together to deliberate on appropriate solutions to the current economic problems of China and the problem of the Chinese Communist Party's armed resistance against the government. The solution to economic problems certainly requires friendly assistance, but the main thing is still self-reliance. Those who can help themselves will surely be helped by others.

Today, China's only way out is: first, to cultivate the foundation of democratic politics and implement constitutionalism. Therefore, the government's most arduous task this year is to hold various elections, convene the National Assembly as scheduled, and establish a constitutional government. Second, to use rapid and effective methods to urge the Chinese Communist Party to stop military actions and fully restore transportation. The Communist Party must become an ordinary legal political party and work together with the Kuomintang and other parties to achieve China's peaceful unification. Only then can China actively carry out various reforms and constructions on the right track of constitutionalism. Only then can the people live and work in peace and contentment.

China's stability and prosperity are closely related to the world's stability and prosperity. International tranquility and peace are also closely related to China's tranquility and peace. In order to fulfill its responsibility as a member of the international community, China must first seek its own peaceful unification. Although this matter is important, sincerity will eventually lead to the complete achievement of the goal, and the main conditions for its success are that the entire nation has confidence, can be patient, and has great perseverance.

Finally, the reporter asked Mr. Wu for his thoughts on the CCP's underground struggle program. Mr. Wu replied that this is the CCP's consistent style and is not surprising.

[Central News Agency, this city] Vice President of the Executive Yuan Wang Yunwu took the night train from Shanghai to Beijing yesterday.

Also, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department Peng Xuepei took the night train from Shanghai to Beijing yesterday.

### Closing Ceremony Held at Huayuankou; Chairman Chiang Issues Instructions and Commendations; Memorial Service Held on the Same Day for Employees Who Sacrificed Their Lives for the Closure

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th] The closure project of the Huayuankou section of the Yellow River, which is related to the safety of hundreds of millions of lives and the prosperity of thousands of hectares of fertile land, was completed after arduous struggle and resistance. The historically significant closing ceremony was held on the 4th. The ceremony site was in the breach that was not long ago turbulent and full of dangers, but now it has become a solid and flat new embankment. Today, the embankment happened to be sunny after rain, and the wind was gentle and the sun was shining. The ceremony began at 9:00 am. Former Chairman Zhao Shouyu of the Yellow River Commission served as chairman. Minister of Water Resources Xue Dubi gave a speech at the meeting, and Director Zhu Guangcai of the Engineering Bureau reported on the construction process. Then, Chairman Chiang's instructions were read out, saying that the success of the closure was due to (1) clear responsibility, (2) effective cooperation, and (3) firm confidence. Subsequently, Deputy Commander Fan Hanjie of the Army Headquarters, Chairman Liu Maoen of Henan Province, Supervisor Miao Peicheng, Consultant Todd of the United Relief Organization, Consultant Qian Zongyuan of the Pinghan Railway, and Director Ma Jie of the Henan Branch delivered speeches separately. Finally, the county magistrates of Zheng County, Zhongmu, and other sixteen counties were awarded banners by the conference for their effective assistance in purchasing materials and hiring workers. The grand ceremony was completed at 12:00 noon amidst the slogans of "Long Live the Successful Closure" and the melodious sound of firecrackers and music.

The original text of Chairman Chiang's instructions at the closing ceremony of the Huayuankou section of the Yellow River is as follows:

Minister Xue of the Ministry of Water Resources: Our country is based on agriculture, and the construction of water conservancy has always been a major government policy. Compared with the dikes of various rivers in the country, after a long period of resistance war, they have been in disrepair. Therefore, at the beginning of the victory, the competent authorities were instructed to start the river repair and defense work as soon as possible. The breach of the Yellow River at Huayuankou for eight years caused severe disasters. The closure of the breach and the restoration of the river are related to national planning, people's livelihood, and reconstruction. Efforts should be made to speed up the process. Fortunately, this matter has lasted for more than a year. Although the project is arduous, the dangers are numerous, the obstruction of human beings, and the unfavorable weather conditions have almost accompanied the project from beginning to end. Finally, the employees involved and the relevant authorities and local governments have relied on perseverance and hard work to achieve success. Not only do the people in the affected areas celebrate the tranquility together, but the national vitality is also easier to recover from now on. The great achievements and achievements are commendable. All senior officials have been awarded medals by the National Government. The remaining employees who have contributed should be commended by the minister on their behalf and given preferential treatment to recognize their meritorious service. As for how to strengthen the dam body in the future to prevent major floods, how to find ways to complete the downstream levee restoration work to facilitate drainage, and how to revive the affected areas to help the disaster victims, all parties should still cooperate, be conscientious and responsible, and continue to work hard to achieve complete success. I have high hopes for this. Zhongzheng, Mao, Xian, Yin.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th] The memorial service for the employees who sacrificed their lives for the Yellow River damming project was held at the Huayuankou Dam Restoration Bureau at 2:00 pm on the 4th. Minister of Water Resources Xue Dubi presided over the ceremony.

Mr. Xue gave a tearful speech, and more than 3,000 participants were moved by it. He also encouraged those engaged in river work to continue their efforts to turn the harm of the Yellow River into the benefit of the Yellow River. The families of the employees who sacrificed their lives will be given preferential treatment. Finally, the representatives of the families of the employees who sacrificed their lives delivered a reply.

### Editorial: The National Government's Return to the Capital: One Year Anniversary

Today marks the first anniversary of the National Government's triumphant return to the capital. Recalling this day a year ago, the entire nation was immersed in the glory of victory, and the enthusiasm for celebrating the National Government's return was fervent! The expectations for domestic politics after the return to the capital were equally urgent! But today, a year later, reflecting on the past, the fruits of that glorious victory have already rotted away; looking to the future, the prospects are bleak. Therefore, as we commemorate this great day of the triumphant return to the capital today, our feelings are truly mixed.

First, the clarification of the political situation and the implementation of constitutional governance still require redoubled efforts from the entire nation, both government and public. On this day a year ago, the Political Consultative Conference had just concluded successfully. The Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction and the plan for the reorganization and unified command of the armed forces that it passed, although not yet implemented, still offered great hope because peace talks were underway with the mediation of Allied mediators, making the National Government's return to the capital the beginning of peaceful national reconstruction. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communists were obsessed with the omnipotence of military force and sought to expand their territory by force. They consistently failed to understand this, leading to a situation where the peace talks anticipated by the whole country were elusive, resulting in a cycle of fighting and negotiating, and negotiating and fighting. This ultimately left Marshal George C. Marshall, the tireless mediator, helpless, and he had to acknowledge his failure and quietly return home. Since then, the peace talks have never been restored. This episode of the peace talks can be said to be the most heartbreaking and disappointing. However, from another perspective, the government, for the sake of peace, spared no effort in repeatedly making concessions to the Chinese Communists. The breakdown of the peace talks was not the government's fault and the Chinese Communists should bear full responsibility. At the same time, for the sake of democracy, the government everywhere demonstrated the spirit of doing its best, regardless of the obstruction of the Chinese Communists and the Democratic League, and still followed the original plan, step by step, embarking on the road to preparing for the implementation of constitutional governance. The convening of the National Assembly in November last year and the drafting of the new Constitution, no matter how they are interpreted, cannot but be regarded as a major achievement of the government's efforts to promote political democratization after its return to the capital. Not only that, but the government, in order to ensure the success of the implementation of constitutional governance, also voluntarily reorganized the government, recruiting members of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, as well as social elites, to expand the democratic foundation of the government, and successfully completed the reorganization last month. The newly appointed Premier Zhang Qun, with the demeanor of a new statesman, came forward to govern, revealing his principles of governance for the future: first, to implement a system where the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan on a trial basis; second, to continue to seek a political solution to the Chinese Communist problem. This immediately gave the domestic political situation a new look, and therefore, in the hearts of the people across the country, infinite hope has arisen again. However, from our perspective, the hope that the people now have for the future of politics is still vague and requires redoubled efforts from the entire nation, both government and public, especially the sudden realization of the Chinese Communists, to immediately lay down their arms, so that the whole country can turn swords into plowshares. From then on, the domestic political situation can be clarified, and the implementation of the Constitution starting on December 25th of this year will blossom with democracy.

Second, the nationalization of the armed forces should be achieved at any cost. A year ago, when the National Government returned to the capital, the people across the country were all eager for the realization of domestic peace; and they unanimously believed that the implementation of the reorganization and unified command of the armed forces, making the nationalization of the armed forces nationwide, was the best way to ensure domestic peace and unity. Therefore, the people of the country were constantly looking forward to the nationalization of the armed forces. But as of today, not only has this hope been shattered, but the flames of war have spread across half of China. North China, Northeast China, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Shaanxi, and the provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi have all suffered from the poison of the Chinese Communist Party's separatist rule. Although the Chinese Communists have repeatedly suffered defeats in military terms, and even Yan'an, which served as the "Chinese Communist Area" for issuing orders, has been recovered by the National Army, the Chinese Communists' delusion has not yet been cleared; and they have placed all their hopes on their guerrilla strategy, and they are foolishly attempting to economically drag down the National Government. Therefore, there is no hope of ending the domestic war for the time being, and the nationalization of the armed forces nationwide is even more out of the question at this point. We certainly also acknowledge that the government's use of force against the Chinese Communists is out of necessity; because the government has an unshirkable responsibility to maintain domestic transportation and protect the lives and property of the people, so it cannot turn a blind eye to the Chinese Communists who use force to destroy transportation and disrupt public order, and it has no choice but to take decisive action so that the people of the country can live and work in peace. However, we still hope that the government can have a comprehensive plan for military affairs. It must restore peace domestically in the shortest possible time, and earnestly fulfill the nationalization of the armed forces, so that domestic peace and unity can be maintained permanently from then on.

Third, the government should prioritize stabilizing the people's livelihood in the economy. During the eight years of bloody war, the people of the whole country were either constantly moving with the army, wandering and displaced, or remained in the occupied areas, suffering the exploitation of the enemy and puppets, moaning and haggard, with unspeakable suffering. Who would not hope to reduce the pain in life after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War? Therefore, when the National Government returned to the capital last year, the people across the country hoped that the government would take action in the economy and finance to relieve the people's distress; but in the past year, because of the inability to balance finances, inflation was unavoidable, resulting in soaring prices, which made the common people struggle on the brink of starvation, with a sense of unease, as if they might not see the next day. The pain of being oppressed by life even exceeded wartime life! If this dangerous situation is not remedied, the subsequent consequences will be unimaginable. Premier Zhang recently admitted frankly to the Legislative Yuan that "the current economy is extremely difficult, which has a great impact on the national economy and people's livelihood, and we should strive for a balance of payments." He also stated that economic problems should be solved by economic methods, which shows that the government authorities are also paying attention to the current national economy and people's livelihood, but we cannot but point out that the severity of the threat to the people's livelihood from the crazy rise in prices exceeds that of floods or fires, and suppressing the rising trend of prices is like putting out a fire to save lives. The first priority is to rush to the scene promptly and take immediate action. If we see a disaster and do not provide relief, but retreat and study disaster relief methods at length, it will inevitably be too late. To be honest, since the economic difficulties have developed to such a serious point, all denials and cover-ups cannot overcome the facts; the government authorities can only face reality, face difficulties, and vigorously implement practical and concrete measures. The British government's approach to dealing with economic difficulties is most worthy of our reference. In the future, all administrative measures should take stabilizing the people's livelihood as the highest guiding principle. We should save all unnecessary expenses, eliminate all redundant personnel, and improve administrative efficiency. Even matters that should be promoted and reformed should be divided into stages. Matters that are not related to stabilizing the people's livelihood can be temporarily suspended. As for the ever-rising prices, we should take bold measures and implement a new economic policy. All measures should be based on statistical figures. If we want to control them, we should strive for thoroughness, not stop until we achieve our goals, and not stop until they are effective.

In short, today is the first anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. All past events are like yesterday's death, and all future events are like today's birth. Looking forward to the future of domestic politics, although there are few optimistic elements and many places for pessimism, everything depends on human effort. The people of the whole country still hope that the reorganized government can use the new style of the new government to overcome the current political and economic difficulties.

### Important Vote Held in French Parliament, Government Wins Vote of Confidence, Communist Party Members All Vote Against, Prime Minister's Future Movements Deserve Attention

[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 4th, broadcast: The Ramadier government won a great victory in the French parliament today with a vote of confidence, but the Communist Party's last-minute decision to oppose the government has foreshadowed a reorganization of the coalition cabinet. The vote count in the French parliament today was revealed as follows: 360 votes of confidence, 186 votes against, and 63 abstentions. Most members expressed their support, but Ramadier still stood up and demanded that the Communist Party state its position. Ramadier said: "We must have a clear decision. If you oppose me, please do not vote for a vote of confidence. France is currently facing serious difficulties, and only the implementation of iron discipline can save the crisis." After Ramadier finished speaking, the Communist Party unanimously voted against the vote of confidence, but the other parties supported Ramadier. Today's result proves that Ramadier has only two paths to follow: one is to replace the Communist Party officials who hold important cabinet positions with members of other parties, and the other is to offer his resignation. It has not yet been decided which steps Ramadier will take.

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] The French parliament will face a vote today that may cause a split between the Communist Party and other French parties. Premier Ramadier has requested a vote of confidence on his price and wage policy. The underlying meaning is whether parties other than the Communist Party are prepared to abandon the participation of the Communist Party and the support of the Communist Party-controlled unions and implement governance. If a coalition government is formed in France without the participation of the Communist Party, it will be the first time since the liberation in 1944. This attempt will undoubtedly be a prelude to a period of political turmoil in France. The Communist Party has strong control over major unions and is prepared to lead unions to demand higher wages. Those who oppose the Communist Party's high-wage policy say that in order to stop inflation and maintain the current value of the currency, wages should be frozen, at least in the current stage. After the economic issues, the Communist Party and other parties also have widely divergent views on foreign policy. The Communist Party is deeply dissatisfied with the increasingly pro-British and American and anti-Soviet stance of other party leaders since the Moscow Conference. Although there may still be a last glimmer of hope for maintaining the four-party coalition government, the Socialist Party is particularly unwilling to cause a full-scale cabinet crisis. Members of the Socialist Party in parliament have spent the whole day studying appropriate ways to allow metalworkers to obtain better treatment without violating the principle of freezing wages, while the Radical Party, the Gaullist Party, and the People's Republican Movement, including Foreign Minister Bidault, are firmly opposed to compromise with the Communist Party. They believe that the metalworkers' demand to increase production bonuses does not correspond to the increase in production volume and is actually a disguised demand to increase wages. In addition, the Radical Party also believes that the current government has not been able to give the free industry sufficient freedom, so it hopes to reorganize the government and exclude the main architect of the cabinet, the Socialist Party's Minister of National Economy, Philip. Several French newspapers pointed out that the current government crisis has exposed some peculiar weaknesses in the constitution. The Communist Party refused to vote for a vote of confidence in the government's economic policy today, but the government can still win a majority vote of confidence. At the same time, Communist Party cabinet members have stated that regardless of the outcome of the vote, they do not intend to resign, and Premier Ramadier has no way to force the Communist Party cabinet members to resign. Therefore, Ramadier can only lead all cabinet members to resign. Therefore, the resignation of the French government is due to the fact that the majority of the parliament has passed a vote of confidence in the government. This phenomenon is unique in the world.

### French Communist Party Clarifies Position: Supports Union Demands, Opposes "Policy of Force"

[France Press, Paris, 3rd] The Central Committee of the French Communist Party recently issued a declaration instructing Communist Party members of the National Assembly to support the union's demands for wage increases and to oppose the continued implementation of a "policy of force" within the French Federation. It also advocated for major cuts in military spending to balance the national budget, and for the implementation of a foreign policy that would allow France to obtain Ruhr coal and reparations. Finally, it expressed disappointment with the situation after the November 1946 elections, believing that violations of democratic regulations prevented the formation of a government that represented the will of the people and was led by the Communist Party. The declaration stated, in part: The government's efforts to suppress prices have failed, but France needs to provide food, clothing, and shelter for the people, and needs to stabilize the value of the franc and the national budget. It is particularly necessary to make major cuts in military spending to balance it. In terms of foreign policy, France should establish lasting and just peace, and seek reparations and the right to Ruhr coal. Regarding the empire itself, it is appropriate to end the policy of force, so as not to be taken advantage of by certain imperialists, causing the French Federation to be divided. It is hoped that Communist Party members will unanimously adhere to this attitude and vote according to this position in parliament. The Central Committee then urged the Socialist Party workers to unite with them to oppose the reactionary forces. It said: "The unified action of the working class can become the decisive factor in the comprehensive unity of the Republic." The Central Committee finally appealed to other parties to redouble their efforts to jointly seek the revival of the country, the welfare of the people, the protection of democracy, and the independence of France.

### US Authorities in Germany Do Not Allow Another Organization to Form the Unified Party

[France Press, Berlin on the Day] Regarding the request of the Bavarian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party's several separatist factions for the US military government to allow them to merge into the Social Unified Party, it is reported that the US military government has already replied, expressing its rejection. It is said that unless the Social Democratic Party itself makes this request, the US military government cannot recognize the merger of the two parties.

### Jesus Statue: Wounds Bleeding

Catholic Believers Vie to See Miracle

[Reuters, Rome, 3rd] Thousands of Italian Catholic believers flocked to the church in La Spezia today to see the miracle of blood flowing from the wounds of Jesus on the cross. The priest of the church said that it was caused by the reflection of light on the oil paint of the wounds. However, some believers said that the Eucharist on the cross was indeed bleeding, and said that this miracle also occurred in 1635. It is said that the cross was made in 1300.

### Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations: Some Progress Made

[Reuters, Moscow, 3rd] Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations have been underway for two weeks. It is now known that the British delegation has decided to extend its stay by one week in order to continue negotiations with the Soviet authorities, because the negotiations have made considerable progress, so the British side is particularly unwilling to interrupt them. It is understood that although the British delegation will not bring back to its country the trade agreement that will be agreed upon soon, it will be able to establish broad principles for restoring Anglo-Soviet trade on the basis of the 1934 agreement. To date, negotiations have been limited to the items that both parties intend to supply, as well as technical issues related to the conclusion of shipping contracts.

### UN Political Committee to Discuss Today: Investigation Team Organization Issues, Jewish Representatives Attend, No Agreement Reached on Major Case

[France Press, New York, 3rd] When the Political Committee of the United Nations Special General Assembly meets on the 5th, it will discuss the establishment of the Palestine investigation team and the definition of its powers. These two issues will force the representatives to address the core of the Palestine issue. The Political Committee has two issues that need to be resolved. One is to establish an investigation committee to prepare a report to be submitted to the UN General Assembly regular session in January of this year. The second is to allow representatives of the Jewish Public Assembly to present their views. The first point is more important than the second, because it involves the entire Palestine issue. Although the delegations are trying to avoid a comprehensive discussion, it seems difficult to avoid this circle. Although the representatives want to give the investigation committee broad powers, they have divergent opinions on its organization. Currently, there are two arguments. One faction favors the investigation committee being composed of members from neutral countries, the so-called neutral countries being countries that are not directly related to this issue. The five permanent members of the Security Council and the Arab countries are not included. The other faction argues that the representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council and the Arab countries should be included together. The United States favors the former argument, and the United Kingdom is expected to follow suit. Small countries are opposed, believing that the Palestine issue can only be resolved by the five permanent members in the end. If the five permanent members are included in the investigation committee, it can solve some difficult problems in advance. The Soviet Union and France support this argument.

[Associated Press, New York, 3rd] The United Nations Special General Assembly debated the case of whether Jewish representatives should attend the meeting to present their views on the Palestine issue this afternoon for four hours without result. The United States and the Soviet Union had very different views. The United States argued that Jewish representatives could only participate in the debate on the Palestine issue in the Political Committee, while the Soviet Union strongly argued that Jewish representatives could speak at the plenary session. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m., and there were still eight representatives who had prepared to express their views according to the plan who had not had time to speak, but the arguments for and against had already been fully stated in the Steering Committee. Chairman Aranha hoped to reconvene the meeting tonight to make a resolution, but in order to comply with the wishes of the majority of the representatives, he adjourned the meeting until 11 a.m. on the 5th for further discussion. Soviet Representative Gromyko said that listening to the presentation of the Jewish representatives would increase the dignity of the General Assembly. "If we want to obtain a just decision, we must allow Jewish representatives to attend the plenary session."

### United Nations General Assembly Holds Welcome Reception; Mexican President Delivers Speech

[French News Agency, Linluxing Grassland, 3rd] Mexican President Alemán, who came to the United States for consultation, has arrived here. The United Nations General Assembly held a welcome reception for him today. After the President of the General Assembly, Aranha, delivered a welcoming speech, President Alemán delivered a speech stating that only through mutual cooperation can we overcome the various difficulties that have arisen after the war and transform this unstable period into true peace. In short, I hope that when you discuss various issues, you can always be guided by harmony and justice.

### Britain Plans to Build Battleships Powered by Atomic Energy

[United Press, London, 3rd] The Admiralty announced today that the government will seek to build atomic-powered battleships and plans to launch a large-scale research effort to maintain naval efficiency. This year, various naval research projects will cost as much as $24 million. Naval facilities must apply the lessons learned by observers in the Bikini atomic bomb tests, but the essence of atomic energy quickly does not limit the navy to defensive aspects. The initial impression is the opposite, and it will lead to an increase in naval power, a high degree of formal innovation, and an expansion of offensive and defensive tasks. Atomic-powered battleships have no refueling problems, and their stay at sea is limited only by other secondary supply issues. At the same time, the Department of Supply announced that a school will be opened in the state-owned atomic energy plant in Stirling Firth, Northern Ireland, to train young people over the age of 14 to engage in atomic work.

### British Shipbuilding Program

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Britain, whose shipping capacity has lagged behind the United States, is trying to catch up quickly to restore its position as the world's leading shipping nation. In addition to orders placed abroad, the shipbuilding target for this year in Britain is 1.25 million tons. The fuel crisis and the shortage of steel and timber will inevitably have some impact on the shipbuilding program, but the amount of the reduction cannot be estimated at present. This year's production, with the exception of one-quarter, will be added to the British merchant fleet, whose total tonnage has fallen to only 24 percent of the world's tonnage, totaling 24,009,600 tons, while the total tonnage of the American merchant fleet is 50,389,000 tons. Britain currently leases 229 merchant ships from the United States, and the British government has decided to spend US$100 million to buy 142 of them. In terms of tonnage, it will take many years for Britain to regain its throne as the world's leading shipping nation, but the equipment of British merchant ships is becoming more and more refined.

### Iraq and Transjordan Sign Ten-Year Treaty of Friendship

The treaty does not contain financial or educational provisions.

### Muslim League Insists on Partition; Unification of India Hopeless; Ismay Returns to Britain to Urge Government to Take Timely Action

[Reuters, London, 4th] The Sunday Times correspondent in New Delhi stated that according to information obtained from very high authorities, Lord Ismay, a senior aide to the Governor-General of India, Mountbatten, went to London to urge the British Cabinet to take timely action to avoid the complete collapse of Indian administration. The India Office fears that India will inevitably fall into chaos before Britain withdraws from India in June next year. The Governor-General's report specifically pointed out that there is no possibility that the Congress Party and the Muslim League will reach an agreement on the unification of India. The independent state demanded by the Muslim League includes six provinces: Sindh, Northwest Frontier Province, Punjab, Balochistan, Bengal, and Assam. However, the Congress Party does not want to cede Assam, eastern Punjab, and western Bengal, where non-Muslims constitute the majority of the population. In the Northwest Frontier Province, the Congress Party may be able to make concessions. Therefore, the Governor-General of India hopes to hold a referendum in the disputed areas to determine who they belong to. The recognition of Pakistan has led to some demands for continued partition. The Governor-General believes that the earlier the transfer of power is implemented, the smaller the support for these demands will be. Regarding taxation, immigration, and the military, it will not be possible to separate them for several years. Therefore, the Governor-General suggests that committees be appointed by Pakistan and Hindustan to take over the transitional administration of these affairs to prepare for the final separation. If the Muslim League only obtains an incomplete Pakistan, it is expected that it will launch a long-term struggle to recover the divided motherland. Conversely, if it obtains a complete Pakistan, the Congress Party will not be willing to accept it. Under these circumstances, the strength of both sides will not be able to focus on the restoration of the agricultural, industrial, and social system. In the development of these opinions, some people have suggested that the British Cabinet should consider having Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union jointly guarantee the sovereignty of India.

### Japan's Foreign Trade; United States Sets Date for Restoration

### Enthusiastic Commemoration of the May Fourth Movement; City Gymnasium Holds Grand Meeting; Announcement of Sixteen Winners of Youth Day Essay Contest

On the one hand, we express our admiration for the spirit of the great May Fourth Movement 28 years ago. On the other hand, we deeply feel that we have made very little contribution to the country and the nation, and we are extremely ashamed. Recalling the May Fourth Movement, although young people had vigorous vigor and determination to transform society, they had two shortcomings: (1) no long-term vision, (2) no practical methods, only knowing that they were dissatisfied with the status quo, but not knowing how to proceed gradually to make effective reforms. We should remember this lesson today. You are the masters of the future. You should work hard, study hard, not be boastful, not sing high-pitched tunes, and carefully observe any problems, study their causes, and do them practically, so as to assume the responsibility of building the country and society.

Competition for Excellence: Sixteen Winners

Then, Director Gu, Secretary Xie, and others delivered speeches one after another. After the speeches, the results of the "Essay Contest Commemorating Youth Day" were announced.

Then, Zhang Daofan delivered a speech saying: "I am very excited to be attending the founding meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association on this Literary Festival. The May Fourth Movement of the 28th year shifted from politics to culture. Up to today, the democratic politics of our country have laid a preliminary foundation and are moving forward. It can be said that 'the spirit of the May Fourth Movement has achieved preliminary results.' However, in order to continue to move forward, we must not stand still. We need to expand the opportunities for writers to learn from each other in order to make further progress. Today, the Shanghai Writers Association is established, and we place the greatest hope on it.

### Amateur Radio Association Shanghai Branch Holds 8th Annual Meeting at Jiaotong University

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Amateur Radio Association held its 8th annual meeting at the gymnasium of Jiaotong University at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 300 members attended. First, Xu Enzeng, chairman of the General Association, delivered a speech saying: "I remember that when the Sino-Japanese War began, a group of brave young radio personnel responded to the national mobilization plan and were willing to serve the country. At that time, I was in charge of the Sixth Department of the Military Commission, so the Sixth Department established the Wartime Service Corps of Chinese Amateur Radio Personnel. In the 29th year, it was reorganized into a people's academic group, which was renamed the current name. The annual meeting is always held on May 5. We have three missions: (1) We love science. Science is the truth that has been tested. Grasp the truth, distinguish right from wrong, and we will follow this path. (2) Our country is a country with a developed metaphysics. Not only is it unclear about right and wrong, but it is also difficult to quickly promote all material construction and production methods. Our love of science is to popularize drawing knowledge in order to accelerate the achievement of national prosperity and happiness. (3) Loving drawing and loving experimentation will inevitably lead to many inventions and many achievements over time, so as to increase social welfare. At the same time, the problem of one's own life will also be solved, and there will be no more phenomenon of fighting for this and robbing from that, which is beneficial to both people and oneself. I sincerely hope that all members will still maintain the spirit of the past and contribute to the country and the nation."

Then, Yu Bingjian, director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, delivered a speech, saying: "During the Anti-Japanese War, our amateur radio operators made a significant contribution. In addition to publishing books, radio publications, holding academic lectures, giving the people radio knowledge, and holding radio exhibitions, they also actively organized to serve the country, manufacturing military transceivers, helping the government train communication personnel, undertaking important communication tasks, and conducting international propaganda. Before the war, we were still lingering in the 20-meter, 10-meter, and 5-meter wavelengths. Now we have progressed to 2-meter, 1-meter, and even several-centimeter radar research. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that to study Western science, we must catch up head-on. This is the easiest and most promising thing for radio."

After Mr. Yu's speech, the association originally invited Zhao Zeng, the head of the three offices, to deliver a speech. Zhao did not arrive due to business, and his recorded speech was broadcast instead. Yesterday's speeches were all broadcast to the outside world by the Minsheng Radio Station. Then, photos were taken, association affairs were reported, proposals were discussed, and directors and supervisors were re-elected. At the end, there were radio performances and other entertainment, which ended at about 6:00 p.m.

[Another report] Amateur radio technology experts Liu Tongkang, Liang Yijian, Wang Xingxing, Ge Zhengxin, Zhao Zhende, Yao Haoting, Wu Guanzhou, Gu Dayi, etc., in view of the current lack of radio technicians and the urgent need for them, have initiated the organization of the "Air Radio Technology School," and plan to hire many other radio experts to take turns teaching.

### Plans for Severe Punishment of Unscrupulous Merchants; Those Found Will Be Punished with the Death Penalty

[East China News Agency] It has recently been confirmed that the authorities are considering proper measures to crack down on hoarding and price manipulation. Currently, unscrupulous merchants found to be hoarding are only subject to administrative penalties and short-term detention, which is not enough to punish the unscrupulous and appease public anger. The authorities have recently planned that, in the future, goods found to be hoarding, including daily necessities such as rice, coal, oil, sugar, yarn, cloth, and salt, will be confiscated and sold publicly at a fair price by the authorities. As for the unscrupulous merchants who hoard, they will be punished with the death penalty in accordance with the regulations on hoarding essential goods for the people's livelihood during extraordinary times. Once the plan is submitted to the central government for approval, it will be officially implemented.

### More Than a Thousand Young People Carry Coffins in Procession; Gongs Sound All the Way; Unscrupulous Merchants Tremble with Fear

The large-scale procession to suppress prices and expose unscrupulous merchants launched by the Shanghai Vocational Youth Association was held at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than a thousand vocational youths gathered at Jing'an Temple, led by the national flag and the commander's car, followed by gongs on all four sides. They then held up huge banners with slogans such as "Expose Unscrupulous Merchants and Suppress Prices," "Where is the Conscience of Unscrupulous Merchants," "Use Heavy Penalties in a Chaotic World," and "Down with Bureaucratic Capital." They also had a large complaint box for passersby to submit complaints at any time. There were also various fascinating programs interspersed, such as rice, coal, oil, cloth, and Western medicine spreading their wings and flying high, somersaults in copper coin eyes, and reaching out for money from the coffin. The procession passed through Nanjing Road, Jiangxi Road, the Municipal Government, Hankou Road, Henan Road, Zhongzheng East Road, the Great World, Xizang South Road, Linsen Middle Road, Zhongzheng South First Road, Zhongzheng North First Road, and ended at Nanjing West Road. Along the way, they shouted to expose unscrupulous merchants for hoarding and to overthrow bureaucratic capital. The citizens were greatly relieved to see this situation and shouted along, with enthusiastic emotions, and the procession dispersed at 4:30 p.m.

For the sake of solemnity, the association specially sent the complaint box to the Garrison Headquarters after the procession, where the headquarters was responsible for opening it. Representatives from the Vocational Youth Association will also participate at that time.

Legal Interpretation

(1) Store Closure

Li Zhijun asks: I suffered a huge loss due to the closure of a certain store. The store owner has absconded without a trace, leaving only the rented storefront and a few pieces of equipment. May I ask (1) can I accuse him of fraud? (2) Can the store's assets be used to compensate for the debt? (3) Can I use the store's receipt as proof of my claim?

[Lawyer Duan Bukai's reply] (1) The crime of fraud under criminal law requires the intention to illegally possess something for oneself or a third party and to use fraudulent means to have someone deliver their own or a third party's property. If the store owner had the above-mentioned intention and behavior, he should be held liable for the crime of fraud. (2) If the inheritance has already begun, then yes. (3) No.

(2)

Miao Shaohai asks: I have an older brother who is married and is naturally dissolute. He does not engage in proper work and has addictions. My father repeatedly advised him, but he would not listen. Once, my older brother was drunk and wanted to chop my father to death with an axe. Fortunately, my father managed to escape and was not harmed. Therefore, there was an irreconcilable hatred between the two of them. One night eight years ago, my older brother was murdered. My father is suspected of absconding and has been living in fear ever since. Now that eight years have passed, does my sister-in-law still have the right to pursue legal action? Also, does the government's amnesty order exempt my father from the crime of suspicion?

[Lawyer Duan Senkai's reply] Your father instigated others to kill your older brother, which is a crime of instigating murder under Article 29 of the Criminal Law. According to Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the same law, a person who commits murder shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years. According to the provisions of Item C of the government's amnesty order, the death penalty is reduced to imprisonment for a term of fifteen years; life imprisonment is reduced to imprisonment for a term of ten years; imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years is reduced to imprisonment for a term of not less than five years; it is not a complete pardon. Therefore, the court can still exercise its authority to prosecute and judge. To this day, your sister-in-law is permitted by law to request the court to punish the murderer in accordance with legal procedures. If unlawful means are used for retaliation, then one should bear legal responsibility.

### Jinghua Company Vandalized, Press Conference Held

Regarding the vandalism of the Jinghua Glass Company by glass workers from other factories, the Shanghai Industrial Association hosted a press conference at the Banker's Club yesterday. Xu Zhaohe, the manager of Jinghua, reported on the truth of the destruction, stating that due to the continuous need to operate the large glass melting furnace during Labor Day, some workers were still working at the factory and were being paid double wages by the factory. Unexpectedly, at noon on that day, hundreds of workers holding the flag of the Glass Industry Workers' Union rushed into the factory and vandalized the office, workshop, warehouse, and the doors, windows, and equipment in various places, with an estimated loss of 450 million yuan. It was also stated that this matter is a small loss for the company, but has a large impact on social stability, so it will be reported to relevant authorities, hoping to ensure the safety of manufacturers in the future and severely punish the instigators. It is said that the workers of the association were not members of the union, so this may have been the cause of this unfortunate incident.

### Three Methods Under Consideration for Placing Unemployed Workers

[Our Dispatch] The authorities are greatly concerned about the placement of unemployed workers in Shanghai. The Social Affairs Bureau took advantage of the visit of Gu Zhenggang and Lu Jingshi to Shanghai to hold a meeting to discuss this issue. However, due to the economic recession, there is still no good solution. According to Director Lu Jingshi, there are three aspects under consideration for placement: (1) When Japanese reparations materials arrive to build factories, these unemployed workers will be absorbed, but the timing of this is still far away. (2) They will be introduced to work in various factories, but due to the industrial recession, a large number cannot be accommodated. (3) A portion of the unemployed workers will be sent back to their hometowns. This matter involves various difficulties, but is also under consideration.

### This Newspaper's Fifth Special Broadcast Zhang Daofan Lectures, Elaborating on the Political and Cultural Significance of the May Fourth Movement, Hoping that the "Association of Writers" Provides Good Spiritual Nourishment

[Our Dispatch] This newspaper's fifth special weekly broadcast was held yesterday at the Oriental Huamei Broadcasting Station on Tibet Road. Mr. Zhang Daofan, a member of the Central Committee, was invited to lecture on "The Significance of Commemorating the May Fourth Movement and the Establishment of the Shanghai Literary Writers Association." The full text of the speech is recorded below:

"Today is the anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. Twenty-eight years ago, a patriotic student movement occurred in Peiping. It was originally a political movement, but later developed into a cultural movement and had a great relationship with literature and art. During the May Fourth Movement, two slogans were put forward: 'We want democracy! We want science!' Because at that time, politics was entirely in a state of autocracy, and academic culture was even more out of the question. The country was both poor and weak, so this patriotic movement occurred, demanding political democratization and advocating science to catch up. Now, when we think about the progress of political democratization in the past 28 years, we feel great comfort. After the May Fourth Movement, through the efforts of the people all over the country, especially under the leadership of the Kuomintang, the movement to protect the constitution and the Northern Expedition in 1926 successively eliminated the warlords and unified China.

Political Democracy is Now a Reality

At that time, there was a very good opportunity to realize democracy, but because the Communist Party in the country was causing trouble, occupying the Anhui and Jiangxi area, plotting to communize, and instigating riots, the government was forced to engage in suppression and could not embark on the road of construction. Later, the September 18th Incident occurred, and Japanese warlords launched the incident to prevent China from unifying. At that time, the national strength was weak, and there was no military preparation, so we had to endure humiliation and delay the enemy in order to prepare more. Until it became unbearable and there was no way to retreat, we launched the full-scale war of resistance on July 7th. After eight years of war, we finally won the final victory. Originally, in order to realize democracy, the Kuomintang had already stipulated the three stages of military administration, tutelage, and constitutional government in the party program before the war, but the tutelage period can be said to have not been completed due to the enemy's sabotage. Now, more than a year after the victory, because there is a need to implement constitutional government ahead of schedule, the National Assembly was convened last year to formulate the constitution. After this year's National Assembly elections, the constitution can be implemented. The recent reorganization of the government is also aimed at realizing constitutional government ahead of schedule. All these facts are enough to show that the "political democratization" proposed by the May Fourth Movement now has results.

Developing Literature and Art Should be Valued Even More

As for science, although it has not yet caught up with European and American countries, there has been a lot of progress. Secondly, let's talk about the cultural movement unfolded by the May Fourth Movement. Literature and art are the main departments in culture, and should be given special attention. Now the United Nations has an educational, cultural, and scientific organization, and the cultural department also focuses on literature and art, so the development of literature and art should not only be sought domestically, but also abroad, in order to win the attention of democratic countries to me. During the War of Resistance, the literary and art circles had considerable progress, and there were various organizations. Now that the war has ended, in the process of national construction, this link of literature and art cannot be ignored, and we need to work harder. At present, the level of domestic literature and art is still not satisfactory. For example, novels and movies have made considerable progress, but the achievements of poetry and other genres are too poor. If we compare them with European and American countries, we feel even more ashamed. Therefore, how to seek the development of literature and art, so that established writers are not only famous in the country, but also enjoy fame internationally, and how to enable young writers to be assisted by established writers and achieve something, depends not only on government assistance and social sympathy, but especially on their own efforts. Therefore, there is a need to organize groups to help each other, learn from each other, and seek everyone's welfare.

The Literary Association Has Great Significance

Now the cultural organization of the United Nations has launched every country participating in it to establish a committee in the country, composed of sound literary and art organizations. Like the United States, there are more than 1,000. In the past, China could not talk about having a sound organization. It was not until the beginning of the year before last that the Literary Association General Association was established in Chongqing, and it was moved to Nanjing after the victory. At the first annual meeting this year, it was decided to establish a literary writers association in Shanghai, because Shanghai is the center of the country's culture and needs this organization even more to unite outstanding writers. The "Shanghai Literary Association" was officially established today after a considerable period of preparation. Today is the anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, which is a memorial day for the transformation of a political movement into a cultural movement, and is therefore of particular significance. It is hoped that the society will attach importance to this organization and use various methods to support and encourage the development of literature and art and literary and art writers. Moreover, literary and art writers are providers of spiritual food. People, regardless of their wealth, gender, age, or youth, have the same need for spiritual food, but the quality of spiritual food is very different. Apart from a few writers with ulterior motives, good spiritual food can benefit people's physical and mental cultivation. Toxic, or low-level, obscene, and depraved spiritual food is not only useless, but also harmful. Therefore, it is hoped that literary and art writers will come up with good spiritual food, and that social readers will have a clear understanding and give strict criticism and severe blows to bad literary and art works, so as to make literature and art embark on the road of good development and cooperate with the important task of national construction in the future.

### Great Relocation Movement of Yingshi University Expanded, Students of All Departments on Strike Since the 2nd, Petition Delegation Preparing to go to Beijing

[Special Dispatch from Jinhua] The students of the Law, Agriculture, Engineering, Liberal Arts and Sciences of the National Yingshi University, who launched the relocation movement, expressed dissatisfaction with Minister Zhu's statement in Hangzhou that "the location of the school should not be changed", and have been on strike since May 2nd. The petition delegation is also preparing to go to Beijing early. In addition, the student union of the school recently discussed and decided on three steps to take in the future: (1) To implement the relocation movement and strive for it with the Ministry of Education again. (2) The expenses of the petition delegation have been approved by all the students and borrowed from the subsidy fees for public-funded students in May, June, and July. (3) To appeal to people from all walks of life to quickly determine the permanent location of the school and welcome the Ministry of Education to send personnel to Jin to conduct an on-site inspection. The students of the school are extremely nervous. The school sports meeting originally scheduled to be held on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month has been suspended. Most of the heads of various offices are avoiding meeting. The new president has been promised by Minister Zhu to be announced on the day he returns to Beijing, but under the current situation, whether the new president can come is extremely questionable.

### Yan Yangchu Arrives in San Francisco, Talks About China's Mass Education Movement

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 3rd] Chinese mass education expert Yan Yangchu arrived here yesterday. He told the press today that the people need peace and food the most. The Chinese people will never be full unless the 85 percent of their farmers can increase their production. The best way to increase production and become good citizens is to study. The Chinese mass education movement began 23 years ago, advocating a simple literacy movement for farmers, with each person knowing 1,300 characters. It is estimated that 80 million people can now read and write simply. In other words, the Chinese illiteracy rate has been reduced from 85 percent to 65 percent.

[United Press, San Francisco, 3rd] Dr. Yan Yangchu, the founder of the Chinese mass education movement, told reporters here that "A typical farmer can understand the democratic politics of 1947 with every character he knows, and despise the old backward methods." Yan is now in the United States raising funds for the printing house fund of the mass education movement.

### Parents of Wuben Students Advocate Severely Punishing the Students Who Caused Trouble at the Municipal Normal School and Fundamentally Solving the School Building Problem

Since the Wuben Municipal Girls' Middle School was vandalized by students from the affiliated middle school of the Municipal Normal School, all parties have expressed deep concern. The parents of the school's students were particularly indignant and convened an emergency meeting at the school yesterday afternoon. More than 60 parents attended and unanimously agreed that the students from the affiliated middle school of the Municipal Normal School had entered the girls' school, which was established at the same address, and wantonly vandalized public property, which was extremely arrogant. The authorities of the Municipal Normal School should immediately hand over the students who caused the trouble and punish them severely, and should not shirk responsibility. They decided to submit a report to the relevant authorities for a thorough investigation. Moreover, Wuben is a girls' school with a long history in the city, and it was moved to its current location last autumn. It shares a school building with the Municipal Normal School, which enrolls boys, and the affiliated middle school of the Municipal Normal School, and the distribution of use has not been resolved reasonably. For example, Wuben has 15 classes, while the affiliated middle school of the Municipal Normal School has only 5 classes, but in the proportion of school building allocation, Wuben only accounts for 30 to 40 percent, so that even the places under the stairs with extremely insufficient light are also used as classrooms. Such a situation clearly despises girls' education. Therefore, it was unanimously decided to request the relevant authorities to allocate an independent and complete school building to Wuben Girls' Middle School as soon as possible to fundamentally solve the problem.

### Central Corps Assists Poor Students, Launches Scholarship and Aid Movement, Total Fundraising Target is 3 Billion Yuan

This movement will end on June 30 this year.

### How to Be a Nation-Building Youth in the Great Era That Ended the Eight-Year War of Resistance

— Zhou Jixi

Can a prosperous and democratic new China be built in this great era? It depends entirely on whether we, this generation of young people, have strong physiques, noble characters, scientific knowledge, and democratic cultivation. If all the young people in our country possess the above-mentioned qualities, then everyone deserves to be called a nation-building youth. A brand-new, modern, and powerful East Asian country will surely be built and prosper in our hands. Therefore, whether our great cause of nation-building can be launched quickly and completed smoothly depends entirely on whether we, this generation of young people, can be nation-building youths. So, "how to be a nation-building youth"? Now, I would like to offer a few humble opinions and encourage young friends across the country who are ambitious, promising, and principled.

Improving Health Standards

First, to be a nation-building youth, we must improve our health standards. According to recently published figures, there are currently 1.16 million young students receiving education in middle schools in our country. However, because our compatriots are generally very poor, most young people are often malnourished, their bodies are aging prematurely, and they are weak and sickly. As a result, only 1% of the young people who applied for the air force passed the physical examination, and only 1-2% of those who applied for the navy passed the physical examination. How can such unhealthy young people build a prosperous, strong, healthy, and happy new China? There is a very popular saying in England: "A nation with third-rate physiques cannot create a first-rate country." We young people are the new citizens of the country and the vital force for nation-building. With such weak and sickly young people, I am afraid that we do not even qualify as third-rate citizens, so how can we build a first-rate power? Therefore, to create a truly first-rate country that lives up to its name, and to stand shoulder to shoulder with the three major powers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and soar in the world, we must improve the health standards of the people, especially the health standards of young people. How can we improve our health standards? Naturally, the most important thing is to pay attention to exercise. Not only should we exercise well in physical education classes, but we should also do morning exercises, class break exercises, and extracurricular exercises every day. We cannot go a day without eating, and we cannot go a day without exercising. Exercise does not necessarily require a large sports field and a lot of good sports equipment, and it is not only young students who need to exercise. Playing table tennis, badminton, practicing Tai Chi, and kicking shuttlecock, as well as freehand exercises, are all popular, easy, and healthy exercises. We young students should develop a lifestyle habit of enjoying exercise and exercising regularly every day. This will surely make our physiques transform from weak to strong, and turn the chronically weak and sick "sick man of East Asia" into a brave and fierce "martial man" who is strong and healthy. Secondly, we must pay attention to hygiene. Getting up early, going to bed early, having regular work and rest times, having a fixed amount of food, not eating raw and cold things, not having bad habits, and improving nutrition and developing other kinds of hygienic habits are all ways to strengthen the body, get rid of diseases, and improve health. I hope that all young people across the country will pay attention to exercise and hygiene, and forge our physiques into indestructible bodies, to be strong, brave, and promising nation-building youths.

Enriching Moral Cultivation

Second, to be a nation-building youth, we must have noble morals and personalities. The late American President Roosevelt said it well, "Knowledge without moral cultivation is like giving a new machine gun to a skilled robber." The great British writer George Bernard Shaw also said: "Human behavior in the world is partly enjoyment and partly contribution. If a person's contribution to society is more than their enjoyment, then they can be considered to have a personality. And the quality and quantity of their contribution can exceed the quality and quantity of their enjoyment. The greater the difference in proportion, the more impressive their personality becomes. Conversely, if a person's quality and quantity of enjoyment exceeds their contribution, then they are simply taking advantage of the crowd, and they should be considered to have no personality or a bankrupt personality." Our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen also taught us that "the purpose of life is to serve, not to seize." Therefore, to be a nation-building youth, we must cultivate the ability to contribute, serve the people, and strive and sacrifice for the transformation of society, the construction of the country, and the benefit of mankind with noble morals and personalities. In this great era of nation-building, looking at our country and society, there are many robbers who have knowledge but lack moral cultivation. The quality and quantity of what they enjoy often exceeds what they contribute. They aim to seize and not to serve. As a result, the entire country and society is in chaos, and the ignorant masses are in deep water. We, the nation-building youths who are determined to save the country and the people, must reverse their actions, contribute our knowledge and abilities, and even contribute our lives and property, to faithfully serve the construction of a prosperous, strong, healthy, and happy new society and new China, and be a "devoted" and "loyal" nation-building youth.

### Mayor's Private Residence Held Meeting Yesterday: Determined Plan to Suppress and Stabilize Grain Prices

Developing Grain Sources and Encouraging Rice Merchants to Freely Procure

In recent days, grain prices have soared, inevitably causing panic among the people. At 2:00 pm yesterday, Mayor Wu invited more than ten people, including Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Office, Fang Zhichao of the Administrative Office, and Yu Shuping, Acting Director of the Police Bureau, to his private residence to review the city's food problems. They all believed that there was no shortage of rice on the market, and that the increase in all goods was the result of panic among the people. In the future, it is decided to (1) request the higher authorities to increase the allocation of grain sources, (2) encourage grain merchants to freely procure, and (3) distribute grain. The Social Affairs Bureau will publish the names and locations of its stores every day so that the people can purchase and the government can supervise, etc. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 pm.

Three Parties Jointly Handle Rice Distribution

Also, it is reported that the mayor decided to convene a meeting with representatives of rice merchants and rice shops in the city again at 8:00 pm tonight at the Municipal Government. At that time, the representatives of the rice shops will request Mayor Wu to order the district offices to handle the purchase and distribution of rice based on household registration certificates, and the rice shops will send shop assistants to assist. Regarding this issue, Mayor Wu stated that rice merchants cannot shirk their responsibility for distributing household rice. The Municipal Government has now issued a document to notify the grain and rice shops and the police sub-bureaus and district offices to jointly handle the matter, and has formulated detailed rules for rice distribution, stipulating the distribution volume and types of rice for each rice shop, etc. The mayor also guaranteed that 10,000 shi of rice will be taken out of the warehouse every day, and efforts will be made to simplify the procedures and there will be no intentional delays. If any rice shops are found not to supply the market, the Municipal Government has ordered the police bureau to investigate strictly.

We Have Ordered Foreign Rice from Switzerland

[Our Report] It is reported that the Ministry of Food is currently in contact with Switzerland to order a large amount of foreign rice. According to sources from the Central Trust Bureau, our country has ordered a lot of foreign rice overseas. The current problem is how to ship it on time to alleviate the food shortage during this lean season. Regarding the rumor that the foreign rice ordered is all second-class goods, when the reporter inquired with the relevant parties, the reply was: Among the foreign rice purchased, there is no shortage of high-grade rice, but among the Siamese rice, there must be a few percent of Xian rice. In addition, our country is currently negotiating with Argentina to purchase 100,000 tons of wheat. It is said that the negotiations are proceeding very smoothly, but the contract has not yet been signed.

### Adjusting Flour Rationing Price Can Be Decided Within This Week

Fuxin and other major flour mills in this city have recently requested Mayor Wu to increase the rationing price due to the high cost of raw materials. It is reported that Wu has agreed to adjust the rationing price after the closing of the Field and Grain Conference, so it can be resolved within this week. However, the cost submitted by the industry to Mayor Wu last time was calculated based on a wheat price of 110,000 yuan. The current wheat price has risen to 140,000 yuan, and the cost has also increased. Moreover, the wheat on the market is becoming increasingly depleted. Therefore, the industry will ask the authorities to allocate raw materials for flour milling or supply the market with foreign flour at a fixed price.

### Establishing a Regulatory Committee to Solve Edible Oil Supply

Regarding the issue of edible oil supply in Shanghai, it is reported that the authorities have decided to establish an edible oil regulatory committee, which will be jointly composed of seven units including the Municipal Government, the Central Trust Bureau, the Central Agricultural Bank, the Oil Extraction Industry Association, the China Vegetable Oil Factory, the Oil Commercial Association, and vendors. Today, each unit will submit a list of names, and after verification, it is scheduled to be formally established on Wednesday. In order to cooperate with this measure, the Central Trust Bureau has already shipped 6,000 tons of soybeans to Shanghai yesterday.

### Sale of Household Rice Rations; Bureau of Social Affairs Approves Rice Shop List

To alleviate public panic about insufficient grain, the Bureau of Social Affairs is releasing nine thousand bags of white japonica and Siamese rice daily, totaling over eleven thousand "shi" (a unit of measurement) for the city, distributing them to various rice shops for retail. It is stipulated that citizens must present their household registration certificate when purchasing rationed rice from the shops. The Bureau of Social Affairs also notified the rice shops to register for verification. Currently, the Bureau has approved over six hundred and fifty rice shops. A list of the rice shops and their addresses is published below for citizens to consult when purchasing rationed rice.

If the report is false, it will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. The number of newly added or newly started machines will not be allocated yarn for the time being. The yarn will be allocated when the company's cotton yarn production increases.

### Minor Losses to Various Sugar Factories in Taiwan During the February 28 Incident; Taiwan Sugar Corporation General Manager Shen Issues Statement

[Reported by this newspaper] Shen Zhennan, General Manager of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, returned to Shanghai a few days ago after completing negotiations in Nanjing regarding fertilizers used by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. According to him, after the February 28 Incident in Taiwan was quelled, he went to various sugar factories throughout the island to inspect them starting on April 7. Company colleagues in various places are generally safe. The loss of public property in various units is also minor.

He said: Taiwan Sugar is the most important industry in Taiwan Province. Twenty thousand employees depend on it for work, and one hundred thousand farmers depend on it for their livelihood. Since the restoration of Taiwan Province, a large part of the factory restoration work has been completed. In addition to the large amount of restoration funds and working capital provided by the Bank of Taiwan, a loan of US$5 million was recently obtained from the Bank of China to purchase hardware materials from foreign countries, so that the plan to complete the restoration of 30 factories by the end of this year can be completed. The area under sugarcane cultivation has reached 90,000 hectares, exceeding the intended target. Therefore, the plan to produce 300,000 tons of sugar next year can be achieved, and it can earn foreign exchange for the country at US$400 per ton exported. However, sugarcane seeds need to be sown in batches from July and August of this year to March of next year. Therefore, to complete this plan, 80,000 tons of fertilizer will be needed this year. Of this, in addition to the 20,000 tons that can be supplied domestically, the remaining 60,000 tons must be obtained from foreign countries, which will cost US$100 per ton, for a total of US$6 million in foreign exchange. However, in the second quarterly quota of imports currently announced, fertilizer accounts for only US$500,000, which must be distributed across the country and will be insufficient.

However, he pointed out that if the Taiwan Sugar Corporation can obtain sufficient fertilizer, simply to complete the plan to produce 400,000 tons of sugar, then in addition to 300,000 tons for domestic consumption, another 100,000 tons will be promoted for export, and the country can earn US$40 million in foreign exchange in one year. The income will be ten times the foreign exchange expenditure when purchasing fertilizer. It is really beneficial to balancing our country's international balance of payments.

### More on "Trachoma"

— Lu Nanshan

A reader of this newspaper previously inquired whether a mixture of yellow lead oxide and grass carp bile could be used to treat trachoma.

Yellow lead oxide is a lead oxide. Metallic lead is heated to 400 degrees Celsius to become a red powder, also known as red lead or lead oxide. The Shen Nong Ben Cao Lun states that its nature and taste are spicy, slightly cold, and poisonous. Its efficacy and indications are all for surgical use. For ophthalmology, its use is limited to external application. For example, the Jade Dragon Pill and Sou Feng San in the Shen Shi Yao Han are both used with other drugs to apply to the eyelids. Moreover, the texture of yellow lead oxide is rough. Even if it is ground extremely finely, it is still inevitable that there will be residues. Once it is dripped into the eyes, it will inevitably damage the cornea and increase eye diseases. Therefore, any eye doctor's limited drug manufacturing is very fine. It takes years of grinding, refining, and calcining to make it. It is not possible for ordinary patients to coarsely manufacture it themselves to treat trachoma. Be careful. The bitter and cold nature of grass carp bile allows it to treat red eyes and cataracts. Therefore, it is often used in ophthalmology. It can still be effective for mild cases of conjunctivitis in the early stages of trachoma. However, this medicine cannot be used alone and must be refined. For example, the Bear Bile Paste in the Shen Shi Yao Han is made of grass carp bile combined with other medicines. Therefore, this medicine is really one of the auxiliary medicines.

Trachoma is a common and prevalent eye disease. Face cloths and handkerchiefs in public places and other objects that come into contact with the eyes, or working in crowded places with unclean conditions, with dust and sand irritating the eyes, are most likely to spread the infection. In the early stages of this disease, there are often no subjective symptoms. Usually, both eyes are affected. Later, there will be secretions in the morning, itching, and tearing. The patient will feel burning and pain, as if there is ash and sand embedded in the eyes, and the vision will gradually become blurred. The most important thing about this disease is that it is prone to corneal pannus, also known as vascular pannus, and inner skin emergency, which leads to ingrown eyelashes or other dangerous conditions, which can cause partial or complete blindness. Mild cases of trachoma can be cured. If the disease has been around for a long time and is severe, as long as the treatment is appropriate, there is no one who cannot be cured. However, it is necessary to prevent recurrence. Ancient ophthalmology books call this disease "pepper sores" and "drug sores" and have internal medicine prescriptions, such as the Gui Shao Hong Hua San and the Chu Feng Qing Pi Yin in the Shen Shi Yao Han, and the Qing Pi Liang Xue Tang in the Yi Zong Jin Jian. They can be effective for the early stages and inflammation of this disease. Trachoma that has been around for a long time is of no avail; therefore, surgery is used. The way to perform surgery also depends on the severity of the condition. Therefore, those who have not suffered from trachoma must prevent it. Those who have suffered from trachoma must go to an ophthalmologist for a detailed diagnosis and treatment on the spot to be safe.

### Fermented Soybeans

— Zhang Zanchen

(Combined with penicillin and streptomycin)

In China, during the Han Dynasty, Zhang Zhongjing used Zhi Shi Tang, and during the Jin Dynasty, Ge Zhichuan used Cong Shi Tang Sheng Seng San, which all contained fermented soybeans. Fermented soybeans are the remains of green mold parasitized by microorganisms, and contain penicillin. The ancients used them to treat plague and heat, which shows that they knew the wonderful meaning of this early on.

In the field of surgery, there is a kind of onion and fermented soybean cake used to treat carbuncles and large toxins. Applying the onion and fermented soybean cake to the affected area and using ironing and moxibustion methods is similar to the external use of penicillin.

Foreign scientists know that penicillin needs to be refrigerated to avoid heat. Ancient Chinese doctors used it in decoctions, or ironing and moxibustion, and the efficacy was inevitably discounted. This is the difference between refined and crude.

Before penicillin came to China, I often used fermented soybeans to treat various external diseases, and each time I received extraordinary results. Now that penicillin is popular in China, I often encounter cases of carbuncles and cellulitis. After others have used injections of this product without success, I use Yang He Tang to treat them, and the effect is very rapid. - This really has its own strengths, why abandon oneself to follow others?

### Beriberi Attacking the Heart

— Gong Peiying

The disease of beriberi attacking the heart is caused by toxins in the blood. The so-called attacking the heart means that the toxins invade the heart, causing the heart to be paralyzed and die. Therefore, if you suffer from beriberi, you should seek medical treatment as soon as possible. Otherwise, it is very dangerous to attack the heart, and there are those who cannot be rescued: The newspaper reported in the past: "So-and-so was sick with swollen feet. He called a car on the road to take him home. Suddenly, he had qi reversal and fell to the ground and died." This is because the toxins attacked the heart, and the heart was paralyzed and died immediately. Since beriberi attacking the heart is a symptom caused by blood toxins, the treatment should focus on detoxification therapy. The best detoxification medicines are rhino horn, antelope horn, musk, bezoar, and cinnabar. Appropriate prescriptions include: Qian Jin Xi Jiao Shi Fu Hua Tang, Chi Shui Xuan Zhu Jiao Qi Yi Ren San, Yu Shu Dan, Su He Xiang Wan, Ju Fang Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan, all of which are blood disinfection medicines for beriberi attacking the heart.

### Children's Pneumonia

— You Xuezhou

The occurrence of pneumonia is due to the invasion of pneumococcus, which is called acute pneumonia, or primary pneumonia; it is also due to delayed infectious diseases such as measles, typhoid fever, smallpox, and whooping cough, which is called local pneumonia, or secondary pneumonia. Changes in climate and weakening of resistance are the major reasons for the rapid changes in pneumonia patients.

The initial symptoms of this disease are chills, fever, coughing, and vomiting, similar to a cold. Then the fever gets worse, with some reaching 41 degrees Celsius. The pulse is rapid, there is a rattling sound in the phlegm, coughing is frequent, shortness of breath, and nasal flaring, with no nasal discharge or tears. After the fever subsides, the cough loosens, the breathing becomes even, and the disease begins to improve. The period lasts for about a week or more. If the fever lingers and does not subside, and the shortness of breath and nasal flaring continue to increase, then the pulse will become thin and rapid, the face will turn cyanotic, and the patient will fall into a coma and die from exhaustion. If it is caused by delayed treatment of typhoid fever, measles, etc., the fever and cough will persist for a long time without subsiding, gradually leading to difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, nasal flaring, turning into convulsions, and eventually being incurable.

The character "inflammation" has the meaning of heat, so ordinary people think that pneumonia is lung heat, and the pulse is rapid and the body temperature is high, so they prefer to use medicine that is biased towards clearing and cooling. In fact, it is not necessarily so. The condition must be carefully examined and medicine must be used according to the symptoms. Clearing and cooling agents cannot be abandoned, and pungent and warm products such as Fuzi and Guizhi should also be used accordingly. The fever of pneumonia is often caused by cold phlegm obstructing the inside, the lung qi not being able to circulate, and the circulation of the lungs being obstructed. Then the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other wastes in the blood will inevitably increase. The heart initiates a rescue effect, so breathing increases, the pulse is rapid, and the body temperature rises. The treatment should use pungent and warm products such as Ma Huang and Guizhi to stimulate the lung blood vessels, encourage heart function, and cause the sweat glands to open up, so that the virus has a chance to be discharged.

In the early stages of pneumonia, when the muscles are hot and there is no sweat, the cough is not smooth, the breathing is rapid, the tongue coating is white, and the pulse is rapid, Sheng Ma Huang, Bai Jie Zi, Guang Yu Jin, Zhi Ban Xia, Ju Hong, Xing Ren, Zi Wan, Yuan Zhi, Tian Jiang Ke, etc. are used to open up the qi. For severe cases, Ma Huang should be used in large doses. If there is coughing, phlegm, drowsiness, and startle, and there are signs of wind and convulsions, Zhu Dan Xing, Gan Wan Pu, Huo Ci Shi, Sheng Mu Li, and Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan can be added. If the muscle heat is not relieved by sweating, the tongue is moist, the pulse is soft, the patient is tired, and the eyes are exposed, indicating that the heart yang is weak, then Huang Fu Pian, Chuan Gui Zhi, Dan Gan Jiang, Wu Wei Zi, Bai Jie Zi, Zhi Ban Xia, and Ju Hong are used urgently, with the main focus on restoring yang and strengthening the heart. If the disease has occurred several times, the pulse is weak, the limbs are cold, the cough is reversed, and water and drinks are not tolerated, then Huang Fu Pian, Hei Xi Dan, Ci Shi, Long Gu, and Mu Li should be used in large doses.

Pneumonia with a crimson tongue, yellow coating, thirst for drinking, cough, phlegm, rapid breathing, and nasal flaring should be treated with a bias towards clearing and cooling, using Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang as the main prescription. If it is complicated with hot infectious diseases such as measles and typhoid fever, the symptoms of pneumonia should be relieved first to avoid causing unexpected changes. If these infectious diseases have not been cured for a long time and have turned into pneumonia due to delayed treatment, and the heat toxin has not been resolved, Da Xiao Qing Long Tang combined with Jie Du Tang has considerable effect. In pneumonia with rapid breathing and nasal flaring, the chest must be raised, so it is called lung distention in ancient times. Mustard seed powder can be mixed with honey and applied externally. If it is easily blistered, Jin Huang Ru Yi San can be mixed with honeysuckle dew and applied. It has the effect of relieving inflammation and swelling. When used together with internal medicine, the effect is faster.

### Fort Pi-tzu-wo Outside Lushun

— Special Correspondent for the Northeast, Han Qingtao

This newspaper, Shenyang, 24th (Airmail Dispatch)

Pi-tzu-wo quietly stands on the eastern coast of the Liaodong Peninsula. In the past, it was a land of fish and salt within the Japanese "Kwantung Leased Territory." Today, it has a new life, a lookout point and a coastal fortress.

The Lushun naval base警戒 line defined by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship is somewhat smaller than the former "Kwantung Leased Territory." Pi-tzu-wo is just outside the line, making it the first important city bordering the area without any political elements.

Ancient Trading Port

Here, the coastline is very long, with numerous harbors. It is a very old trading port. Except for the winter freezing period, ships come and go continuously, reaching Dalian, Yantai to the south, and Andong and various Korean ports to the north.

Closer by are Dagu Mountain, Zhuanghe, and the Changshan Islands, where ship traffic is frequent. Chengzi-tong, the mouth of the Biliu River, Zanzi River, and Liangshui Bay are crowded with fishing boats, dotted with sails, with the seawater gently flowing, creating a majestic scene.

The "Jincheng" railway from Jinzhou to Chengzi-tong, north of Pi-tzu-wo, is the transportation facility that connects this area to Lushun and Dalian.

Pi-tzu-wo is a militarily important area along the coast of the Liaodong Peninsula. Although it has the disadvantage of vast, shallow beaches that prevent ships from docking, it is compensated by Guanglu Island, Dachangshan Island, and Xiaochangshan Island in the Changshan Islands, all of which can accommodate ships. Haiyang Island is even more like an excellent port. The distance from the coast is only a few nautical miles for closer islands, and no more than fifty nautical miles for those further away, so the shortcomings can be overcome.

Changshan Islands

Looking back at the history of Japan's invasion of the Liaodong Peninsula, we can see that Japan once landed at "Huayuan Kou" and "Yanda Ao" near Pi-tzu-wo, occupied Pi-tzu-wo, and then advanced towards Jinzhou and other places, all of which demonstrate its strategic importance.

We need to use sea, land, and air transportation to take over Dalian. Or, in the future, when our navy displays its power at sea, and warships need to refuel and resupply, being too far from Kent Island, the Changshan Islands off the coast of Pi-tzu-wo are very ideal.

However, the Soviet army has already stationed troops on several large islands in the Changshan Islands, such as Changshan Island and Haiyang Island. According to people's reports, there are also Communist troops there. At the second meeting between the first-line generals of China and the Soviet Union in Pulandian, the Soviet general replied to questions about the Changshan Islands, saying: "That area is within the boundaries of the naval base, and the Soviet Union has a garrison command there."

The Lushun naval base is clearly defined in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, which states that it is "used jointly by China and the Soviet Union," so, of course, the national army can travel to, dock at, and use the Changshan Islands.

Lushun, Dalian, the Changshan Islands... are Chinese territory. During the thirty years of joint use agreed upon by China and the Soviet Union, there is a real need for sincere "friendship" and effective "cooperation."

Fishermen's Paradise

The waters of Pi-tzu-wo, with the vast area formed by the sixteen islands of the Changshan Islands, large and small, are a paradise for fishermen. During the Japanese control, there was a "Toyo Whaling Company Kwantung Prefecture Business Factory." The "Aozi Fish" produced near Zhangzi Island were famous. From the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), the Japanese used diving equipment to engage in fishing, achieving great harvests.

Local fishermen told reporters: "In the past, there were over a thousand fishing boats around Changshan, Guanglu, Haiyang, Zhangzi, and Daxiaohaozi (Rat) Islands, each catching three to four thousand catties of bighead, smooth, and miscellaneous fish daily. Now, there are only sixty-plus fishing boats registered with the fisheries association because, after the restoration, fishing boats were either taken away or destroyed. In addition, local unrest has led to a decrease."

Rich Salt Fields

The sixteen islands have a population of approximately 60,000, most of whom directly or indirectly make a living by fishing. Besides many seafood fish and shrimp, there are also famous products such as "sea cucumber" and "scallops." However, their fishing techniques still follow traditional methods, such as twenty-three pieces of "纲" (Gang) and thirty-five to forty pieces of "挂网" (Gua Wang), which are their only fishing tools. If mass production of salt is desired, improvements must be made.

Pi-tzu-wo's fish terraces are well-known, and its salt production is even more widely renowned. Pi-tzu-wo has all the salt fields and equipment, which are among the best in the country.

After the Russo-Japanese War, Pi-tzu-wo was assigned to the jurisdiction of Japan's Kwantung Leased Territory. The Japanese then engaged in salt production development. In the thirty-second year of the Guangxu Emperor (1906), the "Man-Han Company" was established to begin building salt fields, later renamed "Japan Jiyo Kabushiki Kaisha," gradually expanding and forcibly buying out civil beaches. The salt fields operated included the "Jiaxinzi," "Donglaotan," and "Biliuhe" three fields.

In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic (1939), the "Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha Pi-tzu-wo Salt Industry Place" also opened fields in Pi-tzu-wo, Songjiatun, and Qingshuihe. As soon as construction was completed, they declared defeat.

In the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), "Japan Jiyo Kabushiki Kaisha" established a "processed salt factory" in Donglaotan. In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic (1938), a "Kali factory" was established in Jiaxinzi.

After the August 15th Restoration, the Communist army established a salt affairs agency here, only selling most of the originally stored salt catties and failing to restore public difficulties.

The area and output of the Pi-tzu-wo salt fields, according to statistical figures, are as follows:

Qingshuihe, Songjiatun, Pi-tzu-wo, Jiaxinzi, Donglaotan, Biliuhe, and other six salt fields, a total of 4,939 public strands (陌, mo), with an annual salt production of 4 million dan; 610 privately owned strands, with an annual salt production of 730,000 dan, totaling 5,549 strands of public and private salt fields, with an annual production of 4.73 million dan. One strand is 10,000 square meters, and one dan is calculated as 100 catties.

The "Processed Salt" factory produces one type of washing salt, and the "Kali Factory" produces boiled salt, saltified kali, potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, sodium sulfide, high-temperature crystals, low-temperature crystals, brine blocks, and bromine.

The main equipment of the salt fields is that all the water extraction in the fields uses electric motors, transportation is done by light railways, and each field has underground water wells, directly sending the brine to the factory as raw material. A substation and water source are set up in Donglaotan, dedicated to the use of all salt fields and factories. After the Restoration, apart from the Soviets and the Communist army transporting some of the housing, electrical railways, factory machinery, and various equipment, the cluster was repeatedly stolen and moved by the ignorant local people.

The "Jinzhou Salt Field Public Office" took over these salt fields and began planning to resume work, but due to the interruption of the power supply and the destruction of the power poles, wires, and electric motors, most of the salt fields could not be filled with seawater. Under duress, they are handling the addition of wooden waterwheels to replace electricity,勉强开晒(Mianqiang kaisai, barely manage to dry), only accounting for about one-third of the entire salt field, which has been leased out and has begun to work in the fields, and salt can be produced by the end of April. The rest can only be dried after the power supply is restored, and other work cannot be carried out, which is due to artificial deficiencies and insufficient capacity!

The reporter once went to visit the "Jiaxinzi Salt Beach," more than 20 miles away from Pi-tzu-wo, sitting on a light railway pushing away. Looking at the great scene of the salt field, the continuous square salt fields lay there dry and lifeless. The stone houses of the workers, very strong, had no roofs, no doors and windows. The small locomotive was missing parts and could not be started. The power poles had no wires, and everything was out of order.

The situation inside the factory was dismal. The boilers for boiling salt were rusty and corroded, and the machines in the washing plant had no belts. The machines were even more severely damaged by rust, making people unwilling to look any further.

Nearly two years have passed since the liberation of the Northeast, twenty-plus months of time. These machines have been exposed to wind and rain and corroded in the factories without doors and windows. When the Communist army was here, they sold a large portion of the stored salt and took away all the belts and other things, without doing any restoration work.

It has been more than three months since the national army recovered it. The Jinzhou Salt Field Public Office sent people to take over in February of this year. According to the person in charge: "Without electricity or coal, it is difficult to start work. However, the Public Office has formulated a comprehensive resumption plan for all salt affairs in the county. The resumption fee is 2 billion Northeast Circulation Certificates, and resumption may begin sequentially in the near future."

In addition to sadness, everyone feels that if they work hard immediately, there is still endless hope. Otherwise, the salt fields will become even more barren, and the machines will soon become scrap iron.

### Roar, Pi-xiu

The origin of the name "Pi-tzu-wo" is that there is a mountain head by the sea at the west end of the street, which the locals call Dragon Head Mountain. The mountain has cave nests, and in ancient times, many Pi-xiu (mythical wild animals) lived in them, so it was given this name.

The original administrative division of the area was twenty associations (会, hui), each association having multiple villages (屯, tun). Now, it has been changed to four streets and one hundred villages, including five associations and thirty-two villages on the islands, totaling 24,256 households and 185,650 people. The original 1,700 Japanese residents have already been repatriated.

Pi-tzu-wo is backed by mountains and faces the sea, with a magnificent momentum. The streets are very neat, and the buildings are also very good. The entire area has nearly thirty middle and primary schools, with spacious and magnificent school buildings. Unfortunately, there is no funding. Teachers are not paid, some are indeed "枵腹從公" (Xiaofu cong gong, serving the public on an empty stomach), and students have no textbooks to read, causing them to shed tears in anxiety.

This coastal fortress of the Liaodong Peninsula needs to be strengthened and expanded. The abundance of fish and salt needs to be fully utilized. The education of Pi-tzu-wo, which was recently recovered, can no longer be ignored, otherwise, it will not withstand the onslaught of violent storms.

### High School Student Calls for Suspension of Joint Examination

Dear Students;

After the promulgation of the law that this year's high school graduation joint examination must be held, our group of senior high school students became extremely panicked and uneasy. The joint examination is related to the fate of our graduating classmates, and we have no choice but to petition the education authorities to postpone the examination.

Eight years of war have dealt a huge blow and devastation to education. In this environment, of course, we cannot learn a complete education. Moreover, during the war, the textbooks used in each school under special evil forces could not be unified. Unable to receive a systematic education, the uneven level is inevitable. How can we forcibly impose a unified examination? The announcement date of the joint examination is too tight. Within this short period of time, we have to review the three-year curriculum from the beginning. Even if we work day and night without rest, forcibly memorizing the review, and are lucky enough to cope with it, this kind of speculative nature is very dangerous, and it is a great harm to the health of the students themselves. Isn't this too far from the essence of Zeng Zi (Confucius' Disciple)?

The Education Bureau mentioned that the joint examination is to improve the level of students, but students study for the sake of passing the examination, for the sake of competing for points and a graduation certificate, and work day and night, exhausting themselves. In fact, they still cannot get a complete understanding. How can this improve the level of students? Therefore, we hope that the Education Bureau will start from the fundamentals as soon as possible. Improving the level of students is not something that can be achieved by a single examination. Now, our education funding only accounts for 3.7 percent. The cost of the joint examination is huge and feels wasteful. Moreover, after the joint examination, there will still be a university entrance examination. The joint examination is really unnecessary. Rather than putting a huge sum of money on a meaningless joint examination, it is better to increase education funding and stabilize the lives of teachers in order to truly improve the standard of education.

Dear students, now we can no longer wait in silence. For our own benefit, we should quickly unite to respond to the demands of Nanjing classmates, and petition the education authorities with a firm and sincere heart, hoping that the education authorities will accept our request to stop the joint examination. (Wuguang Girls' High School)

Editor's Note: At the same time, we received the same appeal from Shanghai Xinzhong High School, so we will not publish it.

Spring and Autumn

### Declaration of the Shanghai Literary Writers Association

It is undeniable that Shanghai is the cultural center of the country and the hub of cultural exchange in the Far East. The dynamics of Shanghai writers not only affect writers across the country, but the Shanghai writers' group is also of concern to both Chinese and foreign observers, and is noticed by writers around the world. This was the case before the war, and it is still the case after the war. However, looking around, writer organizations and the trend of participating in groups were not very prevalent before the war, and are even more lonely after the war. This is certainly because our nationality is not long in organization, and it is also due to the reasons that the writers' group is not interested, less contact, and less compatible. But the reality in front of us is even more undeniable, it is a fragmented and self-governing situation; as a literary writer who is a spiritual technician, it seems that he should first assume the responsibility of spiritual education. In this environment, jointly establish a new writing belief and a new writing style, in order to promote the era and create the era. We also believe that women's art circles should be democratic first and then democratic, and should be unified first and then unified. Therefore, we believe that sectarianism and门户之见 (menhu zhijian, bias and prejudice, literally "the view of the door/family") hinder this goal; we believe that all colleagues who regard literary and artistic undertakings as their career should unite; we believe that there should be not only no conflicts and friction between literary and artistic groups, but they should be complementary to each other, and help each other to stand. Especially in Shanghai, there are so many writers and the gardens are so barren, we hope that sister groups will continue to emerge, and go hand in hand.

To put it a step further, we believe that the same theme of a work, based on the different thoughts and personalities of the writers, will definitely have different reflections and different strokes; this is precisely the characteristic of literature and art, and also the road of literature and art. We should not only recognize this multi-faceted characteristic and broad road, but also cherish it. Therefore, we only ask whether you are loyal to art? Are you loyal to your feelings and experiences? Are you loyal to the freedom of writing? No one needs to ask anyone's religious beliefs or political relationships. They are all good friends and all hope to join this group. We want to ask a question: Why can't a country's limited number of writers be integrated? Therefore, Shanghai's literary and artistic groups not only do not have to build a big door, it is best not to let even the boundaries of nationality exist. Our group not only wants to shake hands with famous writers who have been writing for decades, but also wants to shake hands with young writers who are courageous to work and have unlimited prospects. However, in order to commemorate the May Fourth New Culture Movement, to cooperate in creating new literature and art, and to experiment with the May Fourth spirit of new ideals, we were established in a hurry. However, this is the beginning of work and the beginning of unity. We hope that writers living in Shanghai will participate, and writers from scattered areas will give more guidance, and jointly promote our new ideal for the relationship between literary and artistic writers.

### Literature and Life - Congratulating the Establishment of the Shanghai Literary Writers Association

— Xu Shiqi

I am a person engaged in painting work, with a strong interest in literature and art; although I am very interested in literature and art, I feel a headache every time I write, and Tong Wen often criticizes me for knowing the meaning of "meeting friends with literature and assisting benevolence." Now that the Shanghai Literary Writers Association has been established, I cannot but say a word to live long, so I will talk about "Literature and Life".

What is life? Each person's subjective views on this question are different. Shakespeare believes that life is a drama, and the joys and sorrows constitute a dramatic life. Li Bai regards life as a dream, and expresses his personal fantasies about the universe, creating great poems. Tolstoy, he said: "Life is hard work, not an enjoyment." "Art for life." Life is sometimes like a bunch of beautiful flowers, vivid and fragrant, and sometimes like turbulent waves, ten thousand feet in the sky, broad and magnificent, and indescribable. Or as heavy as Mount Tai, or as light as a feather, what exactly is life? It is difficult to give a precise answer.

The two words "literature and art", when separated, are literature and art, and when combined, they contain the art of literature, or artistic words, the meaning of art is very broad, according to the common saying, "a technique that makes the things of the natural world adapt to the use of human life", but human activities have two different goals, one is need, and the other is appreciation, making pottery with soil, and building houses by craftsmen, are just activities to meet needs, and painters' works and musical performances are activities to meet appreciation. Thus, art is also divided into two types, those made for needs are practical arts, and those created for appreciation are pure arts or fine arts.

All art is symbolic, so Hegel's (Hcgel) argument is that the more material foundations that art relies on, the lower the character, and the less the higher the character, so architecture is the lowest-grade art, and poetry is the highest-grade art, because the medium it relies on is only a symbolic symbol of words, and it can give the reader the whole concept.

Literature, in its broad sense, can include the entire scope of human life and human activities, as well as all known phenomena of nature. It is the greatest source of indirect experience for us, keeping the past world immortal. Through the medium of literature, we can meet ancient philosophers such as Confucius, Qu Yuan, Plato, Aristotle, and meet in a room, without leaving the house, and be able to travel spiritually to the world's famous capitals of Egypt, Babylon, Athens, and Rome, expanding the ideal world in the subject.

The Italian Renaissance movement in the fifteenth century was the cornerstone of modern human civilization, and the first of the New Culture Movement. Our Shanghai Literary Writers Association was established in the Fifth Fourth, which is due to its profound significance and great mission.

### Flower

— Luo Ming

One

Who deeply and sincerely harvests the initial love of girls, and who cultivates the heart field that breeds the hope of spring. Do you know who is the happiest person, drinking the honey of love, looking forward to a bright tomorrow?

Can you imagine a person devoid of emotion? Going to and fro coldly in the lonely human world. Can you imagine an unlucky person? The sorrow of being abandoned outside the door of happiness.

Swimming in the garden pond of emotional life, writing attempted poems, boasting of the years as leisurely as white clouds. You young people, have you ever been delighted to receive the initial blessing?

Beautiful flowers will not bear solid fruits, and it is true that the best ending is often the worst beginning. If you seek the love of young people and can return without breaking the budding hope with thorns, this is the best lyric poem. Naturally, the disillusionment of extravagance is painful. Have you ever been saddened by your bottomless shoes? Even a pair of bottomless shoes should step forward. This may be a lovely story. One day, a pair of slender hands will be busy, and you will get a pair of shoes sewn with your heart, so warm and delicate.

The flowers and leaves are about to be colorful, and the dreams are often deep. Who doesn't write this prelude to youth with a page of poetic feeling?

Two

Is it the eyes of the girl that gave you the deepest affection, or will you never forget this deep pupil?

In me, there is a clear memory: when I showed the scattered pages of my youth, I was once inspired by a pair of eyes. The season of life's maturity: you have the right to enter the garden of March from the childish wilderness. From that time on, I treasured my own life, and I was proud that I had the initial bloom of youth.

I have not forgotten the joy of receiving the blessings from the initial eyes, nor have I dropped the joy of being comforted for the first time. Oh, those long years, I was immersed in delicate longing, like an excellent sculptor, I decorated my own mood. I wanted so far, and after that opportunity of intimacy, I also had the courage to send my overflowing scenery shyly.

If youth is irrigated by love, then my life will never wither and die.

Three

Every young man has his own dreamland. Some are intoxicated by scarlet dreams, some are delighted by golden dreams, some are enthusiastic about purple dreams, and some have cried for dark and desolate dreams.

Dreams are like light clouds on the Aegean Sea, fleeting and light. Now everyone is pursuing that fleeting and light dream.

Some people say: dreams are created by geniuses, then glory will belong to young people with creative genius. If the great Confucians firmly believe that life is always intertwined with selfishness and ridicule, then indulging in this cup of sweet wine of love will never have the best flavor. Therefore, I can't help but feel sad for that vulgar situation, and I hope to find a dark red paradise to create my future. — Although this is still a young man's romantic dream.

I should thank a pure and sincere girl, she guided me into a dream. It was she who told me that the wilderness of friendship can build a love tree in the courtyard, where there is our common paradise. So, on a hazy moonlit night, by the river in the shade of the trees and by the small window with curtains hanging, we walked with love.

Perhaps that's how it started, I felt the value of life, and I also explored the most sincere and noble nature of mankind.

So, I, you, and he, dedicate a talent and maturity to one person, and give all the life's ideals and hopes to him. I am singing for the first bloom of a girl's heart.

### Remembrance

— Zhou Huazhen

When leisure and peace are around me,

I remember the past——

Happiness and joy jump in my heart.

You are with me,

We——

Wander on the roadside.

Listen to the whispers of souls.

Exchange knowing glances.

Remembrance,

Constantly——

Remembrance!

You are like the hometown I miss;

A place where I played as a child,

We would also visit together.

Now——

Regret grows old with the years,

Sadness grows with time.

I don't know——

What to use to forget?

What to use to cheer up?

Or will carry——

Eternal melancholy and remembrance,

Slowly pass through——

The vast ocean of life.

When leisure and peace are around me

I remember the past——

The sadness of life flutters in my heart.

### Nocturne

— Shao Za

Go chase her back

While this quiet spring night

The sky is covered with dreamlike mist

The crescent moon is hazy and the fragrance of flowers is heavy

Go chase her back

While this pipa complains

The spring tide in the distance is rushing

There is a slight voice whispering for a crossing

Go chase her back

While this deserted spring is cold

The nightingale's voice across the mountain is melodious

Under the cold plum forest, a tear is being thrown to the ends of the earth

### Prayer

— Xiang Jun

I am a young sailor on my first voyage,

Hoping to always be accompanied by ambition -

I am a sailboat drifting at sea,

Let me be the harbor where I anchor;

I am a hardworking gardener

Go to moisten the soil,

Never sparing my blood and sweat

I am in the middle of the cold winter

The tall pine tree standing in the mountains,

I also hope to include a spring breeze.

### Wells' Prophecy

— Yang Bao

The late Wells (H. G. Wells) who passed away a few years ago, was a famous writer and prophet. He was once asked: "Sir, in this crazy world, where do you foresee yourself being in ten years?"

"In ten years," he replied, "I will inevitably face one of two fates: either die, or be locked away in a 'non-insane asylum'."

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

He Jian was disappointed. He scanned the crowd, seeing that everyone's expressions were normal, with no hint of criticism or resentment. Feeling slightly relieved, he dismissed the staff and asked Shouyi, Li Ming, and the Korean comrade, "What do you think?..."

Everyone remained silent, except for Shouyi, who mumbled, "It's done!"

"I ask you one thing," He Jian said to the staff member, "Today's events can be seen as extremely serious, or as nothing at all; therefore, please keep it a secret, and do not mention a single word to anyone: strictly enforce this regarding everything that happened today!"

Upon hearing this, the staff member did not dare to answer, but stood rigidly at attention, saluting in response.

This interrogation concluded. Regarding its effectiveness, everyone present agreed that the method was a failure, but the goal was achieved. The ultimate goal was to determine whether this staff member was colluding with the paper ball-throwing youth. Now it was clear that the staff member was very frank; his answers showed no signs of deception or concealment of facts, so everyone, especially Li Ming, who proposed the interrogation, was satisfied. This lead was thus dismissed.

Around seven o'clock, Shouyi and the others dispersed. From seven o'clock to nine-thirty was the time agreed upon for exchanging information; from nine-thirty to ten o'clock sharp, the four parties would meet and begin operations. The exchange of information was centered around the International Hotel, and Mr. Zongjian was naturally the host of this center.

"No new discoveries." This was the first phone call received by Mr. Qiejian, made after Zheng Yan returned. "No new discoveries" specifically referred to the fact that before Zheng Yan returned, he had taken a detour through Hongkou to visit the Wansui Hall to see if there were any new developments. At the same time, there was also a hint of hope that Ping would miraculously appear safe and sound. After reporting, Zheng Yan also told He Jian that the on-duty female staff member had finished her shift and taken leave, and would not be returning that night.

About half an hour later, He Jian received a phone call from Ben Ming, informing him that he had dispatched three small teams of sentries to investigate three "dens." Immediately following was a call from the Korean side:

"The eight ounces of chemical raw materials entrusted to us have been analyzed into three different properties, all containing the most potent toxins; now it is confirmed that one of the three toxins, which accounts for twice the amount, has the highest toxicity; this can be determined from the black bottle containing the raw materials. The only point that is not entirely certain is that the number on that bottle is different from the original. However, such numbers can be written at will and cannot be taken as a basis..."

This call was still made by the elderly leader of the Korean side: "eight ounces" remained the code word, and the time of the call was noted. "Raw materials" of course referred to Ping's problem; "toxins" referred to the Japanese background; "three properties" referred to the three "dens".

This phone call explained that their sentries, based on the report of that young comrade, had now determined that Hongzhen was the most suspicious place. "Twice" indicated that the "tickets" in Hongzhen were two people. The colors and style of the car sending the "tickets" were correct, but the number was not the original "10915". At the same time, the old leader further explained that such numbers could be forged or changed at will, and did not seem to be a basis for suspicion.

### The May Fourth Movement and Spoken Drama

— Yan Zhewu

The May Fourth Movement, a memorable day of the New Culture Movement, not only had revolutionary and progressive significance in politics and culture, but was also a day worth celebrating in the history of the Chinese spoken drama movement.

The New Culture Movement spawned by the May Fourth Movement had the significance of "anti-feudal culture," not only implementing a literary revolution, but also positively proposing the slogan of valuing art, drama, and novels! And using the translation and creation of spoken drama as the mainstream of anti-feudal thought!

Hu Shi published a one-act play "Major Life Events" in "New Youth," discussing the issue of freedom of marriage. At the same time, Pan Jiaxun translated Ibsen's "Nora" – "A Doll's House" – which also became a famous work discussing women's issues. Its performance at that time, like a rising storm, formed the rise of the Chinese spoken drama movement! Initially, men dressed as women, but later it was advocated that men and women perform together, and it was believed that student drama had the value of propaganda, education, and artistic research! This correctly and seriously established the new concept of drama from the traditional thinking of "turtle actors and drummers," which is also a valuable record in the history of Chinese drama!

Not only that, but all the theories, performance methods, and techniques of spoken drama were introduced from the West. Due to the "one-stop shop of the People's Art Theater Drama School," the talents trained by "People's Art" eventually expanded the Chinese spoken drama movement!

Thanks to the gift of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, the foundation was laid for the Chinese spoken drama movement; until the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in the 15th year of the Republic of China, spoken drama was further liberated. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in the 26th year of the Republic of China, spoken drama was affirmed as China's orthodox art, and the spoken drama movement reached its peak! Indeed, the Chinese spoken drama movement was initially related to the Xinhai Revolution, and since then, it has been linked to revolution again and again, and it is indeed a young and progressive art! It is also the mainstream of the New Culture Movement! Therefore, the spoken drama movement is in fact an activity with both cultural and revolutionary significance! And the spoken drama movement must rely on performances, because the special trade of the spoken drama movement is: "No performance, no movement": and because there is "movement," there must be a "direction," so the performance of spoken drama must not lose its working mission, otherwise, blind work and hasty performances will not help the cause, and are close to shooting without a target!

The spoken drama movement has grown by the gift of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, and now, in this post-recovery "May Fourth," all parties are holding special and grand commemorations of this day. Only our spoken drama circles are in a situation of low tide and collapse, but instead, we have disappeared and done nothing, which seems particularly lonely and painful! However, the spoken drama movement of more than 30 years has grown up in hard times, and we must never allow it to decline and disappear in our generation! We must continue to work hard in the spirit of "May Fourth" innovation and progress, to get through the current difficulties, and look forward to the improvement of the situation, and strive for the reappearance of a vigorous atmosphere!

It's time. Friends in the spoken drama circle should unite strongly, strive for theaters and work in many ways, not fear hardship or poverty, work hard for the future of cultural construction in the new China, and dedicate themselves to the gift of the precious "May Fourth" movement to the spoken drama movement!

Being sick and seeking medical treatment seems to have become a person's condition. However, this tendency, when viewed in terms of its significance to all mankind, is too unfortunate and too terrible.

Ma Zi hates seeing mathematicians, because mathematicians must write zero as "〇". And the existence of this image seems to be deliberately embarrassing Ma Zi. In fact, mathematicians are absolutely unaware of these things.

What I am talking about is naturally certain Ma Zis.

Like Mr. Liu Chengyu in modern times, who opens and closes his mouth calling himself Liu Ma Zi, and talks about Jingting Liu Ma Zi whenever he sees people; quick-witted and quick-spoken, Ma Zi is not something to criticize, but instead becomes his beauty.

If you make friends with a clerk in a clothing company, he pays special attention to your clothes. If you make friends with an artist, he will pay special attention to your contours, and if you make friends with a barber, he has to pay attention to your hair.

I think if you don't have a very strong neck, I advise you to make fewer friends with porters.

I hate the "harboring dirt and filth" of human nature.

In order to make walking time easier, I think I should save less of the "noble" and "solemn" giant belly.

However, the meaning of this is quite different from being on the stage.

There are two idiomatic myths in China. One says, "The Chen lineage is a thousand years old, and Peng Zu has lived for eight hundred years."

Based on this myth, there is the following story:

"When Peng Zu was born, Chen Bo leaned on his pillow and slept. When Chen Bo woke up and asked the servant, the servant checked the running account left by his great-grandfather and said: "Peng Zu died two hundred years ago." Chen Bo rubbed his eyes, yawned leisurely, and sighed sadly: "I knew this child wouldn't grow up."

This is naturally a joke, (laugh or not? Readers are free to choose.)

However, when I think of myself and many upward and kind friends, I have never dared to think of comparing myself with Peng Zu. However, looking in the mirror and examining myself, I don't necessarily have a "death face" that will definitely die young. I hope that the elders who control our destiny will not sleep for a thousand years like Chen Bo.

### The American Candy Bill

— Bu Shu

It is said that in the first ten months of 1946, Americans spent as much as 520 million US dollars on candy. When this news reached the ears of a representative of a small country in the United Nations, he complained a lot, saying:

"If our country could use this candy bill as the country's annual economy, we could make our country a paradise within ten years."

This "old news" on the one hand reveals the wealth of big countries, and on the other hand ridicules the "smallness" of small countries.

However, in our opinion, there is no ridicule at all. The American candy bill for ten months is 520 million US dollars, and what we expect from the American loan to China is only 500 million US dollars. The US dollar bonds recently issued by the government are not even this amount.

Some things cannot be thought about deeply, because once you think about them deeply, you will often feel embarrassed. We certainly cannot shout to Uncle Sam: "If you are less sweet on your mouth, we will be less bitter in our hearts." But comparing the wealth, strength, health, poverty, and desolation between the two, what else can we, the descendants of Yan and Huang, say? Who among us can not be stunned in the face of the American candy consumption figures?

It seems that the complaints of a representative of a certain small country are not only his personal. President Roosevelt said it well:

"When some people eat too much and others eat too little, there is a social problem, and even an international problem."

During the war, the United States became the arsenal of the United Nations. After the war, the United States took on the task of post-war relief. All of this only shows that Americans also have foresight. They know that it is impossible to be detached, it is impossible to move the United States away from the earth, and it is impossible for every American to rise by pulling their hair. Since they live on the earth, they have to take some responsibility for this chaotic and disturbing world. We still remember that last year, President Truman appealed to Americans to save food in order to save the world's food shortage. Truman's speech was roughly what Roosevelt had said before.

The end of the war is almost two years ago, but the world is still restless. There are really not many countries that can restore the stable and healthy living standards of the pre-war period. Just look at the number of sugar consumption published by the US authorities this time, and you will see how many small and weak countries' representatives have been affected and how many people's complaints have been caused! Even in the British Empire, the people there are a little envious and jealous of the American candy bill. Due to the rationing system that is still in effect, most British people have to envy the British girls who married American soldiers.

An American candy bill, in addition to its practical value, unexpectedly has such a side effect: it reflects how shabby the real world is!

### On Poetry Clocks

— Chaoyang

People in Fujian like to make poetry clocks, called knocking clocks, which is like accelerating the completion of poetry, beautifully named striking bowls. Its format is very complicated, just like riddles with various formats. Embedding characters, collecting sentences, and chanting separately are the most common. The patterns of embedding characters are like the first two characters, called side by side, the last two characters are called parallel lotus, the third character is the wasp waist, and the fifth character is the crane vine. I think the chanting style is the most generous, and it is even better if it can collect sentences. Mr. Yi Kuan is a master in this field, such as chanting separately in Penglai Pavilion, which is also made by collecting sentences. It is "Among them, there are many fairies fishing, and the heroes in the world are only the rulers."

My friend Xu Jizhuan's father has a couplet that chants separately on Han Xin and the character Zi: "How can he willingly endure humiliation under his crotch, and from then on there is nothing left in his eyes." This is similar to the format of the above couplet, although it is not collecting sentences, the character Zi is empty and broad, and it is very difficult to be appropriate. It uses the allusion of no one else in his eyes, and uses several empty words to move it, which is like five sparrows and six swallows, and every penny is equivalent, which is a good work. Therefore, at that time, everyone present put down their pens for it. This is the same as Chen Tao's couplet in the old sun, embedding characters side by side: "How can the road not be far away at sunset, and how can the middle be dry but the outside is still strong." The same use of empty words, the skills are also the same, the first sentence is about his own situation, the far road refers to Changchun, the second sentence satirizes current affairs, or potential, and Chen is drifting away from Ming, and villains harm gentlemen, often benefiting them.

### New Uses for Static Electricity

Static electricity, such as the electricity that makes the ends of hair stand up when combing, is now being used in the food industry for the dry separation of particles.

This method can separate the meat of shelled nuts from their shells. Remove raisins from leaf stems, etc., remove cabbage seeds from grains, and separate harmful seeds from various useful seeds.

A new advance is to pre-treat the surface of the separated minerals so that their particles are easily pulled apart in the electrostatic field. Acid gases, such as hydrofluoric acid gas, are known to be effective in treating silicate minerals. Feldspar and quartz can be separated by this method. Hydrofluoric acid forms potassium and aluminum fluorides on feldspar particles, but quartz particles are only etched by this treatment, and gaseous tetrafluoride escapes.

As for separating minerals such as limestone, dolomite, magnesite, and borax, acetic acid and benzoic acid dicarboxylic acid vapor can be used as pre-treatment materials.

### Preventing Focus of Aircraft Windows in the Stratosphere

— Bai Gao

Although stratospheric flight has not yet been commercially implemented, the American optical industry has already prepared glass that absorbs invisible ultraviolet rays to make aircraft windows. This is because at an altitude of more than fifteen miles, ultraviolet rays can focus human skin in two or three minutes, or even injure human lives. On the ground, we are not subjected to these light rays because the extremely short wavelengths they contain have been filtered out by ozone in the atmosphere. There is a kind of glass that does not allow ultraviolet rays to pass through, but only allows infrared heat to pass through, and makes the heat not escape after entering. There is another kind of glass that can absorb both ultraviolet and infrared rays, thus rejecting the heat rays together. On a stratospheric aircraft, equipped with sliding windows made of these two types of glass, drivers can use them to defend against invisible rays and control the temperature inside the aircraft.

### "Iron and Blood Mandarin Duck"

— Zhen

During the Soviet-German War, Soviet women on the front lines suffered hardships and dangers. In order to defend the freedom and land of their motherland, and in order not to let those Nazi thugs madly slaughter mankind, the wonderful ones bravely stepped onto the battlefield, and they selflessly contributed their entire lives. The heroine Natasha in "Iron and Blood Mandarin Duck" is one of the millions of Soviet women.

At the beginning of the film, when German paratroopers landed near Leningrad, the Soviet women in the collective farm unhesitatingly took up weapons to meet the brutal enemy. Then, the German invasion of the Soviet Union began, and the horn to defend the motherland sounded. Countless women joined the ambulance team and went to the front line. They and the Red Army soldiers went to the front line together, lived and died together, fought with the Nazi thugs, reversed the fate of history, and completed the responsibilities of the children of the era.

But these girls also have rich feelings. When they parted with their lovers and fiancés at the station, they were tearful and reluctant to leave. But when they thought of the more important tasks in front of them, they would embark on the journey without hesitation. Here, the affairs of children's love are critically reduced to the second place, and only love for the motherland is cherished by everyone. Such personality and spirit can never be destroyed by Hitler or any force. The Soviet Union's ability to defeat the German bandits has its inevitable conditions.

Having become accustomed to the style of Hollywood movies, Soviet movies have a different style. "Iron and Blood Mandarin Duck" grabs you tightly from the beginning. The director's handling of the scene of the German army landing, as well as Natasha's killing of the German sentry later, is exceptionally clean and neat. At the end, the Soviet army rushed towards the enemy in spite of the gunfire, and the women's ambulance team went to the front line together, which fully showed the director's majestic spirit. But in the delicate places, like after Natasha had a dispute with another female nurse, she rushed to the lieutenant to resolve the misunderstanding, and the military doctor instructed the lieutenant not to be stimulated. After hearing this, Natasha stood aside blankly, considering how to deal with the current problem. That was the best scene handled by the director in the whole play.

Feidelova, who plays the heroine Natasha, is a Soviet meritorious actor and has achieved high achievements in this film. The emotional changes in each scene are explained very clearly and delicately. In the entire film, every actor's pluck is simple and solid, and perhaps this is the characteristic of Soviet actors.

### "Eight Deaths and One Life"

— Mingtao

"Nine deaths and one life" is an old idiom, and it is often used to describe a person's difficulty in escaping from death. Of course, the ratio of "nine" to "one" is not as accurate as the numbers in arithmetic, but when considering actual life, it is not an exaggeration.

With nine opportunities of death juxtaposed, leaving only a glimmer of life; in other words, the possibility of death has far exceeded or is close to inevitable, and the possibility of survival is unless you encounter a miraculous chance. There is such a person, (let's just call him a hero.) He can confidently pass through the heavy encirclement of death, and kill his way out of the extremely difficult battle formation, winning in the "all-in" gamble. Then, the surrounding audience and listeners summed up this epic and tearful story of the "hero" with the four words "nine deaths and one life" to describe and praise.

Story - Gu Ying, the magistrate of Shangcheng County, Henan, committed a total of 82 crimes, including

There were as many as eight counts of capital crimes, but he was never shot. I don't think this is a piece of news that "if the investigation does not match the facts, please correct it." Since the truth of the news is beyond doubt, what I am scolding is the reason that allows him to live with "eight deaths and one life."

Someone once said that a coward dies a hundred times, and a hero dies once, because the latter is stronger and knows how to choose the opportunity to die. Now is the time when flies die once and tigers die a hundred times. Not to mention the seven or eight times of "death" written on white paper, it won't be able to do anything to him, even if it is a hundred or a thousand times, it will be in vain, because he has the magical ability to escape.

The facts should be corrected, so I suggest changing "nine deaths and one life" to "eight deaths and one life," which seems to be more realistic.

### Record of a Dangerous City

— Qin Shouou

Old Zhu watched him send the wealthy lady out the door, hoping that he would come back immediately, but after waiting for four or five minutes, he was nowhere to be seen; he knew that he could not be polite today, and hurriedly used extremely fast steps to chase out to look for him. Sure enough, in the courtyard inside the second door, he found Director Xiong hurrying to walk out.

"Mr. Xiong! I'm sorry, I've come to visit you seven times!" He caught up with him and said loudly in a very serious tone: "The batch of military vehicles that are going to Liuzhou tomorrow that I mentioned was told to me personally by Director Ma's secretary! Mr. Xiong, if you can allow us to ride along, we would be very grateful. If there are really difficulties and you can't agree to us, then please refuse immediately! This is an official matter, and I would never dare to force you! Especially since I, surnamed Zhu, have never had any friendship with you, so I can't force you to do things that are illegal like that Mrs. Pan did just now! However, I can't wait any longer! Please just say one sentence, and I will leave immediately! I will write down everything I have seen and heard here in the past three days and let the society judge! Is it that the lives of the thirty or forty poor actors who are still staying in Guilin to perform for the army today are not as important as the goods hoarded by the wives of several bank employees and movie actresses..."

This set of words, which was like a complaint and a scolding, caught Director Xiong off guard.

"I didn't say I couldn't do it!" He denied it anxiously.

"But you didn't say you could either!" Old Zhu took another step.

Now, the young Director Xiong realized that although the literary and art circles in China have never played any role in politics, the general public is most sympathetic to them, so they also have a kind of power that he should pay attention to.

"Okay! Okay! I will definitely help you with your matter. Those vehicles tomorrow will definitely take all of you away together!" He said very readily.

With the first cannon firing, Old Zhu was also a little overjoyed.

"In that case, on behalf of the troupe, I thank Director Xiong!" A smile appeared on his face again.

"It's nothing! It's nothing!"

"But when should we get on the bus?"

"In the afternoon, you can find Section Chief Yu from our section one. He will tell you what to do." At this time, Director Xiong's attitude was really very sincere, with no signs of shirking or delaying.

Old Zhu thought that there would be no more problems, so he happily bid him farewell. (63)
