[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] Hao Pengju's Communist army unit of over 10,000 men, stationed in southeastern Shandong, has, in view of the Communist Party's prolonged military rebellion and the people's unbearable suffering, voluntarily defected to the National Army. Hao himself has assumed the position of Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone and issued a public telegram. According to military observers, Hao's defection will deal a fatal blow to the Communist army that has been causing disturbances in southern Shandong, and the Communist army's collapse in southern Shandong is imminent.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 7th] Hao Pengju issued a telegram from Haizhou announcing his defection, which arrived in Nanjing at 11:00 a.m. on the 27th.

[Our Xinpu Dispatch of the 27th] Hao Pengju, who calls himself the Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic Allied Army, is now leading his unit of over 20,000 men to defect to the highest military authority in Haizhou, due to his dissatisfaction with the Communist Party's disastrous policies that harm the country and oppress the people.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th] Hao Pengju arrived in Haizhou on the morning of the 27th and assumed the position of Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone appointed by the government. His four divisions are stationed in the areas of Ganyu and its southwest, including Huandunbu and Shahe Town. Hao's actions will have a significant impact on the war situation in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu.

[Another Dispatch] Hao Pengju, the newly appointed Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Army Group, arrived in Haizhou on the 27th and was warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians. Hao originally commanded two armies and four divisions, stationed in Ganyu and the southwest. Since Hao assumed his new position appointed by the government, Ganyu has returned to the government's embrace without bloodshed, and from now on, all of northern Jiangsu will be restored.

[Another Dispatch] Hao Pengju issued a public telegram from his defense post, assuming the new position of Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Army Group, appointed by the government. The text reads: Limited to immediate arrival, respectfully addressed to Chiang, Chairman of the Nanjing National Government, and all military and political officials, and publicly addressed to Mr. Mao Zedong of Yan'an, all parties and people's organizations across the country: Democratic peace, unity, and unification are the unanimous demands of the people and the consistent policy of the government. The National Assembly has formulated a constitution to be implemented within a time limit to establish a democratic foundation. The government has repeatedly expressed its willingness to resume peace talks and discuss the reorganization of the government, exhausting all forbearance for the sake of the country. All citizens should rise up to support it, promote its realization, save the country from danger, rescue the people from misery, and advance towards building a prosperous and strong new China. However, the Chinese Communist Party actually intends to use force as a tool for political struggle, exhausting the people's strength to foster internal strife, which is not only abandoned by the people of the country but also despised by the international community. Pengju leads the entire army and soldiers, always striving for the goals of peace, democracy, unity, and unification, and is willing to return the army to the nation from this day forward, setting an example for the world. I am grateful that the government does not abandon my mediocrity and has appointed Pengju as the Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Army Group, and I will assume office at my defense post on January 23rd. In addition to submitting a report, I respectfully inform you, hoping for your public discernment. Hao Pengju, Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Army Group, kowtows. January 27th.

### France Should Abide by Treaties to Resolve the Xisha Dispute; No Unilateral Declarations Should Be Made

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] When a reporter asked a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 27th about Foreign Minister Wang's recent statement that the Ministry would issue a formal statement on the Xisha incident, the official said: Foreign Minister Wang recently said at Bishop Yu Bin's cocktail party, "If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to issue a formal statement on this matter, it will be released soon." Our stance on the Xisha issue is that the statements made by Director Ye Gongchao and Ambassador Qian Tai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's spokesperson are not formal. The current priority is how France should understand the geographical and historical evolution of Xisha in a harmonious manner, abide by treaties, and resolve disputes, rather than making any unilateral declarations.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 27th] He Lushan, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement yesterday refuting France's reasons for claiming sovereignty over the Xisha Islands, namely (1) Vietnam had made claims to the sovereignty of the islands before the war, and China had not issued a statement to oppose them. (2) Foreign ships docking in the Xisha Islands had been robbed, and the Guangdong Provincial Government had not taken any action after receiving protests from foreigners. Regarding the first point, France has never issued a formal communiqué. Regarding the second point, protests should be made to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not the Provincial Government, because the Provincial Government is not the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and cannot exercise diplomatic functions. China's claim to sovereignty is based on geography and history.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 27th] It is reported that Foreign Minister Wang met with Chairman Chiang yesterday to report on the situation in the Xisha Islands and seek instructions. Foreign Minister Wang is expected to issue a public statement on this issue soon.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th, United Press] The State Department reported that the Soviet Union's anti-American propaganda in the Far East is primarily responsible for the growing anti-American sentiment in the Far East. Kurtwell, the US liaison officer in Shanghai, reported to the State Department that Soviet radio stations, newspapers, and books in China are attacking the United States, just as they do in Eastern Europe. He said that although the Chinese government has banned foreign radio stations, the Soviet Union still has a radio station in Shanghai, calling it "The Voice of the Soviet Union." Kurtwell said: "I have listened to the content of its news programs, which is extremely distorted and often attacks the United States' activities in the United Nations, its occupation policies in Germany and Japan, and its interference in China." Kurtwell said that he recently spoke with an American woman who had returned from Yan'an, and she told him that the anti-American movement there was extremely intense. For twelve days, posters and propaganda were posted and disseminated, attacking the United States. Kurtwell said that the United States, Britain, France, Australia, and the Soviet Union all have news agencies in Shanghai. Although the Soviet agency is not formally organized, and the Soviet Union does not have diplomatic representatives stationed in Shanghai, the work it carries out is the most active. He said that the Soviet Union has six bookstores and publishing companies in Shanghai and publishes four kinds of newspapers. Kurtwell said: Chinese youth are very interested in the United States, but they are also interested in the Soviet Union. They often buy a large number of books. Kurtwell warned US officials that they must strengthen the coordination of news and diplomacy.

### Inspection Group of the Pacification Zone Sets Off in Two Groups on February 1st

Internal Announcement of Administrative Work in the Pacification Zone

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The inspection group of the Pacification Zone is scheduled to depart in two groups on February 1st, one for North China and one for North Jiangsu, led by Bai Chongxi and Gu Zhenggang, respectively. The North China group will go to areas around Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, while the North Jiangsu group will go to areas around Huaiyin and Xuzhou.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Ministry of Interior is actively promoting administrative work in the Pacification Zone. Based on the "Guidelines for Governance in the Pacification Zone," it has successively drafted and promulgated "Administrative Implementation Measures for Counties in the Pacification Zone," "Administrative Implementation Measures for Strengthening Counties Surrounding Communist-Occupied Areas," "Key Points for Household Registration in Counties and Cities," "Key Points for Strict Baojia System in Recovered Provinces and Cities," and "Measures for Commanders of All Levels of Troops in the Pacification Zone to Assist in Promoting Local Self-Government" and other regulations for implementation. The purpose is to quickly restore administrative institutions at all levels in the Pacification Zone, strengthen core-level organizations, and carry out various rehabilitation tasks. In recent months, the handling situation can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) Urging and preparing for rehabilitation work. The Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed the provincial governments in the Pacification Zone to handle the matter as soon as possible and send government personnel with the troops. As soon as a county is recovered, administrative institutions at all levels will be restored to carry out various rehabilitation tasks. (2) Planning for rehabilitation funds for counties and cities. It has been approved that the funds required for the baojia self-defense organizations in the recovered areas will be paid from the rehabilitation funds allocated to the recovered counties and cities. (3) Recruiting talents from the border areas to participate in administrative work in order to promote national sentiment and strengthen administrative effectiveness. (4) Urging the recovered provinces and cities to complete household registration. Household registration should be carried out first when each recovered county or city government is established or returns, and it should be completed within three months. Currently, it is being carried out in ten provinces and cities, including Fujian, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Taiwan, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, and Qingdao. Except for the Northeast, most of the remaining provinces are also in the process of completing it. (5) Urging the recovered provinces to strictly implement the baojia organization. According to reports from the recovered areas, most counties and cities have earnestly implemented the measures promulgated by the Ministry, and the baojia organization and personnel are more sound than before. (6) Improving administrative organizations at all levels in the Pacification Zone. Five principles have been established and handed over for earnest implementation: 1. Simplify the organization, improve administrative efficiency, and reduce irrelevant government orders. 2. Replenish county-level funds. If there is a shortage, apply to the Central Government for special allocations, and strictly prohibit apportionment. 3. Select capable comrades with rich experience and strong ability to serve as county magistrates and assistant administrative personnel. 4. Improve the treatment of administrative personnel at all levels below the county level. 5. Severely punish corrupt and derelict personnel, and reward the people for reporting grievances and informing secrets. (7) Organize and improve county and city-level public opinion organs. It is stipulated that in recovered counties and cities, public opinion organs in townships and baojia should be established immediately after recovery, as well as temporary county and city councils, and formal county and city councils should be established within six months. Most of them have been established successively. (8) Strengthen public security forces, establish provincial police departments, strengthen police forces, plan for the reorganization of police brigades, and review the organization of people's self-defense forces in provinces, cities, and counties. (9) Guiding engineering rehabilitation. Over the past year, the Ministry has urged provinces to establish public works teams to assist various cities and towns in carrying out emergency implementation and rehabilitation work, and urged counties and cities to first formulate construction plans and then implement them step by step. At the same time, the Ministry has appointed senior technical personnel to lead foreign experts to conduct inspections in major cities and assist in design. Except for a few places where implementation has not been possible due to special circumstances, most are actively handling it. (10) Stepping up the work of opium suppression. Personnel have been dispatched to supervise the opium suppression policy, strictly order registration for abstinence, strictly investigate and crack down, and strengthen the assessment of the opium suppression policy. However, a review of the administrative work in the recovered counties and cities reveals that there are still many difficulties, and some have failed to achieve the planned goals. The main reasons are that local governments have failed to formulate central tasks and implement them with varying degrees of urgency, the shortage of funds, insufficient coordination among local military agencies, too many levels of administrative agencies at all levels, and a large number of grassroots workers, making assessment difficult.

### Government Hopes to Reorganize Soon, May Become a Reality by Mid-Next Month, Lei Zhen Meets with Representatives of Various Parties Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The issue of reorganizing the government is still under deliberation these days. It is heard that, in principle, what the various parties hope for is a comprehensive reorganization, that is, the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the hospitals, and the National Government at the same time. The Youth Party has made rigid demands on the distribution of personnel, hoping to occupy one-third of the positions in various departments, from the central government to the local governments. The Social Democratic Party has not yet made any specific statements. It is also heard that the various parties have no intention of participating in technical departments. At present, the government is still considering the principles, and has not yet discussed the details. However, the government has the sincerity to implement the reorganization as soon as possible, so it will make active efforts recently. Last night, on the 27th, this reporter interviewed Hong Lanyou, who said that the reorganization of the government may achieve some results before March 15th.

[Our Newspaper] Last night, this reporter interviewed Secretary-General Lei Zhen to inquire about his views on the overall situation. He replied that the top priority for solving the current problems is peace talks. However, since the government put forward its plan, the CCP has not yet given a formal response. The government can only temporarily shelve the resumption of peace talks, but does not intend to take other actions during this period. When asked whether the Democratic League could act as an appropriate intermediary for the resumption of peace talks, he replied that the Democratic League has not expressed any opinion on this matter. As far as the government is concerned, it has never refused such efforts. His current visit to Shanghai is entirely to pay New Year's greetings to old friends and does not involve any activities, but it is also possible to contact people from the Democratic League. When discussing the prerequisites for various parties to reorganize the government, he said that the reorganization of the government should start from the central government first, and the local scope is too broad and should be carried out gradually. As for the personnel issues of the government's side in the reorganization of the government, the various parties need to consult with the Chairman. Lei visited Wan Renqian of the Social Democratic Party yesterday and is scheduled to visit personnel from the Youth Party and the Democratic League today (28th).

[Our City News] Secretary-General Chen Qitian of the Youth Party told reporters yesterday that the Youth Party is still carefully considering the issue of participating in the government. The rumors that the government has promised the Youth Party certain departments and that the Youth Party has made more demands are purely unfounded. The Youth Party hopes that its participation in the government will be truly beneficial to the implementation of party and government affairs. Therefore, it is currently conducting in-depth research on the policies, systems, and lineup after the reorganization of the government. Before the reorganization of the government, the Youth Party must not only reach an understanding with the government on the aforementioned issues, but also seek understanding with other parties participating in the government. Therefore, the reorganization of the government cannot be achieved overnight. Current contacts are still preliminary consultations. Chen also said that he, Li Huang, and Zuo Shunsheng are scheduled to meet with Dang Zhen this morning (28th).

### Lu Dingyi Officially Declares, CCP Insists on Two Conditions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] On the 25th, Lu Dingyi, Minister of Propaganda of the CCP, issued a lengthy official statement in response to the statement made by Minister Peng Xuepei on the 20th, still insisting on the two conditions of abolishing the National Assembly Constitution and restoring the military position of January 13th of last year, and believing that this is the "most lenient" and "minimum" condition. If it cannot be achieved, "sending government personnel to Yan'an, or even holding a round table conference," is unnecessary. It also stated that since the government has rejected the two conditions proposed by the Communist Party, the government should bear all the consequences. When explaining the "leniency" of these two conditions, Lu said that the Communist Party should have demanded that the government "punish the warmongers" and "the reactionary elements who destroyed the Political Consultative Conference," and the person in charge of signing the Sino-U.S. commercial treaty, and compensate the people for the losses suffered due to the civil war; however, the Communist Party has abandoned these demands and only proposed to abolish the Constitution and restore the military position of January 13th of last year, which can be said to be "lenient," and so on. The full text is more than two thousand words long.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] After Lu Dingyi issued a statement rejecting peace talks, observers believe that the reason for his insistence on the two preconditions is to delay time and wait for the changes in the situation of the Moscow Conference in March. We cannot determine what the Soviet Union's attitude will be, but our government has gradually become a democratic government, and all countries will surely help us enter a peaceful and democratic environment. The Communist Party's current wait-and-see attitude may have already doomed it to failure.

### Social Democratic Party's Stance on the Current Situation to be Announced Soon

[Our Newspaper] The Social Democratic Party will announce its stance on the current situation in the near future, and will provide concrete measures for various practical issues in politics, military affairs, economy, and diplomacy as an indirect response to the government's invitation to the party to participate. Most of the standing committee members of the Social Democratic Party believe that participating in the government at this time will not help the overall situation and advocate adopting a reserved attitude. If government representatives invite them again, the party will likely propose two prerequisites: (1) Please the government announce new policies on politics, economy, and military affairs, with special emphasis on guaranteeing freedom and stability of democracy; (2) Please the government submit a list of government personnel after the reorganization of the government, so as to study whether it can be coordinated with the new policies. Only after these two points are resolved smoothly can participation in the government be considered. As for the rumors that participation in the government will be based on individual volunteers, a senior official of the Social Democratic Party told reporters that if this happens, the participants will participate entirely in their personal capacity and have nothing to do with the party, and please make a public statement on this point.

### Beijing Peace Daily Publishes an Article Criticizing the Democratic League's Political Report

Accusing it of Colluding with the Communist Party to Harm the Country

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Nanjing Peace Daily published an editorial on the 27th, criticizing the political report of the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League. Its conclusion is: The long "political report" published by the Democratic League can be summarized into two sentences: "The Communist Party has a hundred rights and not a single wrong, while the Kuomintang has a hundred wrongs and not a single right." The article clearly pointed out: The long report of the Democratic League is a confession of colluding with the Communist Party to stir up internal strife and harm the country and the people, and cited several facts as evidence. The Communist Party prevented the National Army from going to the Northeast to accept sovereignty, and the Democratic League also opposed the government's acceptance of sovereignty; the Communist Party used unmentionable means in the Northeast to create a so-called "Democratic Allied Army" and occupied many cities, and the Democratic League strongly urged the government to "recognize reality"; the Communist Party hoped to complicate the Northeast issue and turn it into an international issue, and the Democratic League regarded the Northeast issue as "a focus of international issues"; the Communist Party refused to participate in the National Assembly and refused to accept the Constitution, and the Democratic League also refused to participate in the National Assembly and refused to accept the Constitution.

### Preliminary Draft of Regulations Concerning the Implementation of the Constitution Completed

Wang Chonghui Solicits Opinions from All Parties

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The various regulations related to the implementation of the Constitution, such as the Election Law, are drafted by Wang Chonghui and handled jointly with Hong Lanyou and others. It is reported that the preliminary draft has been largely completed, but the important principles still need to be solicited from all parties. Wang convened a meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council at 3:00 p.m. on the 27th to exchange opinions. Zhang Lisheng, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Lifu, Hong Lanyou, Liu Keshu, Lu Xiaodao and others attended, and they discussed the key points extensively, but no concrete decisions were made. It is planned to hold another meeting in early next month to study the matter and then send it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. Hong said that the election laws of various countries are based on party distribution, some use security deposits, and some use qualifications, but we cannot choose arbitrarily in our country. We hope to draft the most advanced new law, but we cannot but make plans for reality. Therefore, in the drafting stage, it is very difficult to favor one over the other. However, in response to the needs of the facts, the drafting of various regulations will be completed as soon as possible so that they can be announced within the expected time.

### Paper Mills in Taichung and Tainan Complete Rehabilitation and Proceed with Production

[Central News Agency, Tainan, 27th Dispatch] The rehabilitation project of the Xinying Pulp Mill in this county, which was bombed fourteen times during the war, has been largely completed. It is expected that production can begin in early March when raw materials are sufficient. The factory has a large scale of equipment and strong machine capacity. Using bagasse, it can produce an average of 100 tons of pulp per day. In the past, the annual output was more than 30,000 tons, making it one of the largest pulp mills in Taiwan Province. Plant managers Tan Gao and Yongxiang said that the factory has not yet resumed production. In the pulp mill, only old bagasse is first used to manufacture bagasse boards for construction, producing 1,000 sheets per day. As for the main raw materials for pulp, there are three types: bagasse, sawdust, and bamboo chips. Among them, the quality of bagasse products is better, but at present, there is a shortage of this raw material in the province, and it cannot be supplied in large quantities. Therefore, it is planned to use sawdust and bamboo chips to manufacture pulp in the near future, and the goal is to reach more than 3,000 tons within the year. According to the paper industry factories in Taiwan Province, the larger ones are only the Luodong Paper Mill in the north, the Tiandu Paper Mill in Taichung, and the Xinying Pulp Mill in Tainan. The former two are specialized in paper making and do not make pulp, while the latter can both produce and manufacture. [Central News Agency, Taichung, 27th Dispatch] The Taichung Paper Mill, jointly run by the Resources Commission and the Provincial Government, was bombed several times during the war, causing great losses. The various repair projects have now been largely completed. According to plant manager Wu Zuping, since the factory started operations in May last year, the output has increased from one ton per day to seven tons per day. There are currently more than 600 employees. It is expected that the daily output will increase to 15 tons by August this year. The Daolin paper produced is of excellent quality and currently uses bamboo as a raw material. The factory site is located in Dadu Township, Taichung County, which is located in the bamboo center area of Zhushan and Zhunan in the province. Transportation in both places is very convenient, and the existing raw materials can be used for one year.

### Tainan Sugar Factory Officially Resumes Production

Can Produce 180 Tons per Day

[Central News Agency, Tainan, 27th Dispatch] The Cheluzhai Sugar Factory in Tainan County, the only factory in Taiwan that produces cube sugar, officially resumed production today, using sugar cane to manufacture sugar, including 36,000 tons of sugar cane reserves from the Haili and Sanqiandian sugar factories, which will all be crushed and processed into sugar. According to the person in charge of the factory, the production capacity is very strong; on average, 180 tons of sugar can be produced per day. From the 36,000 tons of sugar cane, it is estimated that 13,100 tons of special-grade sugar and 300 tons of red sand sugar can be produced.

### Taiwan Provincial Government Strictly Prohibits Smuggling of Rice to Japan

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 27th Dispatch] The Taiwan Provincial Government recently ordered the police and shipping agencies, as well as the county and city governments, to strictly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from smuggling rice to Japan. Although Taiwan and Japan have not yet resumed trade, it is reported that there are often some profit-seeking merchants who smuggle rice and white sugar to Japan. Taiwan Island is surrounded by the sea, and there are many ports of all sizes. Fishing boats of 30 to 50 tons can easily escape the eyes and ears of customs and other anti-smuggling personnel when entering and leaving the ports. In the past, Japan's required sugar and rice were mostly supplied by Taiwan. Currently, Japan is short of both rice and sugar, and smugglers make huge profits. However, rice prices in Taiwan Province are also soaring. The Provincial Government ordered a strict ban on private exports in order to retain rice and stabilize grain prices. The Provincial Government also reissued an order today to prohibit the use of one of the main miscellaneous grains, sweet potato flour, from January to March, so as not to affect commodity prices.

### UNRRA Railway Equipment Shipped to China Via Hong Kong One After Another Originally a Military Railway from Iran to the Soviet Union Disassembled by UNRRA and Provided to the Yuehan Railway

[Our City News] The military railway from Iran to the Soviet Union during the war has been dismantled by UNRRA and shipped to China. A large amount of railway equipment, including locomotives, rails, carriages, and freight cars, has been continuously arriving in Hong Kong and allocated by the CNRRA to the Yuehan Railway for use in restoring the railway's pre-war efficiency. Assuming all the railway vehicles that have been shipped are arranged in a single line, they can form a line eight miles long. A large number of equipment is being reassembled in Hong Kong by the CNRRA. Currently, 1,200 freight cars of 20 to 50 tons and 10 locomotives have been assembled. Hundreds of freight cars have been allocated to the Yuehan Railway for operation. If all are operated, the total load capacity can reach 40,000 tons.

Although the vehicles and equipment have been used during the war, most of them are still in good condition and do not hinder their use. The assembly plant in Kowloon is currently extremely busy, but due to the lack of tools, some work has to be done directly by hand, but still six or seven units can be assembled every day. According to an expert from the CNRRA, the world is short of railway vehicles and equipment after World War II. If we had not dismantled the Iranian railway and directly supplied it to us for use, we would have to wait two years for delivery even if we ordered from Britain and the United States. The Iranian railway equipment that has been shipped includes 45,000 steel rails and 250,000 sleepers, which is really rare," he said.

### Far East Regional Conference to be Held in Shanghai Tomorrow

Canadian Representative Will Also Attend

[Our Newspaper] The first meeting of the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee for this year will be held at the Bank of China at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow (29th), chaired by Dr. Yan Huiqing. The Canadian representative will also attend for the first time. The Canadian representative's participation in the meeting was nominated by Deputy Director Shan Min of the CNRRA at the Sixth General Assembly of the UNRRA in Washington. Li strongly argued that the Canadian representative should also be qualified to attend, because Canada has made great contributions to relief in China, and the total amount of its donated materials reached US$138,738,739, second only to the United States and the United Kingdom. The Canadian representative attending this time is Campbell, who is 29 years old and a naval officer. He came to China a year ago and served as the representative of the Canadian Foreign Affairs Office in the Philippines.

The agenda of this Far East Regional Conference will include Mr. Li Shanmin's report on the proceedings of the UNRRA General Assembly in Washington, reports from responsible representatives on the handling of the resettlement of overseas Chinese, the Yellow River management project, relief in the Yellow River flood area, and the CNRRA's supply of materials, equipment, and economic issues.

### UNRRA Agency in China to End at the End of March

CNRRA's Work Will be Extended

[Our Newspaper] The CNRRA authorities believe that the liaison agency in China will end at the end of March, but 50% of UNRRA materials still need to be shipped to China, so the work of the CNRRA will be extended and may not be able to end at that time. However, with regard to the agency's business, a partial transfer is being planned, and at the same time, relief supplies are being distributed as quickly as possible. The transfer work will be carried out step by step according to a systematic plan. Currently, the equipment that has been transferred includes several ships of the CNRRA Water Transport Brigade, which were transferred to the China Shipping Industry Joint Operation Office. In addition, the ship drivers, mechanics, management and other technical personnel were also hired by the office at the same time, but the treatment issues of some foreign personnel have not been fully resolved. It is reported that the foreign personnel requested the office to pay according to the UNRRA treatment, but the office authorities are currently unable to agree.

Also, reporters learned from authoritative sources that Indonesian Prime Minister Shari accepted the request of Chinese Consul General Jiang Jiadong at today's meeting to send an armed rescue team to the interior of Jambi as soon as possible to rescue the overseas Chinese civilians who were recently kidnapped by Indonesians in the Jambi incident. Shari has promised to work hard to prevent Indonesians from committing acts of massacre, robbery, and arson in the future.

### Zhou Fohai's Escape from Death Blocked; Wife's Request for Retrial Rejected

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Following the upheld death sentence in Zhou Fohai's appeal, his wife, Yang Shuhui, had previously submitted a petition to the Capital High Court requesting a retrial. President Zhao Chen of the court assigned the case to the Second Criminal Division for handling. After several reviews by Division Chief Zheng Lie'e and judges Wang Hongquan and Liu Xiancai, the division decided in a meeting on the afternoon of the 27th to reject the request with a Special Criminal Ruling No. 2 in the 36th year of the Republic. The main text of the ruling stated: "The request for a retrial is rejected."

Minor Merits Cannot Cover Great Faults; Small Favors Cannot Obscure Enormous Crimes

The reasoning began by stating that Ms. Yang based her request on Article 28, Section 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, arguing that Peng Shou and Cheng Kexiang had not testified during the trial. She also cited Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitors, claiming that Zhou Fohai's actions "beneficial to the war of resistance" after his "surrender" should warrant a retrial and reduced sentence. "However, the investigation reveals that the defendant Zhou Fohai conspired with the enemy to resist our country. On November 4th of the 28th year of the Republic, the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court had already issued an explicit arrest warrant. The defendant's so-called 'surrender' occurred in the winter of the 31st year of the Republic. Regardless of whether the Military Intelligence Bureau acknowledges the matter, even if it were true, it occurred after the fact of discovery and the explicit issuance of an arrest warrant, thus not meeting the conditions for surrender. How can this be used as a reason for requesting a retrial? Furthermore, Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitors stipulates that if a traitor has assisted in the war of resistance or performed acts beneficial to the people, and the evidence is conclusive, their sentence may be reduced. However, this regulation adopts the principle of 'may be reduced,' not 'must be reduced.' Even if the conditions stipulated in that article are met, the court still has the discretion to decide whether or not to reduce the sentence based on the severity of the crime." The ruling then detailed Zhou's traitorous acts, stating, "In summary, his crimes are extremely grave." Regarding his "minor merits," "Minor merits cannot cover great faults, and small favors cannot obscure enormous crimes. After weighing the circumstances and considering the severity, it is determined that it is difficult to grant a 'reduction' according to Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitors. Nothing short of the death penalty will suffice to serve as a clear warning. Therefore, even if the witnesses Peng Shou and Cheng Kexiang are brought forward to prove that the defendant assisted in the war of resistance or rescued Central personnel, it cannot be said that this is important evidence sufficient to affect the original judgment, nor can it be said that the original judgment failed to consider the aforementioned witnesses or that there was any significant error. Moreover, the defendant Zhou Fohai was the chief culprit of treason, and his actions were nothing more than attempts to subvert the government. In summary, his crimes warrant more than just death... Therefore, this request for a retrial does not meet the conditions stipulated in the aforementioned article. The applicant's request for a retrial based on the aforementioned article is without merit."

Based on the above arguments, it was ruled, in accordance with Article 1, Section 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 427, Section 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that the ruling should be as stated in the main text.

The end of the ruling included the following: "If you do not agree with this ruling, a protest must be submitted to this court within five days after the delivery, and the protest shall be made to the Supreme Court." This ruling will be delivered to Zhou's wife on the 28th.

Capital Residents Pay Attention; News of Zhou's Execution

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] After the Capital High Court rejected Zhou Fohai's request for a retrial in the afternoon of the 27th, Minister Xie Guansheng met with President Zhao Chen of the Capital High Court at 5:00 PM to inquire about the case. Zhao reported that the request had been rejected and Zhou's wife had been notified that she could file a protest. Minister Xie immediately stated: Zhou's case is significant, and it must be handled with care in accordance with the law to demonstrate impartiality and maintain judicial dignity.

[Another dispatch] Capital residents are anxiously awaiting news of Zhou Fohai's execution. However, considering the examples of past executions of traitors such as Lin Mei, executions often occurred after the Supreme Court rejected the protest and before a second request for a retrial was made. Zhou Rong is considered a "favored traitor," and his "contributions" are actually greater than his crimes compared to Lin Mei. How can the judicial authorities treat him the same? Minister Xie Guansheng has stated that the execution order has not yet been issued, and Zhou may be able to delay his fate for a few more days. However, the general consensus is that Zhou's crimes are heinous and that he should be executed swiftly to uphold justice.

### Editorial: New Prospects for British-Soviet Relations

As a result of Field Marshal Montgomery's visit to Moscow, the uneasy British-Soviet relations of the past year have shown a new light. During the war, Britain and the Soviet Union were allies, but it is well known that the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union after the war has not been harmonious. Although Attlee's administration chanted the slogan of turning to the left, it has not achieved any improvement in British-Soviet relations in practice. Britain has a traditional fear of the Soviet Union, coupled with the expansion of Soviet power in Europe after the war, which conflicts with Britain's traditional interests in many ways. This is manifested in the political situation in Greece, in the handling of the Turkish Straits issue, and in the issue of German control. As for Britain's withdrawal from Poland, it has made this World War lose its original meaning. The Soviet Union also had a traditional jealousy of Western Europe, coupled with the close relationship between Britain and the United States, the military negotiations between Britain and the United States, the adoption of military standardization, military exercises in the Arctic, and the possession of atomic energy secrets. Even if the Soviet Union does not consider this hostility, it feels uneasy in its heart. Therefore, the British-Soviet relationship has been in this state of neither close nor distant for the past year. During this period, although there was Professor Laski, the leader of the British Labor Party, visiting the Soviet Union last July, and the cultural delegation led by the famous novelist Priestley, they did not help to improve British-Soviet relations in substance.

More recently, Foreign Secretary Bevin's foreign policy speech on December 22 further provoked criticism from the Moscow Pravda, which in turn deteriorated British-Soviet relations. Pravda believed that Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement that Britain's foreign policy was not colluding with the United States, nor was it inextricably linked to any country, indicated that Britain had disregarded the Soviet alliance treaty. Although the British Foreign Office denied this statement, it failed to reduce the Soviet Union's doubts about Britain. Therefore, at this time, we saw the visit of Field Marshal Montgomery, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff of Britain, to Britain. Although Field Marshal Montgomery was only fulfilling a previous invitation, undoubtedly, Field Marshal Montgomery's trip was another trump card for the British government to try to improve British-Soviet relations. However, despite the visit of such a figure as Field Marshal Montgomery to the Soviet Union, it failed to dispel the Soviet Union's doubts about Britain. According to a Reuters dispatch, at the farewell banquet in the Kremlin, Stalin asked Montgomery how the opportunity to sign a British-Soviet military alliance was. Montgomery pondered for a moment and replied: Hasn't Britain and the Soviet Union already signed a military alliance? Stalin replied: I am referring to a real alliance, not the Bevin alliance. This shows that even the Soviet head of state had the same view as Pravda regarding Bevin's previous statement. This misunderstanding was not clarified until the British Foreign Office released the exchange of telegrams between Bevin and Stalin on the 25th of this month. The two sides not only reaffirmed that the 1942 British-Soviet alliance treaty remained in effect, but Stalin also expressed his willingness to strengthen the alliance relationship and advocated deleting various reservation clauses that could weaken the previous alliance treaty. Due to the public announcement of this exchange of letters, the two countries reaffirmed the validity of the alliance treaty, which suddenly opened up a vast new situation for British-Soviet relations.

What deserves our attention is: What kind of new developments may British-Soviet relations have? There are basic conflicts in national policies between Britain and the Soviet Union, coupled with the traditional fear and contempt for the Soviet Union in Britain, and the traditional doubts about Western Europe in the Soviet Union. These traditional prejudices do not change due to changes in the ruling party. The policies adopted by the Labor government are no different from those of the Conservative government led by Churchill, and the Soviet socialist government of the proletarian dictatorship is no different from the autocratic government of the Tsarist era. However, after the Second World War, Britain was exhausted, and its strength was far less than before. Even if the Soviet Union was devastated by the war, and even if the new five-year plan was implemented, its strength was not as good as before. Moreover, Britain and the United States kept the secrets of atomic energy, and the Soviet Union was slower than Britain in the production of new weapons. Therefore, at this time, both sides have the intention not to start a war lightly.

However, despite this new expression of rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union, the development of new British-Soviet relations must be sought from a larger perspective in order to see its signs. Now that Stalin has requested to delete those reservation clauses that are sufficient to weaken the British-Soviet alliance treaty; in fact, the British-Soviet alliance treaty was signed when the fight against Hitler was in full swing. Now times have changed, and the emotions when the alliance was originally signed may not be the same as today. Moreover, there is now the organization of the United Nations mechanism to ensure the effort for lasting world peace. Therefore, the key to the development of new British-Soviet relations seems to be not only related to Britain and the Soviet Union, but also involves other aspects besides Britain and the Soviet Union. This is why we saw the London Times, which represents the British government, making such a statement: "An unfortunate misunderstanding has led to a fortunate result. The next step to promote British-Soviet relations will be sought at the Moscow Conference in March." From this, it can be seen that Britain still expects the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference for the development of new British-Soviet relations, and on the eve of the opening of this Foreign Ministers' Conference, US-Soviet relations have not improved due to the change of US Secretary of State. On the contrary, US State Department officials accused the Soviet propaganda machine of trying to turn the people of Eastern Europe and China against the United States at this time, which seemed to cast a new shadow on US-Soviet relations.

However, the new US Secretary of State, Marshal Marshall, is a military diplomat with outstanding talents, and also a person who can gain the trust and support of the Soviet Union. Marshal Marshall's year-long stay in China enabled him to estimate the Soviet Union from a new perspective. Now that Marshal Marshall will attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow as the US Secretary of State; at a time when British-Soviet relations are improving, the summoning of this Foreign Ministers' Conference may not only be enough to promote British-Soviet relations, but may also promote a new understanding between the three powers of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union. The development of new British-Soviet relations must have its meaning on a more solid foundation. We only hope that this new understanding can be born, so that lasting world peace after the war can be ensured.

Gambling is even more rampant, with public gambling occurring at any time and in various places. The provincial government is determined to rectify this evil custom and has issued an anti-gambling decree: (1) All personnel of government agencies, organizations, public servants, school teachers, staff, and students shall sign an anti-gambling covenant. In addition to absolutely refraining from gambling themselves and reporting each other, they shall also persuade their family members or relatives and friends not to engage in gambling.

The Baotians shall be responsible for persuasion, supervision, and legally stopping gambling. (3) All counties and cities should expand anti-gambling propaganda.

The township conscription supervisor, Jiang Guojun, ignored everything and conscripted him. After local gentry provided proof, Jiang became angry at the township chief and arbitrarily fined Bao Chief Zhao Xingcang 20,000 yuan in legal currency, otherwise he would be detained. Despite repeated requests from others and the initial payment of 10,000 yuan, Jiang refused to agree, which aroused public anger.

### A Trip to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border

— By Our Correspondent Jiang Hong

Quzhou, 14th

The Zherao section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been open for almost a week. In order to understand the situation along the line, the reporter braved the severe winter cold and decided to make this short journey of over 100 kilometers.

On the morning of the 9th, the sky was gloomy and it looked like it was going to rain. As soon as I got up, I hurried to the Quzhou Station. When I arrived, Chief Li was already standing far away in front of the station to greet me. We talked as we walked around the station. A small new station building stands on the base that has not yet been leveled. The luggage room next to it and the warehouse opposite have not yet been built. Many goods were piled up on the platform, some unloaded last night and some waiting to be shipped. If it suddenly rains on the open-air platform, those goods such as paper will be very troublesome. At exactly 8 o'clock, the train started. Because

The Roadbed Stones Are Not Yet Laid, It Only Travels 15 Kilometers Per Hour. I was sitting in the guard's van. Most of the space in that guard's van, which was converted from one-third of a train car, was occupied by a large safe. The remaining space was filled with four train crew members and the reporter, five people in total. We were chatting around a brazier, from the former director Zhang Zili to the new director Hou Jiayuan, from the restoration of the track to the salary increase. Their perception of Director Hou can be represented by the words of a person in charge of the car: "Director Hou is actually not bad. As soon as he took office, he gave us a salary increase..." Everything today is measured by money. After listening to their conversation, I had this feeling.

After the train passed the Houxijie Station, the speed gradually increased, but it was only 20 kilometers per hour. The station building in Houxijie is also newly built, but it is smaller than the Quzhou Station. The doors and windows are made of wood, not as beautiful as the glass ones in the Quzhou Station.

When we arrived at Jiangshan Station, the north wind outside the window became tighter, and the road police on the platform shrank their heads tightly into the collars of their coats. Since the opening of the Quzhou station, the Jiangshan station has become deserted. There are only a few country folks carrying burdens waiting for the train on the platform, and the rest are the blue-uniformed traffic personnel. The reporter boarded the passenger car in front. The passengers were crowded to the point where no water could leak through. Four foreign religious figures were playing "poker" proudly and leisurely. A group of country bumpkins surrounded them, staring intently as if watching something novel.

When the train arrived at Xintangbian Station, the 22nd down train had not yet arrived (the two passenger trains were supposed to meet here). Later, I learned from the station that the 22nd train derailed at the San Dao track at Yushan Station because the sleepers were moldy and the tracks had sunk.

It is rare to have a derailment in the station. In recent times, derailments have been heard from time to time, such as on the 29th and 30th of last month between Yushan and Dukou, and between Jinqiao and Shaxi. Fortunately, the speed of the trains on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line is very low, so there was no major loss.

Around 1:00 p.m., the train arrived at Wangshan Station. This place is more lively than the other intermediate stations, and the platform is full of goods. Because the locomotive needs to take on water here, there is a half-hour stop. The passengers on the train, after six hours of shaking, need to eat, so they compete to get off the train to find food. The various food stalls opposite the station are doing brisk business. With a little effort, a long row of stalls is covered with patrons like flies. The Railway Bureau has a Yushan machine factory at Wangshan Station. The locomotives on the Qurano section are inspected and repaired here. The factory is currently rushing to manufacture passenger cars. Currently, five third-class passenger cars have been produced, and two more will be completed soon. At 3:30 p.m., we arrived at Rao. The short journey of 120 kilometers was finally completed in eight hours.

Shangrao, this place that rose during the war, is still

A Commercial Hub in Eastern Jiangxi Due to Its Excellent Location. The streets are bustling with people, as lively as before. Unfortunately, the streets are not as complete as they were three years ago. The stone-paved road surface has been carved out by wheelbarrows into crisscrossing rivers and continuous swamps. The intersections are blocked by wooden fences and stones, making it difficult even for rickshaws to pass through. It is said that this is to prohibit cars from passing through the city. It is indeed too unwise to abandon eating because of choking. On the other hand, small chartered cars are still flying around the streets. Isn't this a strong contrast?

There are many officers from the 11th Army Officer Corps here. Recently, they were ordered to merge with the 12th Corps and will be leaving for Hangzhou. Precisely because of the merger and other reasons, there are still about 400 unemployed officers who have not been accepted for training, stranded in Shangrao, without food or accommodation, which is extremely miserable. The reporter personally saw an unemployed officer eating in a restaurant and not being able to pay, so the shopkeeper willingly sent him to the police station. For the sake of the lives of these hundreds of people, the Shangrao County Government has allocated 500,000 yuan to send them back to their hometowns and is handling registration matters in the Zhongzheng Hall, but each person is allocated only over 1,000 yuan, which is like a drop in the bucket. What good is it?

### Zhejiang Province County Magistrate Assessment: Second Examination Next Month

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Zhejiang Province is holding a county magistrate assessment. The first examination was previously held, and eight candidates were admitted. Since there are another 65 applicants for assessment, it has been decided to hold a second examination on February 8th. However, those who failed the first examination will not be allowed to participate.

### Four Powers Conclude Forty-Year Pact to Prevent German Rearmament; Washington Suggests Revisiting Old Proposals

[United Press, Washington, 25th] A treaty to prohibit German rearmament for forty years was initially proposed by former Secretary of State Byrnes over a year ago. It is said that Stalin himself agreed to this proposal at one point, but Foreign Minister Molotov later opposed it, preventing the case from being seriously discussed in any four-power meeting. It was only during the New York meeting of the four foreign ministers last December that it was agreed to include the treaty proposal as the fourth item on the agenda for the Moscow meeting in March of this year. Therefore, the importance of this case is almost equal to that of the German-Austrian peace treaty; in fact, it can be regarded as part of the entire German peace settlement. Secretary of State Marshall did not initiate the treaty plan, but the experts and advisors under him certainly felt this way. The semi-official Pravda accused British Foreign Secretary Bevin of abandoning the British-Soviet alliance. Only after Foreign Secretary Bevin and Stalin exchanged notes, with the former guaranteeing loyalty to the alliance and the latter accepting this guarantee, did relations smooth out. Pravda first expressed goodwill towards the Americans, and then towards the British. Washington believes this is a conspiracy to isolate the Western powers. Regarding the issue of alliances, US officials believe that such alliances, if always within the framework of the UN Charter, are not a problem. At the same time, in the European context, alliances can enhance the unity of various countries and establish a sense of common security.

### Soviet Newspaper Criticizes Vandenberg's Remarks, Calling Them a Destruction of the Foundation for Cooperation

[United Press, Moscow, 26th] Pravda stated today that if the United States adheres to the foreign policy of Republican leader Vandenberg and Dulles, it will damage the true foundation of international cooperation in the future. The blueprint for Vandenberg's foreign policy, outlined in his speech in Cleveland on the 11th of this month, is an expansionist plan that matches the words and deeds of imperialists. Dulles's proposal that the German economy be linked to its European neighbors, such as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, is a disguised form of Churchill's advocacy of a European Federation.

### British-French Alliance Treaty Draft Near Completion

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] The Times' diplomatic correspondent reveals that the future British-French alliance treaty has been drafted by the British Foreign Office, and the British government is preparing to start negotiations. At the same time, restoring relations between Britain and the Soviet Union on the basis of a new treaty, dispelling doubts, is conducive to British-French relations, as too close a British-French relationship could weaken the connection between Britain and the Soviet Union.

### US State Department Releases Secret Documents from Last Paris Peace Conference

### Premier Clemenceau Suggested Surrounding the Soviet Union with a Barbed-Wire Fence

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The US State Department announced yesterday that secret documents from the 1919 Paris Peace Conference reveal that French Premier Clemenceau suggested that the Allied Powers and their partners should set up a kind of barbed-wire fence to surround the Soviet Union to prevent it from disrupting the world. This was because the attempt to support anti-Bolshevik forces at the time had failed, so Clemenceau made this suggestion.

### Soviet Union Offers Suggestions for Drafting a Peace Treaty with Germany

Must Be Approved by German Central Government; Austrian Delegation to Visit Britain

[Report from this newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: The Soviet Union today made a surprising request to the Four Foreign Ministers, stating that the German central government should be allowed to offer opinions on the peace treaty with Germany, and that the final peace treaty must be approved by the German state. This request was made by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gusev in a written document. Gusev also suggested that the Allied countries should draft the peace treaty with Germany according to the drafting procedure for the peace treaties with Italy and the former Axis satellites.

[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 26th] Austrian Prime Minister Figl and his country's delegation boarded a fast train tonight via Paris to London to attend the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting to present Austria's case.

### Greek Investigation Team Leaves France for Greece

Yugoslav Representative Protests Denial of Entry

[Agence France-Presse, Toulon, France, 26th] Representatives from various countries on the UN Fact-Finding Committee boarded a French cruiser today and departed from here to Greece to conduct an on-site investigation into the situation in that country. They are expected to arrive in Athens on the 29th of this month. The Chinese representative is Dr. Jin Wenshi, Ambassador to Belgium; the Australian representative is Mr. Hood; the Belgian representative is Lieutenant General Tailleur; the Brazilian representative is General Tostes; the Colombian representative is Mr. Olarte, Minister to Belgium; the French representative is Mr. Taux, Professor of History at the University of Paris; the British representative is Mr. Winckler; and the American representative is Ms. Esseryridge. Representatives from Syria and the Soviet Union will travel to Greece on their own. The Secretary-General of the committee is Colonel Lundh of Sweden.

[This newspaper, London, 27th Broadcast, Athens] The chief representative of the Soviet delegation to the UN Fact-Finding Committee, Ambassador to Greece, Mr. Lavrentiev, arrived at the Hassani Airport this afternoon by plane.

[Agence France-Presse, Capital of Yugoslavia, 26th] Officials recently announced that Yugoslavia applied to the Greek authorities for passports to send representatives to Greece to participate in the United Nations Implementation Investigation Committee, but was rejected. The Yugoslav government therefore lodged a strong protest with the Greek authorities yesterday through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### US Representative to the Security Council Visits Marshall for Instructions

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Marshall is entering his second week as Secretary of State and is about to deal with the most urgent and difficult issue facing the United States, namely, the international control of atomic energy. Austin, the US representative to the Atomic Energy Committee of the Security Council, came here to visit Marshall to receive instructions before the Security Council re-discusses the two issues of atomic energy and disarmament on February 4.

### US Plans to Implement Japanese Reparations Plan Immediately; Expresses Dissatisfaction with Soviet and Canadian Lack of Input

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Officials announced today that the Soviet Union and Canada intend to delay the implementation of the US plan to immediately distribute Japanese reparations. The State Department asked the relevant countries last November to jointly draft instructions to be sent to MacArthur, instructing him on how to distribute 15% to 20% of the Japanese reparations first. The Soviet Union and Canada have ignored this. China, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, India, and the Netherlands have all submitted their opinions to the State Department. The US government is now considering taking steps regardless of the opinions of the Soviet Union and Canada. China, the Philippines, and other countries are deeply dissatisfied with the delay in the distribution of Japanese reparations and advocate the speedy dismantling and transportation of the designated Japanese factory machinery, otherwise it will rust and become unusable. The Soviet representative had previously blocked the formation of an agreement in the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission. It is unclear why Canada has not responded. Its representative may express an opinion soon, and it is hoped that the Soviet representative will also join the discussion in the end. The US-Soviet dispute mainly concerns the scope of reparations. The Soviet Union insists that what its troops obtained in the three eastern provinces of China should be regarded as "war booty." The Pauley Report opposes this, believing that the Soviet Union's removal of machinery in the three eastern provinces has made it impossible to restore the industry there, valued at US$1.1 billion. If this kind of machinery removed by the Soviet Union is used as reparations, then its share of the Japanese reparations should be reduced. Although the United States has not specified in detail how to distribute Japanese reparations, it advocates that China, Australia, the Philippines, and India should receive the majority.

Canadian Statement

[United Press, Ottawa, 26th] Canadian diplomatic officials declared today that it is surprising that the United States has expressed dissatisfaction because Canada has not yet provided its views on the distribution of Japanese reparations. In fact, this matter is under consideration, and Canada will soon submit its suggestions. It is true that the Canadian cabinet has been slow to decide on a policy, but this is purely due to certain circumstances beyond the control of Canadian authorities. In short, there is no malicious intent behind Canada's delay in replying.

### Tense Political Situation in Japan

Red Star Newspaper Editorial Criticizes Japanese Militarists

[United Press, London, 26th] TASS relayed a report from the Soviet "Red Star Newspaper" stating that although the former Japanese General Staff has been formally dissolved, secret activities persist. Thousands of officers of the Japanese army, navy, and air force are nominally affiliated with the so-called Rehabilitation Bureau, but their actual actions have nothing to do with rehabilitation. Japan has not yet abolished its military preparations, and the militarists are gradually maintaining their military power. War criminals are still lurking in various government departments.

### British-Egyptian Negotiations Finally Break Down; Egypt Decides to Appeal to the Security Council; Egyptian Prime Minister Announces at News Conference

[United Press, Cairo, 26th] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy declared at a press conference today that the Egyptian government has formally stopped negotiations on the British-Egyptian agreement and has decided to refer the various deadlocked issues between Britain and Egypt to the United Nations Security Council. Although Nokrashy did not specify the issues that are deadlocked, it is generally expected that they refer to the disputes over the future political status of Sudan. The British side insists that Sudan must determine its own political future, leading to irresolvable disputes.

[United Press, Cairo, 26th] Egyptian Minister of Transport Abbaci declared after today's cabinet meeting that Egypt will appeal to the UN Security Council with the entire case, not just limited to the issue of Sudan.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 26th] Professor L’Huillier of International Law at the University of Paris, will come to Cairo as an expert in international law to prepare to bring the British-Egyptian relationship to the Security Council.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: At this morning's meeting of the Palestine Conference, Arab representative Husseini expressed his opinion, declaring that the Arabs firmly oppose any plan to divide Palestine and will resist any pressure to the death. Bevin requested a few days to review this opinion, and the meeting was adjourned indefinitely.

British Officer Kidnapped

[United Press, Jerusalem, 26th] Former British Army officer Major Collins was kidnapped from his residence today by four Jewish underground operatives (three men and one woman) after being anesthetized with ether. It is believed that the kidnappers are members of the Irgun, as the Irgun had threatened that if their member, Groener, who had been sentenced to hanging, was indeed executed on the 28th, they would kidnap British people as hostages and execute them. The area is now heavily guarded by British troops and police, who have been ordered to kill anyone who moves without permission.

### Another Major Tragedy in the Aviation World: Dutch Airliner Crashes; Swedish Prince and Famous American Opera Singer Perish; Pilot Was Famous Dutch Aviator

[United Press, Capital of Denmark, 26th] A Dutch Airlines plane, piloted by famous Dutch pilot Mr. Jensen Dorffer, crashed and burned shortly after taking off from here today, carrying Swedish Prince Adolf and others to the Swedish capital. All sixteen passengers and six crew members perished. The highest-pitched American opera singer, Grace Moore, was also on board. Adolf, 40, son of Swedish Crown Prince Adolf, was returning home after hunting with Prince Bernhard and Princess Juliana in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, he died in the accident. His son, Shengfu, is nine months old and will be the second-generation successor to the Swedish throne. Ms. Moore, a famous singer and movie star, was well received at concerts here and planned to continue to Stockholm to participate in concerts. Jensen Dorffer, 54, is the oldest pilot of the Dutch Airlines. He joined the Dutch Air Force in 1918 and began his flying career. In 1934, he participated in the aviation competition from Britain to Australia and was the first person to fly from Europe to China via Tokyo. A detailed list of other passengers has not yet been released. All twenty-two victims died immediately after the plane crashed, and the bodies were charred and virtually unidentifiable. The plane arrived at Kastrup Airport here this afternoon from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and shortly after its brief stop, was planning to fly to the Swedish capital.

### French Armored Columns Meet in Hanoi

Using Flamethrower Planes to Clear Obstacles

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] According to Hanoi news, two columns of French armored forces have joined forces at Da Ho near Hanoi, with only slight resistance from the Viet Minh forces.

### A War of Words in the Far East Tribunal; Defense Attorney Accuses MacArthur of Overreach; Presiding Judge Webb Sternly Refutes

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 26th] At this morning's session of the Far East International Tribunal, Presiding Judge Webb and Smith, the defense attorney for the defendant Hirota, engaged in a war of words, which was the first such conflict in the history of the military tribunal. The dispute arose when the defense attorney presented a general statement requesting that the legal action against the 26 defendants be dropped on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence. The presiding judge refuted this and ordered each defense attorney to submit a defense brief for his client individually.

At the beginning of the session, Webb rejected three other briefs, namely: (1) errors in interrogation, (2) opposition to MacArthur's legal rights, and (3) opposition to the jurisdiction of the court. Webb refuted the latter two points vehemently, stating that involving MacArthur was a violation of regulations. These words angered Smith, who spoke on behalf of half of the defendants, threatening to appeal to the US Supreme Court. Webb immediately retorted, saying, "Your appeal to Washington is irrelevant to us. Know that the court is not a parliament or congress." "MacArthur's authority is not subject to your public debate. If you believe that fairness is being violated, you can file a defense in a legal manner, but you cannot issue politically charged condemnations." After Webb finished speaking, several lawyers hurriedly assured the court that they recognized MacArthur's authority. Smith's brief pointed out that MacArthur had violated the US Constitution by accepting the position of Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan and overstepping his authority to organize the Far East International Tribunal.

### Churchill Today

— By Xu Zhongpei, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in London

"Each generation produces its own talented writers, each leading the way through trials and hardships for a decade."

Recently, there was a long discussion in England about whether a statue of Roosevelt should be seated or standing. The "News Chronicle" published a timely cartoon, titled "Erecting a Statue for the Living." In the chair Roosevelt used to sit in, an empty space is filled by a worried Truman, looking lost. Beside him, a statue of Churchill is leaning, about to fall over.

This truly symbolizes the current state of Churchill. This fall is a fall within his current circumstances, not a complete downfall including his past. Churchill is a statesman of his generation, leading Britain through hardships to victory amidst missile strikes. His glorious past cannot be forgotten, like a setting sun, still radiant even as it descends below the horizon.

He still possesses the people's affection and remains one of the most respected Britons. When he speaks in Parliament, it is like a father instructing his sons, and the members treat him with the respect due to an elder relative. However, all this past glory is merely a shadow in reality. To put it nicely, it is ahead of its time. One member said, "Whenever Churchill speaks in Parliament, everyone puts aside the topic under discussion and respectfully listens to his speech, listening to his attacks on the government. Once he finishes and takes his seat, everyone picks up where they left off and resumes the discussion." His appearance is merely an interlude that doesn't address the main issue.

Britain's Old Hero

Although many political commentators haven't yet freely used their sharp pens against the old hero who has served the country, they have already expressed open dissatisfaction with him. Many of these commentators vigorously supported Churchill during the war, but now their attitude has changed drastically. Their change of heart isn't due to snobbery, but as one commentator aptly put it, "One cannot judge a person solely based on their past—especially when they are still active in politics."

Churchill is, of course, still an active figure in politics. Although the Conservative Party lost in the last election, he remains the leader of the opposition. He speaks eloquently, writes movingly, and is a talented man. The abandonment of him by outstanding political commentators is because all of his policies lag behind the times, and he can even be said to have no policies at all.

Attlee is Likable

Churchill's successor, Attlee, may not be eloquent, but he speaks to the point, and everyone who has met him feels his sincerity. He is patient, willing to take losses, and shows no arrogance or conceit. His performance in office for the past year and a half has made the people love him, and political commentators have begun to discover his many merits. Moreover, he has chosen good assistants; Morrison and Bevin are both competent. Compared to the group of officials who took office after Roosevelt in the United States, the British post-war government appears more mature and skilled at managing everything. Therefore, while Americans fondly remember Roosevelt, the British feel that they don't have a Churchill government that knows what it is doing, and even that the government's concrete policies are much better than those of Churchill's government—this is Churchill's fatal flaw.

Wouldn't Churchill want to catch up quickly? No one is more aware of the changes in the outside world than himself. His speech in Fulton and his travels in Europe are nothing more than attempts to maintain his momentum. Recently, he also prepared to strengthen the party's organization and rename the Conservative Party the Unified Conservative Party.

The Labor Party's newspaper, the "Daily Herald," mocked him, saying, "In fact, all the divisions within the Conservative Party cannot be unified by renaming it, it will never be unified. But within this future unified party, there is one thing on which everyone agrees: Churchill can go write his memoirs, can go to many small European countries to speak about Europe forming a single family, but he doesn't need to cling so desperately to the title of leader of the opposition."

The Labor Party and the Conservative Party are opposed to each other, and Futuo's statement is, of course, excessive, but if the slanderous parts of the party struggle are removed, Futuo's words also have their truth. The general young people of the Conservative Party know that their party's struggles are outdated and aspire to rise up and reform. Therefore, it is said that they hope the old ones will retire, either openly or secretly, but whenever there are such rumors, Churchill will definitely make a public statement: "I will continue to lead the Conservative Party."

The Liberal Party's Attitude

The Liberal Party, aside from the Labor and Conservative parties, is now closely following the government and cooperating well. Therefore, they inevitably have cold irony and hot sarcasm for Churchill, who has enjoyed great fame, believing that his criticism of the Attlee government is too harsh, and Attlee has shown magnanimity in humility and tolerance.

The Communist Party's attitude towards Churchill is self-evident. Given Churchill's attacks on Stalin, the Communist Party cannot help but hate Churchill to the bone.

In the press, "The Times" is a unique independent faction, free from all parties. But when Churchill raised the question in Parliament, "Does the government know that the Soviet army has about two hundred divisions in Europe?", "The Times" also wrote an article criticizing Churchill, believing that if Churchill knew the intelligence was true, he should have notified the government, not shouted it out in public.

But Churchill himself still has a stubborn, obstinate, willful, and unyielding spirit. He immerses himself in the glory of the past, writing his memoirs, and still leads the opposition in Parliament. Although he is old, he will never become a second Lloyd George.

Time is Most Ruthless

Unfortunately, time is ruthless. Churchill's protest against the British army leaving Egypt and the dispute over Indian independence, compared with the Labor government's policies, show how dim he has become, and also show that time has left Churchill behind. In Parliament, he delivered a speech on the Indian issue, reminiscing about the past glory. Although the speech was moving, in the face of this urgent problem, and when the world believes that Indian independence is a wise measure by the Labor government, how stale and unnecessary this recollection seems.

Churchill's prestige is undoubtedly declining, and along with him is the dignity of the Conservative Party. A Liberal Party commentator even speculated that the Conservative Party may never have the opportunity to govern again. But in the minds of the people, who have solid memories, he is still a legendary hero—although his legend already belongs to the past.

In the royal family, he is still loved and respected. His father was the Duke of Marlborough, he is an aristocrat, and he often has contact with the royal family. The Prime Minister is scheduled to meet the Emperor every week to report on the state of administration. It is said that when Churchill was in power, he always went to court in the morning, had lunch with the Emperor and Empress in the palace, and talked and laughed until three o'clock before leaving. Now, Prime Minister Attlee always goes to court at six o'clock in the afternoon, and leaves in a hurry after the conversation, at most having a drink with the Emperor.

### To Ensure National Security, A Strong Army is Needed. The US Secretary of the Army Advocates Universal Military Training and Intensified Preparation to Cope with Atomic Warfare.

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] Secretary of the Army Patterson delivered a speech to the Women's National Defense Association today, listing three basic needs of the US Army to properly ensure national security. It is said that the United States must establish a strong army of more than one million people, and universal military training must be implemented. In the past, from the initial appearance of a war until the storm arrived, there was still a considerable period of time to engage in training, but in the future, there will be no such preparation time. The initial indication of the outbreak of war will be bombs and radio-controlled missiles falling on our cities. The Army's budget of $6.7 billion has been reduced to barely enough to meet its minimum basic needs. Strategic Air Command Commander Keenan said that the United States will be the first target to be attacked in a future war. [United Press International, Washington, 26th] US Strategic Air Command Commander Keenan continued to say in a speech: In a future world war, the United States will be the first target to be attacked, with enemy planes attacking from both sides, killing or injuring 25 million people in the first 24 hours. The United States will be listed first on the list that Hitler first gave to his subordinates. Those who carry out the attack will be piloted and unpiloted aircraft. Radio-controlled missiles and rockets will all be loaded with atomic bombs, super explosives, super incendiary bombs, and germ bombs, or other popular weapons of mass destruction.

The British-Egyptian negotiations reversed, and the reason for the failure was that the two sides differed on the issue of Sudan. The point of the British army withdrawing from Egyptian territory was easier to resolve. The picture shows the simple ceremony held when the British army withdrew from Cairo.

### Inside Story of the Seymour Road Fire: Committee Organized for Thorough Investigation, Hoping Citizens Won't Endure in Silence. Speaker Pan Announces Details of Conversation with Director Xuan

[Reported by this newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan convened reporters at the council in Fumin Village at 3:00 PM yesterday, discussing the Seymour Road-Wuding Road fire, hoping citizens would assist the government in promoting a new social atmosphere and prevent illegal incidents from continuing. Speaker Pan stated that regarding the Seymour Road fire, there were many rumors circulating about the behavior of personnel from the City Police Bureau and Fire Department. Although what was said lacked basis, there were indeed complaints from all sides. He had already discussed the matter with Council Secretary-General Xiang Changquan the day before, hoping that the convener and members of the Council's Police Affairs Committee, or other city councilors, especially those elected in the area, would pay special attention to this matter and conduct a thorough investigation. The further purpose was to hope that similar incidents would not occur again in the future.

Speaker Pan also announced details of his conversation with Director Xuan Tiewu, stating that he had expressed to Director Xuan that the incident was the responsibility of the Fire Department. Although the fire department is a separate system, it is related to the police bureau. In the past, there were such bad habits in this city, and it is hoped that they will not occur again now. Although the treatment of firefighters is meager, firefighting is a heroic act that is worthy of our admiration. This heroic spirit should not be negatively affected and destroyed. Therefore, a rigorous investigation is required. If any illegal personnel are found, they will definitely be severely punished. At the same time, it is hoped that the affected citizens will come forward and report the matter voluntarily, and do not endure in silence. The individual will absolutely not protect anyone and hopes that citizens will cooperate with the government to correct bad habits. Director Xuan immediately telephoned the Fire Department Director, ordering him to jointly investigate with the Baojia and related personnel and visit the affected residents in many ways.

Finally, Speaker Pan earnestly hoped that citizens would no longer swallow their anger after suffering losses as in the past, and that past bad habits must be reformed, otherwise the bad social atmosphere will never be corrected. At the same time, since citizens bear many taxes to the municipal authorities, the authorities should also take into account the lives and property of the citizens at all times and provide insurance.

The Council Has the Right to Publicly Question

Also, according to the Council, the Council has the right to publicly question the Fire Department's dereliction of duty and is currently conducting detailed investigations at the scene of the incident separately. The Police Bureau was originally scheduled to publicly report the truth after its investigation yesterday, but the victim Wang Yunfu did not meet with the person in charge when he went to the Police Bureau yesterday, so there were no results. However, according to the Police Bureau, based on the investigation in recent days, it cannot be fully proven that the Fire Department was derelict in its duties.

### Five-Person Committee to Meet This Afternoon

[Reported by this newspaper] The City Government decided to form a "Five-Person Committee" to investigate and discuss the handling of the Seymour Road fire. The five people are composed of representatives from the City Government, the Police Bureau, the District Chief of the 10th District (Jingan), representatives of the victims, and City Councilor Zhang Nai-zuo.

According to Mayor Tan, the purpose of organizing the five-person investigation committee is to facilitate the affected parties to have the opportunity to make open reports. If there is evidence, the Mayor and Director Xuan will definitely investigate it strictly. Mayor Wu summoned Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang yesterday afternoon and asked him questions. The first meeting of the five-person committee will be held in the City Government Auditorium at 3:00 PM today, and the Mayor will personally attend and preside over the meeting.

The City Council has asked the conveners of the Police Affairs Committee, Zhang Nai-zuo, Fei Shu-sheng, Hou Ji-yuan, and City Councilors Zhu Wen-qi and Qian Nai-wen to jointly investigate.

### District Attorney's Office Pays Close Attention

[Reported by this newspaper] The District Attorney's Office is also paying close attention to the Seymour Road fire.

### Chen Tingrui's Letter to the Deputy Speakers: Advocates Private Management of Fire Affairs in the Central District

[Reported by this newspaper] Former Chinese Director of the Municipal Council and current Councilor Chen Tingrui sent a letter to Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu yesterday, stating: "My friend Zhang Yizhen was also one of the victims in the Seymour Road fire. When I went to visit him yesterday, according to Mr. Zhang, the situation of the fire was roughly the same as what was recorded in the Shen Bao and Da Gong Bao. The Wang family is still there, so it should not be difficult to investigate the truth. Fire affairs are one of the most important municipal affairs, and the lives and property of citizens are at stake. Firefighters have allowed the fire to burn for as long as thirteen hours, and what I have heard makes me feel like I am living in another world. You are the voice of the people, and the whole city admires you. I have the same feeling and dare to ask, as a citizen, that you join the municipal authorities in thoroughly investigating the matter to clarify responsibility. I am very fortunate. Furthermore, the importance of fire affairs is known to all. Rather than being managed by the government and becoming corrupt, it is better for citizens to manage it themselves and make it well-organized. The volunteer fire departments in Huhang and Zhabei in this city have achieved remarkable results, which is a precedent. Whether the fire affairs in the central district should be managed by the private sector in the future can be discussed in the City Council."

### Fake Undersecretary Deaf and Blind, Released on Bail for Medical Treatment Due to Serious Illness, Suddenly Reported Dead Outside, High Court Summons Person in Charge of Funeral Home

[Reported by this newspaper] Han traitor suspect Shen Qichang, 71 years old, who is deaf and blind, was released on bail for medical treatment from a court of the High Court on December 10 last year due to serious illness. Recently, the defendant's family submitted a statement to the High Court, reporting that Shen had died of illness on December 27 last year, and the body had been sent to the Paradise Funeral Home for encoffining. The High Court authorities believed that it was necessary to investigate this matter and summoned the person in charge of the Paradise Funeral Home for questioning. Yesterday, Lu Housun, the accountant of the funeral home, brought the account books to court to answer the questions. He said that on December 28 last year, there was indeed a body named Shen Qichang sent by the family, and it was encoffined on the 29th. In addition to the coffin, a total of 1,094,400 yuan was spent on encoffining. There are account books and bills as proof, but it is impossible to know whether the body is Shen Qichang himself. After the clerk made a note of the record, he was ordered to leave the court.

Shen was a scholar in the Qing Dynasty, who served as a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Qing government. After the Republic of China, he served as a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Later, he transferred to the judiciary and served in courts in Tianjin, Guangdong, Shandong, and other places. Before the War of Resistance, he practiced law in Shanghai. In 1940, he served as a member of the puppet Supervisory Committee. In 1941, he was transferred to the position of Undersecretary of the puppet Audit Department. In 1943, he resigned due to illness.

### British Ships Hope to Navigate Inland Rivers, Our Shipping Industry Pays Close Attention, Li Yunliang Expresses Opinions on the Sino-British Commercial Treaty

Recently, the British House of Lords discussed the China-related issues. Lord Chancellor Jowitt and Lord Elwyn-Jones expressed their hope that the Sino-British Commercial Treaty would stipulate that British ships would be free to navigate the coast and inland rivers of China, which has aroused great attention in the shipping industry. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shipping Association, to inquire about his views on the above issues. According to Mr. Li, what Chinese people are worried about at this time is that the Sino-British Commercial Treaty will be nominally equal in the future, but in reality, it will lack protection for China's immature shipping industry and will become a one-sided preference for Britain. Or, as rumored, China and Britain have other exchange conditions that allow British ships to re-enjoy special privileges in our inland rivers and coastal areas. The government should determine the pros and cons and not repeat the mistakes after the Opium War, so that China's shipping industry will never be able to recover.

Their work will be undertaken by the district office personnel and the Baojia. Decision: First draft a plan, and then send it to the Health Committee for study.

### Post-Release Issues for Pardoned Prisoners Await Planning Relief Measures Already in Place for Female Inmates Over One Hundred Child Inmates Sent to Reformatories

[Our Newspaper Report] Shanghai Prison continued to release a total of eighty-four prisoners yesterday who met the conditions for the general amnesty and reduced sentences, most of whom were opium offenders. Many family members of the prisoners gathered in front of the prison gate, and when they saw the released prisoners walking out of the gate, they immediately stepped forward to inquire about the recent situation of their relatives in prison and the date of their release. The prison will continue to release people in the coming days. In addition, the North Zhejiang Road Temporary Detention Center also released fifteen people yesterday.

As of yesterday, the number of people released under the general amnesty totaled one thousand and two from Shanghai Prison, one hundred and forty-three from the Women's Prison, and approximately one thousand and three hundred from the Reformatory.

The post-release issues for those released under the amnesty are of great concern to all sectors of society. If they walk out of the prison gate and have no home to return to and no way to make a living, they will inevitably fall into the clutches of the law again, which will affect social security. A reporter visited a well-known figure in the Shanghai judicial community for this purpose, who said that the government must have considered this issue before issuing the amnesty decree. However, the reporter witnessed that many of the released prisoners had no money, were thinly dressed, or had a long journey home. It is now known that when female prisoners are released, the Women's Prison distributes a total of one hundred black cloth cotton qipaos obtained from the Post-War Relief Administration. Those who have no money are assisted with travel expenses, totaling more than 30,000 yuan. Those who have no home to return to are taken in by the Women's Release Protection Association. The association is presided over by Pan Fu, of the Yangjingbang Catholic Church, who has been preaching in prison for fourteen years. The address is No. 1, Tianyou Lane, Zhaojiabang Road, Nanshi. Currently, the association has taken in and assisted more than ten people. As for male prisoners, there is no relief organization like the Protection Association. Only warm clothes are distributed at the time of release, or part of the travel expenses are subsidized. In addition, over one hundred child offenders, who were previously members of the Guangniu Party or Water Rats, will be concentrated today and sent to the Caohejing Children's Reformatory to be trained and taught life skills.

### Shanghai's Most Glorious Day Today Commemorates "January 28th"

[Our Newspaper Report] Today is the 15th anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War. This was the first time that the National Army officially fought against and defeated the Japanese invaders on the battlefield, and it was also the precursor to the Chinese nation's steadfast resistance to violence. The foundation for the victory of the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War was laid here. The City Party Headquarters has specially launched a campaign to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers to show respect. A memorial meeting will be held at 9:00 AM today on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, with Li Jishen and Huang Yanpei serving as chairman and vice-chairman. Ma Yinchu, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Zhang Dongsun, and others have been invited to attend and give speeches.

A reporter visited Mayor Wu at 5:00 PM yesterday to ask him to express his thoughts on the "January 28th" Shanghai War Memorial. Mayor Wu replied: "January 28th" is indeed the most glorious day for our city, and it is worthy of our remembrance and reflection on this 15th anniversary. What is gratifying now is that the Japanese invaders have been defeated and our country has finally achieved final victory. Therefore, it is right to commemorate it today, but holding a grand meeting is not really necessary.

[Another Report] People from all walks of life will hold a grand meeting today to commemorate the martyrs and honor loyalty, to comfort the forty-six "Four-Row Warehouse孤軍" soldiers who remained in Shanghai, and the three hundred and thirty-nine honored soldiers who recently returned from Hong Kong and Macau.

At noon, they will be treated to lunch at the Friends of the Military Society. The lone soldiers and honored soldiers will report on their combat experiences, and there will be entertainment in the afternoon.

### Citizens Neglect Anti-Theft Knowledge Creating Opportunities for Criminals Jing'an District Holds Anti-Theft Propaganda Meeting

[Our Newspaper Report] The Tenth District (Jing'an District) Office and the Jing'ansi Police Station held a joint anti-theft propaganda meeting yesterday morning at the Majestic Theatre. More than 500 baojia chiefs from the district attended, and Jin Deshi, the district chief of the Tenth District, served as the chairman. At the meeting, according to Police Chief Zhou Weiting's report, theft cases in the Jing'an District have been greatly reduced after the implementation of the police management system. At a time when the social and economic crisis is severe, prices are soaring, and there are many unemployed people, and recently, one or two thousand people have been released from prison under the amnesty, if these people have no home to return to and cannot make a living, they will be forced to return to their old ways. The reason for the formation of general theft cases is mainly due to the instability of the political situation and the difficulty of people's livelihood, but the lack or neglect of anti-theft knowledge by the general public also creates opportunities for criminals to take advantage of. If precautions are strictly taken, they will have no chance to take advantage of. It is hoped that everyone will read the anti-theft notices issued by the police station and spread them widely so that everyone in the jurisdiction can know them. The police station is determined to do its best to prevent and arrest criminals, and everyone should be on strict guard for their own lives and property.

### Taikoo Wharf Workers Dispute Over Two Hundred People Seek Reinstatement

The dispute between the new and old workers at the Taikoo Wharf on Jinling Road Bund in this city over the right to carry cargo has lasted for a long time and has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. Yesterday morning, more than two hundred unemployed old workers, led by the chief foreman Zhou Ruiye, gathered at the Taikoo Wharf. They planned to negotiate with the new foreman, Chen Shanyu, to demand immediate reinstatement. Because Chen had heard the news and left, the group of old workers gathered at the wharf and refused to disperse.

### Complex Drug Trafficking Case The District Court Will Open a Debate Court Today Involving as Many as Seventeen Defendants

[Our Newspaper Report] The District Court yesterday tried a large-scale drug trafficking case involving as many as seventeen defendants. The first defendant, Zhu Qishan, was reported in a confidential letter from the Nantong District Court that the drug dealer Su Suiliang confessed that all the drugs were purchased from Zhu Qishan. The District Court then searched Zhu's concubines' residence and found many packages of morphine. However, Zhu claimed in court yesterday that he was a cloth merchant, and his wife, Liu Wenlan, and concubine, Zhu Decao, also denied that their husband was trafficking in drugs. The second defendant, Zhang Mingyuan, took a plane from Tianjin to Shanghai on November 9 last year, carrying a leather suitcase containing morphine. After getting off the plane, he handed the suitcase to the third defendant, Yan Dongfu, who was waiting at the airport. Yan claimed to be a retired soldier who went to the airport to greet relatives and friends and happened to see Zhang, who was an acquaintance, so they traveled together. The fourth defendant, Sun Zhicheng, the ninth defendant, Li Hongying, the tenth defendant, Zhang Gentian, the eleventh defendant, Zhang Yiren, and the twelfth defendant, Li Dingguo (who committed suicide in prison), were all from Taiwan and were all suspected of jointly trafficking in drugs, and drugs were seized.

The eighth defendant, Song Zixin (whose brother, Song Zi'an, was arrested in Tianjin for a drug case). Zhu Qishan's concubine sister, Zhang Wenying, and Kan Zhang Jianghou were also involved. This case is a combination of several cases. Because the defendants are related to each other, the drugs were transported from Tianjin to Shanghai by air, ship, and train. The District Court previously sent a letter to the Tianjin Court to assist in the investigation. The detailed reply from the Tianjin District Court has now arrived in Shanghai. The case was originally scheduled for debate yesterday, but because there were too many defendants and the trial took too long, the court ordered that the court debate be continued at 2:00 PM today.

### Reader Consultation Legal Questions

(1) Usury

Zhu Gufen asks: My relative, A, acting on behalf of his friend, B, borrowed 4 million yuan from C, D, and E. However, A's name is on the notes. Now B is bankrupt. In the past three months, in addition to paying more than 4 million yuan in interest, he still owes C, D, and E more than 1 million yuan each. A is also unable to repay the debt. He asked someone to plead with the creditors C, D, and E to stop the interest and repay the principal in installments or repay the principal by offsetting it with goods, but C and others refused. A is extremely anxious. Please advise: (1) Can A sue C, D, and E for the crime of usury? (2) Or can A file a private prosecution with the court and ask the official to order them to stop the interest and repay the principal within a time limit? (3) Can A ask a lawyer to handle the matter?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia replies] It is right to ask the creditors to stop the interest and repay the principal. If C and others refuse, and there is indeed evidence that they have taken advantage of others' urgency and inexperience, lending money and obtaining heavy interest that is obviously disproportionate to the principal, you can sue them according to law.

(2) Landlord's Abuse

Wu Ruofan asks: I am a tenant in a three-room house. Recently, the second landlord wants to increase the rent on the pretext of increased taxes, which is unreasonable. I have legal questions and would like to ask for answers: (1) Is there any explicit provision for the rent between the second landlord and the third tenant? How should it be calculated to be reasonable? (2) Can I refuse to pay the rent if the second landlord illegally increases the rent?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia replies] (1) Last year, the City Government stipulated that the rent should be calculated at 140 times the pre-war rate. (2) You cannot refuse to pay, you should deposit it according to law.

### Thirty Years of Shanghai Cinema

Foreword: The film industry in Shanghai is currently in a difficult and pitiable situation. The economic downturn and the narrowness of the film market are undoubtedly the objective reasons for the current stagnation of the film industry. More than a year after the victory [of the war], the total number of domestically produced films is still less than twenty, and the content is so inadequate and the technical level is so insufficient that it is truly lamentable!

Secondly, the large-scale import of foreign films is also a fatal blow to the Chinese film industry. Looking around, the film industry in Shanghai, or even in China, can be said to be completely occupied by foreign films, and 80% of the content of these foreign films is entertainment. If there is any educational significance, it is negative. How much educational awareness can you get from those embracing, detective, song and dance, and all-out action color films? This is not to say that Western film merchants are maliciously anesthetizing the Chinese people, but the more trivial the film, the more money it makes in China! The facts are obvious and need no further explanation.

Thirdly, the film industry itself undeniably has many subjective shortcomings. Such as the lack of talent, rudimentary equipment, and inadequate organization and management, making the film industry in Shanghai (which is actually the entire Chinese film industry) still "frail" today.

The film industry in Shanghai has worked hard for its cause and made considerable contributions, but it is still unable to achieve satisfactory results due to various subjective and objective constraints - especially now! However, although the environment is difficult, as pioneers in the film industry, there is absolutely no reason to shrink back and lose heart!

Regarding these issues, many experts and senior writers have provided many valuable opinions, which need not be repeated. What needs to be remembered is this precious history of the Shanghai film industry from its infancy to the present. The reporter does not expect this text to bring anything, but hopes to experience this true story—how the Shanghai film industry has grown.

The Budding Period, 1917

An American film merchant brought camera equipment to China, intending to engage in the film production business, but lost all of his capital of 100,000 yuan and was stranded in Shanghai. Unable to do anything, he had to sell the camera equipment and return home as soon as possible.

The Commercial Press bought this equipment and film. The Commercial Press then tried to run a film production business under its photography department, hiring Ye Xiangrong, who had returned from studying in the United States, as a photographer, and produced simple newsreels, including short films such as "Commercial Press Employees Leaving Work", "Grand Funeral of Sheng Xingcun", "Red Cross Parade", and "Shanghai Burning Soil". The following year, the Commercial Press specially established a "Film Department", hiring Liao Enshou as a photographer to take scenic films and current affairs news in various scenic spots in the country. A series of films were produced, including "Lushan Scenery", "West Lake Scenery", and "Beijing Scenery". Subsequently, educational newsreels such as "Women's Gymnasium" and "Yangzhen Kindergarten" were produced as short film experiments, with considerable results.

Therefore, the Commercial Press simply expanded the film business. Mei Lanfang's "Goddess Scattering Flowers" and "Chunxiang Teasing the Schoolboy" were also filmed on the screen. Between 1918 and 1919, costume dramas such as "Miser", "Young Master Li", "Theft in the Car", "Filial Daughter-in-Law Soup", "The Prodigal Son Returns", "Winning the Lottery", "Picking Up Gold in the Wilderness", and "Son-in-Law Celebrating Birthday" were also filmed. This was the beginning of Chinese people running and producing their own films.

However, before the Commercial Press, the "Asia Film Company" had already made films in Shanghai, but it was not run by Chinese people. The story is long. As early as 1909 during the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, an American named Blachere founded "Asia" in Shanghai and filmed "Empress Dowager Cixi". Until 1913, no second film was produced. Due to difficulties in maintaining it, it was transferred to the company's manager, an American named Esmil. After Esmil took over, he brought together people from the Shanghai New Drama Circle. The basic actors were Qian Huafo, Yang Runshen, and others. The first production was "Difficult Husband and Difficult Wife", directed by Zheng Zhengqiu. Later, due to the lack of film sources, it was suspended for several months. Then, "Two Hundred and Fifty", starring Qian Huafo, "Visiting the City God Temple", "Five Blessings Come to the Door", "Killing Son for Revenge", "Bicycle Accident", "Zhuangzi Splitting the Coffin", "Changban Slope", and "Shop Assistant Losing Ticket", starring Wang Xianneng and others, were completed. During the Second Revolution in the autumn, a newsreel of "Revolutionary Army Attacking the Manufacturing Bureau" was also produced. However, when the European War broke out the following year, the film source was cut off again and it was closed. Later, there was the "Huaxian Film Company", but it was a flash in the pan and closed down due to losses. This is not mentioned here.

At that time, one could know the content of the films just by looking at these drama titles. There was no need to talk about "technique" or "effect". Moreover, all the actors were male. The female protagonists in the films were played by male actors, wearing cheongsams, putting on rouge, and appearing on the screen in a twisted manner. Fortunately, it was still the silent film era, so there was no need to raise their voices to imitate a woman's accent.

The Rise of Domestic Films

A new turning point in the beginning of film came in the winter of 1919. Universal Pictures of the United States sent Henry to China to take scenic photos of various places. In Shanghai, he borrowed the Commercial Press's film production department as a film processing place. Because of their close contact, the Commercial Press sent Ren Pengnian and others to travel with the Universal Pictures photography team to various places in Beijing and Tianjin for half a year. During these six months, Ren Pengnian and others realized the truth about movies. They felt that the movies they had made before were really outrageous and needed to be improved. When the Universal photography team returned to the United States, they sold the camera equipment they had brought at a low price to the Commercial Press.

In 1920, the Commercial Press sent Yu Houpei and others to the United States to inspect the film business. After returning, they filmed "Lotus Drop" and "Righteousness Destroys Relatives". The film department of the Commercial Press did not become independent until 1926, when it was renamed Guoguang Film Company. Gradually, the film business finally raised its head and won the attention of people from all walks of life. In 1921, three new film companies were opened in Shanghai: China Film Research Institute, Shanghai Film Company, and New Asia Film Company.

When the China Film Research Institute was established, it coincided with the sensational case of Yan Ruisheng's murder of Wang Jianying in Shanghai. Therefore, this incident was used as the main theme, and the Commercial Press Film Department was entrusted to film "Yan Ruisheng". Ms. FF, a socialite at the time, was hired, and Yin Mingzhu played the lead role. After completion, it was rented to the Summer Palatial Grand Theater at a high price and screened for a week, and the theater was crowded. However, the China Film Research Institute ended its business as soon as it made money. The first new film of the "Shanghai Film Company" was "Sea Oath", starring Yin Mingzhu. Later, "Old Well Heavy Wave Record", starring Fu Wenai, and "Abandoned Child", starring Dan Erchun, were also filmed.

New Asia Company started filming "Red Powder Skull", which was the first martial arts film in Shanghai.

Film Companies Established One After Another

Here, we must mention the "Mingxing Film Company", which occupies the most important position in the Shanghai film industry. It was born in March 1922. At first, because it did not have the equipment for a photography studio, it borrowed a glass shed from a Westerner named Old Luo and used it as a photography studio to try out news and comedy short films, including "The Adventures of the King of Comedy in Shanghai", "Disturbing the Strange Theater", and "Love of Laborers". In 1923, "Orphan Saves Ancestors" was filmed, advocating inherent morality, which was praised by the audience and the business income was quite good. Where there is profit, general large and small companies have secretly proceeded.

In the same year, the "China Film Company" also filmed "New Nanjing" and "Idiot", but had to close down due to lack of capital.

The following year, film companies sprung up like mushrooms after rain, with a total of fourteen:

(Name) (Representative Work)

Great China Human Heart

Lily Tea Picking Girl

Kunlun Foot Shadow in Front of the Window

Great Wall Abandoned Woman

United Love Sea Storm

New Teenager Love String Variation Record

In 1926, another seventeen were established:

Feifei Wandering Butterfly

Good Friend Miser

Three Friends Runaway Marriage

China First Good Widow

Kaiyuan Marriage Contract

Fair Fair Fight

Five Friends Good Time

Yanyang Down and Out Frightened Soul

Happy Forest Sacrifice for Friends

It can be imagined how vigorous the film business was at that time. From 1926 to 1936, during these ten years, film companies rose and fell, which was very lively. But only a few companies, such as Mingxing, Lianhua, Tianyi, Yihua, and Diantong, really achieved results. And some domestic film companies had no cameras, no photography studios, and even no actors. They were just a combination of three or five people who put up the name of a film company and called themselves entrepreneurs in the film industry. Therefore, although there were many film companies, the production rate of domestic films was extremely low. Taking 1935 as an example, there were a total of forty-six film companies in Shanghai that year, but the total output of films was only thirty-eight, while the total number of Western films sold that year was as many as three hundred and seventy-eight.

The Production of Sound Films

China's first sound film was Lianhua Film Company's "Wild Grass and Idle Flowers", followed by Mingxing's "Singer Red Peony" and Lianhua's "Poppy", etc., but those used wax disc sound. The "film edge sound" nearly sound film experiment was successfully tested in Shanghai in 1936. In 1931, Tianyi Film Company and Mingxing Film Company successively purchased sound film cameras and built sound film photography studios, so there were officially self-made sound films. Tianyi's first sound film was "Spring Colors of the Song Field", which was publicly screened at the New Light Grand Theater on October 29, 1931. Mingxing's first sound film was "Old Times of Beijing", which was simultaneously publicly screened at the Central and Mingxing theaters on May 12, 1932.

Soon, Chinese people invented their own recording machines. In 1934, Situ Huimin and others self-made a sound camera, named "Sanyou-style Recording Machine", which achieved very good results and could record sound outdoors. It won a certificate from the China Educational Film Association and a bonus of 10,000 yuan from Chairman Chiang. Sanyou then organized Changtong Film Company, and the first production was "Peach and Plum Tribulation". At that time, it is also worth mentioning that Mingxing Company once shot color films. In 1931, Mingxing Company, in view of the popularity of European and American color films, filmed a part of "Tears and Laughter" in color, but because the technology was not good and the cost was too high, it was not very successful. Later, during the Anti-Japanese War, there were also attempts, but the results were not good. Until now, we have not been able to see a complete domestic color film.

Before and After the War of Resistance Against Japan

In the early days of Shanghai films, martial arts films such as "Burning the Red Lotus Temple" were popular. The reason why this kind of martial arts film was popular for a while was simply to express the backward worldview of the petty bourgeoisie at that time! Later, social dramas such as "Sister Flowers" began to replace martial arts films, winning a wide audience. In fact, the dissatisfaction with reality and absurd fantasies expressed in these social dramas were no different from martial arts films, except that they were closely related to realistic social issues, and the fantasies also shed their mysterious coats. This change moved the Shanghai film scene from a mysterious tower to a crossroads, which is naturally a good phenomenon.

"Song of the Fishermen", which was screened for more than eighty days and whose seats were always in demand, led domestic films to penetrate the "tragedy" style, and the general audience seemed to love to watch those "joys and sorrows" plays.

In summary, before the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai's film scene was mostly social and ethical dramas in terms of quality, and as mentioned earlier, there were many film companies but very few productions in terms of quantity.

What happened after the Anti-Japanese War?

After spending some dark days on the "isolated island", Shanghai's domestic films had undergone a fundamental change: from the struggle for "quality" to the expansion of "quantity"!

The expansion of quantity may be very good in general. Readers can of course remember how the domestic films at that time were surging. A "Three Smiles" could be filmed in a week, and ten films could be rushed out in a month. The output cannot be said to be small, but the content is really embarrassing! Various film companies were just desperately planning for business, grasping the general low-level audience, and did not hesitate to produce in a rough and shoddy manner, placing the content consciousness in a foreign country! Costume dramas became popular, and the story of "the fallen son wins the top prize" was all brought to the screen. There were also some detective and nonsense boring films that actually became active! Failure pessimism, predestination theory, "peace" theory, and surrender theory all met with the audience!

Why has the "quality" of domestic films declined so much?

First of all, we must point out that Shanghai's domestic films do not have a sound strategy. The film business after "August 13" was done with a "try and see" mentality and did not have a strong will. Therefore, when evil forces attacked them, they began to waver and waver.

This fact was even more obvious after the Pacific War on December 8, 1941. The film practitioners with weak will threw themselves into the arms of the "Greater East Asia"! The Shanghai film search after the Pacific War can be summed up in one sentence: "Demons occupy a dark mass!"

Current Situation of the Film Industry

After the victory, the various factories of the "Huaying" in the enemy and puppet period in this city were taken over by the central government separately. The former Fulv Liliu Huaying Second Factory was changed to the Central Film Photography Studio Second Factory, the Zhabei Tiantong'an Road Photography Studio was the First Factory, and the former Xiafei Road Huaying Third Factory was taken over by the Political Department of the Military Commission and changed to the First Factory, and the Connaud Road was the Second Factory. After the takeover, due to talent, economy, and all kinds of difficulties, the film industry was unusually silent.

By the end of last year, a total of thirteen domestic films had been screened: "Loyal Family", "Frontline Storm", "Tears of Jinghua", "Holy City Record", "Orioles Fly in the World", "Dare to Die Guard Team", "Japanese Spy", "Blood Splattered Cherry Blossoms", "Reeds Turn White and Swallows Fly", "Iron Bones and Ice Heart", "Number One in the World", "The Miserable Do Not Sympathize with Each Other", and "Sparks of the Nation". About "Distant Love", "Lovesickness" and "Spring Marks on the Lake" are currently being screened, and several others are in production. Looking at this number is really pitiful, and its content and technology also have many debatable points.

Special Report of This Newspaper

### News Film: The World's Ears and Eyes

News and film are both "the world's ears and eyes." In this 20th century, these two things finally merged and produced "news film." Currently, we can see some news short films, international or domestic, before the feature film in the cinema, so that in addition to entertainment and appreciation, we can effortlessly accept some common sense of current affairs, and its effect is even better than black words on white paper!

What was the first news film made in Shanghai?

When the Fifth Far Eastern Games were held in Hongkou Park in the summer of twenty-six years ago, the film department of the Commercial Press cooperated with Dr. Peter, the director of the film department of the YMCA, to start taking news short films at the venue. A total of three volumes were filmed: the first volume was the entry of athletes and the opening ceremony, the second volume was the finals of various sports, and the third volume was the girls' gymnastics and the scout gymnastics. These three volumes are the opening of the production of Chinese news films.

In 1922, General Joffre came to Shanghai for sightseeing. Joffre Road was decorated with lanterns and colors to welcome him, which was very grand. The newly established Mingxing Film Company captured the situation of welcoming Joffre into the camera as a start-up gun before Mingxing started filming.

The production of news films flourished after 1927. In 1930, Lianhua was established and produced "Lianhua News" every month. The Central Propaganda Committee also cooperated with Lianhua for a while to take news from various places to enrich the content, which was named "China News".

News films can show their great effect in wartime! Unfortunately, the citizens on the isolated island could not meet and shake hands with the anti-Japanese warriors on the screen. Only after the outbreak of the European War could they see some beacon fires on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in the British Embassy. At the same time, readers may also remember that films of Nazi self-propaganda were also being screened in the German Embassy.

Now, in addition to the overseas news regularly provided by the United States Information Service and several other companies, domestic news is generally produced by the China Film Factory. There has been significant progress in quality compared to the past. I wish them to work hard and make progress! And I hope that the news industry and the film industry will cooperate closely, like Hearst and MGM in the United States!

Among these one hundred names, there are actually only thirty-six people. In other words, there are a total of thirty-six stars who have won the throne in the ten years from 1936 to 1945. And from the above list, you can also see the ups and downs of Hollywood stars.

From 1936 to 1938, the first place was always occupied by child star Shirley Temple. However, due to the increase in age, she fell to fifth place in the fourth year, and then fell out of the top ten! She was replaced by Mickey Rooney, who was the "movie emperor" for three years, but he also fell in the fourth year, becoming the fourth place. In the next year, he fell to ninth place. In the top ten stars of 1944, you can't see the name of this naughty star.

Clark Gable, from 1936 to 1943, he was always selected among the top ten superstars every year; and Spencer Tracy, that tough star, from 1938 to 1945, except for 1943, was also repeatedly listed among the top ten stars. Among the female stars, Greer Garson and Betty Grable are also very popular, and Grable also won the championship in 1943!

Strangely, Abbott and Costello, these two funny stars, actually got the first place in 1942! As for Bing Crosby, he has always been promoted as the "movie emperor" recently, and his bass singing has fascinated audiences all over the world!

### The Central Bank Secretly Sells More Than 10,000 Taels of Gold; Gold Prices Are Powerless to Resist; Falling 190,000 Yuan Compared to Last Saturday

Yesterday, it was still subject to the control of the Central Bank. The morning opened at 4.06 million to 4.08 million, and there was a tendency to weaken as high-priced supply sources emerged. However, the price of 3.99 million once struggled, but due to the registration and allocation relationship, buyers were slightly cautious, and the market fell back to 3.95 million. The Central Bank allocated 3,340 taels at a price of 3.96 million. After the entry of miscellaneous speculative funds and the acceptance of Jingbang [Beijing merchants], the Central Bank secretly sold more than 3,000 taels in addition to the explicit allocation. Therefore, it has never been able to re-cross the 4 million mark. Later, the saying of unlimited allocation spread, and even around 3.95 million at noon. In the afternoon, the Central Bank's buying and selling was even more vigorous, and another 6,000 taels were supplied according to the market, pushing it down to 3.87 million, and then it stabilized slightly. As a result, it fell 190,000 yuan compared to last Saturday, the price of gold jewelry still hanging at 415,000 yuan, silver dollars rose slightly, and the covert tightening of money was seen, ranging from 1.5 jiao to 2 jiao.

Foreign currencies also eased. The black market price of US dollars was initially 6,900 to 7,100 in the morning, and then fell back with the price of gold. At noon, it fell back to around 6,800. Although the gold market declined in the afternoon, the US dollar did not have much impact, although weak but not much. As a result, it fell 300 yuan compared to last Saturday. The price of Hong Kong dollars also weakened, falling 50 yuan compared to last Saturday. There was limited actual sales of Hong Kong exchange rates. Yesterday, there were still a few transactions at 1,340 yuan. Indian exchange rates were 1,630 yuan, and British exchange rates were 21,400 yuan, all with more supply than demand, and the asking price was slightly lower in the afternoon.

### Hua Stocks Poised to Rise, Small Stocks Particularly Sharp

Yesterday, large Hua stocks were stable in the morning but weak in the afternoon, while small stocks continued to advance. Small stocks opened higher in the morning, with Yong Yarn showing brisk trading and declining slightly. After the opening, Nos. 85 and 76 were supplied, and Yong Yarn once retreated to 847 yuan. Nos. 14, 197, 223, 83, 85, 171, 186, etc., all advanced. Qin Xing, Jingfu, and Commercial Press all rose to the limit. Currently, Yong Yarn has risen to 863 yuan, with delivery Yong Yarn reaching a high price of 879 yuan. Nos. 198, 36, 156, and 83 saw supply at high prices and declined, but there was still a lot of buying. Nos. 156, 224, 83, and 36, etc., showed persistent selling interest, forcing the gold market to decline. Currently, Yong Yarn is at a low price of 835 yuan, and delivery Yong Yarn is at 853 yuan. Nos. 89, 180, 158, and 78 were replenished at low prices. Near noon, it once rebounded to over 870 yuan, but No. 156 continued to sell at high prices. The afternoon closed with mixed trading. As a result, Yong Yarn rose slightly compared to the previous close. Meiya and Xinnuo each rose by more than half a percent. Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng each rose by more than 10%. The cold stock, Commercial Press, rose to the limit, and the rest all showed well. Delivery Yong Yarn rose slightly, Xinnuo and Meiya rose by more than half a percent, and Xinguang and Huafeng each rose by more than 10%. In the afternoon, Nos. 224, 13, and 105 were sold. No. 156 suddenly exited after entering, and No. 16 sold spot Yong Yarn, gradually turning weak. No. 152 struggled with acceptance, and after entering, the Central Bank vigorously sold gold, causing some panic, and things worsened. Nos. 186, 156, and 14 again supplied for sale, and No. 16 still dumped spot Yong Yarn. Currently, delivery Yong Yarn has also reached a low price. Near the close, No. 35 came in to buy spot Yong Yarn, while Nos. 151, 158, Erqi (儿七), etc., accepted. After the low, it rose slightly, but the closing price of spot Yong Yarn was still based on the last transaction price of 816 yuan, while the listed price was above 822 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn and Xinnuo fell slightly, Meiya was flat, Jingfu rose by half a percent, and Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng each rose by about 10%.

Various off-market stocks also saw a decline.

### Public Bond Trading Not Significant

Yesterday, public bonds were stable. People had extravagant hopes for rumors of repayment of principal. Unified C opened in the morning and jumped to 2400 yuan, rising from 2430 yuan to gradually decline to 2260 yuan. Finally, it hovered between 2300 yuan and 2350 yuan. Only more than one million yuan was traded. As a result, compared to the end of the old lunar year, A and B rose by 40 yuan, C rose by 13 yuan, D rose by 200 yuan, and Unified E also rose by 50 yuan.

### Northern Gang Absorbs Yisha

Yesterday, foreign stocks saw the Northern Gang particularly eager to absorb, focusing all efforts on Yisha. Yisha opened at 9,500 in the morning, and the high price reached 10,000 yuan. After the high, it turned weak and once fell back to 9,200 yuan, but finally stabilized. After the close, it rebounded to over 10,000 yuan. As a result, compared to before the closing, Yisha and British Union each rose by 10%, and the rest all rose by about half a percent.

### Textile Control Commission Purchases National Cotton, Northern Jiangsu to Obtain 100,000 Dan

In order to increase this year's production, the National Textile Management Committee has recently been actively purchasing cotton in the Northern Jiangsu area. However, the cotton fields in Northern Jiangsu have suffered significant losses due to the disturbances of the Communist army. Currently, it can only purchase at market prices in the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu's National Army. This cotton was originally initiated for purchase by the "Dasheng Private Textile Factory," requesting the assistance of the Textile Control Commission. The Textile Control Commission believes that assisting one private yarn factory is not as good as assisting all private yarn factories in the area, in order to be fair. Therefore, it has decided to distribute the purchased cotton equally among the "Dasheng Factory," "Factories under the China Textile Corporation," and the Yarn Industry Association. The association will then divide the allocated amount into four groups for distribution to its members. According to the person in charge of the Textile Control Commission, the amount of cotton purchased this time is not large, only about 100,000 dan.

### Yarn Prices Firm First, Then Weaken; Yarn Numbers Show Eagerness to Supply

Yesterday, the yarn market was firm first and then weak. The opening of the Textile Construction cargo was delayed until 11:15 a.m., causing people in the industry to arrive late. Trading in the market was extremely late. The asking price for heavy yarn was between 2.5 million and 2.6 million, and the asking price for light yarn was only 2.1 million, similar to the market at the end of last year. Unfortunately, buyers did not surge, and yarn numbers showed a strong desire to supply, causing the red market for each yarn count to show a trend of rising and then falling.

### Woolen Fabric Increases by 10%; Red Market is Only an Ornament

The woolen fabric red market, according to the old rules of previous years, opened on the day before yesterday (i.e., the day of the Five Road Gods of Wealth). Today, it happens to be Sunday, and due to various environmental factors, discussions among the industry to open were mutually delayed. The reporter inspected Qipan Street and various tea houses yesterday, and although there were some openings, many were unable to open and were observing and inquiring each other. Most shops were waiting for the factory to open before discussing opening, and the factories were waiting for the sales situation of the hao (号) customers before opening. Therefore, the red market price became an ornament and lacked actual transactions. Overall, the red market opened yesterday increased by an average of about 10% compared to the close at the end of last year.

### Private Oil Factories Started Work Yesterday

[Central News Agency, this city] Yesterday, private oil factories in this city started work and should be able to distribute to retailers today. The China Vegetable Oil Company also continued to distribute as usual. The edible oil market has not yet opened due to the sluggish arrival of goods. However, the distribution of edible oil to retailers in this city is still carried out by private factories and the China Vegetable Oil Company according to the originally agreed price, and there should be no fluctuations.

### Tea Market Asking Prices are Quite High

The Lunar New Year holiday has passed quickly, and tea merchants also went to the market yesterday as usual. However, because those holding goods are firm, they hold a bullish attitude towards various red and green teas. Therefore, there are few samples, and asking prices are soaring, while buyers are afraid of high prices and are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. The overall closing situation was still good, but the red market rarely opened. According to people in the industry, during this year of construction, Chinese tea merchants, in view of the fact that Chinese tea has still not been active overseas, are still constantly planning the road to revival.

### China Trust Distributes Rayon; Everything Remains Unchanged

[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau's February distribution plan for rayon has been discussed at a meeting by the Government Material Committee, which the bureau represents. It has been decided that everything remains unchanged.

### Longan Turns Upward

Due to the scarcity of both arrivals and stocks, the spring market for longan is tight. Xinghua opened at 580,000 yuan for 4 yuan, Quanzhou Dabao at 480,000 yuan, Tong'an Jikui at 460,000 yuan, and large slices to 730,000 yuan. The official red market will not open until the beginning of next month, and it is still expected to be tight.

### Holders Unwilling to Sell; Silk Red Market Rises Across the Board

Yesterday, the silk red market generally saw gains. Rayon No. 12; the Dongyang brand of zero had only one box open yesterday, priced at 3.6 million yuan. The Gaoshan brand was about 450,000 yuan shorter. The highest bid was over 700,000 yuan, but silk factories have not started work, and there are allocations, so there is no absorption and the market is small. Factory agents lack supply and cannot open. Stocks in the market are very low, so holders are unwilling to sell. The asking price for C-grade is 5.5 million yuan, D-grade is 400,000 yuan, ordinary five-dan is 200,000 yuan, another dan is 5 million yuan, and dried warp five-dan goods are 3.5 million yuan. The market price is roughly as above, but there were no transactions. Asking prices in the silk market are 10% to 20% higher than last year, and buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, with no transactions all day.

### Tung Oil Discusses Opening Red Market

White tung oil has been subject to foreign exchange restrictions, and there has been no domestic development for several months. Although there were several improvements at the end of last year and before the final settlement, those in this industry were not interested, because domestic sales, no matter how sharp, are always limited by the number of sales and are not enough to exert their ambitions. Hongjiang tung oil is a product sold domestically and cannot be compared with white tung oil, but because of cost considerations, it only echoes along. Yesterday, the red market for Hongjiang white tung oil was opened (see the market price column).

### Importers Currently Feel Three Difficulties

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a person in charge of the import and export industry, there are currently three difficulties in importing goods that are not easy to solve, which greatly affect the business of most import and export firms. These difficulties are: (1) For orders placed with foreign countries before the establishment of the Import Administration Committee, but without opening foreign exchange, the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Department will not approve the subsequent application for foreign exchange; (2) It is very difficult to request an extension for goods that have opened foreign exchange but have not yet been loaded on the ship after the expiration date; (3) Goods that were allowed to be imported before the establishment of the Import Administration Committee but without the supply of foreign exchange, such as fruits, cosmetics, etc., are currently mostly restricted or prohibited due to slow arrival. In addition, many industrial raw materials, such as pigments, etc., even if they are included in the list of unlimited imports, are still in short supply. Now, including them in the list of limited imports is enough to affect the development of China's industry. It is deeply hoped that the Import Administration Committee will improve all of these.

### Import Temporary Management Committee Solicits Broad Opinions; Enlists Experts from Various Industries for Cooperation

Imported Goods Also Have Expert Advisors in Groups

[Reported by this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Import Temporary Management Committee, in order to solicit broad opinions and facilitate the progress of work, will enlist experts from all walks of life to establish an advisory body to allow the committee to listen to the opinions of various experts before deciding on various measures for reference and to eliminate barriers. The committee is currently drafting an outline for the examination of the qualifications of importers, so that it can be based on this standard to determine whether the registered importers are qualified. It is expected that there will be clues in the next few days.

The committee's Quota Allocation Department has also divided various imported goods into twelve groups, each group hiring several relevant experts to serve as advisors, so as to facilitate consultation on everything. The names of the imported goods in each group and the list of their advisors are as follows:

### Chinese Medicine Market Quiet; Medicinal Materials Industry Reduces Scope

The Chinese medicine market is affected by the tight money supply in Hong Kong and the feeling is the same in various other ports, affecting the sales of various goods. The market is very sluggish. The New Year's red market has not yet opened, and old prices are temporarily used to celebrate the season. The medicinal slices in this city need to wait for the Lantern Festival before stocking up, and the water passengers from other ports also need to wait for the Lantern Festival to arrive. The current market atmosphere is quiet. It is predicted that there will be a lot of activity after the Lantern Festival. Yesterday, the red market for musk was set: Yishengde 178,000, Xieshengquan 178,000, and Du brand 180,000.

It is also reported that the medicinal materials industry, affected by the depression, has mostly reduced its scope, laid off personnel, and cut expenses. Therefore, there are quite a few unemployed, creating an unprecedented record in the medicinal materials industry.

### Special Rotating Audit Team Audits the Use of Loan Funds by Various Factories; Li Lixia, Chief Auditor of the Central Bank, is Chairman

With the assistance of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Joint Savings Society has lent to more than 40 small factories in this city. It is learned that in order to understand whether the loaned companies are using the loans for proper purposes, the authorities have organized a rotating audit team to inspect and audit various manufacturers separately. The team is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow on the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building to discuss the method of conducting work. It is reported that the rotating audit team has a total of 20 members, with Li Lixia, chief auditor of the Central Bank, as chairman. The rest are jointly composed of two members each from the four banks of the Central Bank, China Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, and the China Trust Bureau, three members each from commercial banks and money shops, and three members from the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. As soon as the approved loans are released, the work will begin.

### American Rice to Supply and Sell to Our Country this Spring; 240,000 Tons Available

Executive Yuan Negotiating Joint Purchase with the Ministry of Food

It is reported that the United States has 245,000 tons of rice available for sale to our country this spring, of which 12,000 tons are produced locally in the United States, and the remaining 233,000 tons are shipped to the United States from Southeast Asia and other places. Currently, our country is purchasing 90,000 tons of American rice through the Executive Yuan, totaling US$160,000, and the Ministry of Food is also purchasing 90,000 tons, accounting for two-thirds of the total. The remaining one-third is reportedly being negotiated by the Executive Yuan with the Ministry of Food, or it may be jointly purchased by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry.

### Raw Sugar is Scarce and the Rolling Price Rises

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat, with little fluctuation. The Association's marked prices were: spot medium sugar white 135,500 yuan to 5,000 yuan, raw sugar red 134,000 yuan, an increase of 1,500 yuan.

### Rescuing the Domestic Tobacco Industry

Ministry of Finance has Adopted the Suggestions of the Chamber of Commerce

The National Federation of Commerce and Industry previously requested three items to save the crisis of domestic tobacco: (1) No foreign exchange should be supplied to tobacco importers; (2) Customs anti-smuggling work should be strengthened to prevent tobacco smuggling; (3) The tariff rate for tobacco imports should be increased. It is recently learned that the Ministry of Finance has adopted these suggestions. The first item is because the amended provisional measures for import and export trade announced on November 17 last year have stipulated that the quota system applies to the import of tobacco leaves and stems, and the import of cigarettes is temporarily suspended. The Provisional Administrative Committee for Imports and Exports is now transferring the application to the relevant government bodies for overall review and handling. For the second item, customs has been instructed to strengthen inspection work and strictly enforce the ban. For the third item, it is agreed to use it as a reference when revising import tax rates.

### Bayer and Defu Factories to be Reorganized into Limited Companies

After the former enemy property Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory and Defu Pigment Factory were taken over and liquidated by the former Enemy Property Management Bureau, there were not many remaining stocks after multiple auctions and tenders. The government authorities believe that these factories have a long history in the world market and our country's market and are valued by pigment and pharmaceutical merchants in various countries. Therefore, they do not intend to close them down and ordered them to be reorganized into limited companies. It is heard that the liquidation office of the factory has received this order and is currently starting the reorganization. It is expected to be formally established in early March this year.

### Northeast Economic Commission Plans to Establish Soybean Inspection Institute for Export

[Shenyang News] Northeast specialty soybeans, with an annual output of 4 million tons, have always been a major export commodity. After the victory, the Central Trust Bureau handled the transportation and sale to foreign countries. However, because there is no commodity inspection equipment in the Northeast, in order to maintain the qualified standard of export goods, it is necessary to transfer them to Shanghai and go through the inspection procedures before they can be exported, which is very troublesome. In order to support the export of Northeast specialty soybeans and make them meet the standards, the Economic Committee of the Northeast Executive Headquarters plans to establish an export soybean inspection institute in Siping, Kaiyuan and other places, with four inspection stations. It is heard that the director of the institute will be concurrently held by Chen, director of the Business Department of the Economic Committee, and the deputy director will be concurrently held by the director of the Shenyang Agriculture and Forestry Department.

### Food Prices Soar; Much Rationing, and Arrivals are Strong; Off-Market Transactions Still Exceed Price Limits; Other Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes, etc. All Rise

Today, the North and South markets are all open. A total of about 15,000 shi of rice arrived. Saigon rice is rationed without restrictions. It is heard that a total of 12,300 packages were rationed out, priced at 63,000 yuan, plus commission fees. However, high-quality early indica rice is expensive due to the high prices in the producing areas, and people's sentiments are excited, soaring by 5,6000 yuan. Bai Yuan Yin Yuan also rose by 6,7000 yuan. Therefore, off-market prices are very different from the deliberated prices, so very few transactions are concluded. Only Zhongguan South japonica rice is still within the deliberated price range. All others exceed price limits. Miscellaneous grains and oil cakes are rising uniformly. The oil market lacks trading in raw soybean oil because inland areas are soaring. Only small cart sesame oil has a slight volume of transactions, and the price also jumps by 20,000 yuan. Flour and bran have both risen sharply by 23,000 yuan. Soybean cakes are selling very well in Shantou and Taiwan, soaring by more than 2,000 yuan. Mung beans have increased by 23,000 yuan, and red beans have followed suit with an increase of 12,000 yuan. Corn and broad beans have both increased by 12,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories in this street are very eager to purchase, increasing by 23,000 yuan. Sesame has increased by 12,000 yuan. Raw peanuts have active sales in Guangzhou, increasing sharply by 56,000 yuan. Wheat is a rare commodity, with no arrivals at all, and inquiries are high.

### Although Autumn Silk Has Been Purchased by the Government, the Difficulties of Manufacturers Have Not Been Reduced

Difficult to Be Effective without a Fundamental Plan

[Reported by this newspaper] More than 2,700 dan of autumn silk, after President Song approved that autumn silk 78 points D grade be priced at 6,326,400 yuan per dan, and dried cocoons be priced at 5,767,540 yuan per dan, for government purchase, have been delivered to the China Sericulture Company for verification by manufacturers, reaching 880 dan as of yesterday. Among these, 655 dan are autumn silk, and 225 dan are dried cocoons. In fact, a total of 560 dan have been delivered to the Central Trust Bureau for purchase, of which 395 dan are autumn silk and 165 dan are dried cocoons. It is heard that there is currently no time limit for the government's purchase of autumn silk, and it is purchased as it arrives.

According to sources, the government's approved purchase price for autumn silk will hopefully prevent losses for manufacturers with well-equipped facilities, excellent technology, and meticulous management. Unfortunately, 80% of manufacturers are limited by working capital, and most of their own 30% advance payments for spring cocoon loans are discounted from high-interest loans. Therefore, the result of hard work producing with low-interest loans is all paid to high-interest loans, so there is no talk of profit. Moreover, many manufacturers have spent a great deal of money on repairing and building factories, and it is even more difficult to talk about profits. It is predicted that the government will formulate another fundamental plan to support the silk industry this year, which will generally follow three approaches: (1) simplifying loan procedures, (2) increasing the amount of loans, (3) implementing strict management.

### Industrial Loan Review Committee Continues Investigation Work

[Reported by this newspaper] The Provisional Review Committee for Industrial Enterprise Loans of the Joint Savings Society has accepted many more applications. Due to the urgent time, they have not been completed. Now the valley factories have started work one after another. The prior investigation work has been continuing as usual from today. All applications, after being approved by the Joint Savings Society, can be handed over to the Shanghai branch for processing. It is also reported that the members of the Review Committee have been meeting three times a week in recent months. They have also been meeting as usual on Sundays and New Year's Eve, working extremely hard. President Song held a banquet on the 25th at the Bank of China Building on the third floor to entertain and comfort them. Xu Baiyuan, Huo Baoshu, Li Fuxun, Xu Jiyin, Qin Runqing, Liu Gongyun, Lin Fengbao, Gu Chunfan, etc. attended. The President expressed great satisfaction with the committee's work in the past few weeks and offered words of encouragement.

### Concerning the Issue of Increased Tuition Fees for This Semester: Private School Teachers Petitioned Yesterday; Mayor Wu Believes Current Fees Should Follow the Senate Resolution; Speaker Pan Promises to Raise the Issue for Reconsideration During the Next General Assembly

[Our Report] The current tuition fee standards for private primary and secondary schools, as resolved by the Municipal Senate's second general assembly, pose a significant threat to the livelihoods of teachers. In addition to publishing a declaration in the newspaper a few days ago, they also petitioned the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Education, and the Municipal Senate yesterday.

Petitioning the Municipal Government: Personally Delivering a Petition to the Mayor

Representatives from 72 private primary and secondary schools in the city, totaling more than 500 people, gathered at New Huanzhong School at 10:00 AM yesterday. They traveled in six large trucks and arrived at the Municipal Government at 10:45 AM. They selected 21 representatives, including Zhang Guangzong from Tongyi Middle School, Xu Kaifu from Mingde Girls' School, Pan Zhisun from Kunfan Girls' School, Zhou Shixuan from Ningbo Sixth Primary School, Sun Chengqie from Chengdong Middle School, Zhang Weixin from Minli Middle School, Wang Gengyang from Daozhong Girls' School, Zhu Yagao from Tonghui Primary School, Gao Mingdong from Chongshi Middle School, and Gu Xudong from Zhouyao Middle School, to meet with Mayor Wu and personally deliver a petition.

The Mayor's Opinion

Mayor Wu appeared at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 11:00 AM. He first expressed his deep concern for the difficult living conditions of private school teachers in the city but noted two conflicting concerns: (1) While the teachers' lives are indeed difficult, the burden on parents must also be considered. (2) If private school tuition fees are repeatedly increased, municipal schools will inevitably be eclipsed. The resulting disparity in treatment will inevitably cause dissatisfaction among municipal school teachers and put the Municipal Government in a difficult position. The Senate considered this matter repeatedly and handled it with great care. Furthermore, the Senate is a representative body of the people, and all its resolutions should be respected. He suggested that all schools currently comply with the Senate's resolution on fees. If there are other difficulties, they can submit a written request, listing the total number of students, revenue and expenditure situation, a comparison of pre-war tuition fees, and the teachers' actual living difficulties, through normal channels, to the competent authority for review and then forwarded to the Senate for deliberation. Mayor Wu also emphasized that educators are leaders of intellectuals, and all actions must comply with the law and be based on facts, not just theoretical arguments. Mayor Wu immediately stated that he has always valued education and promised that when the Senate reconvenes, he will definitely argue their case based on reason.

Representatives' Opinions

After the Mayor finished speaking, representatives Zhang Guangzong, Xu Kaifu, and others spoke in succession, stating the purpose of their petition was purely to stabilize the lives of teachers. They said that many private schools in the city still have non-transparent finances, making it difficult to achieve reasonable adjustments to teacher salaries. Therefore, they hoped that the authorities would thoroughly implement these regulations, requiring all private schools to fully disclose their finances, and ensuring the teachers' job security, as many schools often dismiss teachers who inquire about school finances.

Regarding this point, Mayor Wu stated that school financial transparency must be realized to ensure that the increased tuition fees are used to improve teacher salaries. He will also strongly support job security and will not tolerate such phenomena. Teachers can organize investigation teams to report such cases according to the law, and the Municipal Government will be responsible for handling them. He will instruct the relevant authorities to draft detailed regulations on how to supervise the finances of each school and implement them strictly. As it was already 12:00 PM, the representatives, to express their gratitude, bowed to Mayor Wu and then took the original trucks to petition the Bureau of Education.

Petitioning the Bureau of Education: Three Requests Made

The delegation arrived at the Bureau of Education at 12:15 PM, and the entire group gathered in the square in front of the Bureau of Education, where they were received by the Director of the Bureau of Education, Gu Yuxiu. Four representatives, including Wang Luzhi, presented three requests to Director Gu: (1) On behalf of the school principals: requesting an increase in tuition fees; (2) Subsidizing private school finances; (3) On behalf of the teachers: private school authorities should make their finances transparent.

The Director's Opinion

Director Gu replied separately: (1) Private school tuition fees will temporarily be implemented according to the Senate's resolution, but a reconsideration can be requested; (2) Subsidies for private school finances have been included in the budget, but the Finance Bureau has not yet issued them; (3) Financial transparency for private schools is the responsibility of private school principals. The representatives were generally satisfied and then left the Bureau of Education.

Petitioning the Senate: Requesting Increased Education Funding

At 1:15 PM yesterday afternoon, the representatives went to the Municipal Senate to petition. Fourteen representatives, including Xu Kaifu from Mingde Girls' School, Zhang Guangzong from Tongyi Middle School, and Pan Zhisun from Kunfan Girls' School, went upstairs to the Senate building and presented their opinions to Speaker Pan. The key points of the representatives' requests are summarized as follows: (1) Requesting regulations on hourly wages to increase teacher salaries; (2) Thoroughly implementing the order for private schools to make their finances transparent, protecting teachers' jobs; (3) If private school revenue is indeed insufficient to cover expenses, then tuition fees should be appropriately increased, but to the extent possible, they still do not advocate for increasing tuition fees; (4) Requesting an increase in the municipal budget for education to 35 percent; (5) How will the 50,000,000 yuan subsidy be allocated? (6) Regarding the increase in teacher salary standards, please convey it to the education authorities for immediate planning and implementation.

The Speaker's Opinion

Speaker Pan immediately stated to the representatives: The Senate absolutely sympathizes with the meager salaries of teachers. The teachers' declaration in the newspapers stating that the Senate disregards the difficult lives of teachers is not true. At the same time, he mentioned the question of whether the Municipal Senate has the right to regulate private school tuition fees, which seems excessive and irresponsible. At the same time, this proposal was submitted by the Mayor for discussion at the General Assembly, and the General Assembly should at least make a conclusion to reply to the Municipal Government. During this meeting, he also tried his best to sympathize with the teachers. If the General Assembly had immediately resolved the matter, the proposal to increase tuition fees would not have been passed. It was specially postponed to the second day for further discussion, and as a result, it was slightly increased. However, if a proposal passed by the Senate must be overturned, it should first be reconsidered, and currently, it can only be implemented according to the resolution method. The second General Assembly has not yet ended, and he is responsible for raising the issue for reconsideration when it convenes, but he cannot guarantee that it will definitely pass. At the same time, he hopes that the schools will provide actual materials, such as the schools' actual revenue and expenditure, to be reported to the General Assembly; otherwise, there will be no basis. He heard that the teachers were attacking one or two senators who opposed the increase in tuition fees, which seems inappropriate. The education community should assist the government in promoting democratic politics and cultivate good social practices, and this attitude is not entirely satisfactory. Speaker Pan then went downstairs to express the same opinions to other representatives and promised to raise the issue for reconsideration at the General Assembly before the representatives gradually left.

Mayor Wu Will Convene a Meeting with Private School Principals Tomorrow

Mayor Wu has scheduled to convene a meeting with principals of private primary and secondary schools throughout the city at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 29th) to provide instructions on tuition fee standards and the issue of private school financial transparency.

### Tangshan Institute of Technology: Professor Shortage

President Gu Goes to Beijing to Appeal

[Our Report, Tianjin Airmail] Since its restoration, Tangshan Institute of Technology has faced numerous difficulties, especially the shortage of school funds and the meager salaries of professors, which are major obstacles to the institute's development. Considering the precarious future, all faculty and students unanimously requested President Gu Yisun to go to Beijing as soon as possible to appeal to the Ministry of Education and request a solution to the current difficulties. It is reported that Gu has already departed for Beijing. Since the institute was approved for restoration last spring, it has only received more than 700 million yuan in restoration and construction funds, most of which was used for travel expenses, and the remainder was spent on repairing school buildings and adding desks. The equipment has not yet been restored due to lack of funds. Furthermore, the salaries of professors are lower than those in Tianjin and Beijing, leading to the resignation of some professors, creating an unprecedented shortage of professors in the institute's 43-year history. The institute's monthly expenses are only 4 million yuan, which is half of what is actually needed, making it impossible to advance any work. During his trip to Beijing, Gu will also consult with alumni associations in Beijing and Shanghai to discuss the institute's future survival, purchasing equipment, hiring professors, and resolving funding issues, which will be the focus of discussion. The students have high hopes for the alumni in Beijing and Shanghai and believe that Gu's trip will be successful.

### Students of Shaanxi North Road National School Temporarily Attend Other Schools

[Our Report] The Bureau of Education is facing the urgent need to determine and resolve the aftermath of the fire on Shaanxi North Road during the Lunar New Year, which completely destroyed the nearby Municipal National School, affecting 679 students and 30 teachers, as well as the issue of school opening next semester. In addition to allocating a temporary relief fund of 2 million yuan, the bureau has also requested 200 million yuan from the Municipal Council to build a new school building. In the meantime, a temporary opening plan has been drafted to allow students to temporarily attend classes at the Singapore Fourth National School and the Shiyan Public School in the district after school hours until the new school building is completed. The bureau has scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM today to invite the principals of the aforementioned schools to discuss and decide on the proposed plan.

### Ministry of Education Orders Adjustment of National Education Experimental Zone in This City, Presenting Six Key Points for Adjustment

In order to strengthen the experimental research on national education, the Ministry of Education has ordered the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education to make appropriate adjustments to the establishment of the National Education Experimental Zone in this city. The National Education Experimental Zone originally designated by the Municipal Kindergarten Normal School will be directly supervised by the Bureau of Education starting in January 36th year. However, the Municipal Kindergarten Normal School and the Municipal Normal School should still be responsible for guidance regarding experimental research work. The key points for adjustment are as follows: (1) The name will be changed to the Shanghai National Education Experimental Zone. (2) Zone Address: The address of the Experimental Zone will be submitted to the Ministry for record after it has been selected. (3) General Facilities: In addition to undertaking specific experimental research work, the Experimental Zone also has a demonstration role. The establishment of central national schools and national schools within the zone, the enrichment of school content, the collection of funds, the improvement of teacher quality and the increase of salary and welfare, as well as schools assisting in promoting local autonomy and running social education, should all be completed in advance in accordance with regulations. (4) Experimental Questions: In addition to instructing on (1) curriculum, (2) teaching materials and methods, and (3) guidance for teacher training as the central experimental questions, the bureau may also formulate experimental research questions based on actual needs and implement them after reporting to the Ministry for approval. (5) Funding: In addition to fundraising by the bureau, the central government will also provide appropriate subsidies for the Experimental Zone. (6) Plan Budget: The bureau will detail the implementation plan and budget for the 36th year based on the above points and submit it to the Ministry for approval.

### Dagong Vocational School Reduces Tuition Fees and Raises School Funds Separately

Dagong Vocational School on Emei Road in this city will reduce tuition fees for this semester. In addition to all students in the Intermediate Technical Department enjoying publicly funded treatment, the tuition fees for students in other departments will also be charged at the lowest possible rate to reduce the burden on students' parents. The school's expenses are huge, and the shortfall has been addressed by Principal Xu Heng, who has formulated a production plan to allocate the income from production operations to the school's recurring expenses. However, once the production department starts, it will need a lot of assistance, and it is said that the school deeply hopes that the government authorities will provide strong assistance.

### Glorious January 28th - Reflections on the 15th Anniversary

— Our Newspaper Archives

January 28th, 1932, under the increasingly aggressive oppression of Japanese imperialists, the Chinese nation issued a world-shaking roar; this was the "January 28th" battle that shines in history books.

At that time, Japan had already forcibly occupied the Northeast and continued to invade our territory, intending to realize its so-called "continental policy." On one hand, it used the excuse of the monk assault incident, fabricating facts and making harsh demands on our government. While the two sides were in negotiations, taking advantage of our lack of preparation, they mobilized troops to violently attack Shanghai, bombing with airplanes and shelling with artillery. The essence of both places was reduced to ashes!

At the beginning of the war, the Japanese army made the arrogant statement that "it would only take four hours to completely resolve the Chinese army." However, after our troops stationed in Shanghai bravely resisted, using tens of thousands of isolated troops to confront the massive sea, land, and air military power of the stubborn enemy, they actually persisted for a full thirty-four days. This cannot but be said to be a miracle. The main reason for creating this "miracle" was entirely due to the people and the army uniting as one, fighting together with one heart.

As long as we are not forgetful, we can definitely recall the enthusiastic and harmonious scene of the military and the people at that time. Even ordinary weak women and young children rose up to organize rescue teams and comfort teams. In addition to running around fundraising, young students also wrote countless letters of comfort to the soldiers at the front lines. Laborers who were poorly clothed and fed also donated their hard-earned money as military pay. The generous and passionate spirit of resistance filled the hearts of people in Shanghai and hundreds of millions of people across the country.

In this battle, our country's losses were naturally great. All the large and small stations in Shanghai and the surrounding areas were bombed and destroyed. Production and cultural institutions such as the Commercial Press, the Oriental Library, Sanyou Industrial Company, Wing On Textile Factory, Jinan University, Fudan University, Chih Tze University, Tongji University, and Labor University were mostly destroyed by the fierce artillery fire. The loss of people's lives and property was even impossible to accurately estimate. This was the first large-scale massacre carried out by Japan in the heart of our country in decades of invading China, and it was also the initial awakening of the Chinese nation, which had suffered endless oppression.

The "January 28th" Shanghai Battle lasted for thirty-four days. Because the isolated army did not receive reinforcements and ran out of ammunition, at that time, under the sad and indignant mood of "enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens," a humiliating "Shanghai Armistice Agreement" was signed with the enemy. However, precisely because we could endure humiliation and fight hard, after this historical test, we achieved a comprehensive victory thereafter.

Before the victory, "January 28th" was regarded as a "National Humiliation Memorial Day." Today, this great shame has been washed away. We are welcoming the fifteenth anniversary of "January 28th" amidst the sound of firecrackers during this abolished lunar New Year. The profound significance is self-evident.

The Chinese people will never forget "January 28th" and will always maintain the traditional fighting spirit to strive to eliminate any foreign insults in the future!

### The Climate of Beijing and Shanghai This Month

— Special Contribution from Our Newspaper Contributor Zhou Zhengding, from the Capital

The monthly average temperature in Nanjing and Shanghai is above twenty degrees Celsius for five months (May to September) or four months (June to September); it is between ten and twenty degrees Celsius for three months (April, October, November) or four months (plus May); and it is below ten degrees Celsius but above zero degrees Celsius for four months such as December, January, February, and March. Its climate indeed has significant subtropical characteristics. However, because it is located on the east coast of the Eurasian continent, the difference in temperature between the sea and land in winter and summer causes the air pressure to rise and fall, resulting in the phenomenon of alternating monsoons. The winter monsoon originates from Siberia and often invades southeastward. Its nature is cold, dry, and prone to explosions, so the winter temperature in Beijing and Shanghai is lower than in other places at the same latitude. January is only around three degrees Celsius, and the lowest can even drop below minus ten degrees Celsius. Whenever a cold wave erupts and moves southward, there are often fierce north winds and mixed rain and snow, and the cold is piercing. In summer, the monsoon comes from the southeast sea. The temperature is high and the humidity is heavy, and the weather in Beijing and Shanghai is extremely hot and humid. The average temperature in July in both places is above twenty-seven degrees Celsius, and the highest can even reach over forty degrees Celsius. The weather is monotonous and has little change, which is truly unbearable. The weather in Beijing and Shanghai has the most changes in late spring and early autumn. There are many gales in late spring, and there are many typhoons in early autumn. Gales mostly originate from the front of inland cold and warm air currents. Their path generally goes from west to east, or from southwest to northeast. When they pass through, there is often continuous rain for days. The plum rain in June is caused by frequent gales passing through. During the plum rain season, rainfall accounts for a quarter of the total annual rainfall, which is very important for rice cultivation. Typhoons originate from the tropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean and are most prevalent in late summer and early autumn. They often attack from the southeast to the northwest. Storms and rain often follow, often causing major disasters and harming fishing and navigation, which can be described as devastating. However, the lingering heat of summer is often swept away, and the weather suddenly turns cool, which is also beneficial to the residents of Beijing and Shanghai.

In terms of annual rainfall, Nanjing is slightly inland, so it is clearly less than Shanghai. The average annual rainfall in Nanjing is 978 millimeters, while Shanghai reaches 1128 millimeters. However, the distribution of each month is roughly similar, concentrated in the spring and summer seasons. The rainfall in Nanjing in the three months of summer (June, July, and August) accounts for 42% of the total annual rainfall, and the rainfall in one spring season (March, April, and May) accounts for 24%. The monthly rainfall in Shanghai in summer accounts for 41% of the total annual rainfall, and the rainfall in spring accounts for 24%. The total reaches about 65%. The whole year only autumn is the sunniest, with high skies and crisp air, warm sun and gentle breezes, and it has the reputation of a small spring.

January: Wax plum blossoms begin to open, winter jasmine begins to bloom

This month is the coldest time in Beijing and Shanghai. The Siberian high pressure covers the whole country, and its power is extremely strong. It often drives cold waves to erupt and move southward. When its front passes through, the air pressure rises sharply and the temperature drops suddenly. The north wind howls, the soil freezes, the cold scrapes the skin, and the amount of frost and snow is the most of any month of the year. The monthly average temperature is around three degrees Celsius, and the extreme minimum in Nanjing has reached minus 13.8 degrees Celsius (January 27, 1933), and Shanghai has also reached minus 12.1 degrees Celsius (January 19, 1893). However, because the two places are near the coast, the absolute maximum can also reach about 20 degrees Celsius due to occasional regulation by the oceanic airflow. The 21st to 25th of the month is the coldest time in Nanjing, with a five-day average of one degree Celsius. The coldest time in Shanghai is from the 16th to the 20th, with a five-day average temperature of three degrees Celsius. The rainfall in this month is only slightly more than in December, ranking second among the months with the least rainfall. The average in Nanjing is 38 millimeters, and Shanghai is 50 millimeters. The number of rainy days is slightly higher than in the previous three months, averaging nine days. Also, because it is often under the control of high pressure, there are many sunny days, averaging about eight days. However, there is a lot of dust in the city (the amount of dust in this month is more than in any other month), and the ground radiation is very strong on sunny nights. There is often fog in the low air, and the visibility is not far (the visibility is the smallest). There are an average of four or five days of thick fog per month. The sunshine on sunny days is not strong, and the amount of evaporation is the smallest of all months. In the middle of the month, the wax plum blossoms begin to bud, and in the last ten days of the month, the winter jasmine begins to bloom.

February: Winter jasmine in full bloom, plum blossoms begin to flower

The average temperature in both places this month is around four degrees Celsius, slightly higher than in January, but slightly lower than in December. It is still a cold winter period. The extreme minimum has dropped to eight and a half degrees (Beijing, February 1, 1925; Shanghai, February 2, 1910). The highest temperature can reach 25 to 28 degrees. After the 20th, the severe cold in both places has decreased. The amount of cloud and humidity in this month are the highest of the three winter months, so the sunshine time is less than in the previous month. Rainfall has increased slightly, averaging 46 millimeters in Nanjing and 60 millimeters in Shanghai. The most rainfall is about three times the average. There are nine to ten rainy days, and frost and snow gradually decrease. Thunderstorms are already possible. The wind direction is still mostly north and north-northeast, but its frequency is less than in the previous month. The average wind speed is gradually increasing. In the middle of the month, the plum blossoms begin to flower, and the winter jasmine is in full bloom.

March: Spring returns to the earth, willows turn green and peaches turn red

This month is the transition period from winter to spring. The temperature difference is the greatest. If the average temperature of each pentad (five days per pentad) is ten degrees, then the beginning of spring in Nanjing is on the 17th of the month, and the beginning of spring in Shanghai is on the 27th. The average temperature for the whole month is eight to nine degrees. Although it is warmer than in the three winter months, it is two to three degrees lower than in late autumn (November). The amount of cloud is less than in the two months before and after, the relative humidity is the smallest of the whole year, and the sunshine is more than in the two months before and after. Rainfall has increased slightly, averaging 62 millimeters in Nanjing and 83 millimeters in Shanghai. There are ten to twelve rainy days. The competition between winter and summer monsoons is fierce, making it the windiest time of the year. It is suitable for the custom of flying kites. Every time a strong northwest wind rises, dust flies and obscures the sky. The number of hazy days is the highest of all months. Although the wind direction is still mostly north-northeast, the percentage of east-southeast wind is already enough to compete with it. The average snow season in Nanjing ends on the 10th of the month, and the frost days end on the 19th. The end date in Shanghai is similar and slightly flatter. In the middle of the month: the peaches begin to flower, the willows begin to leaf. In the last ten days of the month: the frogs begin to croak, the geese are rarely seen, the redbud begins to flower, the kites fly and the fish leap, gradually opening the beginning of the spring scene.

April: Silkworm month, mulberry branches, willow catkins flying

It is now mid-spring. Following the fierce battle between the winter and summer monsoons last month, the wind is still strong. The east and east-southeast winds are the most prevalent. The average monthly temperature is around fourteen degrees Celsius. Compared with October in mid-autumn, it is still three to four degrees lower. The highest temperature in both places has reached over thirty-three degrees Celsius, and the lowest has dropped to around negative one degree Celsius. The passage of gales is most frequent this month, and rainfall is abundant, averaging between 93 and 97 millimeters, second only to the months of June, July, August (and September), ranking fourth (or fifth). The so-called "welcoming plum rain" is at this time. Shanghai has the most foggy days in this month. There are eleven to twenty-three rainy days, and the amount of precipitation time is the most of the whole year. In the first ten days of the month: the redbud is in full bloom, and the peaches and plums are in early bloom. In the middle of the month: willow catkins fly, and swallows chirp on the beams. In the last ten days of the month: orioles sing in the branches, spring shines everywhere, and spring colors fill the fields.

May: Barley ripens, paulownia leaves grow lush

This month is the time when the frequency of southeast and east-southeast winds is the highest. The breeze is gentle, and the average monthly temperature in both places is already between nineteen and twenty degrees Celsius. In Nanjing, the weather in the first and middle ten days of the month is still late spring, and the last ten days have already entered summer. The starting period of summer in Shanghai is still on the 10th of the next month (both use the average temperature of each pentad greater than twenty-two degrees as the standard for entering summer). This month, the gale has the opportunity to trend along the lower reaches of the Yellow River, so there is less rain in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The rainfall (averaging 79 millimeters in Beijing and 93 millimeters in Shanghai) and the number of rainy days (10 days in Beijing and 12 days in Shanghai) are less than in the two months before and after. The amount of cloud decreases and the sunshine increases greatly. This month is the most suitable for travel. In the first ten days of the month: the cherries ripen, and the cuckoos chirp for the first time. In the middle of the month: the paulownia leaves are lush. In the last ten days of the month: the pomegranates begin to flower, and it is time to harvest wheat and plant rice.

June: After the lilac flowers bloom, the plums ripen

This month is unusually cloudy and humid, and heavy rain occurs frequently. The average rainfall in Nanjing is 156 millimeters, ranking second among all months in the country, with a maximum of 407 millimeters (1915). The average rainfall in Shanghai is 176 millimeters, ranking first among all months in the country, with a maximum of 492 millimeters (1875). It is now the time when the plums are ripening, so it is called "plum rain". There are twelve to fourteen rainy days. Mangzhong is in the farmland, and the autumn harvest depends entirely on the plum rain for its moistening. However, when the plum rain is in season, dark clouds often cover the sky, humidity increases greatly, sunshine decreases sharply, all things grow moldy, which is unpleasant. The average temperature this month is 23 to 24 degrees Celsius, and the highest can reach 38 to 39 degrees Celsius, which is less than in July. At the beginning of the month: the phoenix trees begin to flower. In the middle of the month: the pomegranate flowers are in full bloom. At the end of the month: cicadas chirp in tall trees, green mountains are vast, and green shade fills the fields.

July: Cuckoos begin to leave, lotus breezes arrive slowly

Midsummer is in season, with hot winds and summer rain. In the first ten days of the month, the temperature is lower because the plum rain has not yet ended. After the middle ten days, the temperature rises sharply and the hot and humid weather begins. The average monthly temperature is about 27 degrees Celsius, the highest of all months. When it is extremely hot in the afternoon, Nanjing can reach 43 degrees (109 degrees Fahrenheit, seen in 1934), and Shanghai can also reach 42.2 degrees (104 degrees Fahrenheit, seen in 1934). The rainfall in Nanjing (averaging 183 millimeters) reaches its peak, and the rainfall in Shanghai (145 millimeters) is second only to the previous month. There are eleven to thirteen rainy days, and there are many sudden downpours, often accompanied by strong winds and lightning. Southeast winds are frequent, and the visibility is vast. Other characteristics of the climate in this month include the lowest air pressure, the longest sunshine hours, and strong evaporation. This month, cuckoos are rarely seen, lotus flowers bloom, the green mountains are lush, and the scenery of the water and mountains is at its peak.

August: Ginkgo begins to turn yellow, phoenix trees bear fruit

The heat of summer has not yet subsided this month, and the humid heat is still present, but it is not as severe as in the previous month. The average monthly temperature in Beijing and Shanghai is about 27 degrees Celsius, which is similar to the previous month. The absolute maximum is 40 to 41 degrees, which is slightly less than the previous month. The rainfall (122 millimeters) and rainy days (12 days) in Nanjing are less than in the previous month. The rainfall (142 millimeters) and rainy days (a little over 11 days) in Shanghai are almost the same as in the previous month. There are the most cloudy days (14 to 17 days) this month, and there are very few foggy days. The number of heat thunderstorms is even higher than in July. When it arrives, the wind and rain are dark, the thunder and lightning are fast, and the sultry heat is often relieved slightly, which is beneficial to health. The typhoons in the Pacific Ocean have become more frequent since last month, and they are even more frequent this month, and they sometimes land and attack Beijing and Shanghai. Although the strong winds and heavy rains during the passage of a typhoon cause great harm, the cooling effect of retreating the heat cannot be ignored. This month, the south wind is in season, plants are flourishing, the ginkgo begins to turn yellow, and the phoenix trees bear fruit.

September: Osmanthus fragrance, pomegranate red, persimmons and apricots begin to ripen

This month, the seasons enter autumn, the southeast wind gradually disappears, and the north or northeast wind gradually prevails, but the wind is gentle and often intermittent, making it the most peaceful time of the year. In the first and middle ten days, although the heat has subsided and the hot air has retreated slightly, the average temperature of each pentad is still above 22 degrees Celsius. In the last ten days, the golden wind recommends coolness, and the cool feeling invades people. The average temperature of each pentad drops below 22 degrees Celsius. Beijing and Shanghai both enter autumn on the 23rd. The average monthly temperature is 22.8 degrees, which is 4 to 5 degrees lower than the previous month and more than 5 degrees higher than the next month. It is truly the so-called "time when the weather is already cool but not cold". The standard rainfall is 83 millimeters in Nanjing and 128 millimeters in Shanghai. There are ten to twelve rainy days. This month, the sweet osmanthus fragrance wafts, the persimmons and pomegranates ripen red, the ginkgo fruits turn yellow, the phoenix trees drop their seeds, the cold cicadas are rarely seen, and the orioles migrate to the south.

October: Chrysanthemums bloom on the fences, lake crabs are fattening

This month belongs to mid-autumn, the heat has completely dissipated, the golden wind arrives slowly, refreshing and pleasant, making it the best time of the year. The average monthly temperature is about 17 degrees, which is 5.5 degrees lower than the previous month, but 3 to 4 degrees higher than April in early spring. The absolute maximum reaches 32 to 33 degrees, and the minimum is around zero degrees. The average rainfall in Nanjing is 45 millimeters (about half of April), and the average rainfall in Shanghai is 71 millimeters (two-thirds of April). There are eight to nine rainy days, which is as scarce as in November or November and December. Since rainfall is scarce and the temperature is decreasing, combined with low humidity and low cloud cover, abundant sunshine and gentle wind, it is the right time to climb high and look far, and enjoy the scenery. This month, chrysanthemums bloom on the fences, lake crabs are fattening, swallows return to the south, and geese come to the north. Early frost is occasionally seen at the end of the month.

November: Frost descends, maples turn red, phoenix tree leaves fall

This month, sunny days are frequently seen, gentle breezes occasionally arrive, the atmosphere is dry and refreshing, and warm like spring. Like the previous month, it is the best time of the year for climate. However, with the Mongolian high pressure dominating the desert north, its power is very strong, the north wind is gradually becoming fierce, and the scene of the earth is gradually turning bleak. The average monthly temperature in Nanjing is 10.6 degrees, and the average monthly temperature in Shanghai is 11.3 degrees, a sharp drop of more than 6 degrees compared to the previous month, making it the largest change in temperature from month to month. Therefore, diseases of the respiratory system are easily prevalent. The standard average rainfall is 41 millimeters in Nanjing and 52 millimeters in Shanghai. There are eight to nine rainy days. The amount of cloud is about the same as in the previous month, and the number of sunny days (9 to 10 days) is the highest of the whole year. This month, Beijing and Shanghai enter winter on the 27th and 29th respectively. Within the month, frost descends, maples turn red, and phoenix tree leaves fall. Early snow has been seen in Nanjing in the first ten days of the month.

December: Plants wither and turn yellow

This month is governed by the command of early winter, the north wind attacks frequently, the cold is biting, severe frost is seen repeatedly, and auspicious snow falls from time to time. The average monthly temperature is 4.6 degrees in Nanjing and 5.8 degrees in Shanghai. The lowest temperature can reach below minus 10 degrees, and the severity of the cold is only second to January. The standard rainfall is 36 millimeters, the least of all months. The number of days of precipitation is the same as in the previous month, sunny days are eight to eleven days, and cloudy days (about 10 days) are the most, and the amount of sunshine is the least of the year. This month, plants wither and turn yellow, and the scenery is bleak. In the last pentad of the month, the sky is often filled with clouds and the rain and snow are plentiful, which is truly the so-called auspicious snow welcomes the New Year.

### Comparison of Beijing and Shanghai Climate

Although Beijing and Shanghai are both located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, only 320 kilometers apart, Shanghai (7 meters above sea level) is at the mouth of the Yangtze River into the sea, and is more regulated by the ocean. Nanjing (68 meters above sea level) is slightly further from the sea, and the influence of the ocean is slightly weaker, so the climate of the two places has many small differences within the great similarities.

In terms of temperature: Although the average temperature in both places is about 15 degrees, Nanjing is colder in winter and hotter in summer, which is more than in Shanghai. In spring and summer, the temperature in Nanjing is higher than in Shanghai, and in autumn and winter, it is lower. For example, the average temperature in July is 27.7 degrees in Nanjing and 27.1 degrees in Shanghai; in January, it is 2.2 degrees in Nanjing and 3.2 degrees in Shanghai. Also, using 10 degrees and 22 degrees as the upper and lower limits of spring and autumn temperatures, using the average temperature of each pentad in both places, spring in Nanjing begins on March 17 and ends on May 20, lasting 65 days. Due to the influence of the ocean, spring in Shanghai comes later (March 27) and goes later (June 9), lasting 75 days. Summer in Nanjing is 125 days, 20 days less than in Shanghai. Autumn begins on September 23 in both places. Autumn in Nanjing lasts 65 days, 5 days less than in Shanghai. Winter in Nanjing begins on November 27 and lasts 110 days. Winter in Shanghai begins on November 22 and lasts 125 days. Therefore, summer in Nanjing is particularly long and the temperature is extremely high. The extreme maximum temperature in Nanjing reaches 43 degrees, while in Shanghai it is only 40.2 degrees. The average number of days in Nanjing with a maximum temperature exceeding 35 degrees is 18 days, 4 days more than in Shanghai. The average number of days with an average daily temperature exceeding 30 degrees is 15 days, 12 days more than in Shanghai. Although winter in Nanjing is half a month shorter than in Shanghai, it is colder than in Shanghai. The extreme minimum temperature in Shanghai is minus 12.1 degrees, and in Nanjing it is even lower to minus 13.8 degrees. The average number of days with an average daily temperature below zero is 12 days, 5 days more than in Shanghai. The average number of frost days in Nanjing is about 39 days, and in Shanghai it is 32 days. The number of snowy days in Nanjing is 10 days, and in Shanghai it is 7 days. Whenever it snows in Nanjing, it rains in Shanghai, although this is not always the case, it is a fact that there are more snowy days in Nanjing. For example, in 1925, it snowed for 9 days in Nanjing, but only 2 days in Shanghai. In 1929, there were 20 days of snow in Nanjing, but only 8 days in Shanghai. In terms of spring and autumn temperatures, spring is colder than autumn in places with a shallow degree of continentality. Taking April and October to represent spring and autumn in both places, the temperature in Nanjing is 14.4 degrees versus 17.1 degrees, and in Shanghai it is 13.5 degrees versus 17.4 degrees. Spring in Nanjing is colder than autumn, which is less than in Shanghai.

The annual rainfall in Shanghai is more abundant than in Nanjing, as mentioned earlier. Except for April and July, the monthly rainfall in Nanjing is generally slightly less than in Shanghai. July is the month with the most rainfall and rainy days in Nanjing. The most rainfall in Shanghai is in June, as is the number of rainy days. The least rainfall is in December in both places, but the least rainy days are in October in Nanjing and in December in Shanghai. There are more thunderstorms in Nanjing (19 days) than in Shanghai (13 days). There are more foggy days in Nanjing (78 days) than in Shanghai (66 days). The former is mostly in winter, and the latter is frequent in spring and autumn. All of these are the general characteristics.

### The Economic Reality of Hangzhou

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Hangzhou, 14th

As the Chinese Lunar New Year approaches, all businesses and shops are conducting a major reckoning. On "New Year's Eve," debt collectors press their claims until dawn. Therefore, the Lunar New Year is the easiest time to see the true state of the social economy. Some call Hangzhou a modern city, but in terms of economic value, it remains fundamentally an agricultural hub, as most of its goods for sale are hard-earned harvests from the rural community. Thus, the Lunar New Year has a particularly intimate connection to it.

Over New Year, Reverence for Gods and Feasting are Paramount

People in agricultural societies highly value the New Year. They believe it essential to show reverence to the gods and engage in hearty feasting. It's said that the gods themselves partake in feasting at this time, so one must not neglect or disrespect them, but instead purchase New Year's goods to honor them. According to old-timers in Hangzhou, in past years, the entrances of shops selling dried goods, incense, and candles were always surrounded by three or four layers of people. This year, however, no matter how the shop owners call out, the fronts of these stores are cold and deserted. There are over 210 such shops in Hangzhou. This time of year, approaching the Lunar New Year, should have been their prime season, but due to sluggish business and the pressure of high-interest loans, as many as 32 have applied to close down. Among those that survive, yellow rice flour, bamboo shoots, and southern vegetables have the best sales. Others like longan, lychee, shark fin, and sea cucumber have plummeted in sales, indicating a decline in purchasing power and a glimpse into the superficial aspects of the social economy.

Tea, Silk, and Oil Industries Face Increasing Risks

Hangzhou is a market for tea and silk. With tea and silk exports facing grim prospects, people in these industries are mostly worried all day long. Many involved in tea and silk are planning to change careers, or are unwilling to reinvest in these industries, instead using their existing capital in other trades.

The edible oil industry is another major business in Hangzhou. However, with the widespread development of state-run oil factories, the business of privately-run oil shops has declined compared to previous years. Those involved in the edible oil business are sensitive to future prospects and are therefore cautiously alert. If they suffer further setbacks, they will face immense risks.

Weak Purchasing Power: Strong Exterior, Hollow Core

Department stores are the key "decorations" of modern Hangzhou. They import all sorts of glass fixtures from Shanghai, as well as Hollywood lipsticks and nail polish, and the latest cigarette cases and match dispensers. In terms of consumption, they have indeed elevated Hangzhou to a modern level. However, Hangzhou is ultimately an agricultural city. The countryside suffers from hunger and cold. Only a very small minority can afford to buy and enjoy these goods. Purchasing power is generally declining, so the department store business is facing a situation of being strong on the outside but hollow on the inside. Only a few, with strong financial resources, who had hoarded large quantities of goods long ago, can barely make a small profit.

Heavy Taxes and High Interest Rates: Depressed Business

The yarn and cloth industry made a substantial profit after the Mid-Autumn Festival, but later yarn prices soared and then plummeted, and sales were sluggish, so it was mostly mediocre. The kerosene business relies on foreign goods to make Chinese money, but it has benefited greatly from the repeated adjustments of foreign exchange rates. Unfortunately, the source is limited and development is not easy. Generally, all industries are in a precarious situation due to heavy taxes and high interest rates. Compared to before the war, the exchange volume of goods is less than one-tenth.

The Money Business is Thriving

The above situation, except for department stores and kerosene, is that the goods are mostly produced by our agricultural society, and then transferred to the urban society for business. Our review shows that they generally fall into a state of economic depression. On the other hand, consumer businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and car businesses have made great profits and are thriving. The Chinese medicine business has also done quite well. However, this kind of vigorous situation actually shows the pathology of society. The development of the hotel industry shows that the housing shortage problem remains unresolved. The development of the restaurant industry shows that the society is increasingly trending towards social interaction and entertainment, rather than focusing on legitimate pursuits. The car industry shows that consumers are extremely increasing their desire for consumption. The Chinese medicine industry shows that Hangzhou is a "sick" society. We may as well take a deeper look at the money business in Hangzhou's financial sector. The money business has made great profits this year. According to a report by the Hangzhou China News Agency, the largest net profit is as high as 50 million yuan. This means that Hangzhou's money business is still in the process of vigorous growth.

Finance is the lifeblood of the social economy. If the blood dries up, the person will wither and die. If the blood is healthy, the person will be healthy. According to the fact that the money business is profitable, Hangzhou's blood is still healthy. This Hangzhou unit may become healthy, or it may improve, or it may be nourished by the thriving business of "Chinese medicine" stores, and eat and drink heavily in a "restaurant," live in a tall "hotel," and go in and out of "cars," luxurious and precious, becoming richer and richer. No, this is just fantasy.

Production Units Face Financial Difficulties

In the above review of the situation, we saw that the sales of local agricultural products are sluggish and declining, while consumer businesses are progressing step by step. A society cannot increase consumption and reduce production, and prosper and grow for a long time. Increased consumption and sharp decline in production will only lead the economy to a state of decline. So where does the money business's profits come from? Is it profiting from investing in production units because the producers are profiting? Is it profiting from doing high-interest loans through so-called "underground banks"? If it is invested in production units, then why is the capital of production units today strained, calling for help but unable to get it, and having to borrow high-interest loans to maintain it?

Today, the tragic situation of the production units is that some of the loans they requested from the government are only enough to repay the interest on high-interest loans, so has the money business lent a lot of money to the production units?

The financial industry is indeed the lifeblood of society! If this blood is frozen in high-interest loans and cannot be metabolized, then it will still wither and die.

### Thinking of the 19th Route Army from the "January 28th" Incident

In our country's war history, the 19th Route Army, under the overall leadership of Chairman Chiang, became famous in one fell swoop during the "January 28th" Battle, writing a glorious page in the history of combat. The army was initially the Second Brigade of the Guangdong Army, later reorganized into the 10th Division, then into the 61st Division, then into the 11th Route Army, and finally into the 19th Route Army. The army had defeated Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang, and other troops. In September of the 20th year of the Republic of China, it defeated He Long's communist troops in Jiangxi Province. In total, it experienced 48 major battles and won 27 victories. The Battle of Shanghai was the 48th major battle experienced by the army. Its morale was high, and its sacrifices were great, which shocked all countries. Later, it was disbanded due to launching a "mutiny." (This newspaper's data room)

### Weekly Forum: Hong Kong Education Encounters Reefs

— Zhou Shang

During the war, there were nearly 2,000 overseas Chinese schools in Hong Kong, large and small. Now there are 300. Recently, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Overseas Chinese Education Association requested the Education Department to improve five points due to the unbearable burden of environmental facilities, etc. The department has responded to each one, but none have been resolved. This is because Hong Kong's overseas Chinese schools have encountered reefs. Extreme elements advocate that overseas Chinese schools withdraw from Hong Kong. Negotiations are currently underway! The first and fifth points are both school health issues. The department emphasized: "Hong Kong is now densely populated, which has greatly hindered the health of residents. If the regulations on school medical and health facilities are relaxed, it will inevitably affect the health of students. The regulations of the school are purely for the health of students and teachers, and under the current bad environment, they should be strictly implemented." It also said: "The capacity of the classroom and the distance of the chairs and tables, etc., are all completed by the health inspectors in accordance with the education laws," etc.

We greatly admire the Hong Kong authorities' emphasis on school health and attention to the health of students. School health and school health education are different. School health is an old term. For more than ten years, it has been abandoned in the New World because its scope is too narrow. It is equivalent to prison health, industrial health, military health, social health, oral health, personal health, and national health. And the most important point is that it does not have much educational meaning. Therefore, school health is not used, but school health education is used. It is not enough to only have health in the school. It must contain health with educational significance, so that the value of health is higher. The school is a place of education, and we have no reason to remove education from health!

Moreover, school health education is fundamental. Many important health education activities have limited costs and great benefits, and the school can easily organize them. School health sometimes costs a lot of money, but it is not easy to do due to the environment. What's more, after the war, everything is desolate and everything needs to be done. To repair the suffering of the people, and say: "The world is hungry, why not eat meat porridge!" Therefore, friends who handle health education should weigh the priorities and urgencies, and should focus on the easy and achieve great results!

School health education is a part of health education, implemented in schools. Health education is the sum of various experiences to improve the habits, attitudes, and knowledge of personal, social, and national health. Implementing health education in schools will allow children to receive health education in all their experiences. Based on the experiences that children have in school, no matter what method is used, it has a good influence on children's health habits, attitudes, and knowledge, so its scope should include three aspects. (1) Healthy school life, (2) Health affairs, (3) Health teaching.

The first aspect of a healthy school life is the school environment. In the old-fashioned way, it is environmental health. The second is the teacher's experience, which refers to discipline, fatigue, voice, mental health, learning health, etc. The third is the school organization, such as work and rest time, homework, etc. Health affairs are related to inspection, correction, and vaccination, etc. Health teaching focuses on teaching the principles and facts of healthy living, integrating health knowledge with actual life, and guiding children to grow healthily in schools, families, and society.

In view of this, there are too many things that schools should do to seek the health of students, and there are more things that the government should do. Most of the healthy life and healthy teaching should be effectively handled by the government to urge schools to do so. Most of the health affairs and a small part of the healthy life and healthy teaching should be directly organized by the government, sending nurses, doctors, medicines, training school health education personnel, providing health education materials, and even providing free school meals to poor students like in the UK, should actively take responsibility. Currently, these things have not been done yet, and even if some are done, they have not been done well. Just look at the prevalence of trachoma among children in Hong Kong's public and private schools, and the tuberculin test has not been held yet. It is really unrealistic to only ask private schools to be responsible for a small part of the healthy life that is not easy to improve, and to order strict implementation.

The UK and China are allied countries and of course the bloodstains of fighting side by side have not yet dried, so they should not intentionally embarrass our overseas Chinese education. However, this measure should start with the easy and easy aspects first, and I hope that the Hong Kong government will change to the Education Department in charge of education in accordance with modern trends, and earnestly lead, and first send a group of health education experts to Hong Kong to effectively handle social and school health education. This will not only benefit the students a lot, but also the entire citizens will be grateful.

Women and Family Published Every Tuesday

### Three Major Liberations for Women in Marriage

— Wang Xin

According to the current situation, there are three things that should be liberated for women in marriage:

(1) Equal Marriage Opportunities. The success of a general marriage is always that the man pursues the woman first, and it is extremely rare for the woman to initiate first. In this way, sometimes a woman loves a man extremely, but is forced by the constraints of etiquette to not dare to speak out frankly, which is what most women feel distressed about. We must thoroughly break the shackles of this etiquette, and men and women can both propose their inner demands.

(2) Eliminate the Concept That a Wife Must Be a Virgin. In the old minds of Chinese people, the first night is a remarkable thing, which is indeed a great insult to women. We must correct this concept. It is not to say that women should not maintain the purity of love, but women may no longer be virgins due to divorce, widowhood, or even violence (such as Miss Shen Chong), but we cannot ruin their future happiness because of their unfortunate fate.

(3) Conscientiously Implement the One-Man, One-Wife System. Although the one-man, one-wife system is clearly stipulated in law, if we look at the situation in society, most husbands, once they have money, the first problem to be solved is to marry a concubine or create a small villa. After having a concubine, it is inevitable to abuse the original wife, which is very unreasonable. Your wife shared your joys and sorrows. Should you forget your wife after you have developed? Analyzing this reason, it is still the current moral decline, neglecting the purity of love, and only seeking the satisfaction of carnal desire. For this reason, we must start from education to make everyone know the sacredness of love and recognize that polygamy is an extremely disreputable thing, then this unreasonable phenomenon can be gradually reduced.

### A Neglected Educational Problem: Are You Willing to Be Beaten and Scolded by Your Child?

— Feng

Have you ever seen a child raise his little hand to hit his parents or pout his little mouth to scold his parents? I think you must have seen it. I have also seen many. I once saw a five-year-old girl slap her father's face crisply in front of many guests, and I also saw a child who had just learned to speak scold his father "muddlehead" and "lazybones" in his mother's arms!

It seems that the child is too ignorant of the rules, but we cannot blame them, because we know that imitation is the nature of children, especially when they have not obtained sufficient knowledge to clearly distinguish right from wrong. Their minds are innocent, their actions are naive, and it is the parents' responsibility to pay attention to whether the child is developing normally in physiology or psychology.

However, in fact, this important responsibility is often neglected by parents due to love and negligence. They even give the child a smiling approval when it is time to give the child an urgent correction. I don't know that this is creating a dark and bad consequence for the child's future behavior and thinking, and then it will be too late to regret! You must know that in the relaxed and happy daily life of the family, the wife may casually scold her husband, although sometimes this scolding contains the meaning of anger and love, but when the child hears it, he will remember it firmly and learn from his mother's example to scold his father. Maybe he doesn't even understand the meaning of this scolding at all. He just simply sees that his mother says this to his father, and his father still smiles, so why don't I do it too? As for hitting his father, it is even more common. Many mothers also hold their little hands to help them hit their father. Although this is sometimes the joy of the boudoir, the child has no selectivity. When he encounters a banquet, he will also scold you "lazybones"! Slap you in the face, how embarrassed will you be then?

At the same time, you will definitely think that you have been too indulgent with your child. You shouldn't ask him to hit you again after the child hits you once, and you shouldn't hug him and kiss him after being scolded once. All of this is caused by yourself because you fundamentally misunderstood the meaning of being intimate with the child. If you want to express your love, you should create the habit of the child shaking hands or kissing you often, or calling you affectionately instead of scolding you or hitting you!

Dear parents, I hope that your love can be expressed in the most perfect and sacred way, and as an immortal torch in the child's future behavior and thinking, it will always indicate the light.

### Household Matters

— Yi Xia

Flower Arrangement Method: When the flowers are half open in spring, cut them off with scissors and insert them into a cut radish, and plant them in a flower pot with soil. Water them often and let them see the sun often. When the flowers have bloomed, the roots of the flowers will also grow well. This is the best flower arrangement method for loving flowers.

Mending a Wok: If there is a hole in the wok, just buy a piece of raw pig liver, mash it, and then apply it to the hole. This method is no different from iron repair, saving money and effort.

Removing Rust from a Knife: If a kitchen knife is not wiped dry after cutting vegetables, it will often rust. You can soak the rusted knife in a mandarin orange water tank for one or two days, and then take it out. The rust will be removed by itself, as if it had been polished.

Washing Glass Bottles: We often discard eggshells, but waste also has its uses. Break the eggshells into pieces and use them to wash glass bottles. You don't need to expend the effort of picking and choosing, and you can scrape off dirt and polish them clean and bright.

Getting Rid of Rice Weevils: To avoid rice weevils, you can put charcoal under the rice jar, and they will not breed by themselves.

Washing Hair: Soap must be washed off after washing hair, otherwise there will be a bad smell. Now you can soak it in calcium water to wash it, which is clean and cool. Borax can also be used to wash.

Culinary Affairs

### Homemade "Salad"

— Jing Wen

The taste of "salad" in Western cuisine is very good, but it is not easy to make it yourself. The biggest reason is that there is no "salad oil", so it is rarely tasted in the family. Recently, I met a Western chef who told me that "salad oil" can also be made by yourself, but it is more troublesome, and he told me the secret of preparation. Later, I made it according to the method, and it was indeed no different from what I bought. What's more, the things you make yourself are always cleaner and cheaper than what you buy outside? Now I will tell everyone this method:

First buy two large chicken eggs, which must be fresh. Knock them into a bowl, being careful to take out the egg whites for other use, leaving only pure egg yolks. Stir vigorously, then use four taels of cooked oil, adding it drop by drop, stirring quickly with chopsticks to ensure that the egg yolks and oil are evenly mixed, and there must be no oil floating and condensing. Add oil while beating the eggs until the egg yolks in the bowl look very thick. The initial salad oil is complete. The most important thing to pay attention to is to avoid being impatient when adding oil, and the faster you stir, the better. Only after the first added oil is completely mixed can the second one be added again. Otherwise, if the egg and oil separate, this bowl of things will be wasted.

At this time, the oil is dark yellow, sticky and thick, and it is difficult to stir open. You must add some vinegar (you must use pure yellow vinegar, Zhenjiang vinegar cannot be used). Also add it while stirring. At this time, the color of the oil will gradually change from dark to light, and finally become white (slightly yellow), then you can stop adding vinegar and taste it. There must be no sour taste, otherwise too much vinegar has been added, and the salad oil will be completed.

Mix in chopped cooked potatoes, green beans, diced ham, shredded bacon, gizzards, etc., add the right amount of salt, then add the "salad oil" and stir, or pour some tomato sauce on top. If you like spicy food, you may add some pepper powder or even chili oil. In this way, a large bowl of delicious and beautiful food can be served to your family for a big meal. If you take it to entertain guests, you will definitely be praised by everyone.

Usually two egg yolks and four taels of oil are enough to make enough salad oil to mix two large bowls of salad. If there are few people in your family who don't eat much, then half the amount is enough.

### Attitude and Impression

— Zhi Wu

When you first get a satisfactory partner, don't immediately change your past attitude. Because their approach to you is entirely due to the good first impression you gave them, not because they understand you completely.

Don't desperately dress up, socialize, and be debauched just because you can't find a partner... Being noticed is not necessarily being loved.

If you want your boyfriend to marry you, don't make yourself look old-fashioned and know everything. Say what he wants to tell you first; otherwise, even if you can get married, you will be extremely painful in the future.

When making friends, don't suppress yourself too much to cater to the other person's happiness, unless you can always do this after marriage, otherwise you will regret it. Many marriages break up because both parties say that the other party has "changed", but it is not "changed". It is the true nature that is revealed.

### Glass Utensils

— Yin Yun

Glass cups and utensils will crack when boiling water is poured into them. If a thin iron utensil is placed under the cup to make it slightly away from the table, it can be avoided. If there are unclean things such as tea stains, wipe it with salt to remove them. When placing new ones, put them in cold water and cook them in a pot over low heat. Wait for the water to boil slightly (it will break when it boils too much, you must know this), add two drops of vinegar, wait for it to cool and take it out, and it can be guaranteed not to crack. (The same applies to glass covers for Western lamps). Wiping and rubbing dressing mirrors, etc., will lose light if you use a chicken feather duster followed by a wet cloth, and the same is true if you hang them in a humid place. If you wipe them with lamp grass heads, kerosene, vinegar, or newspapers, you can avoid the trouble of losing light forever and can be exceptionally bright.

### The New Art of Husband Management

— Xin

Love before marriage is like a magnet and a needle, drawn together extremely closely by a natural force. But once married, as the days grow long, it often resembles a deflating ball or a magnet gradually losing its power. Even if on the surface it appears intimate, at least one party always feels somewhat strained. Whether the man is the attracting magnet or the woman the attracted needle, having already come together, they naturally hope to live a close, shared life forever. As a result, the husband thinks about how to control his wife, and the wife thinks about how to control her husband. We must understand this as a necessary, albeit inferior, tactic to maintain their love. However, examining the methods they frequently adopt, they invariably involve strict management and nagging complaints, restricting freedom and severing social connections. Ultimately, this often leads to more unhappiness. Nowadays, everything emphasizes science. According to statistical calculations, men are responsible for initiating the decline, abandonment, and disdain of love after marriage in over 90% of cases. However, women cannot shirk their responsibility; they must bear the blame for not understanding the art of husband management and for making missteps.

The principle of the new art of husband management can be summed up in a very common old saying: "When well-fed and warm, one thinks of sensual desires; when hungry and cold, one resorts to thievery." A beggar never aspires to marry multiple wives and take concubines because his own hunger remains unresolved, preventing him from developing any ambition for external pursuits. To accomplish anything in this world, the prerequisite is time. If your husband has no worries about food and clothing, then what he has in excess is time. Spending long periods with you, he will begin to tire of it. Therefore, in his spare time, he will gradually develop an ambition for external pursuits, providing him with excellent conditions to engage in unfavorable activities. Conversely, a man who spends his days struggling for food and clothing, working diligently for the sake of his family, will not have the time to indulge in fantasies. Therefore, a husband who has attained warmth and satiety must not be granted idle and aimless time. We should use scientific methods, imperceptible to the senses, to subtly deprive him of his leisure. Here are a few simple examples:

(1) Seize time with work: That is, use legitimate work that does not interfere with his original job to consume his excess time. For example, encourage him to practice writing, incite him to develop an interest in photography, or foster a love for painting. Make him unknowingly become absorbed and devoted to these activities, burying himself in research and diligent practice. The result can be that all his spare time is turned into nothing. Or, fortunately, he may open up a new path in these activities, which would be an unexpectedly perfect outcome.

(2) Seize time with entertainment: Perhaps work makes him feel troubled, so entertainment is pleasing. A phonograph, a piano, or even a harmonica can divert him from a lot of spare time. Other options include seasonal travel, hunting, fishing, playing chess, watching plays, etc. However, be sure not to introduce him to entertainment that is detrimental to you.

(3) Seize time with exercise: This method is even better. Most men consider themselves remarkable and, upon hearing about exercise, are often willing to show off their skills, dominating the sports field and looking down on everything. Therefore, it is perfect to have him spend several hours each day at the gym. Moreover, after swimming, playing ball, and other exercises, he can use his remaining time for quiet rest, which is also infinitely beneficial to his body and health. Isn't that a win-win situation?

Science is constantly advancing, and our methods, of course, must never stagnate here. However, it must be noted that if the needle and the magnet have been joined together for too long, although the magnet may lose its attractive force, the attractive force generated on the needle at that time will be enough to keep it permanently attracted to the magnet.

Spring and Autumn

### The Section Chief's Wife

— Yu Huanren

Ever since the section chief's wife's belly swelled up like a big ball, she often strutted down the street with a smug look on her face. Sometimes she would even stand in front of shops, yawning, and when she encountered another wife, she would chat noisily for a while. Invariably, before she could even get to three and a half sentences, the section chief's wife, afraid that people wouldn't see her "ahead of the game" big belly, would point at it and feign complaint, saying, "Carrying this... thing... is so tiring!"

It is said that the section chief's wife had suffered enough nameless woes because her belly wouldn't grow. The section chief's husband, the section chief, had repeatedly grumbled at her, saying that they had been married for over ten years and she hadn't even farted once, and he insisted on taking a concubine. Every time, the section chief's wife would tighten her face and roll into the section chief's arms in a coquettish manner, not allowing it. Then, she would use her slender jade fingers to point at her husband's nose and say, "Could it be that this is all my fault?" She would laugh with tears in her eyes, but secretly, she couldn't help but resent her belly for being uncompetitive.

Thank God for his blessings! Finally, the section chief's wife's belly gradually grew bigger with the flourishing spring of all things. The section chief's wife changed her former mournful look and became even more fond of greeting other wives on the street with giggles and laughter. The section chief's husband also smiled from ear to ear like a Maitreya Buddha all day long. Now, the couple often woke up laughing in their dreams.

The section chief's husband was in charge of the county's finances. He had plenty of colorful guan jin and golden bars in his pockets, around his waist, and in his shoes. Therefore, even before the little nucleus was born, he had already prepared a small wooden bed, a small bathtub, a small chair and table, and small toys. He had also specially invited a sewing clerk to make small mosquito nets, small pillowcases, small quilts, small coats, and small clothes of various colors. It is said that the child's clothes were made to fit until he was five or six years old! In addition, of course, all the items that the section chief's wife would need before and after childbirth were also prepared properly, such as brown sugar, eggs, ham, and various tonics! ...

When the sun rose and the magpies chirped happily that day, our section chief's wife suffered several life-and-death belly pains. Fortunately, the midwife had been invited to the house half a month earlier, so things didn't get too chaotic. The child was born smoothly. The midwife reported that it was a boy, which delighted the section chief's husband. He immediately ordered the servants who were paid by the county government but "served" in the section chief's house to set off firecrackers and cook noodles and glutinous rice balls. Although in pain, the section chief's wife also revealed a faint smile as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders. At this time, people sending congratulations and gifts were like a constant stream of carriages and horses filling the door.

For this "great joy," the section chief's husband took out several thick stacks of banknotes, each marked with 1000, from the small leather suitcase next to the bed (which really frightened us poor civil servants whose monthly income was not enough to make ends meet). He lavishly held banquets on the "third day" and the "one-month" celebration, and those invited were mostly officials or merchants. While devouring the abundant dishes and wine, they showered the host with flattering words of congratulations, saying that this child had a dignified appearance and would surely be extraordinarily rich and noble when he grew up, all thanks to the accumulated merits of his ancestors. The section chief's wife and the section chief thanked them with beaming faces: "Thank you, thank you everyone..."

However, in the midst of happiness and blessings, the section chief's wife and her husband still felt like a stone was weighing on their hearts, because the child had been sick since birth, and sometimes they couldn't help but break out in cold sweats when they thought about it.

Fortunately, with the diagnosis and treatment of good doctors and good medicine, Bao'er (the child's name) gradually became lively. As a result, the section chief's wife became even fatter than before, and the section chief's husband, of course, had even more guan jin and gold bars in his hands, around his waist, and in his shoes.

Now, the section chief's wife was too impatient to go to that agency to sign in for work, so she quit her job readily, and instead spent all day doting, cherishing, and holding Bao'er like a precious jewel, strolling proudly on the street.

Isn't that so? Look, the section chief's wife is carrying her child dressed in a red wool shirt and pants, walking over from that side with a smile, followed by a nanny.

### Morning in Jiangnan and Other Essays

— Li Wenxun

Morning in Jiangnan

Mornings in Jiangnan are always clear, even on rainy days. The earliest sound one hears is the rolling of carriage wheels, followed by the trembling of dawn's light on the windowpane. In the orange groves outside the window, the birds begin to chirp, singing the dawn's beautiful melodies. Gradually, one hears the footsteps of women, the rustling of clothes, the sounds of washing, splashing water, and the joyful "quack quack" of flocks of ducks.

I rise and stand by the window, breathing in the fresh, clear scent of autumn. In front of the window is a small, lively river, and beyond that is a narrow, gleaming cobblestone street. I see the women washing by the river, using towels to scrub their already very white teeth, and cupping handfuls of water to rinse their mouths. They turn and glance at their beautiful faces in the water. A group of country girls carrying vegetables hurry past, so healthy and full of vitality, revealing smiles as bright as the morning sun. Children with schoolbags bounce and skip, singing local songs loudly. Newspaper vendors, fried dough stick sellers, and vendors selling various breakfast items shout out their monotonous calls. These sounds arrive at a fixed time, and their melodies never change, becoming not only a temptation for children but also the most accurate clock for this rural town.

The sunlight spreads out, so vast and abundant.

My hometown used to be very desolate, but it had changed when I returned for the second time. There was a school around my house. This school had just moved from Sichuan, and I heard that the students inside could endure hardship. Every morning, I saw them climbing mountains, breathing fresh air, practicing pronunciation, and diligently reciting English in the sunny countryside. The various timbres and tones were like the birdsong in the forest in the morning. On a square that they had collectively opened up, children happily ran and chanted. Some children hid in the library all day, copying notes. Girls drew water from the ancient well next to them to wash their clothes. They squatted on the ground, revealing healthy legs, and their skillful gestures were so lovely. When they saw strangers, they shyly lowered their heads and pulled down their collars to cover their thighs. Every morning when I walked on the mountain path, I could always see many children leaping like fawns in the mountains. Sometimes they laughed and raised their arms, and sometimes they sat in the sun and sang. What lovely and enviable youth! They repaired the dilapidated houses, turned the barren weeds into a square, filled the suffocating place with young songs, and filled the sorrowful place with youthful laughter, like wild, beautiful flowers blooming all over my ancient, desolate hometown...

Bell Sound

The distant bell is ringing for a long time, and the long-ringing bell makes me drunk.

This is a characteristic of my hometown. Hearing the bell, I hear my dear hometown, just like seeing a pagoda on a wandering road, which gives a city its sense of belonging.

This is the bell of a county middle school, and it contains my childhood, my young lyricism. In this bell, there is truth, love, joy, and sorrow.

This sound is often associated with sunshine and the laughter of a little lover.

Filled with enlightenment, filled with a monotonous note of life, this is a music of childhood that will always echo in my heart.

Now the old gatekeeper has died, and a young one has been replaced. All the fresh, dawn-like children are pouring out of the bell.

What I heard at first was happiness and hope, but now what I hear is aging and melancholy. What I heard at first was departure, but now what I hear is like evening prayer in a church.

The bell is still ringing...

### Traveling in Southern Anhui

— Xu Shiqi

I had been preparing to return to my hometown for two months to bury my ancestors, but I was delayed by various matters and could not carry it out. However, Old Ling from my hometown had already come to pick me up. After the war, transportation in the interior was very problematic, so I decided to take the route through Hangzhou and take a civilian boat up the river.

"Above, there is heaven; below, there are Suzhou and Hangzhou." I had not been to the paradise on earth for a full ten years. I bought a second-class ticket in advance and went to the North Station with my nephew Wen Zhong and Old Ling. I boarded the train one and a half hours before departure, thinking that there would be plenty of time. However, the passengers were extremely crowded, and we could not find a foothold in the second-class carriage. We squeezed and squeezed again, but we were still sardines in the third-class carriage. It was truly a gathering of talented people, young and old, gathered together to celebrate this thirty-fifth New Year's Eve. "Travel" and "journey," these two pleasant terms, have probably become historical relics. The result that war has brought to the people is broken tiles and crumbling walls, with corpses lying on top of each other. The beautiful Jiangnan, which was once a vast expanse of plains, is covered with a desolate and gloomy mask.

We boarded the wooden boat, and after everything was arranged, we felt inspired to go and admire the West Lake scenery that we had been separated from for ten years, to revisit these two ancient poems: "If you want to compare West Lake to Xizi, it is always suitable whether lightly or heavily made up." Perhaps it was because of this late winter month that the trees were bare and the lake was empty, leaving only a few light boats floating on the vast expanse of water. I always felt that Xizi was gradually aging, or perhaps my personal state of mind had changed. As the seasons changed, the expression of natural scenery also changed its color. However, the return of spring after winter is a continuous cycle, while the years of life are like "the passing of time, never stopping day and night," never to return. The mountains and lakes are still the same, but the people are completely different. The lessons of history are extremely cruel, and we had infinite feelings when we visited the Yue Wang Temple (Yue Fei's Tomb).

Taking the value of sightseeing itself, if one is not limited by time, it is extremely poetic to take a wooden boat and row on the beautiful Fuchun River. However, the countryside after the war is like a thin and weak patient, mentally depressed and skeletal. This beautiful name "Fuchun River" has unfortunately become a "Poor River." The high mountains on both sides rise and fall, which is known as the Little Three Gorges. The most famous scenic spot is Yan Ziling's Fishing Terrace, which stands majestically with a myriad of scenes. This is a manifestation of the characteristic of the Eastern nation's indifference to utilitarianism and a historical fact of glorious history.

"Learning is like rowing upstream; if you don't advance, you retreat." The wooden boat we were sitting on was towed by a small fire truck, and it was quite fast to sail upstream. After arriving in Tonglu, because the water was shallow and there were many shoals, and the river was narrow, we resumed using the old method that had not changed for thousands of years, concentrating the strength of nine people to pull the boat, moving forward step by step with great effort while "moaning" and "groaning." This life on the water is quite interesting. When the wind is favorable, the white sails are hoisted, and the boat sails very fast, making one's heart feel refreshed. However, the kitchen at the stern emits smoke into the cabin, irritating the eyes and causing tears to flow incessantly, making one feel as sad as if one's parents had died. By the evening, the boatmen and passengers were crammed into the cabin.

The wooden boat I was on, counting men, women, old, and young, had more than thirty people, just like sardines packed in a can. The laboring and sacred boatmen were really out of touch with changing clothes and bathing. Group sleeping and breathing foul air made people very uncomfortable. I never expected that after we returned home, our close-fitting underwear had become a colony of white lice. "It's good at home for a thousand days, but it's difficult to go out at any time" is truly a realistic saying.

In the evening, our boat docked at Jiande (formerly Yanzhou Prefecture). Two soldiers and two policemen came, holding guns and claiming that they had a secret order from their superiors to have us change to another wooden boat and clear all people and goods. The passengers were stunned and didn't know what to do. I said that I wanted to see their superior to find out the cause and then make a decision. He looked at me wearing a blue cloth gown, looking very countrified, and flatly refused, with arrogance. Finally, I showed him my ID card, explaining that now the constitution had been promulgated and we had entered the constitutional era, and people could move freely. Fortunately, it was not like playing the lute to a cow. After the police chief mediated, we escaped the tiger's mouth.

When the boat arrived in Chun'an, we changed to a public bus. Various facilities in the interior were abnormal, and all travelers were headache. Although the price of provincial highway buses was low, there were few buses and many people. They ran on even and odd days. The pricing of commercial buses had no standards. The price was reduced when there were few passengers, and the price was increased when there were many passengers. The section of road from Chuntun to Shexian was only 90 kilometers. The highway bus fare increased from 7,000 yuan to 9,000 yuan, and the commercial bus fare ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 yuan. The difficulty of traveling can be seen. Along the way, in various stations and villages, there were few people, and the common people had disheveled hair and dirty faces. The countryside had nothing to destroy.

Our family has lived in Shexian County in Huizhou for generations. It is a desolate ancient county. The residents are hardworking, frugal, and simple in their lives. Most of them do business or study abroad. Two special figures in academic circles came from this place: one is the contemporary philosopher Hu Shih from Jixi, and the other is the recently deceased educator Tao Xingzhi from Shexian. The places where they studied and played in their childhood still exist. After the long eight-year war of resistance against Japan, the enemy's bombing changed many faces. When I stepped into my home, I couldn't help but shiver. The back house had become ruins, and the front hall had no walls. The high-rise hall had become a ruined temple. It was a pity that there were no Qingqing and Hongyu, otherwise I could have converted to Buddhism and become a monk.

The best scenery in the area is the Taiping Bridge (also known as Hexi Bridge) in the west gate. It is made entirely of green stone and was built in the Ming Dynasty. It is half a mile long and is a sixteen-hole bridge that spans the Lianjiang River. Chinese and foreign people who visit Huangshan will definitely linger and look around here. At the end of the road is the Xiqian Scenic Area. The tall trees are shaded, and the ancient pagoda stands tall. Looking from a distance, the Ziyang, Piyun, and Cuiwei peaks surround each other and overlook the Lianjiang River, which twists and turns like a ribbon. Below is the Sanyue Beach, with the sound of Yong always rushing. The local poet Xu Qingyan said:

The road hanging over the stream bank has several layers, the mountain wind blows and brushes the green mist;

I often think of the autumn sentences in the three volts, wash the inkstone and move the boat to the stone spring.

Proceeding dozens of steps, the environment is secluded. Climbing the steps, there is the tomb path of the ancient monk Mei Hua, with dozens of plum trees planted on both sides; after a week, one will see its cold and lonely posture in the ice and jade bones, embellishing the famous mountain. Further up is the tomb of Jiantang Shangren; the monk Jiantang is a New Anhui painter of his generation, who writes Huangshan with fine brushstrokes, uniquely marking his style and surpassing his time. It is a pity that there are very few works handed down to the world, which cannot be found in the local people. In June of the twenty-ninth year, Jitung Jushi, Mr. Wang Caibai, died of illness in his hometown at the age of fifty-four. Those who heard about it regretted it. The local people held a public burial here. Caibai's paintings are exquisite, and his poetry is pure and unique. He has written a collection of Wolong Travels in the Yellow Sea, which is popular in the world; domestic painters admire his art. In the past, we lived together in Nanjing and often visited each other. At that time, Wang taught in the Art Department of Zhongda University, and his students were extremely prosperous. Now that people and heavens are eternally separated, I feel lost and wandering by the base, I can't help but touch the scene and hurt. Below, there is a pavilion built to record his life deeds, and the painting "Wind Willow Mingshan" is engraved on the stone, with a seven-character poem attached, the calligraphy is strong and lovely, the poem says:

The water is beautiful and the sand is clear, this is unique, Wuliao City sails on the blue glass;

Containing Feng and spitting Lian, Xiqian Yue, blowing the flute to Qinglian a poem.

I lived in my hometown for a total of six days. Most of my neighbors and relatives have passed away. I have been studying in Shanghai since I was a child, and it has been thirty years in a hurry. During this period, after two world wars, recalling the past, I really have a sense of vicissitudes.

"How long can you be young, the temples are already pale, half of the old friends are ghosts, screaming in the heart, how can you know that after twenty years, you will be in the gentleman's hall again. …"

Du Gongbu's poem to Wei Ba Chushi is nothing but a picture of today.

### Staying Up on New Year's Eve

— Shi Pei

The cold wind and twilight often remind me of the scene of staying up with my father on Lunar New Year's Eve in my old home in my hometown. My father's mottled hair, his old and thin face; he was wearing a swollen robe and meditating by the candle holder. He never liked to say any farewell words to me, and I quietly watched him. The sequence of the year ends once a year, but the burden that this humble family places on my father's shoulders only gets heavier year after year!

The years give him only worries and sighs. I know that he does not want to pour the bitter juice of life that he has learned in his old age on the young, naive and simple heart of his child. It's only that the years are ruthless, and now I have realized the flavor of my father's past; carrying the sorrows of life, walking on the path of worries...

This year, the lintel of the old house has fallen off, the wind and rain are obscure, and my father has long left the world. The shrine in the hall no longer has the red paper that he personally wrote and changed every year, or perhaps even those faded paper marks left over from previous years have been incomplete. The red paper strips that were pasted in the past, such as "Full of Auspiciousness" and "Five Generations of Prosperity," may have caused some heartfelt joy in my father's life. However, no one remembers these things now. I am drifting thousands of miles away from my hometown, and now, when my mother is lonely on New Year's Eve, I wonder what she feels?

Staying up on New Year's Eve, waiting for dawn, the rooster crows and dances. Staying up on New Year's Eve can encourage the activity of life and the development of will, just like this old Western saying: "Old age praises life, dusk praises white books."

But when will we be able to obtain this joyful excitement of life?

### Poetry Talk

— Wu Tunwu

The boundaries between beauty, goodness, and poetry are difficult to define because they are originally the same kind of tool, a powerful tool to promote human development and move towards the door of happiness.

If some people think that the fresh blood on the arrows of the greedy is beautiful, the useful incense of the paunchy is good, and the dissolute and lazy tails of the past are actually poetry; we will not hesitate to give them the greatest contempt and disgust.

### Sending Off My Younger Brother Wu Zhaosu to Study in America

— Li Tuozhi

The flowing light of Xiepu proves my pure heart, the clear shadow of Bashan is found in my dreams. From now on, the bright moon will shine on the ends of the earth, and I will miss you even more when I look at you across the sea.

The reeds and wind by Xuanwu Lake, the colors of the Six Dynasties are in the faint smoke. Your travels have passed by the Rouge Well, and a touch of warmth is different.

Sending off a good friend further west, the wild rooster crows on Kunlun Mountain. Love the world without the same kind, and teach your embrace to be equal to all things.

The hurried Jinghu train comes and goes, passing by the wine shop several times. Remember the patriotism of the motherland: the warmth of spring in Jiangnan is full of orioles and flowers!

The voices of people around the city building are surrounded by lights, do not pity the parting and get drunk. All the friends on the seat are handsome and young, whose charm is the most flying?

### Water: Random Memories from a Window – Part Two

— Ye Dingluo

When one thinks of water in China, one must count the regions south of the Yangtze River, especially the area around Lake Tai. The water of Lake Tai, one of the five great lakes, is especially clear. That is my hometown, to which I long to return, with its free and unrestrained scenery, rich in gentle sentiments. Paddy fields and rivers are all over the countryside, which is known as the "Land of Fish and Rice." The rivers there are very wide, with water so clear you can see the bottom. Algae and swimming fish move like they are in a large glass box. Countless boats float on the water. The most interesting are not the steamboats, but the folk boats, especially the fishing boats. The women who work on these boats have a special charm. They expose their arms and legs to adapt to their lives and out of natural necessity, not for fashion. Their skin is reddish-black and healthy, and especially their dark cheeks, their beautiful eyes flowing with waves, are captivatingly charming. They can row, punt, cast nets, cook, wash clothes, and sing. Their songs are beautiful, clear, gentle, and not lewd, but rather elegant music. Most interestingly, in the morning, they sit on the boat, comb their hair facing the water, look at their reflection in the water, using the water as a mirror. One can imagine how clear and beautiful the water there is.

Along the city's waterfront, there are rows of fishing shops, lumber shops, rice shops, and bamboo shops. Large shop signs are written on the walls. This is because boats are the means of transportation for goods and people's travel in that area. Thousands of boats row in from the surrounding countryside, loaded with people's food and supplies, seeking large shops to sell to on the river. These large characters on the walls indicate the strong capital and commercial credit inside. When people see these big characters and so many boats, they can imagine the prosperity of the place. The reflections of houses and boats hang in the water, and countless bamboo and wooden rafts float on the water's surface. People form markets on the water. You can see them on boats, bamboo rafts, and wooden rafts, socializing, singing, arguing, drinking, and moving things. In the summer, some people jump into the water like frogs and start swimming.

Who says that the waters of Venice are so beautiful? Many European Romance writers have described it as the backdrop for stories. This water town area in Jiangnan, China, is also bright and beautiful scenery worth praising. Many "ballads" and scripts from the Ming and Qing dynasties wrote many stories of talented scholars and beautiful women here. Now, there are many storytellers in this area. They use a three-stringed lute and a fan to attract many people.

The people here rely on water for a living. Without water in the rivers and ponds, there would be no fish. Without water in the paddy fields, there would be no rice. And the water here is so clear, so the women here look especially like water hyacinths.

### Superman

— Yu Qiang

The comic that has fascinated children all over America

"Young readers are positively influenced: they know that justice will prevail and goodness will ultimately overcome evil!"

Along with all kinds of American goods, comic books starring "Superman," who punched down the "Empire State Building" with one punch, have also crossed the ocean and entered China.

"Superman" is the creation of two short, Cleveland, Ohio youths who experienced childhood frustration. Their names are Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. When they were studying at the city school, they were often beaten by mischievous children nearby. Both were sons of poor parents and liked to read cheap Chinese "Water Margin"-type novels, yearning for the invincible heroes in the books.

Jerry was somewhat capable of using a pen, and when he discovered Joe's talent for drawing, he dreamed of a "super hero." "Its" deeds could be depicted in comics. "I got this idea in bed one night," Jerry recalled. A combination of "Samson (a strongman in the Old Testament), Hercules (a strongman in Greek mythology), and Atlas (a giant in Greek mythology who bears the weight of the sky), plus the virtue of Sir Galahad, his mission in life is to clear the world of thugs.

Where does Superman come from?

The two young men collaborated for six years, producing miles of "Superman" adventure history comics, but they were all rejected by the editor and thrown into the wastebasket. Then, one day in 1938, publisher Harry Donenfeld first bought the first "Superman" story for $130 and published it in "Action Comics" magazine, which became an instant hit. Since then, "Superman" has earned millions of dollars. The two 30-year-old authors—although they had originally sold all the rights—also continued to share in the profits.

Today, "Superman" is a huge business. About three million readers regularly buy "Action Comics," "Superman," and "World's Finest Comics" magazines. "Superman's" "headquarters" are these three magazines, and more than 200 related newspapers reprint them. Their total sales are about 20 million copies. There are dozens of products with "Superman" as a trademark. In addition, there is a "Superman" radio program, broadcast by coastal radio stations.

Of course, "Superman's" biggest impact is on children. Parents also know its importance and often ask "Superman" to order young people to write a line to stop biting their fingernails. More enthusiastic young readers write letters, and "Superman"—through a group of secretaries in "its" publisher's New York office—advises young people to sleep ten hours a day, eat more vegetables, and assert that all thugs have "yellow streaks."

For years, Siegel and Shuster have been writing and drawing "Superman" together. Because "Superman's" influence on children is so great, they must take on the task of instilling faith, a responsibility similar to that of parents and teachers, guiding the publishers of this comic. Therefore, they hire professional men and women in the fields of child psychology, education, and welfare to actively assist.

This editorial advisory group includes Dr. Johnson, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Chetek of the Department of Educational Psychology at Columbia University, and Lieutenant Colonel Milliken, a publishing inspector for the Department of the Army. These experts pay attention to correct English, psychologically sound behavior, and morality. Every "Superman" story has been proofread by them.

Recently, Dr. Chetek analyzed an average "Superman magazine." His conclusion was: "This magazine contains more than 10,000 words of reading material. It is a source of education, leading children to a vast vocabulary, including many useful words that children in grades four through eight need deeper instruction to learn."

Does "Superman" have a good influence on children? Professor Bender, a psychological researcher at Brivive, and Miss Frank of the Children's Learning Association, both believe that "Superman" has a clear and positive influence.

"Children can enjoy the thrill of danger, just like adults reading horror novels," Miss Frank said. "They know that justice will prevail and goodness will ultimately overcome evil." Superman does not harm the good.

To prove this, she gave an example: a little boy warned his female playmate, "Be careful! I am Superman, I will hurt you."

"You can't scare me," his opponent said, "Superman" never hurts good people."

"Superman" has made "its" authors and publishers rich, but they have also fulfilled their educational responsibilities.

Can't the authors of our country's "Little Books" also imitate and improve their style? Can't child educators also use tools similar to "Superman"?

### Anecdotes of the "Worldly Elder"

— Shu Xiang

The ways of the world and human relationships are all different.

(Note: The "Worldly Elder" has published several pieces in this journal, full of witty remarks. Now, two or three anecdotes about the elder have been discovered, which are still recorded for readers.)

The elder accompanied an important person to visit a certain place. News reporters suddenly gathered and asked about the current situation, which made the important person very embarrassed. The elder then spoke on his behalf, saying: "Chief X came here purely for a private visit and has no official business. After this visit, he feels that China's future is extremely optimistic." The reporter laughed, and the elder also laughed, and this predicament was resolved.

A certain chief wanted to celebrate his mother's birthday, but was afraid of public criticism. The elder wrote a birthday message for him, saying: "At the beginning of the founding of the country, the war has not ended, the people are hungry, and there are starving corpses in the wild. I respectfully follow my mother's order and donate all the funds for the birthday celebration to charity to benefit the disaster victims."

An elder had a friend who was engaged in official duties and was quite loyal in his advice, but he was not promoted for many years. His colleagues were active and ran around, neglecting their duties, and even rose above him. The friend went to his residence to complain about the injustice. The elder then made a riddle to illustrate it, saying: "In the past, Dharma asked Guanyin Bodhisattva, 'I have been meditating facing the wall for nine years, without a single desire, but I cannot ascend. Lü Dongbin got drunk three times at Yueyang Tower, violating the alcohol taboo, privately escorted He Xiangu, violating the lust taboo, drew his sword and slashed the Yellow Dragon, violating the anger taboo, and turned stone into gold, violating the wealth taboo, but he is listed among the Eight Immortals. Why is this?' The Bodhisattva smiled and said: 'Dongbin travels to the Canghai in the morning and Kunlun in the evening, walking many roads in a day. You have been meditating facing the wall all day, lazy and immobile, how can you ascend?'" The friend suddenly understood and has since been running around every day.

A certain person was henpecked. Friends would ridicule him whenever they gathered. The person blushed and was ashamed to answer. The elder relieved him by saying: "It's nothing for him to be afraid of his wife. If you were afraid of your wife, that would be strange." Those who heard it laughed, and the person was relieved.

The elder went to a barber shop for a haircut. After finishing, he took out a thousand yuan as payment. The barber thought it was too little, so he smiled and said: "The young master gives two thousand yuan, the old master should give more." The elder angrily said: "He can ask me for money, I have no place to ask for money." The barber heard this and waved him away.

The elder carried a suitcase and bedding to a certain county. He encountered a thief on the way. He first gave him the suitcase, and the thief accepted it, but then demanded the bedding. He gave it to him again. The thief, thinking he was stupid, forced him to take off his coat. The elder smiled and said to him: "A gentleman does not contend for anything, why are you so greedy!" The thief angrily pounced on him and stripped off all his clothes. The elder then became very angry and said: "How difficult it is to find a gentleman!"

### Taking Advantage of a Fire to Loot and Fishing in Troubled Waters

— Shao Zhenhe

When reading the Nanhua Sutra, there are these two sentences: "Entering the water without getting wet, entering the fire without getting hot." At that time, I thought, if there really are such characters in the world, wouldn't they become "either immortals or demons"? In fact, this is stupid thinking, so stupid that I can laugh at myself, laugh at myself for having such naive ideas!

To put it "kindly," the fire brigade and the lifeboat can represent the idea that anyone who does "firefighting" or "rescue" work needs to be able to "enter the fire without getting hot, enter the water without getting wet." If these two types of people "are afraid of fire and avoid heat" or "are afraid of water and avoid moisture," what else can they do? It's simply absurd. All of the above is well known, and there is no need to give examples.

Firefighting. Literally, it seems that as long as the fire is extinguished, the task is completed. In fact, all the people in the fire who are affected by the fire, whether dead or injured, or only have one breath left, even knowing that they are pulled out from the rubble pile will not help, but according to "humanity" and "conscience," they are all included in the rescue list. Firefighting is like this, and rescuing from drowning should be the same. This is also well known, and there is no need to give examples.

In addition, there are many other characters who "enter the fire without getting burned, enter the water without getting wet." As long as two more are mentioned, it can be "applied by analogy." One is "taking advantage of a fire to loot," and the other is "fishing in troubled waters."

Taking advantage of a fire to loot requires not being afraid of fire and not avoiding heat; fishing in troubled waters requires not being afraid of water and not avoiding moisture. The basic spirit is the same as firefighting and rescuing from drowning, the only difference lies in some purposes.

Taking advantage of a fire to loot does not require rescuing people, nor does it require rescuing the fire. The fire is an opportunity for you to "take advantage of." With this opportunity, you should adapt to the situation and not be rigid. To give an example, in the "flying disasters" that have occurred one after another and the recent "fire disaster" in Shanghai, they can be found. It is said that in Vietnam, many victims were not yet dead, still moaning! However, the people who came to "rescue" were concerned with touching gold rings and wallets. Of course, anything you want can be "rescued!"

As for the recent "fire disaster" in Shanghai, they actually talked about "jin tou" (catty price) with gold bars as a condition. It is said that there were really gold bars in this fire, so what was rescued was "gold," so they had to turn their minds to the head of the gold. "Taking gold from the fire" is originally a difficult task!

### Spring Couplets

— Little Bear

During the Spring Festival, I saw two couplets that were quite interesting, so I will record them as follows:

"The people suffer greatly, and there are few good tidings of peace talks."

(This is the Spring Couplet in front of the Wanhe Department Store on Jiangxi North Road. The sentiment and text are both very profound.)

"Benefit the country and the people, promote the cause and build a foundation." (This is the Spring Couplet in front of the Fuchang Brick and Tile Shop on Haining Road. The content is quite relevant.)

### Praise for Oneself

— Liangzai

—Someone Behind the Mirror—

The American "Libbey-Owens-Ford" Glass Company has recently manufactured a mirror by coating a very thin sheet of chromium alloy on a glass plate. People standing in front of the mirror can clearly see themselves due to the reflection of the chromium alloy; but this chromium alloy also allows some light to pass through, allowing people standing behind the mirror to see the person looking in the mirror.

Life Magazine displayed such a mirror in the rest area of ​​a theater in Times Square. They installed a small dark room like a sentry box behind the mirror and sent photographer Yale Joel to hide in this dark room, waiting for an opportunity to act. Because the small room was dark, Yale Joel could leisurely examine the people standing in front of the mirror, while those who were being tricked saw nothing but their own reflection.

Of course, like other public mirrors, the alloy mirror that Yale was hiding in was quickly taken care of by people. Some applied lipstick in front of the mirror; some straightened their hats; some straightened their ties; some arranged their skirts; some examined themselves in the mirror for a long time and smiled before leaving; some winked and preened themselves. Mr. Yale Joel, the "man in the mirror," was too busy to keep up, his hands and feet in a mess. Seventeen of his works were published in Life Magazine, including:

Seven women: One about twenty years old was straightening her twisted skirt, her boyfriend (?) watching her and smiling. A fat lady, looking about forty years old, smiled and pulled the back of her hat. Two middle-aged women seemed to be very concerned about their eyes, one lightly stroking her eyebrows with her fingers, and the other carefully examining her eyelids, as if to determine whether they were single or double. The two who were applying lipstick and moistening their lips with their tongues looked very relaxed. The last one lifted her skirt and carefully straightened her stockings.

Ten men: One was winking and examining his teeth. One was pulling on his stiff collar, looking like he was suffering from it. The man with the brightly colored tie was forcefully pulling up his already not-too-low pants. Two gentlemen with thick eyebrows and big eyes were diligently worrying. One was twirling his chin, worried that his beard was too long; one was pressing his nose, afraid that scrofula would grow. The one whose face resembled Bing Crosby was holding a paper bag in one hand and straightening his hat with the other, a smile hidden in the corner of his mouth. The two who were blowing their noses and wiping their glasses, I really don't understand why they had to stand in front of the mirror. One who was bending over to tie his shoelaces was also included in the shot. The most ridiculous was this gentleman who squeezed one eye shut, opened the other wide, and held onto his coat with both hands. He walked to the mirror just to praise himself. Yale Joel called him "Slif-A mirer".

### The U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp in memory of the 100th anniversary of the birth of scientific saint Thomas Edison. The stamp will be issued starting February 11.
