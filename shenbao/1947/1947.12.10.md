[Our Qingdao, 9th dispatch] The battle in Laiyang is still fierce. The bandits launched more than ten fierce attacks last night, all of which were repelled by the defending troops.

### 關金千元二千元券　央行今日起發行　市當局決制止投機漲價

Central Bank to Issue 1,000 and 2,000 Customs Gold Unit Notes Starting Today; City Authorities Resolve to Curb Speculation and Price Hikes

[Our report] The Central Bank received an order from the Central Government yesterday, and will start issuing 1,000 (20,000) yuan and 2,000 (40,000) yuan Customs Gold Unit notes today (the 10th) according to the actual needs of the market. In order to prevent the impact of rising prices, the Municipal Government convened an emergency economic meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, and Central Bank Vice President Liu Gongyun jointly hosted reporters after the meeting. First, Vice President Liu reported that the issuance of large notes of 10,000 yuan or more is very urgent. The Shanghai Banking and Monetary Industry Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have sent letters to the Central Bank requesting this, and other places have also made similar requests. The Central Bank has already taken note of these needs. Then, Mayor Wu reported the resolutions of the economic meeting, stating in brief: The issuance of large notes has no impact on prices. Before the war, banknotes were issued from one yuan and five yuan up to ten yuan, and this did not affect prices. Now, calculated according to a cost of living index of 50,000 times, a ten-yuan banknote should be equivalent to 500,000 yuan. Therefore, the issuance of 100,000 yuan notes should not have any impact on prices. However, in order to prevent speculators from taking advantage of the situation to stir up trouble, the Municipal Government has convened relevant parties to discuss countermeasures and has resolved to take the following effective measures to control the prices of various daily necessities: Cotton yarn: The government will sell it without restrictions, releasing as much as the market needs. Rice: 300,000 dan will arrive in Shanghai before the end of this month. Starting today, the Social Affairs Bureau will distribute and sell it in large quantities in various districts. Rayon: 5,000 dan will be distributed within two weeks, which exceeds the actual needs, so the price will definitely not rise. Cooking oil: The allocation of oil based on population is already being implemented throughout the city, and there will be no problem with oil prices. Coal: 200,000 tons will be allocated, and coal prices can also be stabilized. The above measures will be strictly implemented starting on the 10th. If anyone still attempts to stir up trouble under the pretext of issuing large notes, they will be severely punished for disrupting financial order.

Finally, Commander Xuan made a statement saying: The issuance of these large notes is originally to meet the needs of the market and is very reasonable. What the municipal authorities are worried about is that there are too many speculators in this city, and they always take advantage of opportunities to manipulate and hoard goods. The Municipal Government has made up its mind to crack down on speculators. Starting on the 10th, the Garrison Headquarters will dispatch a large number of personnel to thoroughly investigate all areas. However, the general public, who are used to using 5,000 and 10,000 yuan notes, will inevitably be psychologically affected by the sudden appearance of large notes. We hope that the press can cooperate on this point to eliminate the public's psychological fears so that the issuance of large notes in the future will not have an impact. We also hope that commodity prices in this city will not rise before the Gregorian New Year and the Lunar New Year.

### 戡亂期間　地方行政首長　獎懲條例草案　行政院決議交付審查

Draft Regulations on Rewards and Punishments for Local Administrative Heads During the Suppression of Rebellion: Executive Yuan Resolves to Submit for Review

[Our Nanjing, 9th dispatch] At the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 9th, the draft regulations on rewards and punishments for local administrative heads during the period of suppressing the rebellion were discussed. The reason for this draft is that local administrative heads, including provincial chairmen, special mayors, and commissioners, county magistrates, and mayors, have the responsibility to eliminate traitors and bandits and protect the territory and the people during the period of suppressing the rebellion. Therefore, rewards and punishments should be given based on their performance. However, the political committee members believed that this matter was of great importance and decided to submit it for review. The draft regulations stipulate three matters for which rewards should be given: Organizing Baojia, building blockhouses, enriching local armed forces, and effectively supervising them, so as to prevent problems in advance and protect the locality. Exerting their best efforts to protect strongholds and save the people despite the fact that the strength of bandits is much greater. Resisting resolutely and protecting the locality when their own strength is equivalent to that of the bandits. The types of rewards are promotion or special appointment, commendation, recording a major merit, and recording a merit in four grades. The matters for which punishment should be given are three: Neglecting precautions in advance, taking inappropriate measures in times of crisis, causing the locality and the people to be ravaged. Failing to exert their best efforts to protect the locality and important strongholds despite the fact that their strength is greater than that of the bandits. Recklessly abandoning the defense or shrinking back instead of advancing when their own strength is equivalent to that of the bandits. The punishments are dismissal for investigation, dismissal with retention of position, recording a major demerit, and recording a demerit in four grades. The procedures for submitting rewards and punishments are also stipulated in the regulations. The Executive Yuan may form an investigation committee to verify the facts and ensure that there is no wrongful pardon.

Content of Financial and Economic Plan: Balancing International Payments to Stabilize Currency Value; U.S. Aid to China Will Be in the Form of Construction Equipment Instead of Cash

[Our Nanjing, 9th dispatch] The self-reliance plan to solve the current economic and financial problems, which is being drafted by the Executive Yuan, is still being discussed by those in charge. Another meeting will be held this week to discuss it further. According to an authoritative source, the part of the plan regarding stabilizing the currency value is divided into two points: Seeking a balance of international payments and reducing the financial revenue and expenditure gap. The source believes that after the U.S. loan to China is completed, the monthly loan of 20 million U.S. dollars can solve the first item of the plan. As for the solution to the second item, it should be strengthening production and reorganizing the monetary system.

### 召開對日初步和會　美考慮答覆我建議　日兵工廠設備將提前拆卸

The U.S. is Considering a Reply to Our Suggestions on Convening a Preliminary Peace Conference with Japan; Equipment from Japanese Military Factories to Be Dismantled Ahead of Schedule

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] A U.S. State Department official told reporters on the 8th that the U.S. government is currently considering a formal response to the note sent to the U.S. by China on November 17th. The U.S. State Department has received a note from the delegation stationed in Japan, recently sent to the Soviet Union, stating that the preliminary peace conference with Japan should be held by the eleven member countries of the Far Eastern Commission, not by the four foreign ministers. However, a State Department spokesman declined to comment on this matter. He only said that the United States will express its views on the Soviet suggestions in its reply to China. Judging from the current signs, the United States seems unwilling to accept the Soviet Union's recent suggestion that a preliminary peace conference with Japan be held by the four powers. The United States' original suggestion was that this conference be held by the eleven countries that make up the Far Eastern Commission, and it appears that this policy has not changed. It is believed here that the preliminary peace conference with Japan may be delayed until next spring because the Soviet Union insists on holding the conference by the four powers.

[Central News Agency, this city] Relevant parties received a telegram from the "Japan Reparations and Returned Materials Receiving Committee" of the delegation stationed in Japan on the 9th, stating that the Allied Headquarters has now decided to allocate all movable equipment in Japanese state-run military factories (including naval shipyards) ahead of schedule, with the exception of those temporarily in use and those that have been destroyed. The scope includes cranes, in-plant auxiliary machinery and equipment, self-supplied generators, wind power, water supply, welding equipment, boilers, electric furnaces, naval dry docks (temporarily in use), and measuring and testing instruments. Currently, a list of items is being compiled and methods of allocation are being studied. Once a decision is made, 30% will be handed over to China, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the Philippines for dismantling and application.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] The Chinese delegation announced today that our tugboat has left Shanghai for Nagasaki in order to tow back the 10,045-ton ship "Hainan." The ship is a renamed version of the Japanese "Bin Ying" Maru. This ship is the largest ship returned to China after the Japanese surrender and will be handed over to our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The ship was sunk by bombing during the war in Xianglin Port on Hainan Island and was salvaged by our people in our territorial waters, so it should belong to our government.

Editorial

### Starting with the Sino-American Naval Agreement

The Sino-British Naval Agreement was signed in Beijing on the 8th, stipulating the transfer of over 270 warships to China without compensation. Most of these ships have already been handed over to China. Although the signing of this agreement is merely the completion of a formality, its significance is extraordinary. Especially at this time when Sino-British relations are undergoing new changes, it is particularly worthy of our attention.

In recent days, the United States has been discussing the two major issues of aiding Europe and aiding China. As a result, in British public opinion, the question of which to prioritize – aiding Europe or aiding China – has arisen. Various parties have expressed numerous opinions, each seeing the issue from their own perspective, leading to much debate and disagreement. However, in our view, this debate is unnecessary. After the war, European countries face numerous dangers. If the United States cannot provide timely assistance, an economic downturn in Europe will be unavoidable. The foundation of American economic prosperity rests on its overseas markets. If Europe experiences an economic panic, the United States will inevitably be affected, causing fluctuations. Therefore, some say that American aid to European countries is equivalent to aiding America itself, which is entirely correct. However, in Asia, China's economic strength and weakness, national power, and political gains and losses are closely related to the United States from a political, economic, and military perspective. At this moment, China is facing unprecedented difficulties and urgently needs American assistance. If the United States cannot provide timely and comprehensive assistance, the consequences will be detrimental not only to China but also to the United States itself. Republican leaders in the United States have repeatedly appealed to the American government and public, advocating for immediate and comprehensive aid to China, based on this very reason. In fact, the current U.S. authorities also recognize this. If we think calmly, since the end of the Great War, the United States has never stopped providing economic and military assistance to China. The signing of the Sino-American Naval Agreement is a strong proof of this. The United States is transferring 271 warships to China without compensation, with the sole purpose of helping the Chinese government control its waters, becoming a first-class naval power in the Pacific and jointly maintaining peace in the Pacific with the United States.

China's eastern coast faces the ocean, extending from the Yellow Sea in the north to the South China Sea in the south, with the East China Sea in between. The coastline is undeniably long. However, China lacks solid defensive fortifications along its coast and lacks large harbors suitable for defense. It can truly be described as an "open door" nation. Any navy with the ambition to invade China can easily enter without resistance. The suffering China endured from Japanese aggression during the eight-year war is a bloody lesson. In the future, when discussing national defense, a strong navy is essential. Moreover, most of China's wealthy provinces are located near the coast. From a tactical perspective, while the air force is important in future world wars, the navy has not lost its importance. China is the only stable force in Asia, responsible for maintaining peace in the Far East. But how can it fulfill this responsibility? How can it complete its mission? Establishing a large navy is an indispensable condition. The United States' transfer of warships to China is intended to help China build a strong navy. This alone proves that the U.S. authorities, whether President Truman or Secretary of State Marshall, have never overlooked the importance of China's position in Asia, nor have they placed China in a secondary position.

When we review the history of Sino-American relations over the past century, the American policy towards China, while varying in urgency and emphasis between the Republican and Democratic parties, has always been consistent in its basic principles. Examining the fundamental American policy towards China, we can identify three key characteristics: First, the United States has never had territorial ambitions towards China. Historical facts support this. For example, after the signing of the Boxer Protocol following the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion, the powers in China all harbored territorial ambitions, seeking to acquire concessions or leaseholds, or demanding the demarcation of spheres of influence. Only the United States not only had no territorial ambitions but also consistently issued statements declaring the two major principles of "Open Door" and "Equal Opportunity," shattering the powers' dream of partitioning China. Second, after World War I, to stabilize the situation in the Pacific, the United States convened a conference in Washington in 1922, inviting the relevant Pacific nations. The United States demanded that the powers respect China's territorial integrity and sovereignty, significantly raising China's international status. This further demonstrates that the United States had no territorial ambitions towards China. When Japan launched the September 18th Incident in 1931, occupying Northeast China by force, Stimson's proposal for the United States and Britain to jointly stop Japan was not realized. However, he issued the "Non-Recognition Doctrine," stating that the United States would never recognize any situation created by Japan through force, a principle that has been consistently adhered to by the U.S. government. Second, the only desire of the United States towards China is to promote trade between the two countries. China is not only vast and rich in resources but also densely populated. From an economic perspective, there is endless potential for Sino-American trade. However, the first condition for increasing trade between the two countries is peace and unity within China. Only with peace can the economy prosper, and only with economic prosperity can the purchasing power of the people increase, allowing Sino-American trade to develop. Therefore, the United States has always hoped that China can become a peaceful, unified, and democratic nation. Third, the United States has always hoped that China would forever be its ally. This desire stems purely from geographical and military considerations. During the last Pacific War, the United States was able to turn defeat into victory entirely due to China's arduous and unwavering resistance. If China had compromised midway, it would not have been easy for the United States to defeat Japan. By analogy, we have ample reason to believe that if the United States wants to maintain peace in the Pacific, whether to prevent Japan from rising again and engaging in aggression or to prevent the Soviet Union from expanding its influence, it must have China as its ally. Since the United States wants China to be its ally, it must hope that China becomes strong. Therefore, the U.S. policy towards China is consistent: it hopes that China can become a peaceful, unified, and strong democratic nation.

However, looking at the current reality in China, the victory has brought new disputes. The Communists are not only attempting to expand their territory by force but also using internal strife as a means to drag down the national economy, thereby achieving their goal of seizing power. Therefore, peace has not yet been achieved in China, and unity is even more out of reach. The continued and expanding internal strife has made inflation unavoidable, leading to soaring prices and widespread suffering. As a result, the need for financial assistance from friendly nations is even more urgent. At the same time, the inability to stop the internal strife has made it impossible to carry out national construction and reform. However, looking at the international situation after the war, especially after the establishment of the new Comintern, the confrontation between the two worlds has become increasingly acute. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall global situation, it is also unacceptable for China to exhaust its national strength in internal strife. This forces the United States to provide military assistance to China. The signing of the Sino-American Naval Agreement is actually the first step in the United States' military assistance to China. During the war, there was a popular saying: "The United States is the arsenal of democratic nations," meaning that the future of the entire world depends entirely on the United States. Now that the postwar era has arrived, the United States has an even greater responsibility and a sacred mission to maintain world peace. Today's American politicians and diplomats should have a long-term vision and provide timely and comprehensive assistance to any place in the world where danger arises.

In conclusion, the signing of the Sino-American Naval Agreement sufficiently demonstrates that the U.S. authorities have not only never neglected the importance of China's position in Asia but are also actively seeking ways to assist China in building a strong navy, thereby jointly safeguarding peace in the Pacific. We only hope that the signing of the Sino-American Naval Agreement marks the starting point for the United States' military assistance to China.

The Sino-American Naval Agreement was signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 8th. (Right picture) Foreign Minister Wang and Ambassador Stuart sign the agreement.

### Chambers of Commerce and Banking Industries Request the National Bank to Issue Large Denomination Banknotes

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] It is reported that the demand for issuing large denomination banknotes with a face value of 10,000 yuan or more is extremely urgent from all sides, who believe that it must be issued. Recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Industry Association, based on the requests of various industries, jointly requested the Central Bank to promptly issue banknotes with a larger face value than before, in order to regulate the market and balance supply and demand. Similar requests have also been made in other regions. Excerpts from the original letters from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Industry Association to the National Bank are as follows:

The letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the National Bank stated that at the present time when genuine agricultural products are being put on the market, the amount of cash required is extremely large. In terms of the current situation of funds, the amount required is far larger than the amount of bank notes that can be stuffed into boxes and loaded on a convoy. In addition to the costs of moving the boxes, there is a risk. More critically, in order to allocate capital and meet needs, it is inevitable to search for small denomination notes which is resulting in the shortage of cash. We are afraid that there is a resurgence of the phenomenon that small denomination banknotes were valued less than those from the period when we were occupied. The letter also said that the Municipal Banking Association had previously sent a letter to your bank requesting the issuance of banknotes with a larger face value, which is a measure that is necessary to deal with the current situation and should not be delayed any longer. The letter also asked the national bank to listen to their need.

The letter from the Banking Industry Association to the National Bank stated that crops such as rice, cotton, and tobacco have been coming onto the market in large quantities. The industry is an important part of the rural economy. The letter added that the large amount of small denomination notes that are needed to support these industries create a burden for these industries. Finally, the letter said that the present level of cash is not enough to satisfy the needs of these industries and requested that a new class of notes should be produced by the national bank.

[This Newspaper Dispatch] Xu Jiguang, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, expressed his opinion on the issuance of large banknotes yesterday, saying: "There is a severe shortage of banknotes in the market recently, which is extremely inconvenient for the business community. The Chamber of Commerce has submitted a petition to the Central Bank for the issuance of large banknotes for circulation. As far as I know, it is not only Shanghai that lacks cash, but the situation in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other areas is even more severe. Therefore, issuing large banknotes at this time will not have a significant impact on prices. Even if some small businesses take the opportunity to raise prices due to psychological reasons, it will not affect the overall situation."

[This Newspaper Dispatch] In order to meet the needs of all sectors and alleviate the shortage of cash in various regions, the Central Bank has decided to start issuing three types of new Customs Gold Unit (CGU) notes starting from the 10th. The face values are 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000, each equivalent to 20,000, 40,000, and 100,000 Legal Tender (fapi), respectively. After the reporter learned of the news of the issuance of large banknotes yesterday, he immediately visited Liang Ping, Director of the Issuance Bureau of the National Bank, Deputy Director Chen Yanzuo, and Tian Fu to view the samples of the new CGU notes. Only the 1,000 and 2,000 denominations were shown, while the 5,000 denomination was still being printed.

The 1,000 CGU notes have two versions, one from the China Printing Bureau and one from the Central Printing Factory, both of which are flat-printed. The note is 2.5 inches wide and 6.1 inches long, slightly smaller than the commonly used 10,000 yuan note. The design of the front and back is similar to that of ordinary CGU notes. However, the front design is dark green, and the seals of the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank are located at the bottom of the note. The back design is brown-gray, with the English signatures of Liang Ping, Director of the Issuance Bureau, and Chen Yanzuo, Deputy Director. The 2,000 CGU notes only have one version from the Zhonghua Book Company, which is intaglio-printed. It is 2.625 inches wide and 5.75 inches long, and the design is also similar to that of ordinary CGU notes. However, the printing paper is more exquisite than that of the 1,000 CGU notes. The front design is dark ocher, and the seals of the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank are located in the middle of the note. The back design is light ocher, with the English signatures of Liang Ping, Director of the Issuance Bureau, and Tian Fu. Both new notes indicate that they were printed in the 36th year of the Republic of China.

### Molotov Suddenly Concedes; Deadlock in Foreign Ministers' Conference Broken; Continued Discussions on German Economic Principles; Based on British-Soviet Documents

[United Press, London, 9th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov made a slight concession on the 9th, which was enough to allow the four foreign ministers to sit down and discuss the main German issues, dispelling fears of an early end to the Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is noteworthy that Molotov's "concession" was made hours after Marshall and Bevin and Bissel had a private meeting to discuss what showdown measures should be taken if Molotov remained inflexible. At the start of today's meeting, Molotov stated that he had never wanted the Foreign Ministers' Conference to break down or end in complete failure. At the same time, Molotov launched another attack on the United Kingdom and the United States, fiercely attacking the Western allies, saying that the Marshall Plan would enslave democratic Europe. He also pointed out that the construction of the Ruhr by the United Kingdom and the United States was a "strategic base" for dominating Europe and planned to divide Germany and establish a divided West German government. Molotov's attack was so sharp that the British representative called it the most shocking lie about the Ruhr issue, but Marshall ignored it.

[Reuters, London, 9th] The British Foreign Office officially announced on the morning of the 9th that Foreign Secretary Bevin will attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference as usual today. Bevin was unable to attend yesterday due to illness.

[Reuters, London, 8th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference achieved unexpected success on the 8th. The four foreign ministers agreed that when discussing the economic principles of Germany, the basic document proposed by the United Kingdom on economic principles should be used as the basis for discussion, and the equivalent parts of the economic principles document proposed by the Soviet Union should be compared and discussed chapter by chapter. The deadlock among the four foreign ministers on procedural issues was thus broken. The four foreign ministers further agreed that after comparing and discussing the equivalent parts of the British and Soviet documents chapter by chapter, they would then hold discussions on the chapters in the Soviet document that were not equivalent to the British document. After the procedural issues were resolved, the discussion of the British document began, and an agreement was reached on one of the economic issues. The chapter stated that the controlling powers should, in the second stage of the initial control period, seek to eliminate Germany's war-making capabilities, enable Germany to compensate the Allied countries for the losses caused during the war, and assist Germany in restoring its economy under the conditions necessary for adequate security. The Allied countries should assist Germany in establishing a balanced economy so that Germany can export to pay for its main imports, repay the occupation expenses paid by the occupying powers, and assume its due responsibility in the task of restoring the sound economy of Europe as a whole. At the meeting on Saturday, Marshall asked Molotov to submit a complete document on the Soviet Union's economic principles for Germany on Monday, which is today. At that time, Molotov did not indicate whether he would or not, but at the beginning of today's meeting, Molotov issued a written statement to the other three foreign ministers and then submitted detailed proposals on the three major themes of economic principles, Germany's post-war economic level, and compensation plans.

### Soviet Union Proposes Detailed Plan; Advocating Joint Control of the Ruhr by the Four Powers

Molotov issued a written explanation as follows: He opposed using the basic document on economic principles by the United Kingdom as the basis for discussion. This document intends to replace the principles of the Potsdam Conference with new principles, which not only violates the Potsdam Resolution but also infringes on the legitimate interests of countries that were invaded and occupied by Germany. He advocated that the Foreign Ministers' Conference simultaneously discuss the basic documents of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom as an equal basis for discussion. His statement continued to criticize the British and American authorities in Germany for establishing an economic center in Frankfurt, ignoring the Berlin Allied Control Council. This move is detrimental to the economic revival of the entire Germany. It was added that the British and American regions have been merged for more than a year, but their industries have declined. Small farmers have not obtained a true distribution of land, and agricultural production has also decreased sharply. On the one hand, the British and American authorities are supporting the restoration of some parts of heavy industry, employing industrial tycoons from the Hitler era, and actively restoring military industry. These policies not only do not help the economic revival of Germany but also enable certain foreign people to use western Germany, especially the Ruhr region, as a military strategic base for dominating Europe. France has also agreed with the policies of the United Kingdom and France in western Germany. Today, the foreign dollar debt of western Germany has increased sharply, making western Germany more dependent on the United States. The United States intends to create this situation and then establish a government in western Germany to eliminate Germany as an independent country. This policy is contrary to the principles of establishing a democratic and peaceful Europe. We must not ignore the rights of the German people to demand the establishment of an independent country and the aspirations of European democratic countries to restore German unity to help the revival of Europe.

The proposals made by Molotov on economic principles, Germany's post-war economic level, and compensation plans are as follows:

Economic Principles: The controlling powers recognize the necessity of accelerating the revival of German agriculture, industry, and transportation, raising the living standards of the people, and enabling Germany to participate in the European economic revival. The Soviet delegation recommends that the Allied Control Council instruct the German central agencies to handle matters that are centrally handled as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement as soon as possible, as well as food, agriculture, etc. These agencies should be supervised and guided by the Allied Control Council, and the commanders of each region should also implement general supervision of the activities of these agencies. If there is a violation of the instructions of the Allied Control Council, etc., the commander may submit it to the Allied Control Council for approval to stop its activities. The level of German industry should be improved, and German steel production should be increased to 10 to 12 million tons per year as soon as possible. After the German central agencies are established and the order in which Germany fulfills its compensation obligations is determined, the barriers between the regions should be abolished to facilitate the free flow of materials throughout Germany. The Ruhr region is jointly controlled by the four powers. Reform the national financial and monetary system of Germany. Encourage the expansion of German exports to guarantee the import of raw materials and other major items, and to fulfill Germany's obligations to the Allied countries. The Allied Control Council shall formulate measures to take over the industry of German trusts and transfer them to Germany to be nationalized. Democratic parties and free trade unions should assist in the implementation of these measures. The British and American economic merger agreements and related agreements are contrary to the principle of German economic unity and should be declared invalid.

Compensation Plan: The total amount of German compensation is determined to be US$10 billion, including the compensation amount requested by Poland. Compensation items include: (A) all industrial equipment necessary for non-wartime industries; (B) extraction of products at any time; (C) German foreign capital; (D) various services; The removal of western German equipment should be completed by the end of 1948; German compensation obligations should be fulfilled within 20 years, starting from the date of the announcement of the Potsdam Agreement; Restore the activities of the Allied Reparations Committee; Under the condition of ensuring the delivery of compensation materials, the production of German peacetime industries shall not be obstructed.

### Revelation of Dulles-De Gaulle Meeting; May Affect the Future of Europe

[Central News Agency, London, 8th] The London Evening Standard published on its front page today with a large headline, reporting the content of the meeting between Secretary of State's consultant Dulles and De Gaulle in Paris, and said that the meeting "may have a profound impact on the future of Europe." The newspaper said that De Gaulle promised that if he gained power in France, he would be willing to merge the French occupation zone in Germany with the British and American occupation zones into one. But there are three conditions: The United States should agree to form a three-nation military defense alliance with France and Britain; The United States should equip 40 French divisions with the latest weapons; The United States and Britain should agree to international joint management of the Ruhr area to ensure that the factories in the Ruhr will no longer be used by the Germans to launch aggression.

### Situation in Italy Improves; General Strike Order Cancelled

[Reuters, Rome, 8th] The Rome General Confederation of Labor previously announced that it would hold a general strike starting at midnight on the 9th to demand that the government implement public works plans to employ unemployed workers. It is now learned that the government has accepted the request, so the General Confederation of Labor has canceled the strike order.

### Threat of French Labor Unrest Not Eliminated; Government's Final Terms Rejected by Communists; Momentum of Resumption of Work in Various Places Increases Daily

[United Press, Paris, 9th] The negotiations between the French government and the Communist leaders of the General Confederation of Labor to resolve the labor unrest became deadlocked again on the 9th, which greatly reduced the hope of an early resolution of the dispute. Due to the reinforcement of the army and police, the momentum of resumption of work is increasing, and the French government's position has been strengthened and has gained the upper hand, but the Communist labor leaders still insist that workers should be guaranteed increased purchasing power. It is generally observed that the government's proposal is the final condition, but the Communists still refuse to accept it, and the negotiations have therefore stalled.

But some people still believe that the General Confederation of Labor may reconsider this move, because the National Central Strike Committee is considering the government's proposal. Thousands of workers are resuming work, and the Paris subway and civil servants directly refuse to strike. French Labor Minister Mejia said that in various places, work is resuming, and "the Communist majority of the General Confederation of Labor has lost the last chance to save face." At the same time, 10,000 mechanized units are in control of key points in the northern mining area. Marseille is also under government control. The Communist mouthpiece "Humanity" headlined "Labor Struggle, Passionate Mood", and accused the government's actions as "retaliatory."

[United Press, Paris, 8th] 50,000 striking workers in Saint-Etienne, a city in the central French coal mining area, led by the Communist Party, have occupied government buildings and major transportation facilities for two days. On the 8th, a team of Moroccan infantry, supplemented by paratroopers from Vietnam, totaling tens of thousands of people, stormed into the mining area under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, and dispersed the Communist strike leaders. Saint-Etienne was very peaceful on the evening of the 8th.

[Reuters, Paris, 9th] Well-informed sources said that after the heads of the executive department of the National General Confederation of Labor failed to negotiate with Labor Minister Mailer on the 8th to resolve the labor unrest, the government has decided to take more severe actions starting from the 10th to stop the actions of striking workers occupying stations, telegraph bureaus, etc., in order to end the national strike movement that has lasted for more than three weeks. The Central Strike Committee also hastily convened a national conference of representatives to discuss appropriate resistance measures.

### French-Soviet Relations Deteriorate; French Government Abuses Soviet Overseas Chinese in France; Soviet Union Decides to Suspend French-Soviet Trade Agreement Negotiations

[This Newspaper Dispatch] London, 9th Broadcast: According to Moscow Radio news, the Soviet Union has sent a note to the French government, stating that due to the abuse of some Soviet citizens in France by the French government, the Soviet Union has decided to suspend trade agreement negotiations with France. The Soviet Union has decided to cancel the passports originally promised to the 18 members of the French trade delegation. The Soviet note also stated that the French side's claim that two members of the Soviet Citizen Repatriation Committee were engaged in activities detrimental to France was absurd. The Soviet side believes that this action by the French government is obviously hostile to the Soviet Union and violates the spirit of the French-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance. The French side shall be responsible for the consequences arising therefrom in the future. The Soviet government has ordered all members of the Soviet Citizen Repatriation Committee stationed in France to leave France and return home, and has requested the members of the French Citizen Repatriation Committee stationed in the Soviet Union to leave the Chinese-Soviet border.

### Social Scum Should Not Be Tolerated; Shaw Defends Maintaining the Death Penalty

[United Press, London, 9th] The famous writer George Bernard Shaw participated in a national debate on whether to abolish hanging today, writing to The Times of London, advocating "liquidation" for criminals who cannot be reformed into useful law-abiding citizens. It is said that "for the sake of self-defense, civilized countries cannot permanently abolish the public power to execute criminals who are of no benefit to society and are difficult to reform. Those who splash acid on people should be banned with rabid mad dogs, without any leniency. Allowing someone to marry a woman but abandoning her after the money runs out is tantamount to drowning her while she is bathing. That person is a social pest and must be eradicated. As for criminals who can still turn over a new leaf, it is not a problem and should not be discussed. If they can be reformed, then reform them." It is noted that this debate on hanging has been raging for a long time since the government proposed a draft criminal law reform weeks ago. Although the case does not involve the death penalty, some members of Congress are brewing to propose an amendment to abolish hanging. Former Interior Minister Dunbar Walter, who has always advocated retaining the death penalty, has now changed his position, believing that the death penalty is a "barbaric act." At the same time, the famous criminal law scholar Corti Benny also wrote to The Times to defend the death penalty, saying that once it is abolished, it will inevitably lead to countless young people who were accustomed to killing during the war to protect the country committing murder.

### Emergency Foreign Aid Bill: US House of Representatives Postpones Vote; Opposition Amendment to Reduce Aid Rejected

[United Press International, Washington, 9th] The $597 million emergency foreign aid bill, originally scheduled for a House vote on the 9th, may now be delayed until next Monday for a final decision. The Senate has passed the bill in its entirety, but the House Foreign Affairs Committee reduced it to $590 million, stipulating $60 million in aid to China, while France, Italy, and Austria would receive only $530 million.

While President Truman declared that countries must receive aid this winter to avoid collapse, some Republicans and Democrats believe the bill can be further reduced. Supporters of an amendment proposed by Republican Congressman Jonkman of Michigan, reducing the total by $300 million, put it forward as one of the amendments to be voted on today. The opposition displayed unusual strength on the 8th, gathering 111 votes in support of an amendment proposing a total ban on the export of any goods not adequately meeting domestic needs. This amendment failed by a narrow margin of eleven votes in the first vote, and was rejected by 136 to 109 votes in the second vote. Republican Congressman Vorys declared that although the original plan stipulated the shipment of $300 million worth of wheat, wheat is currently in short supply and cannot be shipped to countries in need.

### US Senate Approves Inter-American Mutual Defense Treaty

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] The US Senate today approved the Inter-American Mutual Defense Treaty by a vote of 75 to 1. Senators Vandenberg and Connally both supported the treaty, believing it would address aggression from both internal and external sources. The dissenting vote was cast by Republican Senator Millikin.

### US Army Requests Additional Occupation Funds

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] The US Army today requested an additional $490 million from Congress to supplement occupation expenses. Army Secretary Royal told the Senate Appropriations Committee that due to Britain's inability to cover half of the occupation costs in the British and American zones of Germany, as well as other reasons, it was necessary to request congressional approval for supplementary funds.

### US Should Aid Asia: Former UNRRA Director Speaks

[United Press International, New York, 8th] Former UNRRA Director General Lehman, speaking at the dedication ceremony of the new Asia Institute building here yesterday, stated that the United States should not ignore the significant aspirations of the peoples of Asia. Although internal strife exists in Asia, it remains essentially intact. The aspirations of these nations and their common goals have a direct impact on the future of the United States, far exceeding the US-Soviet issue. The United States must provide large-scale assistance to Asia to promote its progress. Approaching Asia with arrogance, complacency, and ignorance will lead to the failure of all efforts.

### Farley Re-enters US Politics

[United Press, New York, 8th] Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Farley re-entered the political arena on the 8th. Farley declared that he intends to support President Truman's re-election, and that his activities next year would be as a "free worker for education."

### Japanese Diet Adjourns First Session: Over Half a Year; Many Bills Passed

[United Press International, Tokyo, 9th] The first session of the Diet under Japan's new constitutional government adjourned on the 9th, lasting 204 days, the longest Diet session in Japanese history. The most important task of this Diet was to pass legislation implementing the new constitution, such as new civil and criminal codes, establishing equal status for women and men, establishing an unemployment insurance system, eliminating bureaucracy in various agencies, establishing a decentralized police system, establishing a Ministry of Labor, and enacting a new Imperial Household Law placing the imperial family on an equal footing with the people.

### Indo-Dutch Direct Negotiations: Prospects Not Optimistic; Disputes Likely on Agenda

[United Press International, Batavia, 9th] Dutch and Indonesian delegations began direct negotiations today to resolve the conflict in Indonesia. The two delegations, supported by UN agencies, met for one hour on a US Navy transport ship docked in Batavia harbor. US member of the UN Mediation Committee, Graham, stated that the committee's responsibility was to transform the conflict in the Netherlands East Indies into peace. The UN Security Council is concerned about this matter because the extreme tension among the people of the region is sufficient to cause a conflict that threatens world peace. The two sides are scheduled to meet again tomorrow at the same location for talks. Observers predict that the first conflict will arise over whether to discuss political issues or a ceasefire first. The Netherlands advocates discussing a ceasefire first, while Indonesia advocates resolving political issues first.

### Terror Grips Holy Land: Arab-Jewish Conflicts; Military Commander Ambushed and Killed

[United Press International, Jerusalem, 9th] According to British military authorities, in the bloody Arab-Jewish war between Tel Aviv and Haifa, the Jewish Haganah defense forces killed 70 Arabs and wounded about 100, and 12 Jews and 3 British were killed.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 9th] Following a gun battle yesterday between Arabs in the area between Haifa and Tel Aviv, they have now entered Tel Aviv. The atmosphere in Tel Aviv was tense, and emergency signals were sent, urgently summoning the Jewish defense force "Haganah" to the rescue. At the same time, Jewish women and children fled in various vehicles.

[United Press International, Tel Aviv, 8th] The Tel Aviv regional commander of the Jewish Haganah forces, Grobman, was ambushed and killed by Arabs on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road on the 8th.

### San Francisco Designated as Foreign Trade Zone

[United Press International, Washington, 8th] The Federal Trade Zone Administration today decided to approve the application to designate San Francisco as a foreign trade zone. San Francisco's application, which had been pending for nearly ten years, proposes designating Pier 45 of the Port of San Francisco as a foreign trade zone, where all foreign goods could be unloaded and stored without paying customs duties, pending future sale or transshipment. The Zoning Board's resolution is subject to final approval by the Foreign Trade Zone Zoning Board, composed of the Secretaries of Commerce, Treasury, and the Army. Currently, there are only two foreign trade zones in the United States, one on Staten Island, New York, and the other in New Orleans.

### Striving for the Liberation of Palestine: Arab Headquarters Established; Cairo Conference Discusses Implementation

[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] It is reported that the "Arab General Command for the Liberation of Palestine" has been established in Lebanon.

[Reuters, Damascus, 8th] Local officials here declared on the 8th that the Arab government governing all of Palestine has been formed within Lebanon to direct future military operations by Palestinian Arabs and foreign volunteers. Once the British authorities withdraw from Palestine, this government will lead troops into Palestine.

[United Press International, Cairo, 9th] The Arab League announced tonight that member states are taking emergency measures, using military and other actions, to prevent the establishment of an independent Jewish state in Palestine. The former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, arrived here today from Lebanon and also issued a statement to the press, saying, "When guns are firing, everything else must be silent." After holding a meeting here, the representatives of the seven Arab League member states – Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen – issued a communique stating, "The leaders and representatives of the Arab nations met tonight and adopted immediate implementation measures for the resolutions of the previous session of the Arab League Council in Lebanon." The Council has drafted a plan for military action to defend the borders of Palestine and promised weapons, money, and other assistance to the Arabs of Palestine. This session was held in secret at the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. When a reporter asked the Lebanese Prime Minister, as he entered the room, what steps the Arab governments would take if the United Nations sent an international security force to Palestine to implement the partition plan, he replied, "Do not raise new questions for us."

[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, is participating in the League Council in Cairo. After the meeting, he will return to Lebanon to oversee the implementation of the resolutions. Egyptian King Farouk will summon Husseini during his stay in Cairo. Responsible observers say that the current League Council meeting is the most significant turning point in modern Arab world history, its major principle being action rather than empty words. Normal security measures were taken during the opening of the meeting, unlike previous Council meetings. Resolutions from the meeting are not expected to be announced, but a declaration may be issued afterward, emphasizing the unity of the League countries and their opposition to partition.

[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] The Egyptian Senate unanimously resolved on the 8th to request the government to cooperate with other Arab governments and foreign governments that oppose the partition of Palestine, using all possible means to prevent the implementation of the partition plan. According to a member of the Palestine Liberation Committee, the first batch of Arab volunteers are already in Palestine, awaiting orders from the Arab League Council.

[United Press International, London, 9th] Government committees stated today that Britain, in view of the increasing military opposition from Arabs to the partition of Palestine, is considering stopping the shipment of weapons and ammunition to some countries in the Middle East.

### Major Corruption Scandal Involving Collusion Between Officials and Merchants; Customs Bribery Case Announced; Extreme Cunning in Giving and Receiving Bribes; Over Ten Million Yuan in Smuggled Materials; Thirteen Defendants, Along With Stolen Goods and Evidence, Escorted to the Capital for Trial

[Report from our Newspaper] The major corruption scandal involving collusion between officials and merchants at the Jianghai Customs, after being investigated by Director Li of the Ministry of National Defense in Shanghai, together with the Songhu Garrison Command, has led to the arrest of the main culprits: Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Binhui, all assistants at the Jianghai Customs; as well as Zhang Yuan, Yang Shude, and Chen Lianggang, who previously worked at the Customs; and intermediaries Mei Futang, Zhang Gaozhen, Shen Yanlu, and Fang Maolin; and associates Mao Fengxiang, Jiang Baoliang, and Mao Runxiang, totaling thirteen individuals. They have been successively apprehended and interrogated separately. They confessed to using their Customs authority to extort property, which has been verified. Six major corruption cases have been investigated and confirmed. All defendants, along with documents, stolen goods, and evidence, have been ordered to be escorted to the capital for trial. Yesterday, the Garrison Command released the following summary of the case: Yi Feng Trading Company's White Iron Case: Lu Genji Construction Company ordered 400 tons of white iron sheet from Yi Feng Trading Company. After the goods were shipped to Shanghai, when Mao Fengxiang, the general manager of Yi Feng Trading Company, was handling the customs declaration and tax payment procedures, the Customs officials demanded a 15% commission, equivalent to US$13,360, otherwise they would refuse to issue a customs permit. Mao Fengxiang informed Lu Genji, who was forced to pay the full amount to get the tax paid and take delivery of the goods. At the beginning of the investigation, Yan Pan and Lu Genquan only knew that the Customs was demanding money, and that Mao Fengxiang and others were responsible for relaying the demands. All payments were transferred by Mao and others. Lu Genquan, the general manager of Lu Genji Construction Company, repeatedly requested to meet with the Customs officials, but Mao and others consistently refused. Therefore, there is little doubt that this case was a conspiracy between Mao and others and the Customs officials. After detaining and interrogating Mao Fengxiang and others, they claimed that they had not met with any Customs officials, but had entrusted Fang Maolin, an employee of Mao Tai Foreign Firm, to handle the customs declaration and tax payment procedures. When Fang Maolin was brought in for questioning, he claimed that he had entrusted Shen Yanlu, a colleague at the firm who also ran the Fuhe Customs Brokerage, to handle the matter. When Shen was brought in, he claimed that he had entrusted Zhang Gaozhen of Tianxing Transportation Company. After Zhang Gaozhen was detained and interrogated, he claimed that he had partnered with Qiu Jiazhen and Guo Ziming to approach Mei Futang of Fuchang Import and Export Company to deal with the Customs, and did not know who on the Customs side was demanding the money. At this point, the case had gone through six intermediaries, and the main culprits still could not be found, making the details of the case bizarre and unexpected. The Garrison Command apprehended Mei Futang, who then confessed to the name of Yue Xinmin, an assistant at the Customs. However, after Yue Xinmin was apprehended, he claimed that because he was inside the Customs, it was inconvenient for him to contact directly, so he entrusted Zhang Yuan, who had a close relationship with the Customs, to handle the matter. He adamantly claimed that he did not know who was demanding the bribe money or who it was being paid to. After many attempts, searching day and night, Zhang Yuan was finally apprehended, and he confessed to the most important culprits: Yin Lansun, the director of the Input Permit Verification Section of the Jianghai Customs, and his subordinate, Zhang Binhui. After repeatedly questioning and cross-examining the one thousand suspects, it was finally clarified that the intermediaries had all received a share of the bribe money. After the payment was cleared, the customs permit was issued, but Fang Maolin again detained it midway, extorting another 270 million in legal tender from the defendant before handing over the permit and other documents to Mao Fengxiang, who then handed them over to Lu Genji to take delivery of the goods. Mao Fengxiang and Jiang Baoliang then intercepted a total of 30 tons of white iron sheet, claiming it as their reward for running errands. The details of this case are extremely complex. Each intermediary was unable to meet with the other party, making progress very difficult. Fortunately, the relevant agencies worked closely together, and the investigation and actions were coordinated flexibly, pursuing the case rigorously at every step, and the entire case was finally brought to light.

Li Fengyong Trading Company's Aniline Oil Case: Li Fengyong Dye Company had 100 tons of aniline oil shipped to Shanghai in batches. The company feared that the Customs would cause difficulties, delaying the issuance of customs permits and preventing them from taking delivery of the goods, which would cause capital stagnation and increase interest charges. Moreover, the quantity of goods did not match the quantity stated in the import permit. Therefore, they entrusted Yang Shude to approach Zhang Yuan, who in turn approached Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Binhui, and others at the Customs, and sent them a total of 200 million in legal tender. The customs permit for the aniline oil was eventually issued in advance.

Li Fengyong Dye Case: Li Fengyong Trading Company also had several batches of dyes imported, but because their original import permits were inaccurate, or they had no import permits at all, or they used the permits of other firms fraudulently, the company entrusted Yang Shude to approach Zhang Yuan, who in turn approached Yin Lansun and others, sending them 150 million in legal tender. All the dyes were then allowed to be taken away.

Minfu Company's Dye and Caustic Soda Case: Minfu Company shipped 605 barrels of caustic soda and 60 tons of dyes and industrial raw materials to Shanghai, but they fraudulently used the import permit of Jinshan Company. The permit only covered dyes and did not include caustic soda, so the goods could not be imported. Chen Lianggang entrusted Zhang Yuan to approach Yin Lansun and others at the Jianghai Customs to smooth things over, sending them a total of 800 million in legal tender. They also privately added the item of caustic soda to the import permit, allowing all the goods to be smuggled in.

Tianhe and Dakang Trading Company's Dye Case: Tianhe and Dakang Dye Companies jointly shipped 64 barrels of dyes to Shanghai, but they only had invoices and purchase contracts and no import permits, so the goods could not be imported. Yang Shude approached Zhang Yuan to approach Yin Lansun and others at the Customs, sending them 100 million in legal tender. They then borrowed the import permit of Xinfu Company, replacing the names and fraudulently importing the goods.

Yifeng Company's Wool Case: Yifeng Company shipped 150,000 pounds of wool to Shanghai, but the quantity of goods exceeded the quantity stated on the import permit several times, and the permit had expired, so the goods could not be imported. Yang Shude introduced Shi Yikun, the manager of Yifeng Company, to Zhang Yuan, who approached Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Binhui, and others at the Customs to plead for them. As a result, Shi Yikun sent 300 million in legal tender, and the wool was successfully imported. All of the above cases have been clearly investigated and confirmed. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Binhui, and other assistants at the Jianghai Customs should be separately charged with taking advantage of their positions to extort property, as well as violating their duties and accepting bribes. Zhang Yuan, Yang Shude, Chen Lianggang, Mei Futang, Zhang Gaozhen, Shen Yanlu, Fang Maolin, Mao Fengxiang, Jiang Baoliang, Mao Runxiang, and others all shared a common intent to commit crimes with Yin Lansun and others, participated in the implementation of the acts, and shared in the stolen money and goods, and should be held jointly responsible as principals. The Songhu Garrison Command has escorted all the defendants, along with the documents, stolen goods, and evidence, to the capital for trial. The results of the crimes committed by these officials, such as undermining national economic control policies, disrupting foreign exchange management, and disrupting the balance of imports and exports, are particularly noteworthy. It is expected that this major corruption case, which is not small, will be severely punished by the law of the land.

### Bribe Money Reaches Five Billion

According to a responsible person in charge of the case of Jianghai Customs officials colluding with merchants in fraudulent activities, the case involves a total of six incidents, with a total value of over 100 billion yuan in fraudulently obtained materials and over 5 billion yuan in bribes. The crimes were committed continuously between June and September of this year. The investigation of the case was extremely: confidential, rapid, and technically sound. Therefore, there was a satisfactory outcome.

### Conscription Next Year: Methods Undecided; Military Service Association Drafts Plan

[Report from our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of conscription in this city, whether to continue adopting the method of enlisting volunteers next year or to collect recruits by lottery, the Ministry of National Defense has not yet decided. The local military administration authorities believe that the implementation of military administration should not stop for a day until the bandit rebellion is quelled. Even if the method of enlisting volunteers is still adopted for military service in this city next year, the quota will not be less than 3,000 men. If the lottery method is adopted, then the examination of eligible young men for exemption from military service in this city has been properly handled and can proceed smoothly.

### Pilots' Strike Not Resolved: Vessels Entering and Leaving Affected; White Russian Pilot Involved in Accident Suspended

[Report from our Newspaper] The White Russian pilot who guided the Da Mei Shipping Company's Loonout ship, which ran aground at the mouth of Wusong a few days ago, has reportedly been suspended from duty by the Customs. In addition to this person, another temporary White Russian pilot employed by the Customs has voluntarily resigned, so there are currently only eight White Russian pilots working. According to people in the shipping industry, the experience of the White Russian pilots is significantly worse than that of the original pilots, so the actual entry and exit of ships has been affected. Recently, several oil tankers with deeper drafts have arrived in Shanghai but have not been allowed to enter the port and are still anchored outside the mouth of Wusong. The shipping industry deeply hopes that the pilots' strike can be resolved, but because the Customs is about to be handed over, it has decided not to allow the original pilots to resume work, which will be delayed until the Navigation Administration takes over in January next year, so a state of transition has now formed.

### Food for Sakhalin Returnees Only Enough to Last Seven Days

[Report from our Newspaper] Because there is still no concrete solution to the future livelihood problems of the overseas Chinese who came to Shanghai from South Sakhalin Island this time, the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office convened a meeting with representatives from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Executive Yuan to discuss relief matters. As a result, a temporary sustenance plan was obtained, with the Ministry of Social Affairs requesting the Executive Yuan to allocate 30 bags of rice (but the actual amount was 28 dan). However, since there are no utensils for preparing food and no cooks, the 28 dan of rice was given to a mess hall to cook on their behalf and to subsidize the rice. In exchange, they got dishes. Based on this calculation, this batch of rice will still only last seven days. The 161 refugees and 15 overseas Chinese who recently returned from Japan are also still residing at the former Naval Headquarters on Huangpu Road. The diet and housing after a week will again be a concern for the authorities.

[Another Report] Upon hearing of the difficulties faced by this group of overseas Chinese, Mr. Siskin, the consul at the US Consulate in this city, specially sent Ms. Ganofu, a representative, to visit them with Wen Songling from the External Affairs Office in Shanghai a few days ago, and generously donated 700,000 yuan in national currency on the spot to assist in relief efforts.

Minister Chen praised the Postal Workers' Union as a model organization in the labor community and praised the soundness of the postal organization, stating: The postal service is a "surface organization," while railways and highways are only long-line organizations. The postal service is comprehensive, reaching every village in the country and serving every person directly. The Postal Workers' Union is the backbone of the postal system. A sound backbone ensures that the branches and leaves will also be lush and contribute greatly to the country and the nation.

Minister Gu said in his speech: The Postal Workers' Union was founded in 1929 and has now officially become the leading national postal workers' organization (previously it had not been formally recognized by the authorities). The Postal Workers' Union accounts for the highest percentage of organized labor in the country. The National Federation of Labor is about to complete the legislative process and may be completed in the spring and summer of next year. Postal workers are progressive laborers and are expected to lead the national labor force in striving for a new, democratic China.

Minister Ma stated: The postal service employs an examination system, so every postal worker has real talent and learning, without anyone padding the numbers. Their knowledge level is higher than that of ordinary laborers, so the Postal Workers' Union organization is also the most sound. It is hoped that in the future, the Postal Workers' Union will expand its work under the Three Principles of the People's labor policy and seek welfare for the country and the nation.

Subsequently, Huo Xixiang, Director of the Directorate General of Posts, Mayor Wu, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, Hunt, Labor Counselor of the British Embassy, Wu Yun Chu, Chairman of the Industrial Association, Sun Yichang, Representative of the National Railway Workers' Union, Cheng Zhuang, Representative of the Seamen's Union, and others gave speeches in succession. Finally, Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the Congress Presidium, gave a reply. The Congress also passed a resolution to send a telegram of respect to the Chairman of the National Government.

### The Heart of Zhejiang

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of this Newspaper

[Jinhua, 4th of this month] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is a major artery of the Southeast. Through it, one can directly reach Guangzhou, Kowloon, and Hong Kong. Through it, one can connect with Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, Liuzhou, and Guiyang in the Southwest. Through it, people and goods from Guangdong, Hunan, Guizhou, and Jiangxi can be transported to Shanghai and Nanjing for exchange. It was built by Chinese engineers using the funds of our own people. However, the flames of Japanese aggression turned the value of this great artery into a fleeting illusion. After the war, it is a daunting task to rebuild the devastated Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.

When we learned of the progress toward the reopening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and when we members of the press were invited to inspect this line, we embarked on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway with a mix of emotions. The train took us out of Hangzhou Station, past the magnificent Qiantang River Bridge, and our hearts were filled with indescribable sadness and joy.

Yiwu Brown Sugar

We were reminded of the locally produced brown sugar, a famous product of eastern Zhejiang. Unfortunately, its production relies solely on squeezing juice from sugarcane and using wooden mortars for refining, a simple and outdated method. As a result, it is gradually being phased out. If we could manufacture it using scientific methods, it could become a major source of export revenue for Zhejiang. According to Mr. Zhu Xianwen, the former Speaker of the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Assembly, the money earned from exporting Yiwu sugar was just enough to cover the cost of cigarettes for the entire county's population. This is astonishing, as it indicates that Yiwu's consumption exceeds its production.

In the train, we had a pleasant conversation with Mr. Zhu Xianwen. He is a renowned veteran lawyer and an old man full of righteousness. He is already seventy-seven years old. He told the reporter that Director Hou of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is a capable and efficient man who demonstrates outstanding talent. He also said that Zhejiang Governor Shen Chengzhang deserves to be called diligent and considerate of the people, and that his spirit of dedication inspires admiration. He further noted that the troops under Director Yu of the Pacification Headquarters are truly cooperating with the people along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The old man seems very satisfied with the current leaders of the political, military, and transportation affairs of Zhejiang-Jiangxi. He concluded by saying: "If something is good, say it is good; otherwise, be honest and say it is not good." I am drawn to his forthright personality and hold the same boundless hope for the future of Zhejiang.

Reconstruction Commemoration

The ceremony commemorating the reconstruction and unveiling of the monument for the reconstruction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was held in Jinhua on the same day. The inscription on the monument, written by Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei, reads: "Hunan and Jiangxi produce rice, and Zhejiang produces ingenuity. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway facilitates trade and is of great importance to the livelihood of the people. After the victory, the reconstruction of this railway faced severe material shortages. Thanks to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for providing 54 locomotives, 599 freight cars, 40,000 tons of steel rails, 563,000 sleepers, 160 spans of steel girders, and approximately 6,000 tons of other equipment, Hangzhou was able to be completed at an early date, laying the foundation for the full line's operation. It is expected that rice and salt will flow freely throughout the southeastern provinces, leading to prosperity. I am overjoyed and hereby inscribe this stone to express our gratitude." As Mr. Jin Shixuan, Counselor of the Ministry of Transportation, stated, the 1,153-kilometer Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is truly a major artery connecting the Southeast with the interior. As Mr. Cleveland, Director of UNRRA, said: "The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is a bond of unity, and I hope that every rail will represent international understanding." As Mr. Hobbins, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), said: "The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will be the main artery of the southeastern railway network." Indeed, the reconstruction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway symbolizes our nation's progress. Therefore, it is no wonder that Director Hou Jiajun is calling on everyone involved in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to contribute their talent and work hard.

Jinhua Ham

Jinhua is also a rice-producing area, and this year's harvest is bountiful, with the rural situation being quite good. As long as the rural situation is good, the ruined houses in the city will not be difficult to rebuild. This is a region famous for ham and tea production. Its affiliated counties, such as Yiwu, Dongyang, and Yongkang, also have similar production. However, the method of making ham has not been improved in recent years, and it still adheres to traditional methods, which should have a significant impact on foreign sales. I once said to Mr. Zhu Xianwen: "Jinhua ham can be made into canned food and sold at home and abroad." Mr. Zhu agreed with this idea, but no one is willing to invest heavily to improve this production profession that benefits the entire people's livelihood.

We strolled through the streets and felt that the people here are indeed much more simple and honest than those in Jiangnan (referring to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou). Ying Shi University is located here, with over nine hundred students. The students are now diligent in their studies and eager to maintain this simple and honest style to do their best to improve production. (Editor's Note: This article is the first part of "A Trip on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway." Due to its late arrival, it is being published today.)

### Wilderness Everywhere, Miasma Permeating: The Homeland of Tropical Bacteria, A Warehouse of Parasitology

[Report from this newspaper, Fuzhou, 5th of this month] The Fourth International Conference on Tropical Diseases, Medicine, and Prevention Research, sponsored by the United States Department of State, is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C., on May 10th of next year to discuss more advanced methods of preventing and treating tropical diseases. Representatives from 60 countries, including China, will attend, and the world's most renowned scientists will contribute their research findings to the conference. International medical experts' emphasis on the sources and pathology of tropical diseases has been a matter of the past ten years, and consequently, tropical pathology has gradually constituted a new science.

In terms of latitudinal position, North Africa, India, Southern Myanmar, and the two Chinese provinces of Fujian and Guangdong can all be classified as tropical disease areas. However, in terms of climate, topography, and the living conditions of the people, Fujian is the most ideal area for studying tropical pathology. Manson Barr, an international expert in tropical diseases, collected many valuable materials in Xiamen and various places in southern and northern Fujian as new specimens for research. He said with emotion that the abundance of tropical disease types in Fujian Province was beyond his expectations.

Overlapping Mountain Ridges, Mosquitoes and Fleas Breeding Everywhere

Fujian straddles both tropical and subtropical zones. The entire territory is covered with overlapping ridges and steep terrain. The coast has southeastern mountains, and the Wuyi Mountains meander along the Fujian-Jiangxi border, with the mountains stretching for more than a hundred miles. The Donggong Mountains extend along the border between eastern Fujian and Zhejiang. The entire territory is mountainous, with dense forests, secluded valleys, and miasma. The wilderness is everywhere, and mosquitoes and fleas breed everywhere. Protozoa and helminths that breed in tropical areas and have the ability to transmit diseases parasitically live on these mosquitoes and fleas, creating a variety of tropical infectious diseases. International experts have called it "a veritable warehouse of parasitology" or "the homeland of bacteria."

Numerous Disease Symptoms Vary Depending on the Time and Place

In the mountainous areas of northern Fujian, streams meander, and the people lack dredging. The stagnant water is turbid, providing mosquitoes with the opportunity to breed. "One-three-day" or "alternate-day" malignant malaria and blackwater fever are very prevalent. Year after year, few people in the counties of northern Fujian are not afflicted with malaria. Elephantiasis, caused by filariasis transmitted by mosquitoes, is also frequently seen in various places in northern Fujian.

In the coastal areas of southeastern Fujian, the terrain is low-lying and the swamps are humid, making it easy to contract leprosy. Guangdong Province has the most leprosy cases, followed by Fujian. Leprosy is contagious, but not as serious as most people imagine.

People in Fuqing County like to eat raw snails, which leads to the prevalence of schistosomiasis, which is quite unique. Fujianese generally like to eat green vegetables, so almost everyone has roundworm disease. Typhus and endemic typhus are quite prevalent in densely populated areas.

There are also seasonal symptoms, such as meningitis, which is more severe in northwestern Fujian in winter. Cholera and plague are more prevalent in the hot summer months, due to unclean food and drink and the excessively hot climate, which allows bacteria to enter the body along with dust. Dysentery is rampant in the autumn. All of the above diseases are very common throughout the province. Other diseases caused by malnutrition, such as "vitamin deficiency" (beriberi), "pellagra," and "scurvy," can also be found in Fujian. The tropical diseases of Fujian can be said to be a grand sight.

Tropical Diseases Are Highly Infectious; Establish Infectious Disease Hospitals

All kinds of tropical diseases are highly infectious, so prevention must be taken seriously. However, the interior of Fujian Province is relatively poor, and the material and cultural living standards of the people are low. In particular, the people do not pay attention to their dwellings and environmental hygiene. They cannot effectively prevent diseases before they occur, nor can they completely eradicate them after they occur. When an epidemic breaks out, it is difficult to contain.

Fuzhou currently has the Provincial Fuzhou Hospital, the United Hospital, and other hospitals that can accommodate patients with infectious diseases. However, the number of beds is limited and the fees are relatively expensive, making them unable to meet the needs of the vast majority of poor people. Therefore, the Fujian Provincial Health Department, the Southeast Anti-Epidemic Office of the Ministry of Health, the Executive Yuan's Fujian Office, and the Fuzhou Municipal Government have jointly established an infectious disease hospital in Xiannan Shangchang in the urban area. This is the only infectious disease hospital in Fujian Province, and therefore, it has a demonstrative or experimental role.

Reporters have visited the hospital's facilities. The hospital exempts all medication costs, surgery fees, and material costs, attracting a large number of patients and establishing a model of a public medical system for social security. Reporters also had detailed discussions with Dr. Lu Songci, the director of the hospital, and Director Zhang Zunxuan about general operations. According to them, the hospital is still in its early stages, and the equipment is not yet ideal. There are no fewer than 300 outpatients every day, and the supply of medicines is still sufficient thanks to the provision of CRRRA. However, the expansion of the hospital site is necessary for business development, but there are no funds. Even the four mobile houses allocated to the hospital by CRRRA have no funds to purchase parts for assembly. After CRRRA closes, the source of medicines will also become a problem.

Striving for Social Trust: The Director Single-Handedly Promotes the Project

The director of the hospital told reporters that even under the most difficult material circumstances, he will continue to support it in order to gain social recognition for this cause. Director Lu is a man with a strong sense of enterprise. The joint establishment of this hospital by the four agencies in Fuzhou was almost entirely the result of his efforts. During the late stage of the Anti-Japanese War, many party and government officials in the southeastern provinces went to Nanping in Fujian to seek medical treatment from Lu. His research papers on trauma and blackwater fever have been highly valued by the international medical community. Last year, during the outbreak of plague in Fuzhou, Lu presided over the treatment and saved many patients. He solemnly told reporters: "We doctors must first save the poor, because their living conditions are difficult and they are more likely to die." The reporter was moved by this. China today does need this kind of doctor with noble medical ethics. (Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu)

[Report from Wujin, 8th of this month] County Magistrate Weng, accompanied by Provincial Inspector Lu Boyu and Secretary Ju Yi, traveled to the Qianhuang District Office by car on the morning of the 7th. He immediately convened all the self-defense forces and more than 300 local people for a speech. Weng and Lu separately elaborated on the significance of mobilization for the suppression of the rebellion and emphasized the importance of clearing out scattered bandits and ensuring public security. They announced on the spot that the communist bandits Yuan Mengxing, Yang Ronglin, Yang Qingshan, and Yang Heshang, who were captured on the 28th of last month, had been interrogated and found to be communists and were ordered to be executed by firing squad. The four criminals were immediately brought out, their identities were verified, and they were tied up and taken to the barren land of Hengtang Bridge for execution. Each criminal was shot and killed, and as the gunfire rang out, the people clapped their hands and cheered.

### A Tragic Change in the Family: Wife Takes Child and Remarries; Husband Sheds Tears in Public Court

[News from Hainan Island, 5th by Airmail from this newspaper] Wu Kunyang, a man from Dutou Village, Qiongxin Township, works as a laborer on the Victory Sailboat. Eight years ago, he married Liu Aifeng and had one son and one daughter, who are now grown up. Last year, due to the difficulty in making a living as a ship worker, he went to Yinggehai in Changjiang County alone to do business, leaving his wife and children at home. Due to high prices, Wu's income was only enough to maintain his own life and he could not support his family. His wife could not bear the hardships of life, so she took her son and daughter and remarried Wu Aqing from Xuwen County. Wu is an agent and has a good monthly income. Wu Kunyang returned home from Changjiang County a few days ago and learned of the situation. He went to Wu Aqing to negotiate and asked him to return his wife. However, Wu Aqing said that Liu Aifeng had been with him since November of last year, and for more than a year, he had taken his son and daughter and spent a lot of money on living expenses for a family of three. He stated that if Wu Kunyang wanted his wife back, he would have to return the living expenses, which would be 700,000 yuan per month from November of last year to November of this year. Wu Kunyang filed a complaint with the police station and summoned Wu Aqing and Liu Aifeng for questioning. The two parties confronted each other. Wu Kunyang was willing to take back the spilled water and take his children home for reunion. However, Liu Aifeng said that Wu Kunyang did not care about the lives of his wife and children and it was difficult to live together again. Kunyang could not force her, so they divorced and took their children home. When the husband and wife and mother and children separated, they looked at each other and wept, which was heartbreaking.

Broadcast Topics

(A) Enrich Broadcast Topics: The broadcast topics do not have to be limited to education subjects. All kinds of practical issues in politics, economics, and society, as well as new knowledge in science, new teaching materials in history and geography, and new discoveries in art, can be used as broadcast topics to increase audience interest and enable them to have a better understanding of the knowledge necessary for real life. The broadcast topics are divided into nine major categories: Education Lectures, including various education theories and practical issues, as well as children's knowledge, youth self-cultivation, and vocational training education subjects. Science Lectures, including basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and astronomy, and the introduction of new inventions. Political Lectures, including civic training, constitutional common sense, and various practical issues in politics. Economic Lectures, including national economy, industrial economy, rural economy, and other realistic issues. Social Lectures, including family problems, population problems, women's problems, poverty problems, crime problems, and social phenomena. History and Geography Lectures, including meaningful topics such as the history of the Chinese nation, the history of Chinese diplomacy, the history of revival, Chinese natural geography, economic geography, and humanistic geography. Health Lectures, including basic knowledge of public health, personal hygiene, and various physical activity subjects. Art Lectures, including the theory of music, drama, fine arts, manual labor, and teaching materials on art. Current Affairs Lectures, including current domestic situation, international trends, and descriptions of various realistic issues. The selection of topics for various lectures should be practical and interesting.

Lecture System

(B) Compile Lecture System: Currently, Asia-America Radio Station broadcasts three times a week (Tuesdays and Fridays from 5:00 PM to 5:20 PM). According to the results of negotiations, Shanghai Broadcasting Station broadcasts twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8:00 PM to 8:20 PM), for a total of five times a week. Counting 52 weeks in a year, there will be a total of 260 broadcasts. Except for Shanghai Radio Station, which broadcasts education news every Tuesday, the remaining nine types of lectures will be systematically arranged. Each lecture will have several special topics, listed in order. Each special topic will be divided into several consecutive broadcasts according to its content, so that the audience can get a systematic concept. If the material is simple, it will be broadcast once.

Expert Lecturers

(C) Expert Lecturers: For special topics of each lecture, academic experts from the city, professors from various universities, and the responsible directors of each department of the Bureau will be employed to speak on various practical issues related to education.

### Qingbai Basketball Team Established, Famous Players Gather, Zhou Zhi in Charge of Planning

Since its reorganization, the Qingbai Sports Association has been actively moving forward under the leadership of Commander Xuan. In addition to participating in the league in the soccer division, the basketball team was officially established yesterday and has already registered for the current League A competition. The roster includes Cai Yanxiong (captain), Bao Songyuan, Wang Nanzhen, Xu Heng, [blank] Yaoyao, Tang [blank] Kun, Zhou Da [blank], Chen Xianglong, [blank] Guorong, Zhang Shao [blank], etc., all of whom are veterans who were once famous and influential. Their strength is quite strong. They have been practicing in the Xiqing or Haiqing Gymnasium every night for nearly half a month. It is also learned that there are still three generals who may also serve for the team, which will make their combat power even more abundant. The team is currently managed by Zhou Zhi, who is responsible for the planning, and he is also independently planning and controlling the team's formation. Mr. Zhou talked about basing it on Commander Xuan's training of discovering the second generation of new talents and the plan that every famous general must be responsible for training a new player. The establishment of the Qingbai basketball team this time can be said to be a demonstration of this, so the selection of players is also focused on technical experience, so that they can be the mentors of the second generation. Therefore, the Qingbai basketball team has absolutely no ambition for the current League A championship and holds the belief that victory is of course gratifying, but defeat is also harmless.

### Summary of New Basketball Rules for 1947-48 (1) Announced by the Sports Association Basketball Committee

The Municipal Sports Association Basketball Committee has decided to adopt the new American basketball rules for 1947-48 for this league to meet the needs. Zhou Jiaqi, the original translator of the rules, has been invited to translate and publish the new rules and changes for reference in the competition. It is reported that the new rule book will be printed after it is sorted out.

(Note) Items with the letter A below are the text of the new rules.

Chapter 1, Article 2, adds a dotted line regulation inside the boundary line of the court (in the old rules, it was a note in Chapter 7 and not the text of the rules). The wording of this article has been re-edited, but the original meaning has not been changed. The full text is as follows:

The perimeter of the court should be bounded by clear white lines. The long lines on both sides are called sideline, and the short lines at both ends are called the end line. The line width should be at least two inches, and at least three feet wide of unobstructed space should be left outside the line (ten feet wide is best). If the court cannot leave a space of three feet wide, a dotted line should be drawn parallel to the line three feet inside the boundary line. When throwing the ball out of bounds, this dotted line should be used as the boundary line of the side or the end as described in Article 7 of Chapter 6 and Article 1 of Chapter 7 (referring to before the [ball] crosses the line).

Chapter 1, Article 4 shortens, and the old rule that the court is less than seventy-five feet is changed to seventy-four feet. The full text is as follows:

Extend the diagonal line of the center circle to intersect the two sidelines to divide the court into two areas. This line is called the "dividing line." If the length of the court is less than seventy-four feet, each area should use two parallel lines 40 feet from the farther end line as the dividing line.

Chapter 1, Article 7 adds the equipment of a transparent shield, and the regulations are as follows:

Transparent shields are suitable for courts with spectator seats outside the end line.

Using the basket as the center, use a two-foot-wide colored line to draw a rectangular area on each shield, the area of the rectangular area is 18 inches high and 24 inches wide (including the width of the speed line), the top of its bottom line should be level with the basket surface.

A border line of at least three inches wide should be painted around the shield.

Chapter 1, Article 13, the wording has been re-edited as follows

The home team should prepare a basketball that meets the requirements of Article 12 in Chapter 1. If the ball is not suitable, the referee has the responsibility to choose the visiting team's ball for the game.

Chapters 2, Articles 5, 6, and 7, the wording has been re-edited. The provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of the old rules have been incorporated in advance and will no longer be established separately. However, the whole is an adjustment in terms of editing and does not change the original meaning, so it is not listed separately.

### Chairman's Order to the Four Joint Treasury Headquarters, All Loan Payments Temporarily Suspended

[Our Dispatch] It is learned that the national banks in the city have recently received a notice from the Four Joint Treasury Headquarters, which has been forwarded by the Chairman's order, instructing the following three points: The Four Joint Treasury Headquarters will temporarily suspend all loan payments. The remittances from various places to Shanghai should be strictly restricted and checked for their actual account names and the source of funds. All national banks must not arbitrarily open up in their operations for profit. It is learned that the national banks have decided to comply with the instructions immediately after receiving the notice.

Another report says that the Four Joint Treasury Headquarters is scheduled to hold a board meeting on the 11th. In addition to Secretary-General Xu Bo [blank], who has returned to Nanjing by train tonight, Chief Executive Officer Li Shuming of Chenghang, Director Wu Rencang of the Central Trust Bureau, and Deputy Director Diao Minren of the Four Joint Treasury Branch all went to Nanjing last night to attend. It is learned that the meeting will make important decisions on the operations of the national banks for the coming year. The national banks will formulate their business plans for the coming year based on the results of the meeting, with the principle of cooperating with government policies.

There is vigorous speculation outside the market, and Chinese shares closed at high prices.

Yesterday, news of large banknotes became more and more obvious, and the industry outside the market was stimulated fiercely, passively driving up the prices. Although there was a lot of struggle in the middle, the external stimulus caused the industry to continue to work hard, and finally closed at a high price.

At the beginning of the morning, Yongsheng Yarn opened at 378 yuan and 385 yuan. Afterwards, there were slight fluctuations, and the outside market opened at two corners one and two corners and a half, but no one was still buying, and it fell to a low price of 372 yuan and 377 yuan. Before long, the black market outside the market was active, pushing the price up to 388 yuan for immediate delivery and 393 yuan for deferred delivery. The noon close was 385 yuan and 387 yuan. The situation of Xiong shares was more powerful than that of hot shares, and the immediate delivery shares, China-France Match, Tongyi, and Rong[blank] each rose by half a percentage point compared to the previous close. Zhabei, Yonggong, and Xinhua were all flat, and the rest showed a slight increase. Deferred delivery shares all rose slightly.

The after-market rose again to 398 yuan and 400 yuan. Some people closed out at high prices, and the national bank's exchange difference increased significantly, once returning to a small value of 392 yuan and 394 yuan. At this time, the wind was completely in favor of the buyers, and the external stimulation was very strong. It was difficult to find sellers at high prices, and the price was still raised to 404 yuan for immediate delivery and 405 yuan for deferred delivery at the close. The small hot and sub-hot shares rose even more. The after-hours prices were even higher. As a result, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Zhabei, which had previously closed with immediate delivery, each rose by 10%, Yongsheng Yarn, Huaxin, Xinyi, Meiya, Hua [blank] Xin Guang, China-France, Yonggong Match, Hua [blank] China Silk, and Tongyi each rose by 5%, and the rest rose slightly. Jingfu, which had previously closed with deferred delivery, rose by 10%, and the rest all rose slightly. Outside the market, the old shares and the new shares were still firm. Some people bought less and sold. The rest showed slight fluctuations.

### Sharp Rise in Foreign Stocks, Government Bonds See Both Glory and Dishonor

Foreign stocks soared yesterday, with the market expected to be even more heated in the future. Stimulated by the Hong Kong exchange rate and off-market trading, buying interest was exceptionally strong. Ewo Cotton opened at $363,000, and American Union at $490,000, gradually rising to peak closing prices of $395,000 and $550,000, respectively. Rubber stocks were even more sought after, with foreign firms finding them difficult to acquire. Securities firms and gold shops were all buyers. As a result, compared to the previous close, British American Tobacco and Llangollen both rose by 20%, Jardine Rubber rose by 15%, and Ewo Cotton, Canton Paper, Ewo Brewery, China Merchants Steam Navigation, British-China Corporation, and Wah Hsing Ironworks each improved by 10%. Most other stocks rose by 5%.

Government bonds experienced both glory and dishonor yesterday, with trading remaining extremely sluggish. Unified Bond C opened at $24,800, with a low of only $24,500, rebounding to hover around $25,200, with a turnover of no more than 2 million. Rooms 360 to 552 saw entries, while rooms 500 and 555 saw exits. As a result, compared to the previous close, Bonds A, B, and E each fell by $200, Bond C rose by $600, and Bond D rose by $100.

### Rice Market Prices Rising

Yesterday, the northern and southern markets together received over 25,600 shih of rice. Domestic prices were firm, and sentiment was positive. Shops were active, and trading was lively. Market conditions continued to rise. White japonica and indica rice both saw gradual increases of $20,000 to $30,000. Early thin rice continued to rise by $30,000, and white glutinous rice advanced by over $10,000. Flour saw active demand, soaring by over $10,000 and breaking through the 300,000 mark. Bran sellers were firm, with gradual increases of $3,000 to $5,000.

Soybean cake from Swatow and Taiwan continued to be in demand and sold briskly, rising another $3,000 to $5,000, reaching the 200,000 mark. Actual sales of soybeans were slow and weak, with prices initially firm but then declining, showing little improvement. Black soybeans from Southeast Asia showed some activity and gradually recovered, rising by $10,000. Red bean trading was sluggish, falling another $10,000 to $20,000, with very limited sales. Cowpeas saw little trading, remaining weak and inactive.

Dumb beans lacked trading. Red sorghum from the north was targeted, rising another $10,000. Corn from the northern ports saw increased demand, rebounding by $20,000 to $30,000. Raw peanuts from Guangdong saw strong sales, with supply and demand balanced, rising another $20,000 to $30,000. Sesame sales were stagnant, falling by $20,000.

The market for cooking oil strengthened, with all oils rising uniformly. Raw soybean oil rose by $30,000 to $40,000, and clear oil and rapeseed oil also increased by $20,000 to $30,000.

### Although Banks Have Discrepancies, Money Supply Does Not Appear Tight

[Reported by this newspaper] Although various banks had discrepancies yesterday, the money supply was not tight. The four major banks and two bureaus had an inflow of 75.6 billion, the Central Bank had an inflow of 45.9 billion, the general clearing house had an inflow of 17.2 billion, foreign banks had an inflow of 52.3 billion, the small clearing house had an outflow of 145.1 billion, the Bank of China had an inflow of 50.3 billion, the Bank of Communications had an outflow of 24.4 billion, and the Postal Remittances and Savings Bank had an outflow of 21.2 billion.

### All Four Installments of Allotments Open Simultaneously, Rayon Prices Plunge

The Central Trust of China (CTC) is distributing rayon to the silk weaving industry, with all four installments being distributed simultaneously. The deadline for payment is today. The allotment price for all four installments of 1A Asahi brand rayon is $73.025 million, so the black market price plummeted again yesterday. Asahi brand rayon was $93 million in the morning, falling as low as $1.5 million at one point in the afternoon, before finally closing at $2 million, $2 million lower than the previous day. The price of 4A Asahi brand rayon was around $84 million, and the asking price for 1A futures was $88 million.

Yesterday, factory-owned materials rose slightly. The market price for each grade was about $1 million higher than the previous day. C-grade five-dan materials were quoted at $8 million, but there were no transactions. High-grade materials were offered at $86.5 million. Mid-grade materials were around $4 million, and ordinary materials were transacted at $3 million. Spot goods from Fuhua five-dan materials were transacted at $5 million. Dried materials also rose, with special grade materials reaching around $70 million.

Yesterday, the silk market saw pure silk quilt covers rise exclusively. Huaqiang goods were relatively stable before the market opened, with transactions at $1.3 million to $1.4 million, but rose sharply after the market opened due to positive sentiment and strong demand, rising step by step until the closing price of $2.65 million, $1.3 million higher than the previous day. Dacheng goods were more than $100,000 higher than Huaqiang. Other pure silk and rayon silk goods also showed firmness.

### Traditional Chinese Medicine Slightly More Active

The market for medicinal materials has been sluggish for a long time, but it finally showed slight activity yesterday. The Sichuan and Hubei trading groups reported that prices in the producing areas were higher than those in Shanghai, making it difficult for Hakka buyers to profit. Coupled with the continuous increase in foreign exchange rates, there were even fewer goods arriving, and sentiment was uniformly bullish. The market saw active sales. Rhubarb is now subject to unified control in the producing areas, making it difficult for Hakka buyers to purchase. Arrivals are scarce, and inventories are dwindling, so prices are extremely firm. Cordyceps sinensis (caterpillar fungus), bulk goods, are being sold by the Guangdong trading group, and large-scale purchases have caused the market price to soar, reaching a new high of $800,000. Croton seeds saw smooth sales, but inventories are weak, and the market rose by $26,000, with strong momentum. New tangerine peel netting is expensive, but the market is sluggish, making it difficult to promote sales. Prepared fritillary bulb is moving forward steadily, continuing to climb to a new high of $18,000, with enthusiastic repurchases by wholesalers. Prepared pinellia also followed suit, reaching $24,000. Dragon teeth and dragon bones have been in short supply for a long time, inventories are depleted, and speculative hoarding is rampant, with varying asking prices. Realgar sales are lagging, and prices are unlikely to rise. Eucommia bark remains weak and sluggish, and although it is in season, it remains wilted.

### CTC Continues to Promote Sino-Soviet Barter Trade; 1,000 Bales of Raw Silk Have Begun to Be Packed

[Reported by this newspaper] The barter trade between China and the Soviet Union is constantly progressing. According to the CTC's barter trade office, a contract has been signed with the Soviet Union for 3,000 metric tons of tung oil, of which 2,200 metric tons have already been shipped. In addition, more than 80,000 cases of brick tea have been shipped, with 7,900 cases already delivered. In May, another contract was signed with the Soviet Union for 1,000 bales of raw silk, which is now being packed and is expected to be fully delivered by mid-December.

### Porcelain Industry Raw Materials Exhausted, Representatives Appeal for Relief

The enamelware industry in this city has a history of thirty years, and business was relatively developed in the past. However, since the government implemented foreign exchange controls, the industry, which relies entirely on foreign imports for the steel sheet raw materials it needs, has been unable to obtain substitutes. The foreign exchange quota allocated is only 5% of the actual need, but so far no permit has been obtained, resulting in no imports of steel sheet of any size this year. In addition, the steel sheets ordered by the industry with its own foreign exchange and arrived at the port have been delayed for a long time without resolution. On the one hand, steel sheet inventories are exhausted and will soon be forced to shut down completely. The livelihoods of all the large number of workers and related personnel who depend on this industry will be greatly threatened. To seek urgent remedies, the industry association has already held its 13th joint meeting of directors and supervisors, and has selected five enamelware factories, including Huasheng, to form a rescue steel sheet raw materials subcommittee to be responsible for appealing to the Import Control Committee and other competent authorities for relief.

### National Treasury Receipts and Disbursements Accounting Will Implement New System Starting Next Year

[Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Finance's newly revised national treasury receipts and disbursements accounting system will be implemented starting in January of the 37th year. The main spirit of the system's content is to change the past practice of general treasury inter-bank transfers to a method of district treasury centralized transfers and reporting to the general treasury. The original sub-treasury accounting affairs will continue to be handled as before, but the reporting procedures and the accounting of the price of payment will be slightly changed. Because the time until the implementation of the new system is very short, the Central Bank is preparing in advance for the inter-bank transfer work of the various agent district treasuries. In order to prepare in advance, it has specifically formulated 14 articles of measures based on the principles of the new system, and has already sent them to the various district treasuries for review and implementation.

### To Avoid Market Fluctuations, Textile Construction Provides as Much Supply as Possible

[Reported by this newspaper] The China Textile Construction Corporation (CTCC) sold cloth yesterday as usual, and was later temporarily ordered to increase the supply of cotton yarn to the weaving industry and yarn shops as needed, in order to avoid fluctuations in the yarn market today due to the issuance of the new version of the customs gold unit. Yesterday, a total of 2,249 pieces of yarn were sold, equivalent to 2,718 pieces of 20-count yarn. The number of applications was about half from the weaving industry and half from the yarn shop industry. The sales price for the weaving industry was still calculated at 28.11 million for 20-count yarn, with other proportions calculated proportionally. The sale of yarn to the yarn shop industry was still done by bid. The floor price for 20-count yarn was 30 million, 32-count was 39 million, and 42-count was 48.2 million (all inclusive of tax).

In addition, the company still sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 43,890 bolts of cloth and 220 bedsheets. There were a total of 1,163 applications. Domestic manufacturers had 23 applications, purchasing 3,960 bolts of cloth. Cloth shops had 1,163 applications, purchasing 39,930 bolts of cloth and 230 bedsheets.

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw 42-count Jianfeng fine yarn open at 48.5 million, briefly approaching the 50 million mark. Buying interest in the market was very strong. The CTCC posting accepting applications, coupled with reports of tight money, caused floating accounts to sell off, and the market weakened. In the end, 42-count Lanfeng was 48.7 million, 700,000 higher than the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns all rose by 200,000 to 1 million.

The cotton cloth market was firm, but later, due to the CTCC distribution and ample supply, floating holdings were released. In the end, 13-pound Longtou and other grades of fine cloth rose by 20,000 to 40,000. Bleached cloth and Yuan Zhigong also improved by 60,000 to 24,000. The market for other colored cloth and Shilin cloth was also relatively stable.

### Yarn Merchant Representatives Request Confirmation of Yarn Merchant Status

[Reported by this newspaper] Tang Zhiliang, Chairman of the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Commercial Association, Zhou Jiasheng, Standing Director, Xi Shaoqing, Shen Boqin, and others, on behalf of the industry, visited Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Textile Regulation Committee, yesterday afternoon. Tang and others stated that yarn merchants did not have the status of distributing yarn during the past period of joint yarn allocation. Therefore, they requested that under the current situation of flower and cloth control, the position of yarn merchants should be taken into account, and the status of yarn merchants should be clearly stipulated in the control regulations. Yuan stated that yarn merchants should indeed have a corresponding status, and instructed them to list in detail the circumstances of yarn merchants selling to other ports before and one year after the war, and report them as soon as possible for reference and processing.

### Pan Shihao Explains the Actual Situation of the Weaving Industry

[Reported by this newspaper] Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the nine weaving associations in this city, expressed six opinions on the position of the industry regarding the authorities' implementation of flower and cloth control: The weaving industry has had faith in the government in the past, and the current textile regulation policy is aimed at maintaining cooperation. The general situation of the weaving industry is bleak. The prosperity of factories such as Xinguang is due to special reasons. Most factories are operating at less than half capacity and are maintaining operations at a loss. Where does the profit come from? The current allocation of yarn is insufficient. How to dispose of the cotton yarn that various agencies issue to yarn factories for commissioned spinning has not yet been decided. The weaving industry believes that the textile regulation plan should include the entire production of yarn factories, so that supply and demand can be balanced. The textile regulation policy should be made public, and the weaving industry should have the opportunity to participate in discussions. The scope of cotton management should be expanded. Other ports should also coordinate and handle matters with Shanghai. The industry association will naturally cooperate with government policies, but the association should not only have responsibilities without authority. As for investigation and statistical work, the deadline should be extended.

### Cigarettes Turn Upward in the Afternoon

The cigarette market initially saw rising prices due to continued strong demand from the industry. Around 9 a.m., Wing Tai Wo offered Qianmen brand cigarettes, with a distribution price of 31 million per case (50,000 cigarettes) for 10-cigarette packs and 33 million for 20-cigarette packs. Tightening money caused intentions to weaken, and the market fell. In the afternoon, due to the issuance of large banknotes, the market turned upward again. In the end, both 10-cigarette and 8-cigarette Old Knife cigarettes rose by 300,000, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose more than they fell.

### Foreign Tea Market Firm

Yesterday, the foreign tea market saw limited transactions due to continued negotiations on delivery. As for Keemun black tea, since sellers have been trying to raise prices again, British merchants, although somewhat interested, are reluctant due to the high prices, so the number of transactions has also declined sharply. As for domestic sales tea from Main Street and other places, intentions to purchase have become active, so the situation is still lively.

### Economic Commission Schedules Discussion of Paper Production Increase

[Reported by this newspaper] The National Economic Commission is scheduled to hold a meeting in Nanjing on the 12th of this month to discuss the issue of increasing paper production. The city's Industry and Commerce Guidance Office and the paper industry will send representatives to attend. The paper industry held meetings yesterday and today to gather opinions and formulate plans to provide to the government for reference. According to relevant sources, the biggest difficulty currently facing the paper industry is that too few raw materials are being imported, not meeting actual needs. The import quota for paper pulp in the first quarter of this year was $300,000, and the second quarter was $450,000. The third and fourth quarters are the same. This number is too far from actual needs, so not long ago the paper industry petitioned the Central Bank and the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, requesting that the import quota for paper pulp be increased to $1 million per month and $3 million per year. This data is estimated by experts and is not considered too high. At the upcoming NEC meeting, increasing the import quota for paper pulp will still be the most important issue. In addition, how to obtain national subsidies to improve the production equipment of various paper mills, and how to improve labor efficiency and achieve labor-management cooperation, will all be discussed at the meeting.

### On Literary Appreciation

— Jin Shan

When it comes to literary appreciation, it is easy to associate it with entertainment and relaxation, feeling that this is just a kind of leisurely blessing for the leisured class. Originally, literary appreciation is a kind of enjoyment, and its scope is very broad. Reciting poetry is, reading novels is, watching plays and movies is, humming Peking Opera, singing folk songs, and telling jokes and stories are all examples. Therefore, it can be said that in one's life, there are opportunities for literary appreciation anytime and anywhere, and there can be activities of literary appreciation.

In principle, a person with a normal body and mind has the ability to appreciate literature, just as everyone can appreciate music except for those who suffer from deafness or are mute, and everyone can appreciate painting except for those who suffer from color blindness or are blind. If a person is neither deaf nor blind, they have the opportunity to listen carefully to the recitation of literary works and to watch the performance of literary works. If they also "know a little," they have the opportunity to read the original manuscript or books of literary works. Therefore, literary appreciation can also be said to be the freedom of the human spirit.

A few years ago, the Ministry of Education discussed the teaching objectives of the Chinese language department in universities, one of which was "In terms of appreciation, to be able to appreciate representative works of ancient and modern Chinese literature." This also shows that literary appreciation is not easy and needs to be included in the freshman curriculum and set as a teaching goal.

"Food and sex are human nature." Although the appreciation of beauty is one of the inherent desires of human beings, to truly understand the beauty of a work, to be inspired by the objective discovery of beauty and arouse the subjective feeling of beauty, requires a kind of heartfelt experience. Generally speaking, the higher the content value of a work, the more complex the conditions for appreciation, and the more difficult it is to understand. This is not a question of whether the form is popular or not, but a question of the distance between objective emotion and subjective emotion. That is, whether the thoughts and emotions produced by the author's life experience are the same, similar, or close to those of the reader, listener, or viewer.

If a work already has a historical or fair evaluation and has achieved a superior position in literature, but we cannot understand it after contacting it, or even do not understand its "wonderfulness," it is also a common situation. For example, "King Wen is on high, shining in heaven" in the "Great Odes" of the Book of Songs does not have the tactful emotions and popular appreciation of "When I went away, the willows were weeping" in the "Lesser Odes" or "Her hand is like soft shoots, her skin is like congealed fat..." in the "Airs of the States."

This involves the essential problem of literature. Literature belongs to all mankind, is created by mankind, and is provided for mankind to appreciate. Without human life, there is no literature. However, since the term "literature" had its definition, it has narrowed the scope of appreciation a lot and has also restricted this inherent ability of human beings. Because human beings first limited "literature" to the scope of the art of writing, and on the one hand, completely handed over the talent of literary creation to the so-called men of letters, the men of letters and non-men of letters became two opposing fortresses. Thus, men of letters create literature, and non-men of letters appreciate literature—this is really one mistake after another. In addition, with the changes in materials, the value of some works will also change. There are ancient and modern times, and there are east and west regions. The reality of life is constantly progressing and exchanging, gradually changing from different to similar, and eventually leading to unity. Future literary appreciation may also develop to have no restrictions of ancient and modern times or east and west. However, human culture has only developed to the stage of approaching and similar, and on the one hand, differences still exist, and on the other hand, small differences have gradually formed. The former explains the temporal uniqueness of the times and regions, and the latter explains the generality of human life and reality. It can be known that "King Wen is on high, shining in heaven" is difficult to understand because of its specific relationship, while "Her artful smile dimples, her beautiful eyes glance" is general and everyone understands it. For example, Sinclair's "The Coal King" is proletarian literature of capitalism, and Lao She's "Rickshaw Boy" is close to peasant literature of feudal society, both of which have their own particularities, while Middier's "" is general. Therefore, American readers read "Rickshaw Boy" with curiosity, just as Chinese youth once read "The Coal King" with curiosity! As for "Gone With the Wind," it will naturally be accepted by the general public, and they will not feel obvious barriers of time, region, country, or race.

Originally, the essence of literature is truth, goodness, and beauty, and beauty is especially the center of gravity of this trinity of essence, and there is no distinction between general and specific. However, the differences caused by the changes and distances in human life forms, reflected in creation and affecting appreciation, can indeed be said to be a flaw in human civilization and an unavoidable fact in the current stage. Although to make up for this flaw and move from small differences to great unity still requires the great efforts of human beings to reverse the sky and shrink the earth for hundreds of years in the future, overcoming the difficulties of the transitional era and reducing the barriers to appreciation is something we should strive for.

Therefore, the development of appreciation ability still depends on rich common sense, deep thought, and keen misperception.

Historical novels require historical knowledge. To read foreign works, one must understand a little about the customs and sentiments of foreign societies. To read Li Yu's poems, one must know about the rise and fall of the Southern Tang dynasty in the Five Dynasties period and the author's experience of the country's destruction and the loss of his family. To read Liu Yong's poems, one must understand the romantic life of this scholar and other literati of the Zhu dynasty, who relied on beautiful women and sang and drank lightly. Just as in literature about war, one must understand the geographical situation, the course of battles, and the types of arms and weapons. However, this is common sense, but it is also a condition for appreciation.

Creation is an activity of the soul, and appreciation is a spiritual understanding. Tao Qian's "Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains" is an Eastern-style escapist naturalism. Du Fu's "The country is broken, but the mountains and rivers remain; the city is green with grass and trees," and Lu You's "When the royal army has pacified the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice" are the Confucian ideas of family and country. Tolstoy's "Resurrection" and "War and Peace" contain his religious beliefs, and Romain Rolland's "Jean-Christophe" is full of the spirit of Western humanism. These are all reflections of the author's worldview and ideological beliefs, which require readers to understand with a bit of wisdom and a bit of thought.

It is said that those who are good at distinguishing green can distinguish the color of sounds, and those who are can distinguish the taste, lines, tones of colors. Therefore, those who engage in creation must know the childishness of words and the feelings they express. And appreciators must have a keen sense of language. The form of a work is originally composed of many simple "characters," which are given specific meanings and composed of various different words and phrases. A sense of language is a kind of conscious action that is immediately issued after letting go or hearing these words and phrases. When this conscious action is sensitive, it can immediately obtain a real feeling through association or analogy. For example, Bai Juyi's "The oriole whispers smoothly under the flowers, the gurgling spring flows under the rapids" describes the melancholy of the pipa. Zhu Qi's "Red apricots blossom on the branches, full of spring," with just a light "bustle" word, shows the full spring light in the garden on paper. Another example is Zhang Xian's "Floating duckweed breaks apart, revealing the mountain shadows; when the small boat returns, you can hear the sound of grass," after reading it, the quiet scene of the lake and mountains and the small boat swaying are in front of you. This is also the sound and color of words, and the level of the writer's skill is also divided in this kind of place. ——In terms of appreciation, this kind of language sense is an imaginative or associative action in consciousness.

People's thoughts and opinions on things in the world are always seeking correctness and rationality, but under the control of utilitarian thought, worldly customs often lead people to a selfish dead end without realizing it. Thus society seems cruel, and life becomes miserable. This is of course because the reasonable is too reasonable and the correct is too correct. To investigate the reason, especially in the neglect of beauty, Nietzsche said: "The two spirits that make up the art world are drunkenness and dreams." Drunkenness is hazy, and dreams are ingenious. May I ask, under worldliness, everyone has forgotten the concept of beauty, what haze is there! In the midst of customs, human nature has lost its taste for beauty, so how can there be ingenuity? It is appropriate that young people who have not lost their childlike innocence feel irritability, ugliness, old age, and death everywhere. There is no light, no heat, no warmth, only piles of rotten garbage are moving, and cold zombies are wriggling. Therefore, the cultivation of the ability to appreciate beauty has to be sought in this entity of childish innocence. It abandons the prejudices of adult society, neither gains nor loses, is a bit smarter, and has no obstacles in its heart. It is the realm of "being able to be still after being determined" in the Great Learning, it is "nothing," it is "emptiness," and through the effort of "being able to deliberate after being still," through literary appreciation, the realm of life is expanded from art, just as seeking truth from science and stopping at goodness from morality, pursuing the harmony of personality and giving play to the glory of life. Reaching the realm of "being able to obtain by deliberation" is "something," it is "fulfillment." Brightness illuminates everywhere, and life is full. What is said here about going from "stillness" to "obtaining," from "emptiness" to "fulfillment," is precisely the two poles in art, which is the entire process of literary appreciation. In short, before appreciation, you will forget the existence of yourself; during appreciation, your spirit has been transformed into the life of the work; after appreciation, the life of the work has enriched your life—that is all.

However, great skill appears clumsy, great wisdom appears foolish, and high-level works often have meaning outside the strings and meaning beyond words. Liu Xie also said, "The mellow are hidden and joyful, and the sharp are full of beauty and joy." And appreciators are inevitably often bound by subjectivity and controlled by prejudices. If they cannot overcome this difficulty, even if they face great masterpieces all day long, it will be like entering a treasure mountain and returning empty-handed.

Appreciation is the reverse of the creative process, and it is also a re-creative activity like criticism. However, appreciation and criticism are completely different in terms of method and result. Appreciation is objective, it is emotional transfer, it is self-satisfaction; criticism is subjective, it is rational measurement, it is guiding others. Appreciation focuses on taste and requires sensitivity; criticism focuses on knowledge and requires fairness. However, the ultimate of appreciation is close to criticism, and the motivation for criticism often starts with appreciation, just as the talent for creation must rely on appreciation to cultivate and criticism to guide. Therefore, appreciation, creation, and criticism are precisely the three inseparable links in the literary undertaking.

### The Literary Path of Today

— Editor

We have always advocated that today's literary path should target reality and suit the current needs: not only to reflect the needs of politics, suppressing armed rebellion; but also to reflect the needs of the people's livelihood, clarifying economic chaos; reflecting the needs of society, rectifying the decline of morality. Faced with a turbulent era, the pens of writers must emit unparalleled passion and strength, shouldering the responsibility of avant-garde warriors. This is the common call of the people today, and it is precisely the goal that this publication is willing to work together with writers across the country to achieve. At the beginning of its establishment, this publication has not yet been able to fully meet its ideals, and still awaits guidance and assistance from the literary community. In the future, it plans to allocate some space to publish works that reflect the needs of reality, as well as general literary theories and creations, hoping to contribute to the construction of modern literature.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

I nodded, indicating that I agreed with Tsurumi's stance, saving him from nagging endlessly about this little thing, like an old woman chanting Buddha: "And then?" I wanted Tsurumi to continue the main text.

"Later," Tsurumi saw that I agreed with his stance, and took a breath, slightly unfurrowed his brow, and relit a cigarette.

Later, in the car, Tsurumi insisted on asking Pingzi: "Why did you come back so quickly?"

At first, Pingzi still used a charming smile as a smokescreen, refusing to explain. Suffering from Tsurumi's endless questioning, as if he regarded this point as a serious problem, Pingzi asked Tsurumi back: "Big brother, why did you come back so quickly too?"

"I took a plane;" Tsurumi honestly said: "But I remember you said at the time that you still had something to do in Dalian, didn't you? But I flew directly, without stopping along the way, how could I fall behind?"

"I also flew directly back to Tokyo." Pingzi lowered her tone, and her voice felt even sweeter; "The monoplane I took took off half an hour earlier than you, and the speed was higher, and I also took a shortcut of ten minutes or so... Besides, as soon as I arrived, I went straight back. You, big brother, do you know that you lingered at the reception station for almost two hours? So..."

"So you've arranged everything?" Tsurumi's words were barbed.

"No," Pingzi shook her head, suddenly slowing down the car, and after feeling a slight jolt in the car body, it returned to its original speed. Although the car's speed changed, Pingzi's words did not stop: "I have other things to do, big brother, I don't have the leisure that you imagine."

"A busy person," Tsurumi satirized: "The Chinese saying is even better—'The capable are often overworked!'"

"But I don't necessarily have to rush back." Pingzi said this sentence, the smile on her face suddenly faded, but she frowned.

"Then, why didn't you come with me all the way!" Tsurumi asked the question, but then felt that the question was a bit boring.

"The biggest reason is still that I'm afraid you'll find me annoying; that's why I asked the supervisor to fly back with two lowly 'peasants'—although it's only a few hours of flight, it's enough for me to endure all the way!" Pingzi's tone became lower and lower; in the lingering sound, there was indeed a hint of complaint.

"Then, aren't you afraid that I'll find your call just now and being in the car with me now annoying?" Tsurumi became a "crude man."

But Pingzi didn't seem to feel the harshness of Tsurumi's words, just shook her head, focusing on driving, while slowly spitting out a few words: "Annoying is one thing, but big brother, the danger to your life is another thing!"

### Continuation of Zhang Chao's "You Meng Ying" with Selected Annotations

— Lü Lianggeng

Introduction

In the late Ming Dynasty, the prose essays of noble families, starting with Mei Gong and Chi Shui, began to be passed down with a spiritual essence, favoring flowery words and small talks, but often containing profound principles, creating a unique realm of the "Sayings" style. Although Mr. Zhang Chao came later, his book "You Meng Ying" has elegant language, exquisite phrasing, and many unique ideas, soaring like the sea water standing upright. It is no exaggeration to praise it as the masterpiece of "Sayings" essays! This summer, during my summer retreat, I often skimmed through a few lines under the green window, feeling that the literary spirit and clear air directly sprayed out from the paper, infecting people's emotions. Regardless of my shallow knowledge, I rashly added more selected annotations; those that could not be fully annotated are still due to laziness and a habit of carelessness! Old annotations are generally omitted here; after careful reading in the future, I will re-annotate them one by one. It has been three years since I stopped writing, and now I am dabbling in literary trivialities again, my hand is stiff and thorny. Although the meeting of the minds is not far from the artistic conception of Mr. Xin Zai; however, my thoughts are blocked in my chest, and I have not been able to convey them in detail. I wonder if a few scribbles can slightly outline the vague contour of his brilliant artistic conception?

People must seek what is timely. Things must seek what is picturesque.

It is appropriate that village peasants, evil women, and corrupt officials cannot enter poetry.

Foul and rubbish cannot enter painting.

Zhuang Zhou dreamed of becoming a butterfly. That was Zhuang Zhou's delight. The butterfly dreamed of becoming Zhuang Zhou. That was the butterfly's misfortune.

I do not quite agree with the view of the latter sentence. It is also the butterfly's good fortune to transform into Zhuang Zhou. Mutual appreciation is the same for both things and people. I once had a couplet: "I hate that I cannot transform into millions of butterflies, contending to land on the heads of beauties like flowers."

The new moon hates its easy sinking. The crescent moon hates its late rising.

Not so! The wind and moon should have waxing and waning, and beauty is seen in defects. A full moon that is always round is also uninteresting!

Butterflies are the incarnation of talented scholars. Flowers are another name for beauties.

If the clear breeze and bright moon are directly the spirits of talented scholars and beauties of all ages gathered together.

All sounds should be heard from afar. Only listening to the qin is appropriate from both near and far.

Not only beautiful sounds should be heard from afar; beautiful sights should also be "viewed from afar." French writer Gide said: "Before beautiful sights, famous flowers, and good scenery, we 'view from afar'!"

Eyes that cannot read are even more blind than blind.

A beauty who is an illiterate is an even greater disappointment. (To be continued)

### Selected Eight-Line Poems by Heine

— Translated by Liao Xiaofan

In the gorgeous May, all the buds are open. In my heart, love is also growing. In the gorgeous May, all the spring birds are singing. I also tell her my love and hope.

Countless charming flowers open from my tears, my sighs become the nightingale's song. If you love me, girl! I give you all the flowers, and every night you will hear the nightingale singing in front of your window.

Let our cheeks be close together, let our tears flow together! Your heart is on my heart, let the fire of our familiarity rise! When our little river of tears flows into that burning fire; when my arms are tight around you! I would rather die for this love.

——Selected from "Lyrical Interlude"

Years come and go, people enter the grave one after another, only love does not disappear, deeply hidden in my heart. I wish to meet you once again, crawling before your skirt and never getting up, repeatedly swearing to you: "Girl, girl, I love you!"

Can your pure white lily fingers kiss me one more time? When they press on my heart, I want to die in silent sobbing. Your bright purple orchid eyes fly around in front of my eyes day and night, I think hard; what does this sweet sky-blue mystery mean?

They love each other passionately, but neither is willing to say it, as if they still harbor hostility, but they are willing to die for love. Finally, they separate, only occasionally meeting in dreams, having long been tortured to death by love, but they don't understand at all.

You are as gentle as a flower, beautiful and pure. I stare at you, and worry steals into my heart. I want to hold your head in my hands, asking God to protect you, forever gentle, beautiful, and pure.

Some people pray to the Virgin, some people pray to Paul and Peter, but I, I only have one prayer, only to you, the red sun! Give me a kiss, give me joy, give me warmth, give me kindness, the most beautiful sun among girls! The most beautiful girl under the sun!

Heine (Heinrick Heine) was an important poet who led the new era literary movement in Germany after the Paris Revolution of 1830. Born on December 13, 1797, he was the son of a Jewish man from Dusselcorf. Also a literary revolutionary warrior, he was full of romantic spirit and passion for freedom. His personality, like Byron's, influenced the entire Europe. Critics believe that since Byron, Europe has not produced works like his. He died in Paris in 1856. This year marks the 150th anniversary of Heine's birth, and this publication has specially selected and translated eight poems to commemorate him.

### Li He'er

— Ji Yong

I don't know why Meng Yuanlao's "Tokyo Dream Record" didn't record Li He'er. Perhaps it was just like the old capital's "Muke Village" and "Roasted Meat Wan," not worthy of "collecting the world's rare and exotic treasures, all returned to the market for trading; all the strange tastes of the world are in the kitchen"? However, Mr. Meng clearly said: "In the second year of Jingkang Bingwu, I left the capital and came south, avoiding the land of Jiangzuo, my emotions were lonely, and I gradually entered the sunset years. I secretly thought of the customs and elegance of the past, the harmony and beauty of human relationships, but only became regret!" It is a bit regrettable to leave out Li He'er in a memoir written with such emotions.

Our remembrance of Li He'er is not in that "Tianjin Liangxiang Chestnut," but in a few words recorded by Old Xue'an:

"Li He, in the old capital, was famous in all directions for his chestnuts. Others tried every means to imitate him, but they could never match him. During the Shaoxing period, Chen Fugong and Qian Shang (Kai) were envoys to the Jin court, and when they arrived in Yanshan, two people suddenly came ten miles to offer chestnuts. Each of the three envoys received a mile, and they praised themselves, saying, 'I am Li He'er,' and left in tears."

These four words "I am Li He'er" carry a lot of weight. I feel that they are at least worth more than Old Xue'an's poem "The surviving people endured death and hoped for restoration, and tears dripped in several places tonight." What's strange is that he didn't record the reactions of the two special envoys, and even if I checked the Song History Benfu or the like, of course, it wouldn't record the matter of meeting Li He, who sold chestnuts, on the road, so I spared myself the effort. However, we know that at this time, Gaozong had surrendered to the Jurchens, and the memorial clearly stated: "Your servant Gouyan,... having received grace, allowing me to be a vassal state, my descendants will abide by the duties of a subject from generation to generation, sending envoys to congratulate on the emperor's birthday and New Year's without interruption." Chen and Qian, the two gentlemen, probably didn't have any "glorious mission." If Li He'er and the general surviving people knew this, wouldn't they be even more desolate?

I love books that record local customs and human feelings, but such writing is rare. Although Zhen Jun recorded the major events of the Western Tour after the庚子 Rebellion (included in the Jia Ye Tang series), "Tian Chi Occasional News" does not have such good articles. Liu Tongren's "Di Jing Jing Wu Lue" has some of this kind of writing, but the versions after Chongzhen have all had the plates gouged out, making it more and more confusing to read. Sun Tuigu's "Chun Ming Meng Yu Lu" seems to should have this kind of emotion, but he was single-mindedly trying to become an official of the Aisin Gioro, so he was afraid that the literary inquisition would fall on his head. Apart from recording the grand court congratulations and the facts of Tingzhang's removal of the palace, he didn't dare to say anything. I really feel ashamed for him. Big facts have nothing to do with the common people. The Chinese have never cared about court rules and national customs—because caring is also useless—instead, they pay attention to the price of a pound of flour and where to eat cheap and delicious snacks, etc. In this regard, I cannot but suggest that the wise and accomplished people who compile "×× Grand View" and the like should pay attention to this.

### On Jews

— Jing Wen

If someone gives you the nickname "Jew," you will be unhappy. Because the three words "Jew" have now simply become a collective synonym for stinginess and selfishness.

But this matter should be viewed from multiple perspectives.

One day, while I was waiting for a public bus in front of a cigarette and paper shop, I saw a foreign man dressed in shabby clothes (I couldn't determine if he was Jewish) coming to buy two packs of matches. He took them, opened them, and saw that they were not full, so he asked to exchange them. At first, the shop assistant refused, and the two argued for a long time. In the end, the proprietress came out to mediate and gave him the exchange. But the shop assistant cursed him in front of him, "Jewish devil."

To haggle over buying two packs of matches may seem too "shrewd" to some people, truly showing the so-called "Jewish style."

But if you think about it carefully, the foreign man was not wrong at all, because what he asked for was only his due rights. The fact that the matches were not full is a fact, and his insistence on exchanging them is naturally his right as a customer. If this is also a "Jewish style," then it is not only not a curse, but perhaps a virtue worth learning.

A person who can thoroughly advocate for legitimate rights must also be a person who can fulfill his due obligations. Of course, there are no shortage of selfish, mean, and stingy people among Jews, but is this limited to Jews? There is no such thing as a "lower race" in the world, and Jews are certainly not of this kind. Some people point out that most of the tycoons on Wall Street in the United States are Jews, denouncing them as financial magnates. However, financial magnates are a system problem, not a race problem.

These few words are not out of favoritism towards Jews. Some European countries have persecuted Jews for centuries. The Great Germanism advocated by Nazism even targeted Jews as its victims. However, now Jews have finally gained independence, while Nazism has become a criminal term internationally.

It is said that the reason why Jews are despised and hated by some people is because they are too good at flattery in business, too opportunistic, and have a stingy character. Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice" is about this kind of person.

But how can all this be said to be the "patent" of Jews? Doing business with courtesy is the same for merchants in our Beijing and major cities in Europe and America. Only people here who are used to merchants' "sullen faces" will find it strange. As for "stinginess," there is really no basis for it, because Europeans and Americans have a different understanding of the concept of "almsgiving" than we usually do. The fact that London beggars often appear as match sellers illustrates this point.

In recent years, I often hear abusive words such as "Jewish bums" and "Jewish devils" on the streets, although they mostly come from the mouths of common people, but in international audio-visual terms, it will inevitably damage the image of our nation, right?

### Big Bills

— Xu Jin

The saying about the issuance of large bills has now been confirmed. The end of the year is approaching, and the livelihood is worrying. There are many "year after year is worse" Wang Xiaoer in the world, struggling on the line of starvation all day long. How can this year be safely passed? I have especially composed two folk poems to tell the world.

Issuance of large bills today, firewood, rice, oil and salt are more expensive; worry about making a living Wang Xiaoer, high threshold afraid of the New Year.

Burned out and battered Wang Xiaoer's future, everything is exhausted and poor; year after year is worse, how can Wang Xiaoer survive until tomorrow?

### Zhao Jingshen and He Fanghui

— Lü Baihua

Danzhu is worn out and I don't know tiredness, I am an old teacher of words in the world; The pass is full of soldiers and I worry about the sound of the flute, who in Jiangnan understands the heartbreaking poem!

We know that He Fanghui of the Song Dynasty was "wonderful in the world," and won the beautiful name of He Meizi with the sentence "When the plums are yellow and the rain is pouring," and Shangu presented a poem "Understanding the heartbreaking sentences of Jiangnan, to this day only He Fanghui is there." What excites the poem is the song, and the setting sun and weeping willows are even more moving. Therefore, I compare Zhao Jingshen to He Fanghui today. His research on the study of poetry and song is more interesting than translating. I have heard him sing alone many times. From the moment he stood up, the smiling face under a pair of thick glasses was still the same. I heard that he recently suffered from appendicitis and was hospitalized. Naturally, in this time of armor and sky, who understands the heartbreaking poet of Jiangnan!

### Admonishing the Arrogant Words of the Sanlou

— Ze Shi

Mr. Jingwen listed "The Atlantic" as a high-end magazine in his article "American Magazines." Indeed, indeed, this publication is ninety years old this year, and it is still strong in its old age. The November issue is its ninetieth anniversary issue, with famous writers such as Einstein, Shaw, Maugham, and former Deputy Country Fellow Wells. The thick volume is priced at 72,000 French francs, but I bought it without complaint. Among them, Frederick Lewis Allen's article "On the Growth of American Magazines" describes the evolution of American magazines over the past ninety years, as if counting his family's treasures, and it is also worth reading.

According to Gonglun, there were 600 kinds of magazines in the United States ninety years ago, and now there are more than 6,000. As for the number of sales, in 1857, no magazine had more than half a million readers. Today, there are more than 30 kinds of magazines with sales exceeding one million copies. Among them, there are those with more than 10 million copies, such as "Reader's Digest"; two with more than 8 million copies; two with more than 4 million copies; and four with more than 3 million copies, which would scare the Chinese to death.

The Chinese magazine with the highest sales volume, as far as I know, is the already dead "Life Weekly," which ranks first with more than 100,000 copies, which is not only unprecedented, but also may be the last. Today, among the colorful publications on the market, those with sales of more than 10,000 copies are as rare as phoenix feathers or unicorn horns. Why? Are there too many illiterate people in China? Are Chinese people poor? Is transportation in China inconvenient? Or do Chinese people get headaches from reading magazines?

I don't think so. The Chinese population, excluding illiterate people, is probably not less than the entire population of the United States, and how many Americans can read magazines? I don't believe that Chinese people are poor. If they are really poor, why bother mobilizing the police to persuade people to eat frugal meals and still have little effect? The transportation is inconvenient, the intention is good, but it is not true. Our planes are definitely not flying exclusively for smuggling and drug trafficking.

The number of sales of Chinese magazines is so pitifully small, I think 90% is because Chinese people have no intention of doing this. When ordinary people have no intention of doing something, there is nothing they can do, no matter how little labor or money is required to do it. For example, I have never intended to exercise, so I have never exercised in the past fifty years, although I am not unaware of the benefits of exercise to the body. As for why I have no intention of running a magazine, it must be because there is no profit to be made from reading magazines.

Observing the minds of Chinese people today, most of them only have the thought of getting rich. Not only do poor people want to get rich, but rich people want to get rich even more. If there is profit to be made, I would even become a thief. If there is no wealth to be made, I will not do things that benefit others, and I will not do things that benefit myself. As a result, winter relief is a good deed, saving a life is better than building a seven-level pagoda. In the years before, those who had a little money would be happy to do it, but now it is not the case. Even if they see someone on the street about to freeze or starve to death, and they know that giving them 100,000 yuan can bring them back to life, they will never give it. They will only give it if there is a chance of getting a house afterwards. They would even act this way in order to save a life, let alone looking at black words on white paper.

Therefore, I am preparing to publish a magazine with nothing inside, but the price is 200,000 yuan per copy, but it comes with a lottery ticket that can win a house. It is estimated that the sales volume can reach millions and is named "Get Rich by Reading."

### On "Personal Example"

— Yi Feng

In China's autocratic era of imperial power, the style of rule by people was particularly prevalent. The ancients said: "Changing customs and habits depends on the hearts of one or two people." This is quite correct. Therefore, the spread of social customs also belongs to the top-down, the so-called "what the superiors like, the subordinates will do even more." The so-called "the wind blows and the grass bends" all refer to this and are also based on experience. In this way, the "personal example" of those in power becomes an extremely important and effective thing. If you don't believe it, try to give historical facts as an example: For example, if Goujian did not have the "tasting bitterness" of Goujian's wooden man, inspiring the common hatred of the Yue people, and the ten years of breeding and ten years of teaching, the Wu's hatred could not be recovered. Another example is the Southern Song Dynasty's isolation in Jiangzuo, not only was it unable to restore the Central Plains, but its territory shrank day by day, and it eventually perished. The reason was that the Southern Crossing monarchs and ministers were "indulging in the mountains and lakes, and there were no more tears of Xinting," otherwise, how could the people's morale be so depressed and society so extravagant? Here, there is an even better example——

According to Zhang Gu's "You Xian Gu Chui" of the Tang Dynasty: "Li Shigu was unruly and feared Du Huangshang as Prime Minister, so he did not dare to be disrespectful. He ordered a cadre to send thousands of coins and a car, also worth a thousand. The messenger did not dare to send it immediately, so he waited outside the house for several days. There was Mrs. Xing coming out of the house, accompanied by two maids in green clothes. He asked: Who is it? He said: The Prime Minister's wife. The messenger immediately reported to Shigu. Shigu abandoned his plan and never dared to lose his integrity."

Li Shigu's unruliness was actually subdued by Du Huangshang, and he did not dare to lose his integrity. The reason is very simple, it is the great power generated by Du Huangshang's personal example. Not only was Du strict and upright in his official position, but his wife was also able to show frugality, causing those who wanted to bribe him to retreat and return in despair. This truly conformed to the law that "when the leader is upright, he is obeyed without orders; when the leader is not upright, he is not obeyed even with orders," which is enough to shine for thousands of years and be a warning for future generations to emulate.

Even today, our political style has not completely escaped the track of rule by people. For this principle of "personal example," the leading figures still have to follow it especially. What's more, today, the wind of greed is particularly strong, which is far better than in the past. In addition to improving the treatment of civil servants to make them sufficient to support their families, it is also necessary to rely on the integrity of the leading figures to disinfect and prevent corruption.

### How to Console the Martyred?

— Ying Lai

The Shen Bao of the 8th carried a Hengyang special dispatch, which briefly stated: "General Dai Anlan, who died in the war while on expedition to India and Burma, his wife, Zheng Hexin, transported his coffin back to the country amidst great hardship. It arrived in Hengyang on the 6th. Due to road conditions, not only could the coffin not be transported back to his ancestral home in Anhui, but Mrs. Dai was also without lodging or food in Hengyang..."

The War of Resistance has been over for more than two years, yet the heroic spirits of the martyrs who gave their lives in the war have not yet been laid to rest, and even the families of the martyrs have reached the point where they "have no food or lodging"! Countless soldiers shed their blood to serve the country, is this how the nation shows its gratitude to them?

Some time ago, it seemed that news was seen in the newspapers that General Xie Jinyuan's wife was appealing to all sectors of society to raise funds to establish a school – and then there was no follow-up. The fierce battle of the Eight Hundred Heroes does have a deeper connection with the people of Shanghai. Therefore, Mrs. Xie received considerable support when raising funds; however, that heat was only five minutes, and gradually the "concern" became "indifference," and finally, "indifference" turned into "forgetfulness"!

General Dai Anlan died in battle in , so far away, perhaps many people have never even heard of the term . Then, the concern for Mrs. Dai's situation will probably be even less, even weaker, right?

The world is still far from a peaceful day, and the "Cold War" in the diplomatic arena has long sown the seeds of a new great war. If something happens on the border, can the soldiers avoid "worries about what will happen at home"? Thinking of this, one cannot help but shudder!

A new "all-black" comic book has been published in the United States, with all the drawings and words written by black people, and all the characters in the drawings are

Yin Wen is dead

The eight-phrase crafty Wen Zongyao, with a boil on his back, has died, and his soul has flown to the Conferred Gods Platform. The old-brand great traitor Yin Rugeng was executed at the beginning of this month, and another soul has flown to the Conferred Gods Platform.

Speaking of Old Wen, he was known as the "Northwest Expert," with extremely old qualifications in his official career, and was on the same path as Tang Shaoyi. They had a very deep friendship. During the Guangxu and Xuantong periods of the Qing Dynasty, Old Wen, with Tang's recommendation, served as the Minister Resident in Tibet and was most familiar with the situation in Tibet and the Sichuan border region. When he left office, he submitted a ten-thousand-word memorial to the Qing government, presenting a detailed account of Tibetan affairs and the matters that should be paid attention to externally and internally, and had considerable insights. He indeed possessed considerable talent. Unexpectedly, he became senile in his old age and suddenly participated in the puppet show in his remaining years. Although it is not worth regretting, it is still pitiable.

Speaking of Old Yin, he was known as the "Japan Expert," studied in Japan, and married in Japan. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, my friend Shao Piaoping started the Zhu Shen, and ordered his arrest. He fled to Japan. At that time, Old Yin was a senior staff member at the Chinese Embassy and often provided assistance to Piaoping in his difficult circumstances. After Piaoping returned to China, he praised him highly. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Guo Songling rebelled against Fengtian and attacked Zhang Zuolin, and Old Yin was used as a diplomat to liaise with the Japanese side. After Songling's army was defeated and he died, and Lin Changmin died for the country, Old Yin took refuge in a Japanese home, changed his surname to his wife's, disguised himself, and was protected by the Japanese to escape the encirclement. Therefore, he felt a sense of rebirth from the Japanese side. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Japanese ruffians provoked disturbances in Hebei Province and launched an autonomous movement. Old Yin was then the Administrative Inspector of more than twenty counties in Jidong. As a senior local official appointed by the central government, he was the first to initiate secession from the National Government and advocate autonomy, establishing the so-called "Jidong Anti-Communist Committee," and announced his assumption of the "Chairman" position on November 24. Soon, he also claimed to be an "Autonomous Government," intercepted tax revenues, disrupted transportation, and played many strange tricks.

At that time, people in Peiping hated him to the extreme because he was so close to eastern Peiping. The Jingbao Small Commentary said, "Autonomy? Or governance?" All the newspapers ridiculed and berated him endlessly. Because although the "Manchukuo" was already absurd, it still had the territory of three or four provinces outside the pass, enough for a large puppet show. What was this "government" of twenty-odd counties? Although Qi Xie was making a fuss, he was just a child, a Manchu, and was taken away by Doihara, and the matter was beyond his control. But Old Yin, as a descendant of the Han Chinese nation, an official appointed by the central government, and not a pseudo-official under foreign pressure after the fall, actually happily established a "small court." Isn't he like Shi Jingtang and Liu Yu? His crime is undoubtedly above that of Wang Kemin and others!

There is no way to reason with such monsters using ordinary human logic, so we can only find his origins in the Conferred Gods list.

Jiang Ziya told Yin Jiao to be the "God of the Rotating Year," and there were two sentences in the imperial edict, "Although instigated by Shen Gongbao, it is also your own fault"; now it can be changed to "Although instigated by the Japanese, it is also your own fault." What is particularly wonderful is that the chief deity under Yin Jiao Tai Sui's command, the "Day Traveling God," is "Wen Liang." Yin and Wen were both killed by Jiang Taigong's subordinates in Xiqi and were conferred gods at the same time. Then, Yin Rugeng and Wen Zongyao, one step ahead and the other step behind on their way to heaven, can also be said to have the friendship of "sharing life and death" ( "sharing life and death" is the puppet government's word for pro-Japanese goodwill)?

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Three: On and Off the Stage (10)

Zhu Zhai then asked, "Who colored these photos?" Yun Qing said, "You don't need to worry about it!" Zhu Zhai was rebuffed and dared not say anything more. He put his hands in his pockets and paced back and forth in the room. Yun Qing then called for Auntie Li to serve the meal quickly, saying, "I still have to go out." When Zhu Zhai saw her urging for the meal, he knew that she was still willing to go to the theater with him. Overjoyed, he quickly turned around, walked up to Yun Qing, and said with a smile, "Cousin, how about I cook for you?" Yun Qing shook her head and said, "No need, they've already prepared it." Zhu Zhai said, "I haven't cooked for you in a long time." Yun Qing said, "Now you can cook a few good dishes and treat your cousin-in-law." Zhu Zhai said, "How is she worthy?" Yun Qing smiled slightly and said, "I love to eat the especially good dishes you cook, but I dare not trouble you now." Zhu Zhai said with a smile, "I'll come and make them for you tomorrow." As he spoke, Auntie Li had already come in to invite them to eat.

The two hurriedly finished dinner and rushed to the Kaiming Theater, took their assigned seats, and sat in the middle of the third row. Zhu Zhai looked left and right, encountered many acquaintances, greeted them one by one, and then saw that "Dumu Pass" was being performed on stage. Zhu Zhai usually did not pay attention to this play, but because the old gentleman Yuan Fushan was performing. Although he was nearly sixty years old, he performed extremely seriously, and a few lines of daoban (a type of aria) were desolate and moving, which could not help but make people yearn and listen quietly. Yun Qing paid particular attention to his singing. When this act was over, Yun Qing said to Zhu Zhai, "Mr. Yuan Fushan is so old, yet he performs so diligently, without the slightest懈怠, it's really rare." Zhu Zhai said, "His advantage lies in being able to follow the rules. No matter whether the original words are difficult to sing or not, he will never change the tone or add words to save effort. It's just a pity that his singing at the end inevitably carries a hoarse sound." Yun Qing said, "This is due to age, we can't be too demanding." As the two were talking, Qi Wan's "Peach Blossom Smile" had already come on stage. Zhu Zhai perked up and focused on Qi Wan's figure and singing. Seeing her playing the role of Miss Yao, she was slender, thin, and had beautiful shoulders. The few steps she took on stage were extremely sweet and charming. When Cui Hu came to the door and asked for water to quench his thirst, Qi Wan held a cup of water, half shy, half secretly glancing, looking at each other without speaking, like a young lady from a modest family who had just met a stranger. Zhu Zhai couldn't help but applaud repeatedly. Qi Wan on the stage seemed to have seen Zhu Zhai, and intentionally or unintentionally, her eyes swept towards their seats from time to time. Yun Qing, sitting next to Zhu Zhai, seemed to have noticed something, nudged Zhu Zhai lightly, and said softly, "Don't clap so loudly, look at how her eyes are constantly shooting towards our seats." Zhu Zhai felt very ashamed and dared not answer, only smiled slightly.

At this time, Cui Hu was singing "Walking Horse Jiao..." "Thank you, sister, for your pity in Tongling, offering a cup of water to save my peach blossom, this kindness is unforgettable, I only regret that we have no silk to face each other, when will we meet again?" Yao'er was watching Cui Hu intently. Her elders came, and her expression retreated slightly, perfectly portraying the attitude of a young girl whose heart was just beginning to open, neither close nor distant. Then she sang again: "Meeting seems to be predestined, separation is not unintentional... Who can I tell this longing to?... Why so quick to leave, why so slow to come..." The lines were sad and moving, and the applause from the audience was thunderous. Zhu Zhai was very excited and clapped repeatedly, nudging Yun Qing slightly and saying, "Really good, really good!" But Yun Qing did not respond, instead, she lowered her head, looking gloomy. Zhu Zhai asked her why. She nodded slightly, her mind elsewhere. Zhu Zhai knew that she had other feelings, and dared not say more, still looking up at Qi Wan's movements on the stage. After the first act, to the return of the soul scene, Yao'er lay on the bed, was helped up, slightly opened her beautiful eyes, and sang, wanting a child: "A melody flies to whom and goes,... Are you indeed the scholar Sima Xiangru who quenched my thirst last year?" The subtle and delicate emotions, thread by thread, were revealed, accompanied by melodious music. Zhu Zhai listened intently, almost as if his own soul had been taken away by her.

Yesterday, this newspaper, entrusted by the Joint Committee for the New Year Anti-Tuberculosis Stamp Charity Sale, is selling anti-tuberculosis stamps on behalf of them, and asks readers to jointly promote and actively purchase them. Because tuberculosis is rampant in our country and its harm is very deep, the government and people's organizations are now universally promoting tuberculosis prevention work. In order to respond to this movement, Shanghai, on its own, is organized by the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association and the Shanghai Joint Committee for Tuberculosis Prevention into the "Joint Committee for the New Year Anti-Tuberculosis Stamp Charity Sale," selling New Year's anti-tuberculosis stamps, on the one hand, using the funds obtained from the sale to subsidize tuberculosis prevention work in this city, and at the same time, using this to awaken the attention of the strong people of the society to tuberculosis prevention. This kind of charity has been practiced in Europe and the United States for a long time, and its results are remarkable. In Shanghai, it is held every year by the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, with the assistance of many social figures. This year, it has been expanded and promoted throughout the country. The Anti-Tuberculosis Association is seeking the assistance of the people of the whole country, and it is estimated that 20,000 anti-tuberculosis stamps will be sold in this city, each costing 25,000 yuan, totaling 500 million yuan. This money will be used separately by the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association and the Shanghai Joint Committee for Tuberculosis Prevention to promote tuberculosis prevention education and related work.

(Appendix) The design of the New Year's anti-tuberculosis stamp, in addition to celebrating the New Year and wishing good luck, the red double-barred cross in the upper right corner is the international anti-tuberculosis symbol. In the center of each stamp is a portrait of the late Dr. Hainschdorf, in memory of Dr. Hai's great achievements and sacrifice in tuberculosis prevention. Dr. Hai was the honorary secretary of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association and the director of the Lung Disease Hospital during the war. He unfortunately passed away in the Shanghai concentration camp set up by the Japanese invaders a few weeks before the victory. (The price of the New Year's anti-tuberculosis stamp is 25,000 yuan per large sheet and 1,000 yuan per stamp.)
