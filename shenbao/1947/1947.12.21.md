### Fierce Battles in Northwest Shenyang, Military and Civilians Steadfast, Internal Tranquility, Rumors of General Zuo Yi's Troops Advancing Eastward from Rehe to Provide Assistance

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 20th] The Northeast military and political authorities and the people are all facing the current situation with steadfast and persevering spirits. After Chu Yupu returned to Shenyang on the 19th, he expressed his willingness to resume his post as Chairman of Hebei Province after the war has concluded for a period, and also stated that Shenyang is a strong city with well-equipped soldiers, and success is within reach. Shenyang was clear and sunny on the 20th, with military aircraft roaring and scouting and bombing everywhere. Military police were on high alert, and the city was tranquil. People were carrying on with their livelihoods in peace. Before dawn, sparse artillery fire was heard from the southwest, but it quickly subsided. Small groups of communist bandits scurried near Sujiatun on the evening of the 19th, and rat-catching battles were conducted in the area 15 kilometers south of Shenyang.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 20th] The northwest area of Shenyang is the main battlefield. The bandits are fiercely attacking Xinlitun, a key transportation hub. The bandits are attempting to enter the area from the north, build from the east to the south, and force their way west toward the railway station. On the evening of the 19th, they reached a point of contention for the high railway station. The battle for Heishan and Yixian continues as the National Army tenaciously defends. In the area between Lingyuan, Faku, and Shifo Temple, the National Army seized favorable opportunities, and the bandits did not dare to aggressively attack the south bank of the Liao River. There have been continued troop movements by the bandits in Liaobei. Currently, another 20,000 bandits are fleeing south to the east, west, and south of Kaiyuan, continuing to attack outposts around Kaiyuan. There is also fighting around Tieling. The bandits' Fourth Column in the south launched a fierce attack on Shahe Station, 25 kilometers south of Shenyang, and briefly captured it before being retaken. Both the Shahe and Taizi River railway bridges are being staunchly defended by the National Army and railway police and have not been damaged, but there are scattered bandits causing disturbances in the area south of Sujiatun. The Dashiqiao Station in Yingkou was reportedly captured by the bandits again on the 19th.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 20th] It is rumored that General Zuo Yi's elite troops have departed from Rehe to reinforce the outer defenses of Shenyang. General Zuo is currently in discussions with the Northeast military authorities regarding military cooperation inside and outside the Pass, and his return to Beiping will be delayed. Representatives of the Chahar-Suiyuan Military慰問團, Wang Chehou and Chen Jun, carrying a large amount of慰問品, flew to Shenyang today.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 20th] Beidaihe was attacked by over 600 communist bandits at 8:00 PM on the 18th, and the railway station was also shelled. However, by noon on the 19th, the invading communist bandits had been repelled.

### Zheng Dongguo Pays Respects to the Chairman, Tells Reporters the Bandits are Destined to Fail

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] General Zheng Dongguo has been very busy since arriving in Nanjing on the 19th, working until late at night. On the morning of the 20th, he spent a significant amount of time at the Ministry of National Defense, engaging in extensive discussions with key figures such as Vice Minister Qin Dechun (acting on behalf of the minister), Vice Minister Liu Shiyi, Zheng Jiemin, Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Fei, and Lin Weifang, among others. They also had lunch together to discuss the situation in the north. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, he paid respects to Chairman Chiang, reporting on the military situation and engaging in a two-hour conversation. He also presented a letter from Chen Cheng to the Chairman. The Chairman often provided detailed instructions on military matters in the Northeast. In the evening, General Zheng held further talks with key members of the Ministry of National Defense. According to Zheng's statement to reporters, he will be leaving Nanjing to return to Shenyang within a few days. The communist army's offensive in the Northeast was launched out of fear of being attacked from both inside and outside the Pass by the National Army. Therefore, they first attempted to cut off the Beining Railway. However, the Northeast is cold and freezing, the bandit forces are poorly equipped, lack food, and are weak in strength, so they are destined to fail. Currently, the National Army is firmly defending important locations. General Chen and Generals Luo and Luying are stationed in Shenyang. The morale of the National Army is high, and the bandits' disturbances are not a cause for concern. Furthermore, while General Chen's stomach ailment flares up from time to time, it is not too severe. He continues to personally handle important military and political affairs every day and does not plan to come south for rest and recuperation in the short term.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 20th] A delegation from Jilin arrived in Shenyang on the 19th, requesting that Liang Huasheng return to Jilin as soon as possible before leaving office to reassure the people.

The Pingjinbao Triangle area has entered a period of pacification. The Daqing River is heavily guarded by the National Army to prevent bandits from fleeing north.

### Authorities Order Feng Yuxiang to Return to the Country for Water Conservancy Inspection, Special Envoy Title Revoked, Zhou Yide Calls Feng a "Slippery General"

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] Feng Yuxiang was ordered to go to the United States last year to inspect water conservancy. Recently, as the mission has been completed, the government has ordered him to return to the country by the end of the year and has instructed our embassies and consulates in the United States to verify and relay the message.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Feng Yuxiang, who was appointed to go to the United States to inspect water conservancy, has had his special envoy title revoked by the authorities, and he has been ordered to return to the country. According to informed sources, Feng Yuxiang was sent to the United States on April 27, 1946, with the government generously providing funds and allowing him to bring staff. However, since arriving in the United States, nearly a year has passed, and he has not only neglected his inspection mission and failed to submit a single report, but also, as a government official, made anti-government speeches and actions, issued excessive writings, and formed unauthorized groups, which is absurd and ridiculous and tarnishes his official position. Therefore, the authorities have made the above decision to terminate his inspection mission.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Congressman Zhou Yide called Feng Yuxiang a "slippery general." He stated on the 19th that the Chinese "Christian General" Feng Yuxiang's speeches in the United States attacking the Chinese Nationalist government violate the meaning of American preferential treatment. Zhou Yide told the House that General Feng is cooperating with the Communist Party to undermine the credibility of the current government in the hope of restoring his former power as a warlord in China. General Feng is currently making fierce and disloyal attacks on the Republic of China. General Feng made a speech at a meeting hosted by the American Democratic Far East Policy Committee, an organization that has long been identified as a well-known Communist front organization aimed at carrying out activities to persuade us to abandon China.

### Severe Damage to the Pinghan Railway, Director Xia Guangyu Bitterly Narrates the Communist Bandits' Cruel Methods

[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 20th] Xia Guangyu, Director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, invited reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai in the afternoon of the 20th to bitterly narrate the tragic situation of the Communist bandits' destruction of the railway. According to him, the damaged railway can be divided into three sections: the northern section from Xiaolizhuang (south of Zhengzhou) to Mengmiaocun, with 118 kilometers destroyed; the middle section, 30 kilometers south of Queshan, completely destroyed; and the southern section from Wangjiadian to Huayuan, with 15 kilometers destroyed, totaling 253 kilometers of the entire southern section of the Pinghan Railway destroyed. At least 100 kilometers of this section must be rebuilt. Approximately a dozen military stations were burned, three large railway bridges and a dozen small railway bridges were destroyed, and 140 passenger cars and 160 locomotives were either destroyed or lost. Overall, the Communist bandits' destructive methods were crueler than those of the enemy. The damage between Xuchang and Yancheng was particularly severe, which is infuriating. However, it is gratifying that, as a result of the staff's rescue efforts, over 700 locomotives and freight cars have been transported to the south of Xinyang, and over 24,000 tons of grain have been recovered. Currently, in addition to the Xin-Han section operating as usual, transportation cars can also reach Minggang north of Xinyang. The repairs to other sections will require at least 100 billion yuan, and a request for funds is being sent to the ministry.

[Our Correspondent in Zhengzhou, 19th] Zhengzhou Pinghan Railway is short of coal on both lines. The Zheng-Xin section will temporarily suspend passenger and freight trains from the 18th. The railway bureau is stepping up its efforts to purchase coal and find ways to resume traffic.

### Number of Elected National Assembly Representatives Reported to the General Election Headquarters

Reaches 1,841

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] As of the evening of the 20th, the number of elected National Assembly representatives who have reported to the General Election Headquarters has reached 1,842. According to Zhang Lisheng, chairman of the General Election Headquarters, if the number of representatives reported reaches 2,031, it will be sufficient to reach one-third of the total number of representatives, and a request can be submitted to the National Government to issue an order to convene the National Assembly. The provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, among others, have already reported all elected representatives. A small number of elected representatives from Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have not yet reported.

### Postponement of Shipment of Reparations, Preparations Become More Thorough, Dispatch of Military Police to Japan May Have to Wait Until Next Year

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] According to the person in charge of the Japan Reparations and Returned Materials Supervision Committee, the work of transporting Japanese reparations materials from Japan to our country's ports by ship has long been prepared. The Hai康 was originally scheduled to depart on the 15th and the Hai浙 on the 20th for collection. All parts of the two ships have been thoroughly inspected, and the crew's vaccination work has also been properly completed. Later, a telegram was received from the Acceptance Committee stationed in Japan stating that the marking of the parts' packaging was insufficient, and the two ships were temporarily postponed. The Hai康 was then changed to make a trip to Qingdao, but later another telegram was received from the stationed Acceptance Committee requesting that the Hai康 be sent to Yokosuka for collection. An attempt was made to arrange for the Hai康 to depart for Japan on the 23rd of this month, but then another telegram was received from the Acceptance Committee stationed in Japan on December 17 stating that the Allied Headquarters indicated that there would be fewer Japanese workers during the New Year period, and the transportation efficiency would be too low. It was decided to change the Hai康 to depart for Japan on January 5 next year, with an estimated arrival in Yokosuka on the 10th, and the Hai浙 to leave Shanghai on January 15, with an estimated arrival in Yokosuka on the 21st. The Supervision Committee has now telegraphed back to comply. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and our country's shipping companies are very enthusiastic about undertaking the transportation of Japanese reparations materials and have participated actively. The number of ships prepared to be dispatched is as high as twelve. Originally, the first batch of 9,447 machine tools could be transported back in two months, but due to the above reasons, the time has been slightly extended. The preparations in our country should become more thorough, and the task of undertaking this transportation should become easier to manage.

[News from our publication] Although there have been long-standing contacts with the Allied Headquarters regarding the dispatch of our country's military police to Japan, no formal decision has been made to date, and it may have to wait until January next year to be realized.

### Deadline for Submitting Number of Stable Areas Suffering Losses in the War Against Japan: End of This Month

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The total amount of reparations demanded by our country from Japan has not yet been submitted because the investigation of the extent of our country's losses is very difficult. The number of losses in stable provinces and cities must be submitted by the end of this month, but it is impossible to investigate in pacification areas. Of the 15% initially allocated to our country, some of the machine tools, over 9,000 pieces, are enough for our government to prepare transportation tools. Originally scheduled to send ships to Yokosuka port in Japan from the 15th of this month, but due to insufficient preparations on the Japanese side and incomplete marking of the boxes on our side, it was decided to postpone it to January 5th to 15th next year, with each ship sent to Japan to transport the reparations of machine tools back home.

### National Assembly Representatives' Fellowship Issues Declaration on Constitutional Government Issues

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] The National Assembly Representatives' Fellowship recently issued a declaration on the issue of constitutional government, expressing their opinions. They are all National Assembly representatives who participated in the drafting of the constitution. The date for the implementation of constitutional government was determined to be December 25th at last year's National Assembly. Now, because the government believes that preparations for the implementation of constitutional government have not been completed, and elections have not been completed as scheduled, a transitional period has been announced, and a National Assembly date has been set, while announcing the powers of the National Government and its affiliated institutions during the National Assembly period. As the original scheduled date for the implementation of constitutional government has arrived, the constituent National Assembly representatives have prepared two declarations to inform society in order to demonstrate their responsibilities.

### Archbishop Yu Bin Arrives in Shanghai, Talks Freely About Impressions of Visiting the United States

He is scheduled to go to Beijing today. According to his impressions of the trip, "My trip to the United States was purely in a private capacity as a goodwill visit. I had extensive discussions with President Truman, congressional leaders, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and other friends. I also visited news, broadcasting, industrial and commercial enterprises, and important water conservancy facilities, and gave lectures to various academic groups. What I have seen and heard has provided much food for thought. As for the impressions of this trip, they can be divided into the following points:" (Continued on page 2, column 1)

### We Decide to First Send a Special Envoy to Congratulate Myanmar's Independence

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] Myanmar is scheduled to formally become independent on January 4th next year. Our country has decided to first send a special envoy to congratulate them and participate in the grand ceremony. The candidate for this position has been internally determined and will be announced within the next week.

### U.S. Congressional Committees Reach Agreement on Aid to China, France, Italy, and Austria Bills, Aid to China Funds Used to Purchase Grain and Other Materials

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] It is reported that in order to cooperate with the U.S. loan to China, a committee will be established by the relevant ministries and commissions to engage in planning and guidance. The heads of the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the National Resources Commission will serve as committee members.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The special session of Congress, which had been discussing the foreign winter relief bill for nearly five weeks, finally reached a compromise agreement between the House and Senate on the 19th and passed a $540 million emergency aid bill for China, France, Italy, and Austria, which was immediately sent to President Truman for signature and implementation. The bill was first passed by the House with a large majority of 233 votes to 2, and then also passed by the Senate with a voice vote. Previously, after the House deleted certain parts, the Senate originally approved $568 million in emergency aid to the four countries, of which $18 million was used to aid China. According to Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "The China portion must be included. The Appropriations Committee approved $20 million in aid to China last night, but this amount cannot be allocated according to foreign legislation. There is no implementation plan for the aid to China funds, and only $18 million remains unallocated, so this amount is being used to provide China with a small amount of assistance. This sum merely represents our belief that the situation in China is as important to American security as the situation in Europe." According to Senator Bridges, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, this amount will be used to provide the Chinese government with food, small arms, ammunition, and other materials.

### According to a U.S. Information Agency dispatch from Washington, this $18 million will be taken from the funds of the U.S. after the end of the UNRRA.

[News from our publication] New York, 20th, Broadcast: U.S. Congressman Fulhan stated that the Chinese government needs ammunition more than money. The amount of $60 million is not helpful. Even if a loan of $200 million or $300 million is made, it will not be very effective unless the National Government receives military assistance, including American military experts. What Bullitt envisioned is clearly this.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Dr. H.H. Kung stated here on the 20th that the first line of U.S. anti-communism is in China. Dr. Kung, in his capacity as a private citizen, was unwilling to elaborate, but he believed that, roughly estimated, the U.S. would need more than $150 billion to complete the long-term aid plan to China to balance China's economy. Dr. Kung emphasized that this number may be greatly increased or decreased by those who demand China's needs in the Gooding program. He said that the stability of the world depends on the stability of Asia, and that an appropriate aid plan to China will enable China to improve its economic foundation within a year. Dr. Kung said that China's economic revival depends on: first, currency stability; second, the creation of economic order within the country; and third, the restoration of foreign trade to pre-war standards. Dr. Kung said optimistically that although China was severely damaged during the war, China could quickly recover if the United States provides it with appropriate assistance.

### In Memory of a Great Master, Mr. Li Denghui

— Zhang Hanmei

Following the passing of former Fudan University President Mr. Li Denghui on the 19th of last month, educators across the nation were deeply saddened. Mr. Li's death is truly a great loss to the country. Mr. Li's students and old friends are scheduled to hold a memorial meeting at Jiangwan Fudan University today, and we would also like to take this opportunity to express our respect for Mr. Li. Mr. Li devoted himself to education for more than forty years without interruption. The talents he cultivated are scattered throughout all sectors of the country, and they have made significant contributions to education, culture, commerce, industry, political reforms, and so on. His profound impact is not limited to those who directly or indirectly received his teachings. Even those who did not know Mr. Li personally were deeply moved upon hearing of his death. A worker even wrote a letter to Mr. Li's funeral committee, requesting that Mr. Li's remains be buried on the banks of West Lake in Hangzhou. He said that such a great man should be forever remembered amidst the scenic beauty of the lake and mountains, for future generations to pay their respects. Although this suggestion was not accepted, the influence of Mr. Li's noble character can be seen from this.

There have been many introductions and praises of Mr. Li's life, which need not be repeated here. We believe that Mr. Li's life can be summarized by the words "love" and "dedication." Mr. Li was a devout Christian believer. He did not pay much attention to the many rules and formalities of the church, but he was truly able to practice the doctrine of universal love. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to education, charity, and national salvation. These efforts stemmed from his love for young people, his love for the orphaned and helpless, and his love for the country. He personally lived a simple and frugal life, but he contributed all his energy and property to improving the welfare of others. He always advocated "service" and "sacrifice," and he himself was the embodiment of these virtues.

The church he belonged to was the Presbyterian Church, which is known for its strict discipline. Mr. Li demonstrated this spirit in his conduct and dealings. He started with himself, so he was truly able to achieve the effect of "teaching by example." Although he was not as strict with others as he was with himself, he had a clear distinction between right and wrong. He did not approve of those who were merely easygoing and indiscriminate, and he disliked those who were ambiguous and dealt with everything with a "good enough" attitude. He spared no effort in criticizing hypocritical and selfish behavior. However, everything he did was based on love. Whether it was rewarding others or defending others, it was out of good intentions. Therefore, he was truly able to achieve the demeanor of not dwelling on past wrongs and not being concerned about minor faults. Because he was kind and generous, he was ultimately more lenient than harsh. He mostly sought to get along with others, and others were influenced by him, mostly imperceptibly, and could not bear to deceive him.

In terms of career achievements, Mr. Li devoted his entire life to only one school, Fudan University. He served as a lecturer from the very beginning of Fudan's establishment. Later, he was promoted to president and single-handedly cultivated Fudan from a simple school into a famous university in the country. This spirit of focusing one's mind and dedicating oneself to one thing is rare in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Precisely because he was able to dedicate himself, his influence was vast and boundless. Although only Fudan students were directly influenced by him, those who admired and respected him were all over the world. This is truly the best criticism for those who nowadays want to participate in everything but achieve nothing. Mr. Li advocated that everyone should do their duty. One must first stand firmly in one's own position before being able to extend to other tasks. He often quoted a saying from the Bible, saying, "Only those who have no sin on their own hands are qualified to throw a stone at a sinner." He meant that it is not right to criticize and attack others without doing one's own job well. We cannot help but feel a sense of regret here. Are those who now speak freely and specialize in blaming others meeting the standards of conduct that Mr. Li left us?

Because Mr. Li devoted his life to education at one school, he did not leave behind any startling or shocking deeds. Mr. Li's style is like the vast Tai Lake, boundless and endless at 36,000 hectares, rather than a turbulent and rapid river. Mr. Li was an educator, a great master admired by all. His inspiring power arose unconsciously and imperceptibly. We believe that it is relatively easy to be a sensational careerist, but in today's superficial era, to be able to emulate Mr. Li's legacy of neutrality and peace, and his gentle and kind style, is truly a rare and precious thing, worthy of our eternal respect.

Finally, we would like to add a few more words. Recently, many who admire Mr. Li want to respectfully call him a liberal. On this point, we have slightly different opinions. This view, of course, stems from respect for Mr. Li. It is only natural for lovers of liberalism to give their beloved title to someone they admire. However, although the intention is good, it does not quite match Mr. Li's personality. Liberalism originates from free thinking, and free thinkers are also atheists. Mr. Li was a devout believer in Christianity, and he probably would not want to accept a title that is incompatible with his beliefs. However, Mr. Li was indeed a most enlightened religious figure. He never persuaded others to believe in his religion, and he was most able to accept opinions that were contrary to his own. When he was in charge of school affairs, he also welcomed others to share the responsibility of running the school with him. He was a person with a strong democratic spirit. All of these aspects are in line with the spirit of liberalism. However, we must analyze this title because in recent times, liberalism has lost its original spirit of self-discipline. Although liberalism opposes external suppression and restraint, it also does not want to impose suppression and restraint on others, but it has a strict self-examination and discipline for itself. Just as our country used to say, "People must have things they will not do, and then they can do things." If one is always lenient to oneself and others, then superficiality and laxity will become a common practice, which is truly infinitely harmful. Here, we feel that Mr. Li's style of being demanding of himself and generous to others is especially a model for young students, and it is also a good remedy for the common diseases of the present time, and we cannot help but pay our respects to it again and again.

### Zhou Yide on Feng Yuxiang

(Continued from page one) In the history of Chinese turmoil, no one has committed as many acts of betrayal as Feng. Throughout his life, Feng has changed masters several times. For his own personal gain, Feng allied himself with the most corrupt warlords in China, warlords who plunged the unfortunate country into continuous civil war. Currently, he is allied with the CCP traitors who want to make China a Soviet satellite state. General Feng's past record can be described as that of a "professional traitor." In 1926, when he was forced to flee China, he studied at the Moscow Revolutionary School. Subsequently, Feng returned to North China, and in 1927, he participated in the Soviet conspiracy to communize China. Feng's alliance with President Chiang Kai-shek was when he was sure that President Chiang could defeat the warlords. Although he accepted President Chiang's friendly cooperation, he immediately rebelled against the central government and joined forces with Wang Jingwei, who later became a traitor, to form a new united government in North China. After Wang was defeated, Feng retired to a temple. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Feng rejoined the central government and held an insignificant military position. Since then, he has been actively involved in a small group of people who were dissatisfied with the government. These dissatisfied people, while publicly supporting President Chiang as the only leader to save China, were secretly plotting to overthrow President Chiang in order to gain power. Ordinary Chinese people view him as a "slippery general."

### Yu Bin Talks About His Impressions of Traveling in the United States

(Continued from page one) Today, the American people have a deeper understanding of the meaning and responsibility of America's leading position in the world than in the past. Therefore, they are more serious and effortful in dealing with it than in the past. The recent changes in the United States' attitude towards China and the active support for Europe and China are all related to this awareness. Today, domestic problems in the United States are also very complicated. Inflation is particularly noteworthy. In a situation where the standard of living is rising daily and production and consumption are not commensurate, the American people feel that economic problems should be carefully planned so that people's livelihoods can be stabilized. In addition to foreign aid issues, the American government and the public are making the greatest efforts on domestic economic issues. The indifferent attitude shown by the United States towards assisting China has been misunderstood in the past as a reflection of American public opinion. In fact, this view is completely inaccurate. Most Americans, except for a few with ulterior motives, are concerned about and sympathize with China. The pity is that the general American understanding of China is insufficient, but this is actually due to the fact that the information provided by our country is too little. For example, the US Congress's recent amendment to the government's proposed foreign aid bill, which included China as a recipient country, is a manifestation of the true American public opinion. After caring about China, the Americans place earnest expectations on China. They all hope that China will strive to improve and make more active improvements so that the world will continue to benefit from the contributions of the Chinese nation. When I met with President Truman, he said: "I am very concerned about the Chinese people and admire President Chiang very much. We will do our best to help China, but China should also make our assistance have satisfactory results." His intention is also to hope that we should work hard to improve.

### Refugees Gather in the Capital; Intensify Evacuation and Relief; Ministry of Social Affairs Has Implemented a Plan

[Nanjing, Central News Agency, 20th] The number of refugees successively arriving in Nanjing due to bandit disasters is increasing daily. They are living in Xiaguan in a miserable state. To provide relief to the refugees, the Ministry of Social Affairs has now formulated a plan. The guiding principle is to send them back to their hometowns and strengthen local relief in each province as a principle. According to this principle, refugees coming to Beijing from Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces will be sent back to their provinces as much as possible. In safe and moderate areas within each province, refugee relief stations will be set up separately to effectively strengthen local relief and resettlement to avoid the suffering of refugees wandering around. Refugees who have already arrived in Beijing and are indeed suffering from cold and hunger will still be given appropriate assistance. Shelters and porridge distribution centers have now been established in Puzhen to provide temporary relief.

In Anhui, Wuhu, Anqing, Liuan, Dangtu, Bengbu, Linhuaiguan, Mingguang, County, Guzhen, Suxian, Datong, Fuyang, Tunxi, Zhengyangguan, and Youjia'an are the centers, and they have already been implemented in Wuhu, Anqing, and Zhapu. In Jiangsu, Jiangning, Jurong, Liuhe, Jiangpu, Jiangdu, Zhenjiang, Xuzhou, and Taixian are the centers. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has instructed them to be implemented. As for the capital, in addition to the Refugee Diversion and Treatment Committee of the capital taking overall responsibility, refugee diversion stations will be set up in Pukou, Xiaguan, and outside Zhonghua Gate to handle them separately.

According to the aforementioned guidelines, with each relief station as the center, refugees will first be sent in batches to neighboring disaster-free or lightly disaster-stricken counties. Then, according to their nature, they will be made to participate in work relief, participate in anti-rebellion service work, be introduced to work as servants, or be fostered in separate households (in Anhui customs, in the cold winter season, poor women and children can be introduced by relatives and friends to be fostered in wealthy families). The elderly, weak, disabled, and those who have no support will be accommodated and rescued by each station using the original relief homes, temples, and other public places, or by building sheds.

### Thai Rice Mills Nationalized; Overseas Chinese Businessmen Seek Rescue Measures

From today, all railways and inland waterway vessels will stop serving any private rice mills.

### Before Resuming Negotiations on the German Peace Treaty, the US Decides to Stabilize Western Europe First; Marshall's Speech Criticizes Soviet Policy

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Marshall stated on the 19th that the Soviet Union is obstructing the drafting of peace treaties with Germany and Austria in an attempt to keep Europe in a state of chaos. Marshall addressed the nation in a broadcast commenting on the failure of the London Foreign Ministers Conference. He said that it would be extremely difficult to reach an agreement on the terms of the peace treaties on paper before European recovery is guaranteed. He said that the war has destroyed the balance of Europe, creating a "political vacuum" that must be filled by rebuilding a healthy structure in Europe in order to ensure lasting peace. Marshall stated that the Soviet Union's actions at the Foreign Ministers Conference were related to the Soviet Union's attack on the Marshall Plan for European aid, and therefore every proposal agreed upon by the Western countries at the Foreign Ministers Conference was completely opposed. The Soviet Union's open declaration of its hostility and opposition to the European recovery plan is because once the recovery plan is successful, it will allow the sixteen European countries that agree to participate to restore their national strength and establish governments that can guarantee genuine freedom and individual opportunities to prevent terror and tyranny. Although Soviet officials and communist leaders in European countries have publicly predicted that this recovery will be impossible, he is convinced that the free civilization of Western Europe will be rebuilt. Marshall stated that he went to London to attend the conference, hoping that the four powers could reach a basic decision to resolve Germany's situation this winter and improve the future of all of Europe. However, the Soviet Union consistently adopted obstructionist tactics, which can be seen from the fact that the issue of German reparations quickly became a major topic. He said that the Soviet Union's demand for reparations to be paid in current production is actually equivalent to the United States paying the bill, that is, "the United States deposits and the Soviet Union withdraws." Marshall also said that the reason he suggested the Foreign Ministers Conference be adjourned is that it is now clear that it is impossible to make peaceful efforts in Europe. He said that the Soviet Union's only interest is to use the conference as an opportunity for propaganda to win the favor of the German people. He concluded that the conference had neither gains nor losses, but the outlines of the problems and obstacles have become clearer. We cannot hope for German unification at this time, but should do our best in the areas within our reach.

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Marshall's broadcast speech shows that he has placed all his hopes for resolving the German peace treaty issue on the success of the European Recovery Program. He further clarified that he has given up hope of resuming discussions with the Soviet Union on the German issue before the European Recovery Program is assured of success. He did not specify how long this period would be, but his statement that "there is no hope of a solution until it is shown in the coming months whether Western European civilization can overcome the destructive effects of the war and restore a healthy society" roughly indicates the time frame that Marshall anticipates.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] After Secretary Marshall's statement, the move by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to unify West Germany seems to be closer to reality. Diplomatic officials said that Marshall's words are a prelude to discussions between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on merging the occupation zones in Germany, but Secretary Marshall does not believe that it is possible to hold three-country peace treaty talks with West Germany. However, diplomatic officials believe that the unification of the Western German occupation zones is the only superior strategy to pressure the Soviet Union to agree to resolve the German issue.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] US Secretary of State Marshall has decided to follow Truman's advice and take a short break before participating in the legislative battle for the future $17 billion European Recovery Program. Marshall plans to spend his indefinite and short vacation at his winter villa near Pinehurst, North Carolina, on the 20th.

### The Soviet Union Should Be Held Responsible for the Failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference; Bidault Reports to Parliament

He shared the same views as Bevin and Marshall, placing the responsibility for the failure of the conference on the Soviet Union, but his wording was more cautious.

### Soviet Occupation Forces Attempt to Annex the Berlin Area

[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] A Berlin Soviet official newspaper recently published an article authorized by the Soviet side, stating that if the Western Allies reach a solution for two or three zones of West Germany, the Soviet Union will demand that all of Berlin become a complete part of the Soviet zone politically, geographically, and economically.

### Britain Gives the Soviet Union a Christmas Gift; Motion to Reconsider the Old Soviet Atomic Plan

### Britain and France Enthusiastically Welcome Truman's Long-Term European Aid Plan; US Republicans Demand Limitations on Amounts

[Our Newspaper] London, 20th broadcast: A spokesman for the British Foreign Office expressed a warm welcome to President Truman's long-term European aid plan, considering it a major event in history. The President's emphasis on recovery rather than relief is particularly commendable. In addition, newspapers in various European countries have praised Truman's plan as much as possible, with the exception of the Communist Party. The latter believes that this is another step by US imperialism to control Europe.

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] After President Truman submitted the Marshall Plan to Congress, Republican opposition has become increasingly apparent. The Republican Policy Committee of the House of Representatives revealed that the majority of the committee members will insist that the annual aid amount not exceed four billion dollars. It is said that the Republicans have drafted a bill requiring limiting the amount of assistance and amending the plan proposed by the government. Although the vote of the Republican Policy Committee of the House of Representatives does not mean that Republican members of both houses will oppose Truman's plan, it shows a strong opinion from a part of Congress that supports limiting the annual aid amount to a maximum of four billion dollars and will firmly demand the implementation of this limitation. It is also learned that the Republican proposal will also include: Entrusting the task of funding public works and large-scale enterprises to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. First conduct a one-year trial of the European aid plan, and do not bind Congress to agree to the long-term aid for a period of four years and three months, as suggested by President Truman's message. Establish a bipartisan government agency that is accountable to both Congress and the President to manage the implementation of the European aid plan, instead of setting up only one general manager as suggested by Truman. It is heard that the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, Vandenberg and Eaton, are still reserved about the aforementioned amendments.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Senator Taft broadcast on the evening of the 19th that Truman's proposal for aid to Europe was slightly excessive.

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] French officials and the general public warmly welcomed President Truman's submission of the Marshall Plan to Congress.

### US House Passes Extension of Export Controls

[US Information Service, Washington, 19th] The House of Representatives today passed a bill extending the President's authority to control exports and allocate domestic transportation equipment until February 1949.

The bill was passed by the Senate on Thursday and will now be submitted to the President.

### Argentina Proposes Suggestions at the International Trade Conference; Advocates US-Argentine Cooperation to Implement Economic Plans

[United Press, Havana, 20th] Molina, the head of the Argentine delegation attending the International Trade Conference, proposed six plans on the 20th to establish an economic "one world" to solve current international problems. The United States and Argentina are the world's largest grain-producing countries, and close cooperation between the two countries will enable the entire plan to be implemented. Mr. Molina believes that the failure of the London Foreign Ministers Conference is tantamount to bringing the threat of war, so he urged immediate action to avoid world panic by means of economic and social measures.

Contains Six Points

The main points of Mr. Molina's plan are as follows: Immediately convene an international monetary conference to solve the world's shortage of gold and dollars.

### Prosecution of Nine Businessmen and Employees for Using China National Aviation Corporation Planes to Traffic Drugs, Yan Zaihou and Others Acquitted

[Our Report] The case of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Kunming-Shanghai flights carrying large quantities of opium and morphine has been concluded by Chief Prosecutor Quan Tao of the District Procuratorate, who yesterday filed a public indictment on charges of attempted drug trafficking and corruption. The defendants are Nie Chengshan (from Yantai, Shandong, businessman, residing at No. 9, Yuan Garden Lane, Xin Zha Road, Shanghai, in custody), Yin Liangchen (from Kunming, Yunnan, medicine merchant, residing at No. 25, Xingye Lane, Linsen East Road, Shanghai, in custody), Gu Wenpeng (at large), Sha Pu (at large), Zhuang Zhongfu (from Chaozhou, Guangdong, tailor, residing at No. 3, Jishan Lane, Lane 61, Fuxi Road, Shanghai, in custody), Lü Huiming (from Chongqing, Sichuan, medicine merchant, residing at No. 3, Jishan Lane, Lane 61, Fuxi Road, Shanghai, in custody), Shi Ting (from Chongming, Jiangsu, mechanic, in custody), Sun Shougao (from Donghai, Jiangsu, mechanic, residing at No. 33, Jiaxing Road, Hongkou, in custody), and Wei Wenxiang (from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, mechanic, residing at No. 314, Zhongzheng Middle Road, Shanghai, in custody), a total of nine people.

Discovery Process

The indictment states: Gu, Sha, Zhuang, Lü, and others, through Gu Wenpeng, transported four packages of drugs from Kunming, Yunnan, and hid them in the CNAC plane they were travelling on. After arriving in Shanghai, Sun Shougao, a mechanic at the CNAC Shanghai airport, secretly took them out. Sun then asked his colleague Shi Ting to help, and Shi Ting sought the assistance of another colleague, Wei Wenxiang, to remove the drugs. Afterwards, Sun Shougao, Shi Ting, Wei Wenxiang, and others shared a reward of 20 million yuan. On November 3 of this year, Gu Wenpeng flew from Kunming to Shanghai again, bringing 31.160 kilograms of raw opium, divided into ten packages; 0.780 kilograms of processed opium, packed into one package; and 3.720 kilograms of morphine, divided into three packages. These were combined into two large bundles and hidden in the rear compartment of the cargo hold of Plane No. 47. After landing in Shanghai, Shi Ting was asked to take them out. Shi found the packages to be enormous and, as Wei Wenxiang was on leave, dared not take action. The next morning, the company discovered the drugs and turned them over to the customs. The case was then sent to the court on November 11.

Drug Trafficking Boss

According to Shi's testimony in court on December 1 of this year: "This time the opium was brought by Gu Wenpeng." "After being discovered by the company, I ran to Room 206, 2nd Floor, No. 587 Jing'an Temple Road, which was Sha's residence, and was monitored by people, who told me to call Nie Chengshan. Later, Nie came, along with Sha Pu, Gu Wenpeng, and myself. The four of us discussed it. I heard them using slang, referring to the goods as 'gold' and arranging to meet at the Great Bundle Hotel, Room 502, with Gu Wenpeng and Nie Chengshan." "This time, they didn't use slang, but directly called it opium." "On the 8th, the Great Eastern was closed, so they changed to Room 520 at the Great China Hotel, and Gu Wenpeng changed the registration name to Chen on the guest register. On the 9th and 10th, Sha, Gu, and others were discussing it, and Chengshan wanted Gu Wenpeng to pay compensation. Nie Chengshan is likely the big boss of the drug trafficking operation."

Commission of 20 Million

The defendant Yin Liangchen also firmly denied participating in the drug trafficking, but he admitted that he was from Kunming and lived in the home of Gu Wenpeng's mother-in-law in Kunming. He originally traded in Chinese medicinal materials, and when Gu Wenpeng first asked Shi to remove the drugs from the plane, he falsely claimed that they were valuable medicinal products, namely bezoar. Furthermore, according to Sun Shougao's testimony in this court on December 1 of this year, he received a commission of "20 million for removing the smuggled goods in May, of which 10 million was received from Yin Liangchen at No. 25, Xingye Lane, Xiafei Road. Gu Wenpeng gave me 9.5 million yuan, and I got another 500,000 from Nie Chengshan." This is concrete proof of the defendant's joint drug trafficking. As for his reversal of testimony in court on the 12th of this month, denying the fact that Sun Shougao had received 10 million yuan from him on the 1st of the same month, as well as his association with Gu Wenpeng, shows that his statement is false and unreliable. The defendant Zhuang Zhongfu gave Yin Liangchen 5 million yuan in legal tender to be given to Sun Shougao as a reward for transporting the drugs. He claimed to be in the business of selling Western clothing and knew Yin Liangchen through Western clothing transactions, and that he often borrowed money from Yin. When questioned about why he engaged in such an unrelated activity, he had no satisfactory explanation, making him also suspected in this case. Although the defendant Lü Huiming did not deny that he had taken 5 million yuan from Yin Liangchen because Yin Liangchen needed to pay Sun Shougao 10 million yuan in legal tender on the 5th of this year, he claimed that it was mid-September, which is clearly untrue and should be considered as having an accomplice relationship.

Three Employees Embezzle

Regarding Shi's involvement in Gu Wenpeng's loading and unloading of drugs, the defendant Shi frankly confessed to this court on December 1 of this year, "Sun Shougao had asked me to do it once before. At first, I thought it was smuggled goods brought on the plane, and I just took it when Sun asked me to. After getting such a large reward, I realized it was opium." "I asked Wei Wenxiang to take it for the first time, and I gave him 8 million yuan out of the 15 million yuan reward." When Sun Shougao was interrogated, he stated, "Gu gave me 20 million in foreign exchange, I kept 5 million, and the remaining 15 million was for Shi Ting and Wei Wenxiang to divide." When Wei Wenxiang was questioned, he stated, "I didn't know what it was, he asked me to help take it, and gave me 8 million yuan." According to the defendants Sun Shougao, Shi Ting, and Wei Wenxiang, all of whom are mechanics at the state-owned CNAC, regarding the unloading they did in May, all three testified that they heard Gu Wenpeng say it was smuggled rhinoceros horn, which indicates that they took advantage of their service at the airport to seek illegal profits, but did not have the intention of trafficking drugs. As for Shi Ting's actions the second time, having received an excessive reward the first time, he clearly knew that it was not ordinary smuggled goods. Moreover, according to the company employees Gao Junchen, Huang Yulin, Gu Zhenhan, and others, before the drugs were transported on November 3, there were already rumors of this at the airport. As the person involved, how could the defendant Shi Ting not know? However, he still listened to Gu Wenpeng's instructions and intended to unload the goods. At this time, it should be considered that he also had the act of attempted drug transportation.

Legal Articles Violated by the Defendants

The above-mentioned defendants Nie Chengshan, Yin Liangchen, Gu Wenpeng, Sha Pu, Zhuang Zhongfu, Lü Huiming, etc., are suspected of committing the crime of drug trafficking under Article 4, Paragraph 1, and Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Opium and Drug Prohibition. Among them, the defendants Nie Chengshan, Gu Wenpeng, and Sha Pu are also suspected of violating Article 56 of the Criminal Code. The defendant Shi Ting is also suspected of committing the crime of attempted drug transportation under Article 4, Paragraph 1, Article 5, Paragraph 1, and Article 16 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Opium and Drug Prohibition, as well as the crime of corruption under Article 3, Paragraph 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, and should be punished according to Article 50 of the Criminal Code. The defendants Sun Shougao and Wei Wenxiang are only suspected of committing the crime of corruption under Article 3, Paragraph 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, and in accordance with Article 20 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Opium and Drug Prohibition, Article 1, Paragraph 1, and Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public indictment is filed.

[Further News] The other defendants in the same case, Yan Zaihou, the mechanical foreman, Shi Xuan, the bookkeeper of the plumbing shop, and Gu Jiluo, Pan, Shi Ting's landlords, were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. Yan and Shi, who were originally in custody, were released at 6 p.m. last night.

### Two Western Newspapers Dissatisfied with Paper Allocation; Newspaper Association Issues Statement: There Has Never Been Any Bias Towards Chinese and Foreign Members

Li Zikuan, chairman of the Shanghai Newspaper Commercial Association, issued the following statement on behalf of the association yesterday regarding the fact that the North China Daily News and the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, both members of the association, were dissatisfied with the fourth-period quota allocation and criticized the association:

Since the general meeting of all members of the association passed the fourth-quarter paper quota allocation plan for this year on the 18th of this month, the two member newspapers, the North China Daily News and the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, have made a lot of publicity and arbitrarily attacked the association in their respective newspapers due to the reduction in the quota. The articles published on the 19th and 20th, in addition to expressing their grievances, also contained rumors and speculations, which were further exaggerated. They not only made malicious comments and slandered the association, but also involved the Chinese government and other members of the association. The association does not want to criticize this kind of attitude. The association is confident that it handled this case completely in accordance with proper meeting procedures and has never been biased or private. The truth and falsehoods will be submitted to public opinion. The association's allocation quota is authorized by the Allocation Office of the Transportation and Management Committee, and the allocation draft is still reviewed and decided by the Allocation Office after it is passed, so the final authority rests with that office. If the allocation plan decided by this association is indeed inappropriate, there is still room for final remedy. However, the two Western newspapers publicly attacked this association and other parties before the remedy was exhausted. Their arrogance is truly astonishing. The reason why this association reduced the quotas of the two newspapers is entirely because they exceeded the number of pages allowed and failed to comply with the regulations, and there is no other reason. The government's regulation prohibiting additional pages should be consistently followed by all newspapers, both domestic and foreign. If this regulation only applies to Chinese-run newspapers and not to foreign-run newspapers, then not only will the government have no way to justify itself, but the restrictions will also be empty words. This association has never discriminated against Chinese and foreign members. As evidenced by the fact that the quotas of the two Western newspapers increased in the third period compared to the second period. If the two Western newspapers had not added pages in November, how could other members have the impression that they had too much paper? Members should know that today, no nationality should still have a special sense of superiority to clash with others. If this trend is started, foreign members of other industry associations may follow suit and use the methods of treating Chinese people ten years ago, failing to follow normal channels and using special solutions to resolve matters after the situation becomes serious. I am afraid that all public affairs will be impossible to handle, and the responsibility will be clear. I am truly afraid that various sectors will not understand the truth, so I am declaring the facts.

### Zhang Chunfan's Trial Concludes and Awaits Judgment; Testimony Emphasizes Discord Due to Leng Shan's Slander; Witnesses' Statements Show No Signs of Pessimism

At 9:25 a.m. yesterday, after Judge Mei Lehe and Prosecutor Chen Shoutao opened the eighth Criminal Court, Zhang Chunfan was ordered to appear in court.

Only Shen and Wei arrived yesterday. Zhang's testimony was the same as his written statement, emphasizing that the discord between him and Xiao was due to Leng Shan's slander. He also stated that Xiao committed suicide on October 13. Before the suicide, she intended to go to Hangzhou to negotiate the recovery of the Hangzhou house that had been occupied. After lunch, Xiao asked him if he was going to Hangzhou. He replied that he could not go. Shortly after, Wei Lanfang came to report that Xiao had committed suicide by taking poison. Next, witness Shen Yitao testified that on October 10, he was with Xiao and knew that a dispute had occurred between Zhang and Xiao, so he accompanied Xiao home and tried to persuade Zhang. On the afternoon of October 13, he went to Zhang's house again to chat and heard that Xiao wanted to go to Hangzhou. He left after a brief conversation. Before the incident, he saw no signs of resentment or pessimism from Xiao. Wei Lanfang testified: She had been performing on the same stage with Xiao Dangui for two or three years. On October 13, she went to Xiao's house, and Zhang Chunfan told her about Xiao's affair with Leng Shan. Later, Xiao also complained to her. On that day, Xiao was dressed up in gorgeous clothes and made up beautifully. Soon after, she saw Xiao's expression change greatly and ran into the room, picked up a pen, and wrote "Chunfan, you and I live together..." Seeing this, she grabbed the pen, and Xiao fell to the ground. At that time, the smell of lysol was very strong, knowing that she had taken poison, so she was rushed to the Sino-American Hospital, but she died. After the interrogation, Prosecutor Chen stood up and gave a legal argument, requesting that the defendant be sentenced according to law. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer stood up to defend him and requested bail, which was not granted. In the end, the case was scheduled for sentencing, and the defendant was returned to custody.

### Anhui Province After Robbery

[Special report from our newspaper in Hefei on the 15th] From Hefei to Lu'an in western Anhui and then to Huoshan, all six small bridges on the highway were thoroughly destroyed by the bandit army but were jointly repaired by the National Army and the Anhui Highway Bureau. Due to military needs, traffic needs to be restored urgently. Some bridges are not strong enough, and cars passing over them inevitably cause concern. There is still no passenger bus from Lu'an to Huoshan, and there are scattered bandits along the way. Our group of eight colleagues, led by Li Xuetan, a secretary of the rank of colonel from the Eighth Pacification District Headquarters, accompanied by two military vehicles, departed from Hefei to Huoshan. On the way to Huoshan, a certain division of the National Army sent additional troops to protect us. In the car, we only saw military vehicles coming and going, and there were no commercial vehicles at all. Even human-powered wheelbarrows and pedestrians were not as frequent and continuous as between Lu'an and Hefei. Today, advancing from the edge of Dabie Mountain to Shanqiu is getting more and more desolate. This is the result of Liu Bocheng's entry into Dabie Mountain from southwestern Shandong.

Autumn Harvest Depleted, Spring Famine Worrying

The car raced on the highway, bumpy. The reporter happened to be traveling after being ill, and felt particularly tired. Anyone who has traveled on the Anhui Highway (especially the western Anhui Highway) will feel the difficulty of traveling. Because the tea, hemp, bamboo, wood, charcoal produced in western Anhui are transported only by this highway. In addition to carrying on shoulders, the transportation tool is a hand-pushed wheelbarrow. The road surface is earthen. Thousands and tens of thousands of wheelbarrows pass by all year round, and at a glance, there are small ditches. Even if it is a stone road surface, it is said that it cannot withstand years of wheelbarrow rolling, which makes the road surface rugged, like the Shu Road. This kind of heavy-duty wheelbarrow is the largest in human-powered transportation capacity. It cannot be prohibited and should not be prohibited. Therefore, the road surface can only get worse day by day, and driving is like dancing. On rainy days, it is suspended. The second problem is that the rice fields on both sides of the highway are still gray and withered rice straw roots. Very few have been plowed and turned over. This is to tell us that after the robbery in western Anhui, human and animal power are generally lacking. This year's autumn is dry, and the planted wheat has not sprouted due to uneven rainfall. Most of this year's autumn harvest was consumed by bandits, hiding a terrible spring famine next year. For thousands of years, our farmers have relied on the heavens for food, and can only wait with their eyes open for a moderate winter rain. If the people who handle relief in the bandit area cannot achieve practical benefits for the people, our farmers will have no other hope. Speaking of the third problem, that is, the one that has the greatest relationship with the rural economy of western Anhui, the tea production in Lu'an and Huoshan. According to the statistics of the Anhui Construction Department, the tea production area in Lu'an is 114,580 mu, with an average annual output of 35 catties per mu. The tea production area in Huoshan is 88,017 mu, with an average annual output of 30 catties per mu. The current price of tea is between 70,000 and 120,000 yuan per catty. Adding up the statistics of the two counties, this income is too amazing. On the way to Luohuo, the short tea bushes on both sides sway in the long weeds. In the spring of this year, the Anhui Relief Sub-Administration had an organization of a working team for the revitalization of tea gardens in western Anhui, using flour to encourage tea farmers to cultivate and weed. Looking at it today, that work was in vain, no wonder the tea production in western Anhui is declining.

The Gateway to Western Anhui Is Difficult to Open

General Tan Heyi, the division commander of a certain division of the National Army, is now stationed in Lu'an. He tracked and pursued Liu Bocheng from the south bank of the Yellow River, dragging its tail. After passing the Shahe River, the Shihe River, and crossing the Weihe River, he marched thousands of miles to Lu'an. At that time, the Third Column, the elite force of the bandits, was actually occupying Lu'an. Commander Tan's division captured it with three divisions. It is said that this was something that Liu Bocheng did not expect.

Commander Tan talked about his experience in fighting bandits. The bandit army's combat is that the first line is a small number of so-called old Eighth Route Army soldiers leading a large number of militiamen, followed by "supervisory teams." This "supervisory team" is composed of Communist Party members, armed with machine guns aimed at the militiamen. If the militiamen retreat during combat, they will be shot dead immediately, forcing the militiamen to dare not retreat. Originally thought that the bandit army was brave, but soon broke through its method, in addition to attacking the first line head-on, also attacked the "supervisory team" by detouring. After defeating the "supervisory team," the first line immediately collapsed, so many were captured along the way. The bandit army really cannot withstand the attack, and its mobility is greater, which is one of the reasons. Now Commander Tan is stationed in Lu'an, which is considered the most stable life in three months, and his troops have entered the eastern foot of Dabie Mountain to carry out sweeping operations.

Another report: Recently, grain prices have fluctuated greatly, which has greatly affected people's lives. The county government has repeatedly received clear orders to take effective measures.

It has also prepared and issued a grain storage investigation form, but it has not yet complied. According to the report, the price of white rice per stone has approached the one million yuan mark. Special orders have been sent to Nanshi rice market outside the city to monitor rice prices and strictly investigate grain merchants' grain storage. If they encounter raising prices, manipulating hoarding, and hoarding outside the industry, they should be immediately detained.

[Report from our newspaper in Wuxi on the 19th] The Southern Spring Township Office in the Third District of the County received information about Gu Zhennan, the intelligence team leader and deputy captain of the Youth Team of the traitorous bandit Jiang Ge department.

[Report from our newspaper in Wujin on the 19th] Since the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, prices in this county have soared, especially the prices of rice and rice have been the most intense.

### Social Affairs Bureau Registers Grain Merchants - Formulates Eight Guidelines for Grain Merchants

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has decided to re-register grain merchants and has formulated guidelines for grain merchants so that each grain merchant understands the procedures for various groups. The record is as follows:

1 Grain shops that have already been established should, according to custom, first join the same trade association, obtain membership qualifications, and then obtain a grain merchant registration application form from each association, fill it out in detail, and send it to the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau for review along with the capital and purchase and sales ledgers. It will be reviewed immediately upon arrival, and the approval or rejection will be returned immediately. However, it must meet one of the following requirements:

Those engaged in retail and wholesale should have capital equivalent to or greater than the price of twenty market stones of grain in the local area.

Those engaged in procurement and sales should have capital equivalent to or greater than the price of forty market stones of grain in the local area.

Grain warehouses should have a reasonable warehouse with a capacity of storing more than two hundred market stones.

Processing businesses should have equipment with all processing tools.

Brokerage businesses should have a fixed address and brand name, as well as proof of assets equivalent to or greater than the price of twenty market stones of grain in the local area. Newly established grain shops should first apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for a grain merchant registration application form, fill it out in detail, and send it to the Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to investigate and pass the qualification, issue a license, and then join the same trade association, be listed as a member, and start business.

2 When grain merchants organized as companies apply for grain merchant registration, they should submit the company registration license of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the company's articles of association, a business plan, and a list of directors, supervisors, and staff. It should be submitted by the Social Affairs Bureau to the Ministry of Food for approval and issuance of a license. The registration of branches should wait until the company is registered before applying to the local food authority where the branch is located.

3 Branches or factories of grain merchants should also apply for grain merchant registration separately and obtain a license before they can operate.

4 When registered grain merchants close down, go out of business, or dissolve, they should report to the Social Affairs Bureau in writing within ten days and surrender their business license.

5 If a registered grain merchant transfers all of its business to another person, the transferor and the transferee should jointly apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration in writing within ten days and exchange the business license.

6 If there are any doubts about the ledgers submitted during registration, a license will be issued after sending personnel to verify them on the spot.

7 In addition to applying for grain merchant registration, grain businesses should apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for commercial registration after obtaining a business license. Those with a larger scope of processing business should also apply for factory registration.

8 When grain merchants with the same brand name apply for registration, they should make corrections and reapply in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Registration Law.

### Detailed Rules for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Still Awaiting Instructions from the Executive Yuan and Ministry Before Decision

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since Chairman Yuan of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee took office, the full implementation of cotton yarn and cloth control has involved a wide range of issues. After several gatherings of experts from various departments for careful research and discussion, a management implementation plan was drafted and personally brought to the Executive Yuan and Ministry in Beijing the night before last for decision. It is understood that the general contents are centralized procurement of domestic cotton, commissioned spinning of cotton yarn, commissioned weaving and dyeing and finishing of yarn and cloth distribution, and export of yarn and cloth. It is heard that although the new plan has been decided in principle, various details such as whether to purchase all existing cotton or retain part of it, how to deal with existing yarn and cloth, and how to deal with duplicate products are still awaiting Chairman Yuan's instructions from the Executive Yuan and Ministry before a decision can be made.

### Cotton Merchants Express Opinions on Textile and Adjustment Committee's Purchase of Domestic Cotton

[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Pingsun, Chairman of the Shanghai Cotton Business Association, spoke to reporters yesterday about the purchase of domestic cotton: The National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee is about to be established. He had inquired with Yuan , Chairman of the Textile and Adjustment Committee, about the purchase of domestic cotton. According to Mr. Yuan, the authorities intend to entrust local established enterprises to collect the cotton on their behalf. However, this approach does not seem to take into account the livelihoods of small cotton enterprises. It is best for local cotton enterprises to organize a unified agency, jointly purchase the cotton, and then allocate the cotton obtained to the Textile and Adjustment Committee. In this way, regardless of the size of the cotton enterprise, it will have the right to purchase cotton. The survival of small cotton enterprises can be maintained, and the government will not need to set up separate agencies in cotton-producing areas.

Free Talk

### Specious

— Ji Yong

One day, friends gathered together and suddenly discussed the recently popular short shirts and long trousers worn by women, feeling that this kind of attire was somewhat mismatched. One friend said: This is entirely created by American young soldiers. They wanted Chinese women to have some foreign charm, but also to not deviate from the "Chinese essence," thus creating this look.

We naturally dare not completely assert that the motivation for this kind of attire is so, but by extrapolating from this, since the Western scientific ideas that have been introduced into China in the last hundred years are innumerable, every one of them has been distorted, becoming "specious."

I live in an area near the southern district of Shanghai, which is a genuine "Chinese district." Taking a walk down the street, one can see "atomic photos," "atomic leather shoes," atomic this, atomic that. You will suddenly be utterly confused. The United States, which invented the atomic bomb, still cannot apply atomic energy to power as of now, yet China can actually take photos and make leather shoes. Isn't that strange!

The process of all sciences entering China is roughly like this: • speaking and discussing randomly; • imitating randomly; • turning the direction and specializing in evil. The former example does not need to be discussed. Atomic photography is one example; there are many more examples of the latter. You can go to the street and see that we can make almost all of the latest foreign industrial products, except for heavy industries. There are dozens of brands of 51-type fountain pens. The best-selling new foreign books are immediately pirated, even magazines are no exception. Toothpaste imitates Kolynos, soap imitates Palmolive, and cigarettes imitate Lucky Strike even more vividly. Like this, all consumables that are easy to learn and make big money from are things that people rack their brains to do. As for turning the direction, an electric machine can produce vitamins ABCD, and can also mass-produce heroin and morphine. A printing press can print books and periodicals, why can't it print counterfeit money? What we know is already countless, and what we don't know, we don't know how much more there is!

China was originally the best at absorbing foreign civilization and also the best at assimilating foreigners. In modern times, there are hardly any traces of genuine Chinese style left in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Clothing is barbarian clothing (ancient China had no trousers, people sat on the ground. Wearing trousers and having tables and chairs were introduced from Western Regions countries, so the earliest chair was called a barbarian bed). Flatbread and fried dough sticks are the barbarian food of *bi luo*, which is barbarian cake, and there were many vendors selling it in Chang'an in the Tang Dynasty. Housing and vehicles have recently become mostly Westernized. However, no matter what, there should be a principle, which is to "choose the good and follow it," and do it thoroughly. You can't learn it randomly, never digest it, and then abandon it after a while, like a child buying snacks in an alley. This is bound to affect overall health. The foreign culture that ancient people came into contact with may have been simpler than modern culture, so its reaction was more rational and correct. In the last fifty years, the speed of change in the material environment has been too fast, so China has become a fool who is flustered, neither east nor west, making everything unlike anything, but wanting to learn everything. The result is that there is everything and there is nothing, creating a fully "specious" situation.

If material things are like this, what about thoughts? Although Zhang Wenxiang was not very good, he still dared to say the sentence "Chinese learning for the body, Western learning for the use." Now we have gradually lost our center and are at a loss, and everything has become "specious" everywhere!

### Mirror

— Zhuge Lang

An old grandmother told her granddaughter:

"Don't trust the mirror. Look at me! I've looked in the mirror for decades, and finally, I've reflected this current appearance!"

### On "Arguing"

— Dong Jinhu

When things get to the point of having to argue, it's probably more ominous than auspicious. The ancients were afraid of going to court because they were afraid that once they argued and couldn't clear themselves, their heads would be in danger of moving; today, people are actually also very afraid of government offices, although some people like to litigate, they are ultimately in the minority, and to some extent, they always have a bit of acting tough, or using the name of someone who often goes to government offices, waving a big flag as a tiger skin to scare others, all of which belong to a special class, not what I want to discuss. What I'm talking about here belongs to good people, who usually hang the Zhu Bo family instructions, and these people's life attitude is generally to argue less and yield more, and not go to government offices.

Arguing less naturally means talking less as well. It is said that people before the Qin Dynasty liked to talk more than those after, so in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, there were many debaters. Later, probably due to the principle of "a tree that stands out in the forest will be blown down by the wind, and behavior that is higher than the majority will be criticized by the crowd," there were fewer debaters, but they were still not abolished. Later, debating became even more inferior, shaking the tongue, and was not adopted by gentlemen, and was called: vulgar.

The source of this vulgarity is said to have arisen from uselessness. Once something is useless, even the best thing will be reduced to lowliness. There are many examples of "uselessness," the more famous one being Yang Yun's reply to Sun Huizong's letter, which is actually a good piece of argumentative writing, but it couldn't save this author. From this, it can be seen that debating is useless, and in government offices, debating is even more useless.

I prefer to talk more. Although I will also be silent, the latter is mostly out of necessity and not a wish, because I love to talk, so I inevitably argue more. Although my fate is still good, I have not entered government offices or been subjected to official punishment, but in ordinary days, the word "vulgar" is unavoidable.

People who have read a few books of poetry and sayings of Confucius always hope that they can be a bit more elegant, but people's nature is sometimes very difficult to wear down. An elegant facade is certainly important, but when it comes to government offices, and life and death are at stake, life is ultimately more valuable than the facade, so it is better to be a bit vulgar and save one's life than to be elegant and lose one's life. This is precisely "necessity," but it is also genuine sentiment.

### Blank Paper Document

— Yue Ping

Since the start of the Second World War, the most important international document has of course been the United Nations Declaration signed in 1943. This declaration adopted the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and most of the world's countries united through this declaration, fighting shoulder to shoulder, and to this day, everyone is still relying on this declaration's bit of connection, striving for lasting peace at Lake Success and Flushing Meadows—at least replacing armed conflict with heated debate.

However, how was this declaration actually signed! It was not until recently that everyone learned about it.

On that day, representatives from various countries gathered at the White House, waiting specifically to sign the agreement. President Roosevelt was naturally elated, extending warm hospitality. The conversation was lively and engaging, and everyone cheerfully emptied their cocktail glasses. The time for signing the agreement arrived.

However, where was that most important United Nations Declaration! Some people said that they had seen this document in the White House, but after searching everywhere, there was no trace of it. The host could not help but be anxious, so the tall-stemmed wine glasses in front of the distinguished guests were refilled, while some of the guests were whispering among themselves.

Then someone remembered that the document might be in the State Department. The State Department is in charge of foreign affairs, so they would naturally know the whereabouts of this document. The White House officials immediately called the State Department, but that day was a weekend, and the State Department had no one working except for a few junior staff members on duty. After inquiring carefully for a long time, one staff member remembered that the document was indeed locked in the State Department's safe.

Who could open the safe!

White House personnel desperately searched and finally found someone who knew how to open this safe. He lived in a village far from Washington, D.C., where transportation was quite inconvenient. However, the voice on the phone from the White House was already frantically anxious, repeatedly urging him to immediately return to the State Department to open the safe.

That staff member said: He did know how to open the safe, and he was also very willing to rush back to Washington immediately. However, all of this was useless. Because the safe had a time lock, and no one could open it until Monday morning.

The White House staff had to report this matter to the President tremblingly. Roosevelt couldn't help but laugh, and he told those diplomats on the spot about this difficulty. Then, he took a blank sheet of paper from the drawer, and asked them to sign on this blank sheet of paper—while asking each representative to trust him (Roosevelt), promising that what they were now signing was indeed the United Nations Declaration.

The diplomats also laughed, and they signed one after another. Later, this blank sheet of paper was pasted on the original agreement. They resolutely signed the largest blank check in history—and how valuable this check is will depend on how historians write about it in later generations.

### Several Novelists in Beiping

— Lü Xian

"Free Talk" using Chen Shenyan's novels, "New Garden" using Zhang Henshui, and "Great Park" using Old Woman, felt that the literary atmosphere in Shanghai had greatly changed; therefore, the author would like to briefly introduce several first-class famous writers in the North below:

Chen Shenyan, former editor of the Beijing News in Beiping, is calm and taciturn, just like his name. Since the Beijing News stopped publication, he has had very little contact with the outside world, and writing novels is his daily work. His works are mostly of the genre of expressing love in society, depicting tenderness and lingering feelings, which make people shed tears when reading them. Published novels include "Such a Clear Sky," "Doomed Jinghua," "Unspeakable," and "A Soul Lost in the Sea of Love," about dozens of kinds.

Zhang Henshui, former editor of the Beijing World Daily in Beiping, has a thin body, a slightly pockmarked face, a mouthful of gold teeth, a southern accent, and likes to sing Peking opera. The author once listened to him perform Chong Gongdao in "Escorting a Female Prisoner" and Zhang Sanlang in "Wulongyuan." His works include "The Unofficial History of Chunming," "Half-New Daughters," and "A Laughing Marriage," about dozens of kinds, all of which are works of romance, emphasizing the description of the characters' personalities.

Zhao Huanting is a master of martial arts set in the countryside, and he writes about the forms of women with bound feet in great detail. Before the war, he swept across the entire North China, and his works are too numerous to remember, but unfortunately, the author is not good at reading martial arts novels, and all the titles of this gentleman's novels cannot be remembered for a while.

Old Woman (Xu Yu Kai), former editor of the Beiping Zui Bao, is a middle school teacher, and is famous for editing the student edition, and is not originally a novelist. The two works he disclosed in Shanghai this time--"County Magistrate" and "Anti-Japanese Beauty"--are still his debut works, so the style is not like a chapter novel, and he writes in the tone of Beiping "storytelling," which has surprisingly become a unique style.

Huanzhulouzhu (Li Shoumin) is a peculiar novelist. The book "Legend of the Swordsman of Mount Shu" is so long that it cannot be measured in miles, because he involves the magical and can grasp the majority of readers. Sometimes his novel moves from newspaper A to newspaper B, allowing those who change their subscription to newspaper B in order to read his novels. The strength of its appeal is like this.

### First Time Being a Dad

— Qian Fanfu

On the day of the first snowfall this year, I became the father of a girl.

Although I had hoped for a boy beforehand, this didn't have much of an impact. I immediately felt a new human love's power stirring my soul. Although it wasn't as passionate as the love between husband and wife, it was more natural.

I was so moved that I smiled, but then tears fell. I created a small life, silently contemplating the wonders of creation. Her face really looked seven parts like me and three parts like my wife. After laughing, I couldn't help but shed tears like a spring. I thought about the responsibility that was weighed down on the shoulders of every new father, especially in this difficult era. I felt a combination of joy and fear.

My tears dried, and my thoughts condensed into a firm will—this was not a fantasy at the peak of emotion, but a vow to be upheld forever: I will always protect the love and obligations I am entitled to, and not only be an honest husband, but also be a good "dad."

### Carefree Flower

Chapter 5: Unexpected Disaster (20)

As soon as Xu Zhuzhai entered the room, he sat on the sofa, held his left leg, and frowned tightly, as if he couldn't bear the pain. Little Wang's mother poured a glass of water and asked him to drink it. Seeing that his knees and cuffs were covered with dirt, she used a towel to wipe it clean for him. Zhuzhai still held his left leg, complaining of pain. Little Wang's mother said, "Mr. Xu, take a look at your leg and see if the skin is injured, so I can find something to apply to it." Zhuzhai indeed pulled up his trousers, revealing his pale white calf, and then pointed to his leg bone, saying, "I feel uncomfortable with pain right here." Little Wang's mother took two steps closer, squatted down to take a look, and there wasn't even a hint of redness on the skin, so she said, "The skin isn't broken, I'm afraid the tendons and bones are injured, let me rub it for you." As she spoke, she stretched out her palm and gently rubbed where Zhuzhai pointed, while softly laughing, "People still say you practice martial arts, with such a small leg, so white and tender, what strength does it have!" As she spoke, she raised her head and glanced at Zhuzhai. Seeing her expression was very dissolute, Zhuzhai closed his eyes. He asked Xiao, "Who said I practice martial arts?" Little Wang's mother pursed her small mouth and said, "Your wife said it. That night, she said from under the stage that you get up at dawn every day, either yelling or practicing Baguazhang, and only come home in the evening, completely ignoring the family." Then, she lightly patted Zhuzhai's calf and said, "Such thin legs, and you still say you practice martial arts!" Zhuzhai suddenly opened his eyes and said, "You don't believe me?" Then, he exerted strength in his leg, and the calf immediately tightened and the tendons stretched. Little Wang's mother pinched it and it was like an iron pillar. She asked in surprise, "Mr. Xu, don't you feel the pain when you exert yourself like this?" As soon as Zhuzhai heard this, he quickly frowned. The muscles in the calf relaxed again. Little Wang's mother's hand was still rubbing on his calf, saying, "Rub it for a while longer, get up and walk around, move the muscles and bones, and it will be fine." Zhuzhai still kept his eyes closed, letting her massage him, while asking, "Did the boss go to the countryside?" Little Wang's mother pursed her small mouth and said, "She went to Director Lin's house. The boss just came back today, and hadn't even entered the house before she was picked up." Zhuzhai said, "What is this Director Lin's name?" Little Wang's mother put her hand under her chin and thought for a moment, saying, "It seems to be something like Futian. The boss always calls him that. It's said that he's from Fujian, and some say he's from Taiwan, I'm not sure. That face is very ugly, with a flat nose, sunken eyes, and flaring ears, three parts like a human, seven parts like a ghost!" Hearing this, Zhuzhai couldn't help but laugh. He said, "The boss is so beautiful, why would she be friends with such an ugly ghost?" Little Wang's mother raised her head and looked at Zhuzhai, saying, "Speaking of which, the boss is also very wronged. The boss has recently arranged several historical dramas and needs to add stage costumes. In order for this Director Lin to help her, she has to appease him." Hearing Little Wang's mother say these words, the suspicion in Zhuzhai's heart completely dissipated. He couldn't help but sigh silently, feeling that Jiang Wan was too pitiful.

### Mr. Li Denghui's Deeds

Mr. Li's given name was Denghui, courtesy name Tengfei, a native of Tongan, Fujian. His ancestors were surnamed Huang, but he followed his maternal family and became a Li. His father was Mr. Kaiyuan, and his mother was Madam Shen Bi'niang. He was born on March 24th of the twelfth year of Tongzhi (April 20, 1873, Gregorian calendar) in Hongba Village (Parmera) outside Batavia, Dutch-owned Java. At the age of fifteen (1887), he went to Singapore to study. At nineteen, he went to the United States and entered Wesleyan University, then transferred to Yale University. At twenty-seven (1899), he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree. The following year, he went to Binlangyu and served as the director of the English department at Yinghua College. He attended meetings organized by Mr. Sun Yat-sen to promote revolution. At thirty (1902), he returned to Batavia and became the principal of Yale School. In the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), at the age of thirty-three, he returned to China and went to Shanghai, where he co-founded the Real World Chinese Students' Association with Mr. Yan Junren, Mr. Wang Rutang, and Mr. Cao Xue. Mr. Li served as the president for several decades. In the autumn of the same year, Mr. Ma Xiangbo founded Fudan Public School in Wusong, and invited Mr. Li to be the chief instructor. Mr. Li delighted in nurturing talent and dedicated his life to it, starting from then. Later, Mr. Yan Youlu, Mr. Xia Jian, and Mr. Gao Mengdan successively served as supervisors, and Mr. Li served as the dean of academic affairs, responsible for hiring teachers and planning the curriculum. In the thirty-third year (1907), he married Ms. Tang Peilin. In the same year, he served as the examiner for students from Jiangnan studying abroad. In the first year of Xuantong (1909), he also served as the chief examiner for students from Zhejiang Province studying in the United States. In the third year (1911), he served as the chief writer for the Republican Advocate and concurrently taught at China Public School. When the revolutionary army rose, Governor Li Songqing of the Wuhan Military Government invited Mr. Li to preside over foreign affairs, but he did not go. During the North-South peace talks, he served as a consultant for Dr. Wu Zhiyong, the Southern representative. In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), Fudan Public School moved to Xujiahui. The following year, Mr. Xiangbo retired due to old age. At that time, the Kuomintang had just been established, and Chairman Sun Yat-sen and others recommended Mr. Li as the principal. In the sixth year, Fudan Public School was reorganized into a university, with departments of liberal arts, science, and commerce. In the winter of the same year, he went to various parts of Southeast Asia to raise funds. He returned to China in the seventh year and received an honorary doctorate from St. John's University in the eighth year. Mr. Li first purchased land in Jiangwan as the site for Fudan University. By the ninth year, he had accumulated more than seventy acres of land, and construction began in the tenth year. After much hardship, the project was finally completed. In the eleventh year, the lecture hall (Jian Gong Hall), the office (now the library), and a dormitory (destroyed by the Japanese寇, now Denghui Hall is built on the old site) were completed first. The university department moved to Jiangwan, while the Xujiahui campus was used for the middle school department. In April of the thirteenth year, Mr. Li went to various parts of Southeast Asia again to raise funds. After more than a year, he returned to China and established the Fudan Experimental Middle School. In the eighteenth year, in accordance with the Ministry of Education's regulations for universities, the university department was reorganized into four colleges: liberal arts, science, law, and commerce. Mr. Li had wanted to establish agricultural and architectural engineering departments, but both were unsuccessful (civil engineering courses have been taught since the twelfth year, and the university now has a college of agriculture). In January of the twentieth year, Madam Tang passed away. Mr. Li was deeply devoted to his marital relationship. He had three sons and one daughter, all of whom died young. His son Youren died at the age of nine. Bereaved of his spouse, he was depressed and almost beside himself. He also built a residence on Tengpei Road in Jiangwan, where he could enjoy his books, flowers, and trees in a small space. After Madam Tang passed away, he never lived there again. In the twenty-first year, the Japanese invaded Shanghai and destroyed it. In the twenty-third year, Mr. Li built the Fu Yu Institute on land he owned near the West Gymnasium Road in Jiangwan to collect street children who had dropped out of school, provide them with education and training, and enable them to become self-reliant through a skill. It had achieved initial results, but was destroyed by the Japanese in the August 13th Incident. In August of the twenty-fifth year, Mr. Li requested leave, and the board of directors appointed Mr. Qian Xinzhi as acting principal and Mr. Wu Nanxuan as vice principal. Mr. Li was then appointed as a legislator, but he declined. He then went down the Yangtze River and entered Shu, returning after three months. He was warmly welcomed by his students and acquaintances wherever he went, and the people of Sichuan were particularly impressed. Later, Fudan University was relocated to Sichuan, and local gentry were happy to assist. Mr. Li's trip paved the way for this. In the spring of the twenty-sixth year, Mr. Wu Zhihui transferred more than a thousand acres of mountainous land on the shore of Taihu Lake in Wuxi to Fudan University. Mr. Li, along with several directors, personally went to receive it and, together with Mr. Zhihui and Mr. Rong Desheng, inspected the site and indicated the location for construction. In the summer of the same year, he sent teachers and students from the civil engineering department to Wuxi to survey and plan. However, before the plan could be finalized, the Japanese invaded, and the school moved inland. Some teachers and students were unable to go due to the environment. Uncertain of what to do, Mr. Li established the Shanghai Fudan University Preparatory Department in the old foreign concession the following year. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the old foreign concession was also occupied by the Japanese. The enemy puppets wanted to gather popularity in order to rally support, so they secretly tried to coerce Mr. Li and Mr. Zhang Yongni. Mr. Yongni had heard something beforehand and claimed to be ill and did not go out, and sent someone to inform Mr. Li. Mr. Li then changed his name and hurriedly entered the Weida Hotel from his residence on Yuyuan Road, and did not let anyone know except his closest friends. After a while, he moved into Beverly House on Baise Zhong Road for almost a year. As the enemy puppets' surveillance gradually relaxed, he moved to Ruicun on Haige Road, and the Fudan University Preparatory Department, after moving three times to avoid danger, finally rented a house on Hede Road to start classes. During the eight years, Mr. Li personally handled all matters of the school, large and small, as in the past. The registration of new students and the grades of graduating students were reported to the Ministry and secretly sent to the wartime capital on time. At a time when the public was fearful, in a place under internal and external pressure, and at a time when livelihoods were precarious, he led the teachers and students to overcome all difficulties and ultimately preserved its integrity. In the thirty-fourth year (1945), the Anti-Japanese War was won, Fudan University had been changed to a national university, and Mr. Zhang Yousan had replaced Mr. Wu Nanxuan as the principal, returning from the wartime capital. Mr. Li gave detailed instructions on everything. Because the Jiangwan campus was occupied by the pseudo-Shanghai University during its fall, it was largely destroyed, and the Sichuan campus was expanded after several wars, plus the preparatory department, the number of teachers and students in both places, and the past teaching environment, there was no room for lectures, accommodation, and meals. For several months, he organized the old campus and planned new campuses. With the encouragement of Mr. Li, faculty and staff inside and outside the school overcame difficulties and did their best. After the completion, Mr. Li thanked the university for its school affairs and gave guidance at any time, responding to every question, and attending every major gathering to give instructions. The affiliated middle school and the affiliated experimental middle school were reorganized into a board of directors, and remained the private Fudan Middle School and the private Fudan Experimental Middle School, with Mr. Li serving as the chairman of the boards of directors of both schools, and concurrently serving as the principal of both schools, going to school every day to handle government affairs, with no cold or neglect. Mr. Li's spirit was as strong as before, but his eyesight was deteriorating, but he still went to the classroom every day to inspect. On the night of July 30, 1947, he suddenly suffered a stroke and was bedridden. His students were concerned about his illness and often talked to him about school matters. On November 19, at 4 pm, he passed away due to pneumonia, at the age of 75. He left a will that his brother Mr. Dengshan's third son, Xianzheng, be his heir. On the 22nd, he was buried in the Presbyterian Cemetery in Baziqiao, in the tomb prepared by Madam Tang. Mr. Li was very strict with himself and particularly frugal. He donated one-tenth of all his income from writing and royalties to public welfare and charitable causes, so he left nothing of value behind him. Mr. Li dedicated his life to education and had no intention of becoming an official. He gave full support to the development of culture, academic research, patriotic movements, and social welfare. He also gladly accepted and did his best in all public welfare and voluntary positions. He successively served as a member of the American Geographical Society, a member of the American Political Science Association, the vice chairman of the National Government's Opium Prohibition Committee, a member of the National Government's Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, the honorary chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation, the chairman of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, a member of the China Road Association, the president of the National Christian Youth Association, the president of the Shanghai Christian Youth Association, a member of the Chinese Christian Education Association, the president of the Chinese Child Welfare Association, and the chairman of the National Diplomacy Support Association. Mr. Li often wrote articles to express his views, which were published in newspapers and magazines. Mr. Li was intelligent and eager to learn, and always had a book in his hand. He learned Dutch, English, and Malay as a child. Due to local government regulations, he could not learn Chinese at an early age. After returning to China, he began to learn Chinese from others. In a few years, he was able to read and write fluently. While in the United States, he learned Greek, Latin, French, and German. In the early days of Fudan, students who studied ancient and modern foreign languages were taught by Mr. Li himself. He devoted particular effort to English. He served as the chief English editor of the China Book Company and also compiled textbooks such as "Practical English Textbook," "Cultural English Reader," "Li's English Composition," "Li's English Rhetoric," and "Important Factors in the China Problem," which were widely circulated at the time. The cooperative cause in China was pioneered by Mr. Xue Xianzhou of Fudan. After Mr. Xue passed away, Mr. Li worked hard to maintain it. Mr. Li was very devout in Christianity but rarely forced it on others, and particularly liked to talk about De Talk Kelsi. Fudan has had an administrative meeting since the 13th year. Mr. Li handled school affairs and made decisions based on public opinion, and his actions matched his words. He taught students by encouraging and rewarding them, making sure they believed before following. What he always said was that one must be willing to sacrifice to be successful, one must be happy to serve to be useful, and one must be able to unite to be powerful, with impartiality as the guiding principle. He was saddened by the rampant flow of human desires and lamented the suppression of justice, so he particularly emphasized moral revitalization. Mr. Li is gone, but his virtue is in people's hearts, his achievements are in people's eyes, and his words are in people's ears. It is said that there are three types of immortality, and Mr. Li possessed all of them. This is his deed.
