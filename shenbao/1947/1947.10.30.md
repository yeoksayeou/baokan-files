### US Aid Plan to China Approved; Relief Bill to be Submitted to Congress; Wang Shijie Returns to Nanjing, Holds Extensive Talks with Zhang Qun

[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, on the 28th, responded to Chairman Chiang's summons to Gu, reporting on his attendance at the UN General Assembly during his absence from the country, as well as discussions with White House officials. After four days of observations in Tokyo, he flew back to the capital by special plane at 5:15 PM on the 29th. That evening, at around 9:00 PM, he met with President Zhang at his official residence, talking late into the night before departing. It is widely believed that the issue of US aid was the central focus of Wang's discussions with Chairman Chiang and President Zhang. According to authoritative sources speaking to our reporter, Wang's extensive talks with President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Under Secretary of State Lovett in the United States have led the White House to have a deep understanding and concern about the current situation in China. It is possible that an understanding regarding aid to China was reached when Secretary Marshall met with Foreign Minister Wang in New York on October 14th for an extended conversation. The statement issued by the US State Department regarding its decision not to release the Wedemeyer Report in its entirety indicated that it was preparing to take action in the Far East. Recent widespread reports that the US government approved the Wedemeyer Report and its recommendations on October 21st are highly plausible. In principle, there are no longer any issues regarding US aid to China; the only remaining questions are the method and timing of concrete action. Regarding the former, the attention of the current Chinese government is not focused on loans, as experience has shown that the support provided by loans is short-lived and insufficient. Moreover, China's urgent need is not the portion of international payment loans that can be provided, and temporary economic stability is insufficient to eliminate the rebellion of the Communist bandits. It is certain that the authorities in China and the United States have agreed that military supplies and materials are the only effective means to strengthen suppression and stabilize society. According to this source, Pulitzer's proposals are quite practical in this regard. Under the current circumstances, the US military advisory group finds it extremely difficult to carry out its work, and expanding the organization is a necessary step. As for the timing of US aid to China, the source believes that some measures within President Truman's authority are expected before November 17th, but large-scale assistance will not be implemented until a decision has been made on the Marshall Plan for Europe.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 29th] Sources with authority in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed today that President Truman approved the plan to aid China on October 21st, the content of which is similar to the recommendations made by Pulitzer in his report on his trip to China published in Life magazine, including military and economic aid. According to Pulitzer's recommendations, $1.35 billion would be provided to China over three years, under US supervision and management.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Representative Bloom, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a Democratic Congressman, stated that he believes the relief bill to be submitted to the special session of Congress next month will include China. Whether China needs the same relief as other countries will be debated in Congress at the same time. Furthermore, according to sources in the State Department, the relief bill currently being drafted does not include China. The news also stated that a separate bill to aid China may be introduced during the regular session of Congress this winter, but it is often considered separately from the relief for Europe.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Dr. Henry, President of Lingnan University, warned the American people that if they do not aid China at this critical juncture, the United States will lose a great friend when China becomes the strongest nation in the Far East in the near future. Henry is in the United States to raise a fund of $100,000 for the United Christian Universities of China. In a speech he delivered yesterday at the Optimist Club, he said that the Chinese people are a great nation with traditional friendship towards the United States. He emphasized the courage of the Chinese people during the war, citing several examples to illustrate how Chinese farmers helped the American army in China. He told reporters that he will stay in the United States for several months before returning to Lingnan University.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Vice Minister Ye Gongchao stated that according to the Sino-American relief agreement signed on the 27th of this month, the relief supplies provided by the United States to the Chinese people are valued at approximately $30 million. Detailed information on the implementation of US relief in China will be announced as soon as it is completed and approved.

### Children in Washington Schools to Raise Food for Us

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Children in local schools will go to various homes on the 31st for Halloween (Halloween is the name of a beggar) to raise food for relief organizations in China and other countries, instead of asking for candy as in the past. According to past custom, children from schools often went to various homes to ask for candy on this day. If they were not given any, the doors and windows were often broken, or the walls were smeared with dirt. A local school is currently raising food for Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences in Nanjing.

[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] It was announced here that Mr. Berlin, the treasurer of the United China Relief, will lead the organization's New York committee in the final fundraising campaign of 1947 to carry out the organization's plans for education, health, and childcare, such as "Helping China to Automate".

### Australian Minister Plenipotentiary Explains Australia's Policy Principles Towards Japan; Guarantees Pacific Security Will Not Be Subjected to Japanese Aggression; Gradually Reforms Japan and Establishes a Democratic System

[News Report] Australian Minister Plenipotentiary to China, Professor Copland, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. At 4:00 PM, he held a press conference at the Hua Mao Hotel to explain Australia's policy towards Japan, focusing on two major principles: The first is to guarantee the security of the Pacific region, so that it will no longer be subjected to Japanese aggression. Therefore, Japan must be disarmed, freed from militarism, and its ability to wage war destroyed. Japan has already lost the ability to wage war in the short term, but there must still be appropriate supervision in the future; Australia strongly advocates the establishment of a supervisory body in which all eleven countries that fought against Japan can participate. The second is to establish a democratic system in Japan through the gradual reform of political, social, and economic institutions. Merely formulating a constitution and holding elections cannot fundamentally change the social institutions of Japan, but such a thorough change is necessary if Japan is to become a truly democratic country. Therefore, the establishment of international supervision is necessary. Professor Copland answered the questions raised by the reporters as follows: (Continued on page 2, column 1)

### 50,000 Yuan Notes Have Never Appeared in Shaanxi

[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Xi'an, 29th] Regarding Lou Tongsun's previous revelation that 50,000 yuan notes, a portion of 100 billion, would first be used to purchase cotton in remote provinces, our reporter recently learned from six relevant official and financial institutions in Xi'an that the quota for cotton transport and sales loans in Shaanxi this year, handled through the Cooperative Treasury, is 100 billion. However, this amount has not yet been remitted, so it is difficult to predict what kind of banknotes will be used for payment in the future. A certain party also stated firmly that the treasuries of various units here have not yet received such new banknotes. Another party believes that issuing new large-denomination banknotes in Shaanxi first would not be of much significance, as the financial activities here are closely related to those in Nanjing and Shanghai, and the demand for large-denomination banknotes in the financial center is greater than in Shaanxi. Furthermore, the special funds previously allocated by the China Textile Corporation for purchasing new cotton here have not yet been used due to the difficulty of sea transport.

### Britain Supports Early Convening of a Peace Conference with Japan

[Central News Agency, London, 28th, United Press] A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated that Britain supports the early convening of a peace conference with Japan, and said: "I do not know what position the British government will take if the Soviet Union refuses to participate in an early peace conference."

### Korea Should Gain Independence Soon; Gu Weijun Speaks at the UN Political Committee; Urges US and Soviet Union to Strive for a Solution

[Reuters, Lake Success, 28th] Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun spoke on the Korean issue at the UN Political Committee, requesting that the United States and the Soviet Union make another effort to resolve the Korean issue themselves. Gu believes that, for the sake of fairness, the solution to the Korean issue should not wait until the final resolution of the Japanese peace treaty. Gu stated that China agrees in principle with the US proposal and said that the Korean people should gain independence as quickly as possible. Before the troops withdraw from Korea, the following indispensable conditions must be met: The establishment of a provisional Korean democratic government; The organization of methods to maintain law and order; The occupying countries must guarantee that Korea will not fall into a vacuum and face the danger of civil war after the withdrawal of troops. Gu also stated that the Chinese government is prepared to agree to any conditions stipulated by the UN agencies, but must first seek the opinions of the four powers concerned, namely China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The US representative Dulles proposed: Early election of a Korean National Assembly; The National Assembly organizes a Korean National Government; The National Government receives the powers of the South and North Korean governments in an orderly manner; Withdrawal of all occupying forces; All of the above steps are implemented under the supervision of UN agencies. When reviewing the US-Soviet negotiations over the past two years, Dulles specifically pointed out two points: When the United States proposed on August 26th of this year that the four powers of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union hold a meeting to break the deadlock, the Soviet Union refused. When the United States announced that it would submit the matter to the United Nations mechanism, the Soviet Union suddenly announced that it was prepared to withdraw its troops in January next year. Dulles pointed out that the Soviet Union's troop withdrawal proposal is not a suitable solution, because there are currently two governments with completely different forms in North and South Korea. The Soviet Union did not explain how these two different forms could be connected before the troop withdrawal.

### Yulin Launches Defense War; Communist Bandits Occupy Heights Outside the City; Airfield Difficult to Use

[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Zhangjiakou, 29th] Military News: The defense war of Yulin in northern Shaanxi has restarted, and fierce fighting has been taking place in the suburbs for days.

They are also transporting grain and stretchers from northwestern Shanxi to gather around Yulin. Most of the bandits are currently moving north from the Baiyushan area, attempting to attack the North Gate and the Chaoyangguan area. The defending troops are calmly fighting back. In addition, a battle for the western side of the airfield has broken out, making it difficult to use the airfield. The situation is developing seriously.

[Another dispatch] Yulin is currently surrounded by Communist bandits. The Wulipu area south of the city and the 918 Heights have been occupied by the bandits. There was no fighting on the night of the 28th. A portion of the Communist bandits advanced to the Niujialiang area north of Yulin (20 li from the city). The National Army's Duan Baoshan unit is resisting. In addition, the city of Shenmu has been attacked by Communist bandits since the 28th.

### Members of the Underground Democratic League Should Register with the Security Authorities; Dong Xian Guang Declares at Press Conference

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Director Dong Xianguang of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, in response to inquiries about the Democratic League at a press conference on the 29th, stated: The activities of the Democratic League and its branches, which have already been declared illegal, will naturally be prohibited. As for its individual members, if there is no excessive behavior and they can abide by government laws and decrees, there is no need to worry. There are currently many members of the Democratic League who are hiding underground. If they can be reasonable and law-abiding, they should register with the local security authorities. As for Luo Longji and others, regardless of whether they register or not, everyone knows that they are members of the Democratic League.

[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] Huang Yanpei of the Democratic League specifically visited Zhang Qun on the 29th. They believe that the Democratic League can obey the order to dissolve, but there are several matters that must be handled before the dissolution. Therefore, they expressed dissatisfaction with the current situation of being under surveillance and specifically negotiated with Zhang Qun to request the lifting of the surveillance. According to Huang, Zhang Qun has indicated that the agencies under his command will lift the surveillance of the Democratic League, but as of the evening of the 29th, the surveillance personnel have not left, so the personnel of the Democratic League will continue to make efforts on the 30th. A reporter also asked Luo Longji what their plans were after the dissolution of the Democratic League. Luo said that whether they can still be regarded as free people in the future will be decided by the government. Regarding the inside information about the Democratic League announced by the Ministry of Interior on the 29th, Luo believes that since there is some factual evidence, the government can submit it to the court for litigation.

Vice Minister's Opinion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] After the government announced that the Democratic League was an illegal organization, a reporter interviewed Vice Minister Tao Xisheng of the Central Propaganda Department for his opinion. Tao stated: We expect Zhang Lan's "order" to stop the illegal activities of the Democratic League to be effective, and we also expect Luo Longji to formally declare his obedience to the government's orders. But if we expect them to extricate themselves, we will ultimately be disappointed. The unforgivable point of Luo Longji, Zhang Lan, etc. is that they are destroying Chinese political morality. We hope that the responsible security authorities will not allow them to escape the country, which can still protect them and prevent them from finishing the last stroke of Zheng Xiaoxu and Zhao Xinbo's deeds.

Kuomintang Will Not Support Cross-Party Candidates Competing for National Assembly Seats; Secretary-General of the Municipal Assembly Does Not Need to Resign to Compete for Supervisory Committee

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party firmly refused to amend their lists of National Assembly candidates, each accounting for two-fifths of the "cross-party" candidates. The Kuomintang seems to have conceded to this, but declared that it will not support these candidates in the election. It is reported that the Youth Party has already replied to the Kuomintang, stating that it is unwilling to amend the list, and the Democratic Socialist Party emphasized that the so-called cross-party candidate issue does not exist. According to people familiar with the inner workings of the various political parties, there are indeed many Kuomintang members on the lists nominated by the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party. Most of the Kuomintang members who were widely recruited by these two parties on the eve of this general election are disillusioned members of the Kuomintang, so in terms of Kuomintang party discipline, these members must be punished.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] According to the Ministry of Interior, as ordered by the Executive Yuan, the Secretary-General of the Provincial or Municipal Assembly or Provisional Assembly does not need to resign from the position of Secretary-General because his duties are different from those of the Assembly members, and he can participate in the election for the Supervisory Committee.

[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] The Kuomintang councilors held another symposium on the afternoon of the 29th to discuss election issues. The final decision was to submit the lists of more than 30 Kuomintang councilors who will participate in the election to President Chiang by Mo Dehui and Shao Lizi for reference.

[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Jinan, 29th] The Shandong Provincial Free Professionals' Organizations held a joint meeting on the 29th, stating that it is unfair to divide Shandong into the Eastern District and handle the election together with the recovered provinces and cities due to the quota allocated by election districts. It was decided to telegraph the government to request a change to the Northern District and to reserve the voting rights of members in the unrecovered counties and cities. The Shandong National Assembly Friendship Association also sent a telegram expressing the same view.

### National Army in Eastern Hubei Recaptures Huangmei; Brilliant Victories on the Foothills of Dabie Mountains; Local Forces in Eastern Henan Recapture Chenliu County

[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanchang, 29th] After Gui Yongqing inspected Jiujiang and strengthened patrols by Yangtze River warships, the defenses have become more consolidated. The Communist bandits entrenched in Huangmei were attacked by the National Army's powerful units, and the bandit army was routed and fled. The county seat has been recaptured, and the county's local troops have entered the city to clear the battlefield. The bandits from Guangji are also fleeing towards the northwest, leaving a small number of bandit troops entrenched in the suburbs, which are currently surrounded and attacked by the National Army. There are rumors that Guangji has been recovered, but officials have not confirmed it. In addition, Gui Yongqing will go to Hukou, Pengze, Madang, and other places within days to inspect the river defenses.

[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] The National Army in eastern Hubei recaptured Qishui again at dawn on the 29th. In addition, the remaining bandits in the northeastern foothills of the Dabie Mountains are nearing their end. Since the National Army launched a crackdown on Liu's 3rd Column, which had fled into the mountainous areas, from Lu'an and Shucheng in the northeast of the Dabie Mountains, they have achieved brilliant victories. On the 25th and 26th, they captured Huoshan, Maochang, Zhongmeihe, and other important strongholds on the eastern foothills of the Dabie Mountains. The bandits fled into the deep mountains in a panic, and the National Army in pursuit were the same soldiers who had held the Dabie Mountains for more than eight years during the War of Resistance Against Japan. On the 27th and 28th, a unit of the National Army annihilated more than 300 bandits and seized many of their military supplies in the Dahua Ping area southwest of Huoshan (this place was the second guerrilla base in the Dabie Mountains during the war). Another unit killed Li Yuntang, the commander of the 23rd Regiment of the 9th Brigade of Liu's 3rd Column, as well as political commissar Chen Huaitang and more than 200 others in the Xiejiatan area of Tianjianshan south of Huoshan, seizing a two-way radio and more than 100 rifles and machine guns. The more than 400 people captured in the Dongnuerjie area of Zhaishan on the 26th have been sent to Hefei from the front and are being treated with great courtesy.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 29th] The local forces recaptured Chenliu County at 5:00 PM on the 29th.

### Re-emergence of Fierce Battles in the Jilin-Changchun Area; Bandits Attempt to Invade Changchun Airport, Driven Back; National Army in Northern Liaoning Recovers Changtu Railway Station

[Special Dispatch from Changchun, 29th of This Month] Fighting broke out near Dafangshen Airport this morning, but the bandits were driven away by the National Army, retreating towards the Tangjiayingzi area in the northwest. The National Army is pursuing them. Gunfire was heard briefly in Changchun City last night, but the city was extremely peaceful during the day. The bandits' attack was intended to draw the National Army eastward towards Jilin and to halt the air transport of reinforcements. 10,000 bandits have been discovered entrenched in the northwest of Changchun, and may attempt to sneak into the suburbs again at night. It has been determined that the units are the "West Manchurian Independent 4th Division" and the remnants of the 2nd Column.

[Another Telegram] After the recent bandit disturbances in the Jilin-Changchun area, Changchun City heard the rumble of cannons and the crackle of gunfire for the first time last night. It was midnight, the moon was bright, and the stars were few. The outside temperature was four degrees Celsius below zero, and some people were awakened from their sleep. It is reported that several hundred bandits sneaked from Xiaolong towards Tangjiayingzi in the northern suburbs of Changchun, Zongjiawopu, and near the ten aircraft of Kuancheng at night. This group was a force that had been sent out by the National Army and was retreating. They were met by the National Army, and the bandits had fled far away by dawn. The area is the location of the 6th Precinct of the Changchun Police Bureau, and some officers were injured.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] The bandits who were defeated and wounded from the northwest suburbs of Changchun before dawn on the 29th are still wandering in the villages and towns north of Dafangshen and Kuancheng's two airports. Elite troops of the National Army stationed in Changchun are now launching a fan-shaped encirclement to wipe them out. Furthermore, according to military sources, crack troops of the National Army have been arriving in Changchun continuously by air in recent days, and the war in the Jilin-Changchun area is about to enter a new phase. Although the main force of the bandits' Independent 4th Division once fiercely attacked the north and west airports of Changchun, attempting to prevent the National Army from advancing north, the National Army's strength is formidable, and the invading bandits will undoubtedly be crushed.

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 29th of This Month] Artillery fire is raging in Jilin, and fierce offensive and defensive battles are unfolding. The main forces of the bandits' 2nd, 6th, and 10th Columns, as well as part of the 1st Column, and the Independent 12th Division, nearly 110,000 men in total, are besieging Jilin. The National Army is relying on solid fortifications to hold firm, and the air force is also constantly flying over to strafe them. From the night of the 28th, the bandits' 6th Column launched a fierce attack on Xiaobaishan, Jilin, with 4,000 men, while the 2nd Column attacked Weizishan with 3,000 men. At noon on the 29th, the National Army, with combined air, infantry, and artillery forces, repelled the bandits. On the night of the 29th, there was artillery fire near the outskirts of Jilin, and the defending troops have great confidence. The bandits are desperately trying to seize Jilin to open up the north-south railway transportation line. If they succeed, Dalian, North Korea, southern Liaoning, northern Songjiang, and even another national border could be connected. Therefore, they are attempting to capture it at all costs. The National Army is also determined to defend it firmly. This battle will be the decisive one in the bandits' sixth offensive.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] The situation in northern Liaoning is about to become clear. The National Army recovered Changtu Railway Station at noon on the 28th and is now advancing towards Tieling County.

### Editorial: A Proposal for Implementing Full Rationing Using Relief Food

The Sino-American Relief Agreement stipulates that China will be assisted with certain basic necessities of life, the first of which is food. Although the detailed figures have not yet been officially announced, it is expected that the amount will be considerable.

We associate the question of how to distribute these relief supplies with the issue of food rationing. Taking this city as an example: from price ceilings and negotiated prices to free trade, the problem of people's food has never been completely resolved; from free trade and sales at parity to partial rationing, the problem of people's food has never been completely resolved. Everyone knows that to completely solve this problem, it is necessary to start with full rationing, and to achieve full rationing, it is necessary to have sufficient supplies. However, the municipal government does not have these supplies at all, so there is no question of rationing. In the past and present, the food that the municipal authorities have relied on is only that allocated by the Ministry of Food, so they have had to sell it temporarily and ration it partially, according to their means.

According to Article 2(a) of the Agreement, "All American relief supplies shall be...distributed by the Chinese Government and by voluntary agencies already established in China and agreed upon by the two Governments." This article stipulates the distribution agencies. If this food is handed over to the municipal government or the already established Civil Food Allocation Committee for distribution, there will naturally be no problem.

The same article also states that "In the larger Chinese cities where circumstances permit, distribution and price control systems shall be inaugurated with a view to ensuring that all classes of the people, irrespective of their purchasing power, shall obtain an equitable share of relief supplies imported from abroad or produced locally. It is understood that American relief supplies obtained under this Agreement may be used to support Chinese efforts to improve fees and control prices." This is tantamount to stipulating that large cities such as Shanghai should implement a full rationing system; in addition to the domestic and imported foreign rice and flour, the relief supplies can also be used as support.

Article 4(a) stipulates that "The Chinese Government will exert every possible effort to secure the maximum production and collection of locally produced supplies required for relief." This means that our country should strive to increase production and purchase and store as much as possible in order to make overall plans for rationing. Subparagraph (b) also stipulates that "The Chinese Government undertakes that no measures shall be adopted which would reduce the local supply of any article of the nature herein described by reason of the delivery, sale, or granting of such article and thereby increase the burden of relief." This means that after using relief supplies and implementing overall rationing, the original supplies of local goods can only be increased, not reduced.

Article 3(d): "Chinese currency expenditures incurred by reason of relief supplies, including the work of the resident American Relief Mission, and certain emergency relief programs currently being carried out by Chinese Government agencies and voluntary agencies, shall be used to sell and pre-pay funds upon request of the American representative from the proceeds of the sale of American relief supplies." In this view, even the expenses required by the agencies handling the distribution of relief supplies, whether they are American, Chinese, or so-called voluntary agencies, may be paid from the proceeds of the sale of relief supplies, but the Chinese government will advance them first when necessary. Although Article 3(e) states that the Chinese government is responsible for "local expenses for the handling, inland transport, and distribution of relief supplies, including unloading and other port expenses," it is normally not allowed to pay for it with the above-mentioned price. "But the American representative is willing to consider using this fund with the Chinese government to meet extraordinary expenses, so as not to impose an excessive burden on the Chinese government." All the expenses of handling the rationing may be paid by the sales price.

There is no explicit provision in the agreement on how much food our country should bear when implementing full rationing. Assuming that each party bears half, and with the current population of the city being approximately 4.5 million, of which small households account for approximately one-quarter, calculating based on two *dou* for large households and one *dou* for small households, the city requires a total of 788,000 *shi* of rice per month. Then our country's rice rationing can proceed smoothly, without any major obstacles. If the U.S. side agrees, they can be allocated according to the current *shi* of rice, and the rest can be allocated from the relief food. Then, after these grains arrive, the so-called full rationing can be implemented immediately. The city's food problem can be completely resolved, and the fluctuations in rice prices will not affect general prices.

Article 1(d) of the Agreement states that "The Chinese Government shall, at any time in advance, present to the American Government its proposed plans for the number of import needs for economic relief: these plans shall be subject to review and approval by the American Government." The city's full rationing is in line with the provisions of the agreement and is appropriate for the needs of Lei Jing. It seems to be part of the government's plan and can serve as a reference for implementation in other major cities. The handling of these relief supplies can be completed entirely in 1946, and we hope to formulate plans as soon as possible and implement them on a scheduled basis to solve this serious problem.

Australian Minister Answers Reporters' Questions

[Continued from Page 1] Australia opposes retaining the veto power in the peace conference with Japan. Australia's opposition to the principle of the veto power has been consistent for a long time, and the records of the United Nations conferences are sufficient to prove it. Australia hopes that the peace conference with Japan can be convened as soon as possible, but this is unrelated to the opposition to the veto power. Furthermore, the various members of the British Empire do not intend to vote as a group in the peace conference with Japan. The various members of the British Empire will never appear as a group unless a common crisis arises. Australia believes that the decision on Japan's future industrial level should be based on two principles: one is not to give Japan the opportunity to re-invade, and the other is to maintain the hope of Japan's economic development. Regarding China's revitalization, Australia welcomes any news about China's internal revitalization, because China's revitalization is related to the peace and stability of the Far East. Australia does not want anyone to use Japan to become a force for stabilizing the Far East, because this move will make Japan the strongest country in Asia again and threaten the Allies again. The volume of trade between Australia and China in 1939 accounted for only 6% of China's total imports; to expand Sino-Australian trade, the key lies in China's internal revitalization. China must restore its export industry before it has foreign exchange to purchase goods from other countries. Regarding the future exercise of international supervision over Japan, Minister Gao advocates that each country should send representatives to Japan and demand that Japan implement political and economic reforms. As for the period of implementation of supervision, it is inevitable to become a pedantic view at this time, because the international situation changes at any time, and everything should be based on the actual situation. As for the issue of Japan's compensation, the total amount of compensation is still unknown at this time. This is a long-term task that should be carried out under the strict supervision of the Allies, and its distribution will benefit the entire region. It is worth noting that the amount of compensation for each war in history has been less than expected. Minister Gao finally pointed out that due to the evolution of the situation, Australia's responsibility in Southeast Asia and the Pacific has become heavier than in the past. Today, Australia has also implemented a rationing system, saving money on food and clothing, and donating 25 million pounds to help alleviate the British economic crisis. Regarding the newly emerging national forces in Southeast Asia after the war, Foreign Minister Evatt has declared that he is willing to "treat them with a realistic understanding attitude," but hopes that they will become a huge cooperative force to improve the living standards of people in the entire region.

Situation of Opening Trade with Japan

(Continued from Page 1) The reason for opening trade this time is to cope with American merchants and to encourage the import of raw materials. However, only foreign merchants are allowed to come to Japan, and Japanese merchants are not allowed to go abroad to promote sales. Therefore, Japan is actually in a passive position and cannot operate in the markets of other countries. Due to Japan's lack of raw materials and funds, its production capacity has been reduced, and it cannot export a large number of goods. Not to mention dumping, it is even more impossible to compete with other countries under the strict control of the Allied Headquarters. Except for seafood, bamboo, lacquerware, and consumables that can be purchased in cash, all machines and important hardware materials must be exchanged for imported raw materials. Surveying the current situation, it is difficult to expect Japan's exports to develop within a year, and Sino-Japanese trade is even less optimistic. According to records, our country owed Japan approximately 1.5 million US dollars last year. The amount has not been settled this year, and the amount is likely to be even greater, making procurement difficult. Although we have repeatedly argued that our country has suffered heavy losses due to the Anti-Japanese War and lacks materials, trade is different from compensation. If the outstanding accounts are not cleared, it is difficult to over-argue. If we do not change our strategy and actively increase our country's exports, all trade may be suspended. Furthermore, examining the progress of trade in other countries, the United States has provided a loan of 100 million US dollars to supply cotton in exchange for yarn and cloth. Since the end of the war, Australia has imported 7,000 bales of wool, and recently sent many experts to Japan to discuss the exchange of wool and the expansion of import quantities. Representatives from India also came here with the main task of exchanging cotton for machinery. The remaining British, Canadian, Philippine, and Dutch countries all have considerable activities. The close relationship between China and Japan should not be ignored. Opening trade aims to encourage commercial operations. Our country can award and encourage merchants to export. For imported materials, in addition to those directly purchased and stored by the government, it seems appropriate for exporters to undertake them with priority within the scope of control. It is said that the profits from imported materials are higher. The huge profits obtained from imports are used to compensate for exports. In addition, with strict foreign exchange control, the amount of exports can be easily increased.

### Xu Baiyuan's Speech: Four-Bank Joint Loan Policy

### Iron Ore Deposit on Hainan Island; Reserves Reach 200,000 Tons; May Become the World's Largest Steel Production Base

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] American steel experts believe that Hainan Island is very likely to be developed into one of the world's largest steel production bases.

He is currently in Japan as a private trader. It is said that preliminary negotiations on the immediate purchase of 100,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island are currently underway by the Chinese government. He told the Central News Agency reporter that, in view of the high cost of transportation between China and the United States, which may cause losses in transshipment, he is currently considering transporting this batch of iron ore to Japan, and after refining it into iron in Japan, reselling it to the Japanese government, or even reselling it to China.

### The Truth About the Illegal Activities of the China Democratic League

— (Continued from yesterday)

When the National Army recovered Changchun and the CCP's power in the Northeast collapsed, it urgently sought a delaying tactic. Therefore, the CCP delegation sent Qi Yanming and Wang Bingnan to Shanghai on May 28, 1946, to meet with Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, and Shen Junru of the China Democratic League to discuss with Zhou Enlai, Gai Biwu, Lu Dingyi, and Qi Yanming of the CCP. At that time, the CCP's conspiracy was to demand that the government stop military actions in the Northeast on one hand, and to insist on reorganizing the Northeast Political Committee and governments at all levels, with the participation of various parties, on the other hand. The China Democratic League stepped forward to work on this. On August 29th, the China Democratic League, following the CCP's instructions, sent representatives to meet with Marshall to propose a comprehensive ceasefire and the reorganization of the Northeast political institutions. Afterwards, the China Democratic League, together with the CCP, planned with Ma Xulun and Yan Baohang in Shanghai to launch their so-called anti-civil war movement to serve the CCP's purpose of buying time. This activity of the China Democratic League was unsuccessful, but its members entered the Northeast one after another to serve the CCP's puppet organizations.

The Issue of Reorganizing the Government: Expanding the government organization was to be implemented before the convening of the National Assembly according to the Five-Point Agreement of the Political Consultative Conference. Article 6 of this agreement stipulated that proposals discussed by the National Government Committee that involved changes to the policy guidelines must be approved by two-thirds of the members present to be passed. The CCP and the China Democratic League demanded that they must occupy 14 of the 40 seats on the Government Committee, which exceeded one-third, in order to maintain their so-called veto power. This request was opposed by other parties, causing disputes and delaying the reorganization of the government. This is enough to demonstrate the China Democratic League's close following of the CCP, and the CCP's trust in the China Democratic League to be its tool in political struggles.

The Issue of the National Assembly: Convening the National Assembly was one of the Five-Point Agreement of the Political Consultative Conference, originally scheduled to be implemented on May 5, 1946. When the meeting date was approaching, the CCP and the China Democratic League refused to submit the two lists of names for participation in the National Government and the National Assembly, so the government had no choice but to announce the postponement of the National Assembly. In June of the same year, the government set the date for the National Assembly to be convened on November 12, but the China Democratic League still followed the CCP in refusing to submit its list of representatives to participate in the National Assembly. On October 28, Mo Dehui and other social figures came forward to mediate, with third-party figures signing to attend the National Assembly as a condition for postponing the National Assembly for three days, so that the government and the CCP could reach an agreement on the reorganization of the government and military issues within these three days. Luo Longji and others of the China Democratic League also signed, but Zhou Enlai severely criticized Liang Shuming and others of the China Democratic League, and they realized that this decision violated the CCP's intentions and canceled their signatures. This was the last manifestation of the China Democratic League following the CCP in peace negotiations. The details can be seen in Zhang Junmai's explanation published in the newspapers on October 14, 1947.

The Issue of Peace Talks: The Agreement on the Cessation of Conflicts and Restoration of Communications in January 1946 and the Plan for the Reorganization of the National Army and the Unified Integration of the Communist Army into the National Army in February were the basis for peace negotiations, and the representatives of the China Democratic League also participated in the signing of the agreement on military issues of the Political Consultative Conference. However, throughout 1946, peace negotiations were delayed and ultimately failed due to the CCP's insistence on military separatism and intensified military rebellion. During this year, the China Democratic League echoed the ceasefire when the CCP proposed a ceasefire, such as the negotiations after May, and also opposed the ceasefire when the CCP opposed the ceasefire, such as the negotiations on the eve of the National Assembly. In its propaganda, the China Democratic League repeatedly blamed the government for the delay in peace talks in its speeches and documents. Its political report at the Second Plenary Session completely spoke on behalf of the Communist bandits, accusing the government of being responsible for the failure of the peace talks.

After the National Assembly closed, the CCP was determined to carry out military rebellion to the end, insisting on unreasonable conditions and opposing the resumption of peace talks. The China Democratic League also followed its instructions, launching propaganda against the peace movement initiated by Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yunchu, and other figures from the Shanghai business community. The China Democratic League believed that only resistance to conscription and grain taxes in the countryside and resistance to donations and taxes in the cities were true peace movements. Luo Longji openly stated that the China Democratic League would not participate in peace talks that did not aim at genuine peace. From then on, the China Democratic League abandoned the peace movement and devoted itself to underground work of resisting conscription, resisting grain taxes, resisting taxes, resisting donations, and inciting student and worker movements.

The Anti-American Movement: The CCP started the anti-American movement in July 1946, and the China Democratic League also followed the instructions and echoed consistently. In September, the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee designated it as the "Anti-American Propaganda Shock Month." First, Chen Jiakang, Qiao Mu, Fan Changjiang, and others were sent by Zhou Enlai of the CCP to contact Luo Longji, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Liu Wangliming, and others of the China Democratic League. The CCP funded the China Democratic League to enable it to orchestrate the so-called "Ten Major People's Organizations" and establish the "World Peace Promotion Association" to hold the "US Troops Withdraw from China Propaganda Week" from September 23 to September 29.

On September 27, Deng Chumin and others of the China Democratic League in Chongqing, Zhang Dongsun and Zhang Shenfu of the China Democratic League in Beiping, and Hu Yuzhi and Hu Shouyu of the China Democratic League in Singapore held anti-American symposiums or representative meetings simultaneously. Other places such as Hong Kong and Kunming also launched actions one after another. The CCP launched a response from its Communist bandit-occupied areas inside and outside the customs starting on October 7. In mid-to-late November, the China Democratic League cooperated with the CCP again to launch propaganda against the Sino-US Commercial Treaty in Shanghai, Chongqing, and Beiping. To this day, this propaganda continues to intensify.

The Issue of International Interference: Before the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in March 1947, the China Democratic League, accepting the CCP's instructions, launched a movement to demand international joint interference in China's internal affairs to increase the CCP's momentum. The Shanghai Wenhui Daily and its associated newspapers spared no effort in advocating international interference, which was obvious to all. Zhang Lan and other responsible persons of the China Democratic League, together with personnel from the China Association for Promoting Democracy and the China National Democratic Construction Association, jointly telegraphed the British, Soviet, and American foreign ministers' meeting, attacking the United States and requesting the three countries to jointly discuss the China issue. The professional students guided by the China Democratic League also launched the same movement in some universities in Beijing and Shanghai, demanding international interference in China.

(B) The China Democratic League Undertakes Bandit Area Work

The Fact

While the China Democratic League undermined the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference, refused to participate in the National Assembly and the National Government, and expelled the Chinese Social Democratic Party for participating in the National Assembly and the National Government, on the other hand, it systematically participated in the CCP's illegal regime. After the CCP's Northeast Bureau convened the "Northeast Provincial and Municipal Representative Conference" in Harbin from August 7 to August 15, 1946, and established the puppet "Joint Administrative Office of Northeast Provinces and Cities," personnel of the China Democratic League rushed to the Northeast bandit area to hold important puppet positions. The facts are listed on the left:

The Communist bandits absorb League members to go to the bandit area: In September 1946, Zhou Enlai in Shanghai discussed with Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and others of the China Democratic League to register unemployed personnel of the China Democratic League to go to the bandit area to work. The original letter from the CCP delegation to the headquarters of the China Democratic League is recorded below:

Entrusted by Mr. Zhou Enlai, a record of talks with your League is enclosed. There are more than 300 unemployed members of your League in the Beijing-Shanghai area, many of whom are serving in cultural, educational, industrial, and commercial circles with high capabilities. Our delegation will first register them for job placement. Our delegation has assigned Comrade Hua Qiang as the person in charge of registration in Nanjing, located at the Xinhua Daily Office at 360 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing. Please notify the unemployed members of your League that those who are going to work in the liberated area should bring a letter of certification from your League and go to the above location to register, starting from September 26, 1946.

### Vigorously Seeking to Resolve the Stalemate in the Korean Issue; Britain Supports the US Proposal; the Soviet Union Still Insists that the US and Soviet Union Should Withdraw Their Troops First, and Advocates Inviting Korean Representatives to Participate in the UN General Assembly Discussion

[United Press International, Lake Success, 28th] Britain fully endorsed the US proposal to establish a United Nations commission to supervise elections in Korea and the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from the country. Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British representative and also the president of the Security Council, told the UN Political Committee that it was crucial to have a neutral body to oversee the Korean elections. Cadogan opposed the Soviet proposal to have the two countries withdraw their troops and allow the Korean people to establish their own government without foreign assistance. He said that this might cause greater chaos and that the British government was unwilling to take responsibility for this. Cadogan also opposed the Soviet proposal to have Korea send appropriate representatives to the United Nations to participate in the discussion of their national affairs. He said that this would cause serious and insurmountable difficulties because these representatives could not arrive in Lake Success in time for this session of the United Nations General Assembly. He believed that at the current stage, there could be no genuine Korean representatives here, and furthermore, he did not think it was necessary. The US proposal did not seek to impose any particular regime on the Korean people. After Cadogan's speech, the Polish representative, Mr. Bobke, rose to speak and expressed his support for the Soviet proposal made by the Soviet representative, Gromyko, on the 28th. Gromyko reiterated that US and Soviet troops should withdraw first, and that Korean representatives should be brought to Lake Success for discussion before the US proposal is put to a vote. However, the Australian representative, Evatt, pointed out that the Soviet proposal was not submitted in writing. The Chairman of the Political Committee, Mr. Rosenbert, representing Mr. Bische, agreed to this point and immediately adjourned the meeting until 11 a.m. on the 29th. Prior to this, Evatt strongly argued that Australia and several other countries had participated in the Pacific War longer than the Soviet Union, so the relevant countries in the Pacific should not be excluded from the consultations on Korean issues in Moscow and other places.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 29th] A spokesman for the US delegation stated today that the United States opposes the Soviet Union's request for the United Nations General Assembly to invite representatives of the Korean people to participate in the debate on Korean independence and to order US and Soviet troops to withdraw from Korea before January 1 next year. The Soviet proposal is unnecessary and appears to be delaying or even stopping the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the case. (See the draft of Gu Weijun's speech on the first page)

### The Truth About the Korean Issue

[Reuters, Lake Success, 29th] Behind the Korean issue lies a complex and difficult political situation similar to that in the Balkans. Although the US and the Soviet Union mutually accused each other of lacking faith in the negotiations on Korean independence in the first round, neither side mentioned the political reality that exists behind the current stalemate. The main obstacle to Korean unification is the disagreement on the form of the interim government. The Soviet Union insists that Koreans who opposed trusteeship in the past should not participate, which in effect means that no one except the Communist Party should participate, while the United States insists that all political parties should participate.

Regarding the organization of the interim government, the Soviet Union insists that Koreans should form their own government without external interference because it believes that the Communist Party in North Korea is more tightly organized and stronger than the non-Communist parties in South Korea. Therefore, if elections are not held under US supervision, the Korean Communists can monopolize all important positions through their propaganda. The US authorities, in order to cope with the political weaknesses in its occupied area, insist that the Korean parliament should be elected according to a proportional representation system, so that the southern region, which accounts for two-thirds of the total Korean population, can obtain a two-thirds majority.

### US Security Advisory Council Strictly Prevents Leaks of Secrets

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] The Security Advisory Council of the US State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff is currently organizing a mechanism to handle the issue of classified intelligence, aiming to prevent leaks of intelligence that endanger US security and put the US in a desperate situation. The council recommends the following classification of classified intelligence: Top Secret, Highly Secret, Secret, Restricted Circulation. A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on Undersecretary Lovett's statement that the Top Secret report of Wedemeyer has caused great damage to US security.

### Danish Elections Announced; Communist Party Suffers a Setback but Shows Slight Recovery

[Associated Press, Copenhagen, Denmark, 29th] It was learned today that the final vote count of the parliamentary elections showed that the Communist Party lost nine of its original eighteen seats in the Lower House, occupying only nine seats. The right-leaning Farmers' Party received the most votes, winning 49 seats, eleven more than in the last election. Most observers believe that the reason for the Communist Party's failure is its recent demand for the purge of Congress and its activities in various European countries.

### US Journalist Comes to China for a Visit

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 28th] Robert McCormick, publisher and chief editor of the authoritative "Chicago Tribune" in the western United States, flew to the Far East today with his wife for an inspection tour. McCormick said that the purpose of this trip was to gather news, and he plans to visit Japan, Korea, China, and Egypt.

### Bullitt Criticizes the Soviet Union; Points Out that the Soviet Union Intends to Conquer China; Emphasizes that Stalin Should Be Forced to Back Down

[United Press International, New York, 29th] Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union William Bullitt criticized the Soviet Union for wanting to rule the world with communism and to strengthen itself in order to "attack the United States." Bullitt said: "The Soviet Union's goals have never changed. Unless the people of the Soviet Union can control their government, these goals will never change. Stalin will never know when to stop. We can only force Stalin to back down. At present, the Soviet Union does not dare to discuss launching a war against the United States. The Soviet Union is currently strengthening its national power in order to attack the United States in the end. At present, the Soviet Union is consolidating its control over 120 million Europeans and wants to seize France, Italy, Greece, and conquer China."

### Communist Rebellion in Bolivia Suppressed

[Associated Press, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 28th] It is reported that the Communist revolutionary movement in the Bolivian region of Bakri has been suppressed by the Bolivian government.

[Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 28th] The Brazilian Army Ministry, in view of the fact that the Communist Party in neighboring Bolivia has attacked and occupied the border town of Guaramirim, has ordered the Brazilian Army to take every measure to ensure Brazil's neutrality.

### US Congressional Special Session is Approaching; Marshall Returns to Washington; Truman Begins Drafting Legislation

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 29th] US Secretary of State Marshall returned to Washington on the 29th to prepare for the congressional special session on aid to Europe. He may come here at any time to discuss major issues at future UN General Assembly meetings, but the routine work in the UN General Assembly has been handed over to US Chief Representative Austin.

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] President Truman began today to draft his message to the special session of Congress, which will recommend legislation to implement the Marshall Plan for European Recovery. President's Press Secretary Ross announced this and said that the President has received some recommendations decided by the Harriman-led Foreign Aid Advisory Committee. Authoritative sources revealed that the main contents of the plan have been tentatively set as: Congress approves an appropriation of 7 billion yuan as the aid amount for the first year of the four-year European Economic Recovery Plan, with a total of approximately 20 billion yuan needed in four years, with the annual needs decreasing in turn. The governments of the European countries participating in the Marshall Plan form a multilateral agreement, accept the principles of the plan proposed by the United States, and the United States and each European country government conclude bilateral agreements. This indicates that European countries should also do their best, like the United States, to help the implementation of the Marshall Plan. Each participating European country is responsible for including the proceeds from the sale of goods obtained from the United States in its budget. For example, if the United States supplies wheat to France under the Marshall Plan, France does not have to pay for the wheat, but it will include the number of francs equal to the US dollar value of the wheat it receives in its budget revenue item. This franc will be used to increase France's contribution to the implementation of the Marshall Plan. This measure can reduce the amount of US dollars required for the old Marshall Plan.

### Taft Criticizes the Marshall Plan

[Associated Press, Boston, 28th] Senator Robert Taft said on the 28th that the Marshall Plan in its current form is "completely unreasonable." Taft, a Republican nominee for president, is probably the most powerful leader of the Republican Party in Congress. His criticism of the government's aid to Europe plan almost certainly indicates that he will lead the struggle in the special congressional session on November 17. He said that the reason why the United States has inflation is because it is helping foreign countries too much. He criticized the shipment of coal and steel to Europe, saying that Europe has abundant coal reserves, while steel is also in short supply in the United States.

### US Small Plane Completes Round-the-World Flight

[Associated Press, Shemya, Alaska, 28th] A small monoplane piloted by Truman and Evans landed here at 1:35 Greenwich Mean Time. They departed from Nemuro, Hokkaido, Japan, and crossed the harsh North Pacific Ocean, flying 1,500 miles in 13 hours and 35 minutes. They left the United States on August 9 for a round-the-world flight, and landed on US soil on October 28. The place where they landed tonight is at the western end of the Aleutian Islands.

### European Countries Launch Organization of Customs Union; the Soviet Union is Invited to Participate in Discussions

[Reuters, The Hague, 28th] The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have invited the governments of all European countries, excluding Spain and Germany, including the Soviet Union, to meet in Brussels on November 10 to discuss the possibility of organizing a European customs union.

[Reuters, London, 28th] Financial experts from Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and Italy, who participated in the meeting of the Payment Agreement Committee established at the Marshall Plan meeting last month, have decided to recommend to their respective governments that they sign an agreement stipulating monetary cooperation on a multilateral basis. Relevant parties said that although a complete agreement has been reached on the principle of exchange, other countries still believe that the proposal of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and Italy to establish a central exchange office is premature.

### US Will Launch a Broad Propaganda Offensive to Counter the New Comintern; US Military Government in Germany Will Purge Left-Leaning Elements

[Associated Press, Berlin, 28th] US Military Governor in Germany, General Clay, told a press conference on the 28th that he might retire from the military next year. He has requested the Army Department to allow him to retire in 1948 so that he can get rid of military and public life and return to his hometown of Georgia for fishing. It is said that the United States plans to launch a propaganda offensive in Germany to "defend the doctrines we believe in and attack the doctrines we do not believe in." Officials said that the purpose of this new plan is to deal with the Communist Information Bureau. General Clay's statement is the intention of the United States to launch a propaganda offensive around the world, because the Soviet Union is spreading propaganda around the world trying to defeat the power of the United States. General Clay said that the United States' propaganda does not attack any foreign government, but is explaining US policy. The military government has ordered that no government official may attack a foreign government in public speeches, and at the same time, those in the US military government who deeply believe in communism will be dismissed.

### US-Soviet Dispute Over Repatriation of Japanese POWs Resurfaces

(United Press, Tokyo, 29th) The United States and the Soviet Union clashed again today at the Allied Council for Japan. The chairman of the council, U.S. representative Mr. Sebald, accused the Soviet Union of failing to fulfill its agreement to repatriate Japanese prisoners of war. Soviet representative Mr. Kislenko claimed that the U.S.'s inclusion of the POW repatriation issue on the agenda was merely an attempt to incite anti-Soviet sentiment among the Japanese. Mr. Kislenko also said that the treatment of repatriated Japanese prisoners was miserable, tantamount to leaving them to their own devices. The issue of repatriating prisoners was not within the scope of the council's discussions. Mr. Sebald replied that a matter affecting so many Japanese people should be discussed.

### Democratic Party of Japan: Horizontal and Vertical Alliances; Mr. Shigeru Yoshida Expected to Become Next Prime Minister

(New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th) The Democratic Party is studying countermeasures regarding the conservative new party movement centered on the Liberal Party. Given the current cabinet's dire straits, the Democratic Party is concentrating its efforts with the aim of securing the next prime minister position. Ichimatsu and Kimura, both traditionally considered part of the Kijūrō Shidehara faction, have also expressed their strong support for Mr. Yoshida to assume the premiership in the next term. They have also temporarily agreed to unify within the party. However, regarding the Liberal Party, they have proposed forming a four-party coalition cabinet. If the Liberal Party objects, they appear poised to adopt divisive tactics toward the Liberal Party. Currently, the conservative new party movement and the four-party coalition cabinet movement centered on Mr. Yoshida seem to be intertwined. The People's Cooperative Party also shows a tendency to merge with the Democratic Party. As for the Socialist Party, there seems to be an understanding on the part of Mr. Nishio. However, if Mr. Nishio leans too close to the Democratic Party, Mr. Hirano may take opposing action.

### United Press Female Employee Suddenly Arrested in Budapest

(Reuters, Budapest, 28th) Miss Elizabeth Berelos, an American secretary to Mr. Jack Quin, a correspondent for the United Press in Budapest, has been arrested by the Hungarian political police. The reason for the arrest has not been announced.

### French Communists Hold Large Demonstration to Obstruct Pro-de Gaulle Anti-Soviet Rally; Military Police Deployed, Leading to Fierce Clashes

(United Press, Paris, 28th) Fifteen thousand members of the French Communist Party staged a demonstration march on the 28th, attempting to break through a pro-de Gaulle anti-Soviet rally, but were ultimately dispersed by police using batons and bayonets. This incident occurred just after Prime Minister Paul Ramadier requested a vote of confidence from parliament for his coalition government. Prime Minister Ramadier stated in parliament that civil war was almost inevitable if France were to be divided into two opposing camps, left and right. The vote will take place on the 30th (Thursday).

Many demonstrators were injured, and twelve gendarmes were also injured by stones. The clashes lasted for two hours. A large contingent of regular army troops, carrying submachine guns, arrived to maintain order, and the clashes finally ceased. The pro-de Gaulle rally was originally scheduled to take place at the Wagram Hall on Wagram Street in eastern Paris. Police drove the Communist crowd from Wagram Street to Place des Ternes, and then cavalry dispersed them from there. As police dispersed the demonstrators, the cries of women in the crowd along the street shook the heavens. The windows of all the shops at the scene had been smashed, and shoes, handbags, and other items dropped by the demonstrators were seen all along the street. Many demonstrators have been arrested. The pro-de Gaulle rally was eventually able to proceed, only delayed by thirty minutes due to the incident.

(United Press, Paris, 29th) The military police's dispersal of the Communist demonstrators has caused Paris to experience its most serious political incident since the liberation on the 29th. The leftist "L'Humanité" called the incident a "bloody attack," accusing Prime Minister Ramadier of being a "protector of anti-Soviet thugs." The newspaper also stated: "This is the result of a policy of selling out the interests of the French people, and the result of obeying the policies of the gold standard empire."

It is said that in October 1946, he secretly arrived in Andong with Xu Shou-xuan and Yuan Dongzhi, a director of the Shanghai Democratic Promotion Association, and then traveled to Harbin. (Note: Xu Shou-xuan was also one of the heads of the Northeast National Salvation General Association, and went to Harbin to take up the position of Administrative Committee Member of the Pseudo-Political Affairs Office. Yuan returned to Shanghai in May 1947 and stayed at the residence of Zhang Junbo of the Democratic Promotion Association.)

At the same time, he suggested to the CCP that the central leadership should remain behind the scenes in the student movement, and delegate the executive power to the Democratic League, as there were many Democratic League members in the education sector. The CCP accepted this suggestion. (Note: The Pseudo-Yan'an University was an institution used by the Communist bandits to train cadres.)

Chen Jinkun - Preparatory Committee Member of the Democratic League's Liberated Area Branch, Professor at the Pseudo-Yan'an University.

(C) Facts about the Democratic League Participating in Communist Bandit Military Rebellion

The Process of Zhou Jingwen, Luo Binji, and Others Colluding with Communist Bandits to Establish a Pseudo-Regime.

Splitting China's Northeast Territory and Sovereignty has been a consistent conspiracy and ambition of the Communist bandits. The Democratic League has been their political and military assistant. Before the National Assembly in 1946, Zhou Jingwen, a Standing Committee Member of the Democratic League, met in Shanghai with Chen Jianzhong, the head of the "Northeast Youth Association," a representative of the remnants of the puppet Manchukuo, and decided to request the Communist bandits to demarcate an area in the Northeast, concentrate their forces, and jointly establish a pseudo-"Northeast Autonomous Government" with the Communist bandits, the Democratic League, and the "East Youth," etc. Chen Jianzhong was then introduced by Zhou Jingwen to meet with Dong Biwu, a representative of the Communist bandits. Dong agreed to introduce Chen and others to meet with Lin Biao and Li Lisan for discussions. According to Zhou Jingwen's statement to Chen, if they could gather troops, the Communist army could provide a region. If they could issue a ceasefire slogan and establish a pseudo-government before March 10, 1947, it might attract international attention.

In January 1947, Zhou Jingwen dispatched Luo Binji (listed as an Executive Committee Member of the Democratic League's Northeast Branch in the list submitted by the Democratic League to the government) to the Northeast with Chen Jianzhong to inspect the strength of Chen's troops and to connect with old and new connections in various places in Northeast and North China. Luo traveled out of the pass from the Beining Line via Shenyang to Changchun. The "Preparatory Committee of the Northeast People's Autonomous Committee," led by Zhou Jingwen of the Democratic League, the "Northeast Youth Association" led by Chen Jianzhong, and the "Northeast People's Patriotic Support Association," which Chen had won over, signed an "Agreement" in Changchun on March 8th to establish the pseudo-"Provisional Northeast People's Autonomous Committee" and the pseudo-"General Headquarters of the Northeast People's Autonomous Army." The pseudo-Central Committee of the pseudo-Autonomous Committee had one chairman, assumed by Zhou Jingwen of the Democratic League; and seventeen committee members, including four from the Democratic League, four from the Communist bandits, eight from five groups including the "Three Principles of the People Comrades Association," the "Northeast Cultural Association," the "Northeast Political Construction Association," the "Northeast Youth Association," and the "Northeast People's Patriotic Support Association," and one so-called "social notable."

After the establishment of the pseudo-Autonomous Committee, Luo and others secretly gathered forces and issued a "Letter to Northeast Armed Comrades," inciting the National Army to mutiny. They also issued a "Letter to Fellow Representatives" in the individual name of Zhou Jingwen, which had already been printed on January 17th, encouraging the people to betray the country. On March 11th, Luo Binji and a party of six set off for Harbin to meet with the Communist bandit Lin Biao, conspiring to discuss the demarcation of an area by the Communist bandits, concentrating the forces of Chen Jianzhong, and issuing a telegram during the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference to establish a pseudo-government. Luo and others were detained or searched by the National Army on the Changchun front, and many drafts and secret documents were seized. According to their confessions, they were ordered by Li Jishen and Zhou Jingwen to collude with the Communist bandits and engage in treasonous activities. (Continued on Page 5)

### Nanjing Promotes Frugality; Dance Ban Implemented in Stages; Short-Term Partial Ban First; Frugality Measures for Private Cars and Gasoline Resolutely Implemented

(Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th) The Executive Yuan's Frugality Supervision Committee has decided that the enforcement of the dance ban in Shanghai will first implement a portion of it in the short term. As for a complete ban, the method is still awaiting detailed proposals from Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, before discussion. The principle will be to implement it in stages, with a timeframe shorter than one year. The Frugality Supervision Committee held a meeting at 4 PM on the 29th, attended by Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, to report on the difficulties of implementing the dance ban in Shanghai and the demands of the dance industry. The meeting also discussed other frugality-related issues, such as restrictions on gasoline for private cars, and resolved to resolutely implement the originally promulgated frugality measures.

### Meeting on Gasoline Rationing for Vehicles

(Our Newspaper) The city's Committee on Gasoline Rationing for Vehicles held a meeting yesterday at the Public Utilities Bureau. It was resolved that cases involving discrepancies in gasoline usage for commercial trucks and small package cars would be submitted to Shen Naizheng, a counselor to the city government, Shi Bangfan, a representative of the City Council, Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Rentao, the Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, for joint review. If they deemed the need to be genuine, the Public Utilities Bureau would borrow gasoline from the oil companies on their behalf. Concrete measures will be formulated later. However, the committee unanimously agreed that the situation regarding industrial gasoline usage warranted attention. Because there are no precise statistics on industrial electricity usage in the city, oil companies should include vehicle gasoline usage when allocating gasoline to factories. In reality, however, factory vehicles still obtain gasoline purchase permits from the Public Utilities Bureau, resulting in duplicate allocations. Therefore, the committee believes that a thorough investigation is necessary. Representatives from the oil companies have expressed their willingness to cooperate and will submit detailed reports on industrial gasoline usage in the future to avoid duplication and compensate for shortages. As for the city's method of allocating gasoline based on vehicle type, it will be formulated after the review is complete.

### Fifteen City Councilors Propose Temporary Motion to Relax Restrictions on Private Cars; Public Utilities Bureau Decides to Establish Review Committee

After the Executive Yuan issued an order restricting the use of gasoline for private vehicles, the City Public Utilities Bureau followed suit by issuing a public notice stating that, starting from October 14th of this year, registration and licensing for cars would be suspended for all private individuals or private legal entities, except those who met the requirements of the regulations and were approved to use a certain number of vehicles. City Councilors Wang Zhuyi, Wu Zhengji, Ma Junshuo, Tao Baichuan, Jiang Hao, Gao Shuan, Zhu Fuji, and fifteen others believe that, in addition to the private individuals and private legal entities stipulated in Article 3 of the regulations, there are also private hospitals, schools, various guilds, labor unions, charities, as well as councilors, lawyers, accountants, architects, and engineers, whose nature and business, or public needs, are not significantly different from those of doctors listed in Category 1 and banks, factories, mines, and newspapers listed in Section 2. Therefore, the scope of private individuals and private legal entities permitted to use cars should be slightly relaxed. Furthermore, the transfer of ownership of private cars is a common occurrence, and since there are no restrictions on such transfers in the regulations, they should continue to be permitted freely to avoid the loss caused by freezing vehicles. The councilors have jointly submitted a temporary motion to the City Council with the above opinions, which will be discussed at the fourth general meeting to be reconvened tomorrow.

Three Points of Supplementary Opinion

The three points of supplementary opinion that they propose to suggest to the central government are as follows:

In addition to the physicians stipulated in Article 3, Section 1 of the regulations, other lawyers, accountants, architects, and engineers who are legally registered, as well as public officials such as councilors, should be permitted to use cars due to business and public needs.

In addition to the banks, factories, mines, newly opened newspapers, and large-scale private enterprises related to daily necessities stipulated in Article 3, Section 10 of the regulations, other legally registered private hospitals, schools, and legal entities, such as various guilds, labor unions, and charitable organizations, should be granted some relaxation of restrictions and permitted to use cars.

All private cars should be permitted to be transferred to any private individual or private legal entity.

Responsible for Review and Research

After the City Public Utilities Bureau issued the regulations restricting the use of cars by private individuals, it attached great importance to whether applicants for car registration or transfer met the regulations and how to eliminate vehicles that did not comply with the central government's regulations. To handle matters properly, it has decided to establish a "Private Car Use Restriction Review Committee" to be responsible for reviewing and researching this work. As for the composition of the committee, it has also been decided that each of the seven units of the city government, the Health Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, the City Council, and the Import and Export Management Committee will send a representative to form it. Once the committee is established, all applications for registration or transfer of private cars must first be submitted for review and decision before the Public Utilities Bureau handles them.

### Advising Frugality at Banquets Officially Begins Yesterday; Director Yu Explains the Mission

The police bureau's work of advising frugality at banquets officially began yesterday. Director Yu Shuping specially invited reporters from various newspapers to the police bureau yesterday afternoon to report on the tasks and new facilities that the bureau is responsible for in order to implement the central government's decisions and promote the frugality movement. Director Yu reported that the juvenile police were selected from disaster victims in refugee shelters, while the female police officers were mostly selected from female youth troops. The selection of these police talents has profound significance. The juvenile police were originally child refugees. Their assignment to promote frugality not only externally fulfills police duties, but also internally stimulates the conscience of the generally extravagant. It is believed that restaurant merchants and diners will assist the juvenile police in completing their mission with a spirit of "being concerned about the hungry and drowning." The female police officers are mostly female youth troops who graduated from high school and were introduced to the bureau by Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo. After selection, they were organized into teams for training, and now there are a total of forty-three of them. They have received strict military education and have been baptized by the revolution. Having them take on the work of advising frugality and rectifying customs is an ideal thing. As for their working methods, they will be either open or secret. The so-called secret means wearing plain clothes and going to various restaurants as customers to secretly investigate.

Director Yu added that the juvenile police are currently in training. Once their uniforms are made, in about a week, they will be able to work. The female police officers are also waiting for their uniforms to be made. Currently, the work of advising frugality at banquets is temporarily being undertaken by personnel from the Business Section of the Administrative Office. Dozens of people have been dispatched to various restaurants since the 29th to carry out the work.

### Winter Relief Society Proposes Three Fundraising Methods; Formally Submitted to the City Council

(Our Newspaper) The chairman of the Winter Relief Committee formally submitted a proposal to the City Council yesterday regarding winter fundraising methods for review and approval. The three proposed methods in the proposal are:

Issuing refugee relief lottery tickets.
Adding 20% to the entertainment tax.
Organizing a charity horse race.

Yuan Wenzhang, the fourth director of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the City Hall yesterday to consult with Secretary-General Shen on the development of winter relief work. According to Director Yuan, fundraising for winter relief is difficult this year. Last year, the UNRRA allocated a large amount of flour, blankets, and clothing, etc., but this year there is none, and the number of refugees awaiting assistance is greater than this year. The drama and film industries believe that the entertainment industry is already in a precarious situation today, and adding a 20% winter relief donation will further affect business. This matter will be discussed further at 10 AM today.

### Winter Relief Donations to Be Collected by Three Banks

The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee Fundraising Committee was established the day before yesterday and is located on the third floor of the Pudong Building on Zhongzheng East Road, and will begin operations immediately. Shanghai Bank, Xinhua Bank, and Zhonghui Bank have been designated to collect donations.

### Land Rights Dispute at Jiangwan Racecourse; Englishman Sues China Trust Bureau for Return

(Our Newspaper) The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office of the Central Trust Bureau (legal representative Wu Renchang) was sued in the Civil Court yesterday by the Racecourse General Association (legal representative Englishman Nord), requesting confirmation that the 1,215 mu, 5 fen, and 4 li of land at Jiangwan Racecourse in Shanghai, together with the buildings and fixtures on it, belong to the Racecourse General Association, and requesting the court to order the defendant to return the property to the plaintiff in accordance with the law.

The complaint stated that the plaintiff sold 1,215 mu, 5 fen, and 4 li of land at Jiangwan Racecourse in Shanghai, together with the buildings and fixtures on it, to the Shanghai Hengchan Company on February 10, 1939, subject to a condition of rescission, and entered into a contract stating that the purchase price was 760,000 legal tender yuan, to be paid in three installments. The first installment of 80,000 yuan was to be paid in cash upon signing, the second installment of 320,000 yuan was to be paid on March 17, 1940, and the third installment of 360,000 yuan was to be paid before February 1, 1942. The contract also stipulated that if the buyer delayed the payment of the second or third installment, the buyer should return all the occupied land, buildings, and fixtures to the plaintiff. After the contract was signed, in addition to the first and second installments already paid, Hengchan Company did not pay the third installment of 360,000 yuan as scheduled. Until October 30, 1942, nine months after the agreed date, the buyer suddenly transferred the 360,000 yuan into 180,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two to one without the consent of the plaintiff, and deposited it into the account of the Shanghai Racecourse General Association at the former Korean Bank, claiming that the payment had been completed. However, according to the contract, this transfer of property rights was actually invalidated due to Hengchan Company's delayed payment. After the victory, the plaintiff believed that the property rights of this racecourse land still legally belonged to the plaintiff, so it repeatedly requested the defendant (China Trust Bureau) that had taken over the land to return it, but the defendant did not agree. Later, the Executive Yuan decided to confirm that this case was a legal act with a condition, so the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit with the court requesting a judgment. It is reported that the case has been scheduled for hearing by Judge Xu Fuji of the Civil Court on the 31st of this month.

### Traffic Police Car Collides with Freight Train Between Longtan and Qixia Mountain; One Traffic Policeman Killed and One Injured; Various Trains Slightly Delayed

An accident occurred between a traffic police patrol car and a freight train between Longtan and Qixia Mountain on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line the night before last, resulting in one traffic policeman killed and one injured. Various trains were slightly delayed. According to a spokesman for the railway bureau, at 19:13 on the 28th, Yuan Zhenglin, the driver of traffic police armored motor vehicle No. 632, departed from Zhenjiang Station to patrol the line to Hepingmen. At 20:53, after arriving at Qixia Mountain Station, he obtained information about the section of road between Qixia Mountain and Yaohuamen, but instead of driving directly to Yaohuamen Station, he drove towards Longtan. At that time, freight train No. 506 had already passed Longtan at 20:58 and could not avoid the collision, resulting in a collision at the 282-kilometer mark between Longtan and Qixia Mountain, killing one traffic policeman and injuring another on the spot. The gear selector of locomotive No. MCCS-1188 of freight train No. 506 was damaged, and motor vehicle No. 632 was severely damaged. After learning of this situation, the railway dispatching office telegraphed the Nanjing Main Station to report to all relevant parties in the Nanjing-Wuxi section. At 22:46, an engineering motor vehicle and rescue train departed from Nanjing and arrived at the scene of the accident at 23:35. The head of the Nanjing-Wuxi Transportation Section ordered the No. 506 freight train to return to Longtan, and the damaged patrol motor vehicle was also towed to Longtan by engineering motor vehicle No. 711, which was at 0:35 on the 29th. Fortunately, the railway line was not damaged, and the road between Longtan and Qixia Mountain was completely cleared at 2:00 on the 29th. Trains No. 9, No. 10, No. 11, No. 12, and No. 16 were all slightly delayed as a result. It was found that the accident was purely caused by the traffic police patrol vehicle not following the railway regulations, and the railway authorities have raised the issue of responsibility for the accident with the Traffic Police Headquarters.

### Arbitration Issues of the Joint Electric Power Plant; Article 13 Amended

[Our Dispatch] Article 13 of the Shanghai Joint Electric Power Plant contract stipulates that in the event of disputes, the President of the International Court of Justice shall appoint an arbitrator to make a fair judgment. At the last meeting of the Municipal Council, it was considered damaging to sovereignty, and the debate was quite heated. The Public Works and Regulations Subcommittees of the Council held a special meeting yesterday to further study the matter.
According to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau, after the meeting, the subcommittee reached a concrete resolution to amend Article 13 as follows:
In the event of disagreements over the contract or disputes over power supply technology, the company and the government shall each appoint an arbitrator to make a fair judgment.
If the opinions of the above-mentioned arbitrators differ, making it impossible to resolve the issue, a third party may be appointed as an arbitrator with the consent of both parties.
If an arbitrator is difficult to produce (i.e., when both parties cannot agree), according to the original text of the contract, the President of the International Court of Justice is requested, in a personal capacity, to arbitrate in China. However, the subcommittee believes that involving the Court feels somewhat uncomfortable, so it has been decided to amend it to "request the President of the British Institute of Electrical Engineers (i.e., the well-known I.E.E.F.) to appoint an arbitrator from a third country to arbitrate in China." According to Director Zhao, the subcommittee discussed this point quite seriously yesterday, and the article has been nearly finalized after the amendment. Therefore, it should be possible to pass it smoothly when the Council convenes a general meeting this time.

### Northern Jiangsu Refugees and Unemployed Workers Appeal for Issuance of Suburban Tricycle Licenses

[Our Dispatch] Tang Guangya, Wang Zhuzhai, and other representatives of Northern Jiangsu refugees and unemployed workers held a press conference yesterday to appeal to the Public Works Bureau to promptly issue suburban tricycle licenses in accordance with the resolution of the Municipal Council. In summary: They, including their families, number more than 20,000 people. Last year, they fled to Shanghai because their hometowns were ravaged by communist bandits. They purchased tricycles with high-interest loans to earn a living by carrying passengers. The vehicle licenses were all purchased by the tricycle companies from Baoshan and Jiading counties and resold to them at high prices. However, after operating for less than a month, they were banned by the authorities. After being deceived, they sent representatives to petition the authorities many times. Subsequently, the Municipal Council resolved at its third meeting to approve the allocation of 1,179 suburban tricycle licenses, and at its fourth meeting, it reviewed and passed the case again to maintain their livelihood. However, the Public Works Bureau has not made any statement nearly a month after the adjournment of the Council, and there is currently a move to suspend the licensing of operating vehicles. They are extremely anxious, so they have raised several points to appeal to the authorities:
They now have nowhere to return, and the problem of their livelihood in Shanghai urgently needs to be resolved.
The traffic congestion in the city is limited to the urban area, and it seems that suburban vehicles can still be allowed to operate.
Since the Municipal Council has already made a resolution, please, in view of the imminent winter and the difficult life of the refugees, promptly approve the issuance of licenses.

### Seeking a Child Causes Disaster; Young Woman's Violent Death Implicates Doctor

[Our Dispatch] Song Pan, a young woman at No. 5 Tianbao Lane, Xinjiang Road, had been praying to gods and Buddha day and night because she had not become pregnant after marriage, which led to mental illness. She made noise every night. Her husband bought dozens of sleeping pills and instructed his mother to give her half a pill before going to bed to avoid disturbing others' sleep. Recently, she had improved slightly in the evenings, so they stopped giving her the pills. The remaining ten pills were hidden in the cigarette case. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 24th of this month, her mother-in-law called Song Pan to get up and empty the chamber pot, but she did not wake up after being called for a long time. Knowing something was wrong, she checked the hidden pills and found that they were gone. She realized that she had taken poison. However, she discovered that Pan still had body temperature, so the mother-in-law planned to send her to the hospital for treatment. However, the neighbor women advised against it, saying that hospital expenses were too high, and advised summoning Zang Zhiting to inject a cardiotonic injection. However, it was ineffective, and she soon died. On the afternoon of the 24th, the police bureau summoned and interrogated her. He admitted that he was not a registered doctor, but he injected her out of a sense of righteousness, but he did not expect that Song Pan had been deeply poisoned and could not be saved. The police bureau believes that Song Pan's death was ultimately due to an overdose of sleeping pills or due to improper dosage. A forensic examination is still needed. Yesterday, he was transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation on charges of manslaughter. Prosecutor Li Mingshan briefly questioned him and ordered him to be released on bail pending trial.

Yesterday, the court opened for interrogation and brought Pearce and Chen Chang to confront each other. According to Wang's confession: A Russian person promoted the sale of empty gasoline drums to me, so I offered a price to buy them. I did not know that these drums were embezzled.

### Viewing the Ryukyus from Taiwan

[Aeronautical Dispatch from Taipei, 27th of the month] Recently, the Ryukyu issue has aroused unanimous concern at home and abroad. Taiwan, due to its geographical relationship, is closely related to the Ryukyus, and the general public is particularly concerned. Therefore, when President Zhang visited Taiwan, reporters asked him about this matter. In the past, the number of Ryukyuans seeking a living in Taiwan reached more than 15,000. After the restoration [of Taiwan to Chinese rule], all of them were sent back, leaving only more than 60 people employed, most of whom were fishermen. According to overseas Chinese who recently returned to Taiwan from the Ryukyus, the current situation of the island is as follows: on the Ryukyu Islands, which are sixty li in diameter, not a single complete house cliff remains after the baptism of artillery fire. Only the capital city of Naha has a small cement building remaining, while the rest has been completely leveled. The lives of the residents are extremely difficult, because there is no cultivation of food crops on the island, and all vegetables must also be obtained from outside. The public roads are very good, with high-grade cement road surfaces and also pebble roads. In the northern part of the island, the US military has constructed projects. There are also supplies among them for China. Only two or three people from our country are on the island, handling material supply matters, and most of the food and daily necessities needed are shipped from Shanghai. Naha, the capital of the Ryukyus, is 313 [nautical] miles from the base port (Keelung is 426 nautical miles from Shanghai). It is a place where typhoons pass through Taiwan to attack Japan every year. The US military meteorological headquarters on the island and the meteorological bureau of this province regularly exchange meteorological information. When President Zhang inspected Keelung, a representative of 3,000 members of the Ryukyu Revolutionary Comrades Association, Xiyou Ming, submitted a petition to President Zhang requesting that the Ryukyus be returned to our country. It is understood that Xi is a Ryukyu fisherman and is currently employed in Taiwan, residing permanently in Keelung. Smuggling is rampant in Taiwan province. It is said that most of it involves small boats sailing to the waters of the Ryukyus to exchange goods. President Zhang also inquired about this matter in Taiwan, but the authorities had no specific figures to provide for reference. As for the news of Japanese Ryukyuans who were detained for smuggling into Taiwan, this newspaper published it on the 23rd. The "Smuggling Law" has been abolished, and the authorities have no way to deal with such cases.

### The Truth About the Illegal Activities of the Democratic League

(Continued from page 3)

2. The Democratic League colluded with Li Jishen and the Communist bandits to arrange military uprisings in South China.

From March 21st to 22nd, the "Guangdong Armed Work Committee" of the Communist bandits' Guangdong Provincial Committee decided to develop rural armed uprisings, establish the pseudo "Guangdong People's Armed Liberation Committee" as a command organ, and stipulate that the committee would be composed of seven people, and invite five "advisors," including one from the Communist bandits' pseudo-center, two local representatives of the Communist bandits, one from the Democratic League, and one social activist. The province was divided into six sub-districts, each with a command post. The minutes of the meeting have been seized.

In May of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], the South China Bureau of the Communist bandits issued a document titled "New Tasks for the Current Special Struggle in the Two Guang Provinces," stipulating the use of the Democratic League, the "Sanminzhuyi Comrades United Association" (a reactionary organization of Li Jishen et al.), the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, etc., to form a "political alliance" and a "military alliance." The original document stated: "The Party must establish bases for the Democratic League," "establish a central department in Hong Kong," "the political alliance will be centered on the Democratic League, and the military alliance will be centered on the Zhang Yan faction," "the future leader of the League should be Li Jishen and others," "convene a joint meeting of the leaders of the Yue and Gui factions headed by Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai, the Peasants' and Workers' Party, Sanlian, overseas factions, and leaders of military organizations in various places…" etc. This document has also been seized.

3. Du Bincheng colluded with the Communist bandits to incite mutiny among the National Army.

According to the confession of Chen Jianzhong, a communist bandit collaborator captured in Changchun: "The China People's Autonomous General Association is chaired by Li Jishen, and the location is probably in Hong Kong. I only heard that personnel are responsible in the Nanjing area, the Central Plains area, and the Southwest area. In the Northwest area, Du Bincheng or personnel of the Chinese Communist Party are responsible." It was found that Du was the chairman of the Northwest General Branch of the Democratic League (Li Shuren, an executive committee member of the General Branch, went to the bandit area in northern Shaanxi in the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946] to serve as the president of the pseudo-Yan'an University; Guan Mengjue went to the bandit area in Northeast China in October of the 35th year to serve as the director of the pseudo-Nenjiang Province Education Department), colluding with the Communist bandits and secretly serving as the person in charge of the Communist bandits' Guanzhong Local Committee, and successively inciting National Army generals Kong Congzhou and Zhao Shoushan to defect to the bandits, and plotting a riot, which was confirmed by the Shaanxi Provincial Garrison Headquarters, and handled according to law. 4. Li Yinfeng of the Democratic League colluded with the Communist bandits to plot an armed riot in northeastern Sichuan.

Li Yinfeng, a member of the Democratic League, was originally a disgruntled military man from Sichuan. After joining the Democratic League, he actively contacted disgruntled military men to incite mutiny among active-duty officers, recruited military and technical talents, colluded with Li Xiannian's troops of the Communist bandits, and plotted to launch an armed riot in northeastern Sichuan. The police and security organs cracked the case and arrested Li Zibo, Xiao Mingding, He Leisong and others together. They all confessed without hesitation.

(D) The Democratic League joined forces with the Communist bandits to incite labor and student movements.

1. Inciting labor unrest

The Shanghai Quanggong Building incident was a joint anti-American movement rally manufactured by the Communist bandits and the Democratic League. Disputes arose at the meeting place, causing fights. On February 28th of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], Chen Jiakang, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party delegation in Shanghai, convened a meeting with Huang Yanpei, Shi Fuliang of the Democratic League, and Ma Xulun and Pan Zhenya of the China Association for Promoting Democracy to discuss expanding the Quanggong Building incident. The key points of the resolution were as follows: Strengthen the organization of the Liang Renda funeral committee, with Ma Xulun in charge. Expand the campaign to mobilize various trade unions to respond. Strengthen the publicity of the "Truth about the February 9th Massacre" and increase the issuance of propaganda. The "Love Chinese Goods and Resist American Goods Association" will be organized by Shen Junru under the guidance of a division. Hire a lawyer to sue the inspection office in the local court, with Shi Liang in charge. Launch student response, with Pan Zhenya in charge. Maintain the "Shanghai Student Anti-Violence Federation" organization and strengthen it.

On May 6th, Han Zhuoru and others from the Beijing Municipal Office of the Democratic League held a meeting to discuss the group movement work instructions issued by the headquarters and decided: Organize dock workers and transportation workers (including railways) in Xiaguan. Strengthen the league activities within National Central University, and other schools should also develop organizations. Develop agricultural movements in the suburban areas of the city. The women's movement should establish a women's movement team as soon as possible to organize women's peripheral groups.

In October, Li Xiangfu of the Democratic League instructed league members in Beijing to develop organizational relationships with workers at the Beijing Water and Electricity Plants in order to launch strikes, disrupt water and electricity, and disrupt the social foundation when necessary. The police and security organs have obtained accurate information on the above facts.

2. Inciting student movements: On the eve of the May Student Movement in the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], the Student Union of National Central University was re-elected. The Beijing Municipal Office of the Democratic League used huge sums of money to support Mei Zhenqian's campaign. Guo Hengqu and Liao Zuyuan successively received 9 million yuan in activity funds from Li Xiangfu (6 million yuan once, and 3 million yuan once).

The Communist bandits and the Democratic League planned to start the May Student Movement with the May Fourth Memorial. The second item of the Shanghai Communist bandits' "May Work Plan" stipulates "Launching a student movement, with the May Fourth Memorial as the activity center, the anti-violence associations of various schools as the backbone, each university as the activity target, creating bloodshed as the goal, and continuing to initiate petitions and demonstrations as a form of struggle." The so-called Anti-Violence Association is the anti-American movement organization formed by professional students organized by the Communist bandits and the Democratic League in various schools on the pretext of the Shen Chong incident in Beiping.

On May Fourth Memorial Day, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Wang Shaohe, Shi Fuliang, Ma Yinchu and others went to major middle schools and universities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou to give speeches and openly incite. Subsequently, the "May Fourth Incident" occurred at the Shanghai Law School. On May 5th and 6th, the Shanghai Branch of the Democratic League held a meeting to decide to fully expand this incident in order to brew a full-scale student movement.

Afterwards, the newly elected members of the Student Union of National Central University stirred up another student movement under the pretext of the "movement to increase public funds," which reached its peak on "May 20th." In the course of the student movements in various places, the Democratic League in Beijing and Shanghai continued to gather to study and guide the student movements, focusing them on the slogans put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, such as "Anti-Hunger, Anti-Civil War, Anti-Conscription, Anti-Grain Collection." The Beijing Municipal Democratic League held three important meetings at Lan Jiazhuang and Meiyuan New Village (May 11th, 25th, and 28th). The Shanghai Municipal Democratic League held two important meetings at Zhang Bojun's and Wang Shaohe's residences (May 24th and 25th).

After the "May 20th" student movement expanded, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun and others of the Democratic League continued to raise more than 70 million yuan in activity funds in the name of condolences. On the evening of the second day of the strike at National Central University (the 14th), Shi Fuliang took 2.6 million yuan from Li Xiangfu at Meiyuan New Village and transferred it to the professional students in the Student Union of National Central University. During the student movement, professional students constantly went to the Beijing Municipal Office of the Democratic League. The Democratic League sent Luo Ziwei, Jin Ruonian and others to contact various schools. Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Ma Yinchu and others also took turns to give public speeches at National Central University, Jinling University and other schools to incite them. Shen Junru, Liu Wang Liming and others wrote to the Senate in Shanghai in the name of the "International Human Rights Protection Association" to protest. The Beijing Municipal Office and the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the Democratic League also issued documents such as "Opinions to Fellow Students of the Gu School" and "Opinions on the Current Student Movement" to strengthen the incitement work.

The Southern General Branch of the Democratic League in Hong Kong issued a telegram on May 30th to denigrate the government, and issued a telegram of condolence to students in various places in the name of "Democratic People from All Circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon." On June 1st, it convened the "Conference Against the Civil War and Promote Peace" and published the "Anti-War" special issue and the "June 2 Special Issue" to incite the dragon workers, strikes, school strikes, war strikes, and advocate the overthrow of the government and the formation of a coalition government.

3. Secret documents found in the student movement The police and security organs not only obtained intelligence about the collusion between the Democratic League and the Communist bandits to jointly instigate student movements, but also obtained many secret documents. The important ones are as follows:

In February, the Communist bandits' "Summary of the Anti-Civil War and Anti-Dictatorship Movement of National Sun Yat-sen University" was seized in Guangzhou, stating that the February student movement in the school was the responsibility of the Democratic League and the assistance of the Communist bandits.

In Guangzhou in May, a document titled "Decisions on the Student Movement in Hong Kong and Kowloon" issued by the Organization Committee of the Southern General Branch of the Democratic League after convening a student movement review meeting on June 3rd was seized. It contained a detailed review of the May Student Movement in Hong Kong and Guangzhou and indicated the direction for planning new student movements in the future.

In Shanghai in June, a document titled "Summary of the Current Student Movement and Instructions for Future Work" issued by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist bandits on June 15th was seized. It stated that the May Student Movement in Beijing and Shanghai was led by the Communist bandits, with the Democratic League coming forward, and exposed the conspiracy of the "June 2" and "General Strike" and the future direction in detail.

During the emergency response to the "June 2 Riot" in Dongqing and Chengdu, the members of the Democratic League detained by the police and security organs have all separately confessed to inciting labor unrest, student unrest, rice unrest, and being members of the Communist bandits.

E. The Democratic League's activities to undermine the National General Mobilization Order for Suppressing Bandits

1. Hong Kong - After the government issued the General Mobilization Order for Suppressing Bandits and Quelling the Rebellion, Peng Zemin, the chairman of the Southern General Branch of the Democratic League in Hong Kong, delivered a speech on July 9th, promoting the Democratic League's call for "using the general mobilization of the people to oppose the general mobilization of the government." On the same day, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Branch of the Democratic League issued a speech, declaring "Calling on all overseas Chinese in Hong Kong to unanimously oppose" and "Resisting the General Mobilization Order," "Opposing the government's general mobilization with the people's general mobilization" and other words.

2. Nanjing - In August, Luo Longji and Li Xiangfu of the Democratic League, in the name of the "China People's and Civil War League," wrote and printed leaflets to undermine the General Mobilization Order and incite strikes, market strikes, resistance to conscription, and resistance to grain collection. The leaflets were personally revised by Li Xiangfu, and Jv Xinmin. Luo Longji decided to print and distribute them. Member Zhao Chaofan discovered his conscience and photographed the original manuscript and surrendered to the Central Party Headquarters.

3. Northeast - Xinhua News Agency of the bandits broadcast Yan Shihang's article on September 18th for the Communist bandits' "September 18th" commemorative special issue, slandering the head of state and calling on the people of Northeast China to support the rebellion and overthrow the government.

4. Singapore - From September 27th to 29th, the Democratic League held the first All-Malaya Representative Congress in Singapore, established the Malaya Branch, with Hu Yuzhi as chairman, and declared "Currently, the Chinese Communist Party opposes the government, and we also oppose the government. The Chinese Communist Party advocates the establishment of a democratic government, and we also advocate the establishment of a coalition government." He then read Zhang Lan's admonition, the main points of which were to oppose the National Congress and oppose the Constitution. Among the resolutions of the conference were: To telegraph support for the central government's new policies of the League, To support the "People's Liberation War" in the motherland in order to realize the coalition government as soon as possible, To telegraph opposition to all "traitorous and dictatorial" crimes of the government, etc. At the closing ceremony, Hu Yuzhi entertained reporters and declared: In order to achieve the goal of overthrowing the government and establishing a coalition government, the Democratic League is willing to fight together with the Chinese Communist Party, Li Jishen and others, and other non-partisan people.

The above sections point out that the Democratic League has now become a conspiracy and riot group that opposes the Constitution and subverts the government. The words and actions of its general branches in various places are in cahoots with the Communist bandits and are no different. The people in charge of its headquarters are secretly engaged in underground work on the one hand, and on the other hand, they are still trying to make a vague posture to cover up their conspiracy and riot, and to confuse the vision of people at home and abroad. Now the Communist bandit military in Shandong has completely failed, and the bandit army of Jinji is pouring south, trying to break up into parts south of the He and Huai Rivers, avoiding the real and attacking the virtual, in order to disrupt social order and shake the hearts of the rear. The Democratic League is even more of an assistant to their underground work and rumor offensive, and has become a major threat to social security in the rear. (End of full text)

### Joint Meeting of the Directors and Supervisors of the Textile Federation Requests Postponement of the Implementation of Allocation and Sales, Seeks a Reasonable Plan that Must Take Both Sides into Consideration, Designates an Eight-Person Group to Continue Discussions Today

[Report from This Newspaper] The National Textile Federation held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Chairman Du Yuesheng himself. Before the meeting, a supplementary inauguration ceremony was held, supervised by Ouyang Lun, representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Wang Jiashu, representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The ceremony was grand. After the routine cases were discussed, representatives from the six district associations made a temporary motion to discuss the issue of joint allocation and sales of cotton yarn. After the representatives from the six districts gave oral statements on the development of the case, it was decided that the case was related to the future of the national textile industry's production, and it was often submitted for discussion. The speeches were fierce, and the discussion lasted for more than three hours. The common opinion was that the so-called joint allocation and sales with vouchers had many difficulties, the main ones being three:

First, the so-called joint allocation and sales are scheduled to be a "voucher" allocation system. However, under the current situation where production and consumption are out of balance, the conditions for voucher allocation and sales are not yet in place. It is difficult to implement it nationwide. If it is only implemented in Shanghai, it will be even more unfair. If yarn merchants in various places request voucher allocation and sales, there will be many disputes, and it will be difficult to achieve good results in practice.

Second, regarding the price issue, the Textile Regulation Committee's explanation of the joint allocation outline is similar to the unified allocation and sales method, and it is by no means a genuine joint allocation among peers. The power to determine the price seems to be entirely in the hands of the government. If the government's purpose is only to stabilize prices, then in the current situation of sluggish production and insufficient supply, prices will inevitably rise higher and higher, making it more difficult to meet the conditions for yarn factories to resume production. The textile industry believes that the greatest difficulty lies in the fact that the power to determine the negotiated price is entirely in the hands of the government.

Third, the original meaning of yarn factories opening their goods was to seek circulation independently, adapt to market conditions, and seek natural development. If all yarn production is forcibly collected by the government, it will inevitably lead to Zhou Zhuan's failure and obstruction. At a time when production has not yet stabilized and money is often stranded, the industry is mostly confused by this and believes that it is difficult to implement. The fact that each factory will lose its operating rights is even more important.

Based on the above three unsolvable difficulties, the association decided to request the government to extend the time limit, reconsider the issue of joint allocation and sales, and strive to obtain a reasonable and feasible plan that can take into account both government national policy and yarn factory production. Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Liu Jingji, Tang Xinghai, Zhang Wenqian, Rong Erren, Zhu Fuju, and Zhang Jian [omitted] were immediately designated to form an eight-person group to hold a group meeting to propose a plan for the government to adopt, in order to seek compromise and guidance, so as to obtain a reasonable solution.

[Another News] After the Textile Federation had held the Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors, Du Yuesheng, in his capacity as Chairman, visited Liu Siying, the acting chairman of the Textile Regulation Committee, to report on the situation of the meeting, and then returned to the association to continue convening a group discussion, which lasted for a long time. It is heard that discussions will continue today.

Private Factory Exchanges Opinions

[Report from This Newspaper] The six-district cotton spinning association held a regular meeting of executive directors yesterday afternoon. During the meeting, they exchanged opinions on the issue of joint allocation and sales. After the meeting, the association's spokesperson met with reporters and said that whether the textile industry will accept the joint allocation and sales method will be discussed by the National Textile Federation's council meeting. Chairman Du Yuesheng will personally preside over the meeting. It is expected that there will be specific opinions for compromise.

### Rice Plunges, Flour Follows Suit

Yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of 10,100+ shih of rice. The market trend was in a slump, with prices plummeting in the early market.

Du Yang indica plunged by 340,000 yuan, and early thin rice fell sharply by 340,000 yuan. Bai Yuan stepped down by 230,000 yuan. Yin Yuan shipments gradually surged, disposing of stagnant goods, plummeting by 350,000 yuan.

There was no new flour arriving and it was in demand, causing it to decline by 89,000 yuan. Wheat bran also similarly contracted by 12,000 yuan. At noon, factories announced that the existing flour warehouse receipts must be cleared within three days, making people feel even weaker. Soybean cake trading was scarce and lacked vitality. There were increasing sources of soybeans arriving, but oil mills were indifferent, and local dealers continued to aggressively cut prices. External buyers' transactions were not strong, and negotiations resulted in a decline of more than 10,000 yuan.

Broad beans' southern appetite was not considered, falling by more than 10,000 yuan. Peas moved slightly sporadically, with a weak tone. Green beans from Shantou purchases rose by 120,000 yuan. Cowpeas were picked up in Nanyang, stabilizing the market. Sorghum was moving in distilleries, temporarily stabilizing.

Corn from the North was being selectively purchased at high prices, resulting in a high-priced and subsequently stagnant appearance.

According to the person in charge of the committee, the current purchase of cotton from India has been decided to be carried out through barter trade, with our country exchanging cotton yarn for cotton from India. Both parties have also agreed that each bale of 20-count cotton yarn can be exchanged for 1,050 to 1,120 pounds of Indian cotton. 755 pounds of the exchanged cotton will be given to yarn mills to offset the cotton yarn. Of the excess, 60% will go to the Central Bank to cover foreign exchange settlement expenses, etc., and 40% will be allocated to private yarn mills as profit. The committee has now begun registering for this barter method. To date, 14 manufacturers have registered, and the first barter is expected to succeed within the year. As for the transportation of cotton yarn to India and cotton to China, both parties have agreed to use ships for transportation, as air and road transportation costs are higher.

### Cigarette Raw Material Registration: Manufacturers Request Priority Purchase

Since the government announced the measures for handling goods arriving at the port with self-provided foreign exchange, the China Cigarette Industry Association, in view of the scarcity of materials in China and the possible interruption of cigarette raw materials, believed that since the raw materials arriving at the port already belonged to the Chinese people, it would be a loss not only to our cigarette industry but also to our country if they were unfortunately re-exported. A joint meeting of directors and supervisors was held on the 23rd of this month to discuss the registration of goods arriving at the port with self-provided foreign exchange. It was unanimously resolved to support the national policy and apply for registration first, awaiting government handling. However, in order to safeguard the survival of the industry, it was requested that the government consider the difficulties of businesses and allow cigarette manufacturers to directly purchase the registered cigarette raw materials with priority, and to process them in advance.

In other news, among the goods arriving at the port and being shipped without permits and with self-provided foreign exchange, the registered value of tobacco leaves arriving at the port was "US$112,094.86," and the value of cigarette paper was US$1,165,881.68.

### Guangdong Province Strictly Inspecting Sea, Land, and Air Transportation Starting Yesterday: Cracking Down on the Flow of Cash from Beijing and Shanghai to the South; Floating Capital in Guangzhou Already Transferring to Hong Kong

[Report from Our Newspaper in Guangzhou on the 29th] Guangdong's financial tide has been fluctuating for the past month. After the authorities fully suppressed it and prohibited remittances to the south, it barely achieved stability. Recently, some people have been taking advantage of the opportunity to smuggle large amounts of cash from Beijing and Shanghai to the south to purchase gold and foreign currency, causing market fluctuations a few days ago. The authorities have now announced that starting from the 29th, all ships, vehicles, and aircraft arriving from the south by sea, land, and air must undergo strict inspection to prohibit the smuggling of cash to the south. In recent days, a large amount of floating capital staying in Guangzhou has fled to Hong Kong, and the financial situation in Guangzhou is still stable.

[United Press Guangzhou on the 29th] In recent days, the prices of daily necessities here have risen, especially rice. Salaried workers feel greatly distressed. In the past ten days, the price of rice has risen from 320,000 yuan to 410,000 yuan per dan (110 pounds), and other commodities have risen by 40% to 70%. Part of the reason for the price increase is that the Hong Kong dollar has risen more than doubled in one month. According to official statistics, the price level in the middle of this month was 64,500 times that of 1937, which means that 10,000 yuan in legal tender is equal to 1 jiao, 5 fen, and 5 li in 1937.

### Individual Applications for Foreign Exchange Must Be Transferred to the National Bank for Review

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 29th] The Ministry of Finance announced: According to the previous measures for managing foreign exchange, individual applications to designated banks for foreign remittances should be transferred to the Central Bank for review. The Savings and Remittance Bureau, as one of the designated banks, will also handle foreign remittances in this manner.

### Bulls Slaughtered Almost Entirely, Hua Stocks Lifeless

Hua stocks reached a dead end yesterday. Although large Chaozhou dealers knocked in over 100 million shares outside the market, they were still settled by floating profits, and there was no achievement. Trading inside and outside the market was unusually light, lacking energy. Rumors of loans continued, but most bulls had been slaughtered, so even if there was a breeze, it would soon be calmed down.

Morning

It was very uncertain, and the opening of each stock saw both gains and losses. Yong Yarn opened at 292 yuan and 294 yuan, but transactions were extremely scarce and retreated to 289 yuan and 290 yuan. It then retreated to 287 yuan and 288 yuan. Although it was supported, it rose slightly. Outside the market, the interest rate opened slightly higher, at 1 jiao, 9 fen and a half and 2 jiao, 4, but the market situation did not improve. Later, when news came that a large Chaozhou dealer had knocked in over 100 million shares outside the market, Guangdong dealers came to buy and settle immediately, and some submitted delivery orders, and it rebounded to the high price of 294 yuan for immediate settlement and 296 yuan for delivery. Soon, it could not get rid of its sluggish state, and near noon, it retreated to the low price of 286 yuan and 287 yuan. The noon closing was 286 yuan and 288 yuan. Except for unpopular stocks, they were all dragged down slightly. As a result, compared with the previous closing for immediate settlement stocks, China-France, China Textile, Five Harmonies each fell by half a percent, Commercial Press Datong Underwear Match slightly rose, Cement Jinglun Xinyi was still flat, Yong Yarn Xinnuo Meiya Huafeng Xinguang Jingfu Qinxing Xinhua Xinya Liannong China Silk Tongyi Rongfeng Hengfeng Zhabei Huaxin slightly decreased. For delivery stocks, only Qinxing was flat, and the rest slightly declined.

Afternoon

Only immediate settlement was done. Yong Yarn opened at 288 yuan and retreated to 285 yuan, and then was pulled up to 289 yuan. At this time, the evening newspaper had news that a loan had been preliminarily agreed upon, and it fell to 284 yuan. It then rose to 287 yuan at the closing. As a result, compared with the longer closing, Yong Yarn Xinguang Jingfu China-France Liannong Tongyi China Textile slightly rose, Bing Underwear rose by half a percent, Huaxin Xinnuo Commercial Press Jinglun Xinya slightly declined, Zhabei Match Xinhua Rongfeng Qinxing were all flat, and most of the old stocks outside the market still slightly rose.

Stock Exchange Holds Board Meeting

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Stock Exchange is scheduled to hold a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4 p.m. today. It is said that the commission income of the Stock Exchange has not been abundant recently, which is not enough to cover expenses. Therefore, methods to increase the trading volume will be discussed at that time.

### Government Bonds Slightly Rise, Foreign Stocks Stabilize

Government bonds yesterday rose slightly after being purchased for speculation. C-E was flat, and B-C opened at 24,000 yuan, fell to 21,900 yuan, and finally hovered around 23,000 yuan. Room 503 went out first and then came in, Room 550 and Room 360 made purchases, and Room 552 and Room 555 sold. As a result, compared with the previous closing, C-E was flat, A-B recovered by 800 yuan, B-D rose by 1,000 yuan, and the turnover was about 6 million.

Yesterday, hot foreign stocks were flat, and cold stocks and rubber stocks were sought after by many, seeing quick profits. Securities dealers and retail investors both came in, and foreign firms and banks all sold. Jardine Spinning hovered between 200,000 and 210,000 throughout. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Jardine Spinning, British Federation, De Feng, Jardine Beer, and Xiangtai were all flat, Ken Zhi alone rose by 20%, Shipping and Steel rose by half a percent, and the rest saw gains and losses mixed.

As a result, ten British American Tobacco cigarettes still fell by 210,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and Old Daozi stepped down slightly by 150,000 yuan.

Soap saw floating sellers dispose of their holdings, and the market continued to decline by 56,000 to 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Beautiful Phoenix Match decreased by 120,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brands decreased slightly.

Intestine casing exports have recently come to a standstill. It is said that the minimum cost of a barrel of intestine casings is currently 30 million yuan, while the highest market price abroad is 15 million yuan, making it impossible to trade, resulting in many automatic stoppages of production.

### The Convergence of Eastern and Western Cultures

— Fu Tongxian

Northrop: The Meeting of East and West, The MacMillan Co.

This is a high-level academic and ideological work published in the United States after the war. The author is Northrop, Professor of Philosophy at Yale University. His theme is how to converge Eastern and Western cultures to seek mutual understanding among human beings and achieve true world peace.

Most people think that the Second World War was different from the First World War in terms of human psychology. They think that there was no ideological conflict in the First World War. The war at that time was fought for democracy, and later Germany failed, and democracy seemed to have won. Afterwards, it was discovered that it was not the case, and everyone still did not understand the meaning of that war. As for this war, everyone can see that there are ideological conflicts everywhere. Everyone understands that the fate of peace depends entirely on whether traditional democracy and Soviet communism can coordinate their political, economic, and religious claims and truly cooperate with each other. However, the author believes that this is not the only ideological conflict, nor is it the most important one.

In Palestine, the beliefs of the Jews and the culture of the Arabs are incompatible; in India, the social views of Muslims and the social views of Hindus are irreconcilable. In Europe, the aristocratic ideology and Taoist concepts of Roman Catholicism and the populist ideology and humanism of Protestant Christians are also conflicting. Similarly, in the East, the Shinto beliefs of Japan and the Confucian and Buddhist ideas of moderation and compassion cannot be reconciled. In the Americas, the traditional Latin American views and the traditional Anglo-American views are also inconsistent. In short, in various different cultures, what one culture believes is right, another believes is wrong; what one culture believes is wrong, another believes is right. Ideological conflicts and different ideologies are prevalent throughout the world. If these contradictions and conflicts are not eradicated, the world will never have a peaceful day.

These problems cannot be solved in practical situations. We must trace the root causes and conduct thorough and objective reviews from a theoretical perspective in order to obtain a correct understanding. This book aims to put effort into this area. According to the author's preliminary analysis, the root cause of these ideological conflicts is the conflict between Eastern and Western cultures. Therefore, the basic question now is how to converge Eastern and Western cultures. After this conflict is resolved, other ideological conflicts can be easily solved.

Based on this theme, the book divides the entire content into two parts. The first part is Western culture. Western culture is divided into six major branches: the dual-rich culture of Mexico, which is itself a complex cultural mixture, including the meaning of ancient Aztecs, the customs of Spanish colonies, the style of 19th-century France, the economy of North America, and the charm of modern Mexico; the free culture of the United States of America; the unique democratic culture of the United Kingdom; the idealistic culture of Germany; the communist culture of the Soviet Union; the Roman Catholic culture. Although these many cultures differ in content, they belong to the same form. Whether in philosophy, religion, or even science, the knowledge content of Western culture is not absolute or final, but is changing and improving. The author believes that this can be traced back to two basic reasons. First, the knowledge of Western science, philosophy, and religion is not derived from intuitive perceptions. This knowledge is based on observation and the pre-establishment of a hypothesis, and then the collection of evidence for deduction. Therefore, second, Western knowledge must have a series of logical reasoning. Based on these two characteristics, we know that Western culture is theoretical, symbolic, and indirect.

The second part of the book discusses Eastern culture. Eastern culture can be divided into three major branches: the culture of Confucianism and Taoism in China; the Shinto culture of Japan; the Buddhist culture of India. Easterners perceive all things and nature in an emotional and intuitive way. Easterners and nature are integrated into one. The so-called "all things are one, forgetting both self and things," is the spirit of Eastern culture. Therefore, Easterners also have two basic concepts about the nature of things. First, nature is an intuitive and complete whole, which is shared by all human beings and all things; second, we directly feel various differences in this complete whole. Based on these two characteristics, we know that Eastern culture is aesthetic, experiential, and intuitive.

The author of this book believes that all art can be divided into two categories. The first category of art uses an intuitive and complete whole as aesthetic material and directly expresses it itself, purely for art's sake. The second category of art uses theoretical methods and techniques to use this intuitive and complete whole as aesthetic material, and uses it to convey the relationship between things. It is a symbol or tool used to convey external objects. Western culture, whether in philosophy, science, economics, politics, or art, belongs to the second category of artistic type; Eastern culture in all aspects belongs to the first category of artistic type. However, our natural understanding of all things should not only have intuitive experience, but also theoretical analysis. The future new worldview should, on the one hand, have intuitive aesthetic materials and directly express itself, and on the other hand, have a logical reasoning method to express intuitive raw materials in symbols. These two aspects are not contradictory but parallel; not only are they parallel, but they are also complementary.

Therefore, according to the author's view, the convergence of Eastern and Western cultures is not complete Westernization or complete Easternization. These two cultures will converge into a new world culture, which includes intuitive factors and theoretical factors. At this time, the individual is not only a purely intuitive self; nor is it only a self that is verified by science and recognized by theory. On the one hand, the individual has its intuitive nature, an undifferentiated and coexisting real self with the surrounding people and things; on the other hand, it has its logical nature, an abstract self with special functions in the relationship of a social organization. Therefore, the philosophy of cognitive action with two-term relationship (the two-termed relation of epistemic correlation) laid the cornerstone of the future world culture.

The author, Professor Northrop, has profound knowledge, deep thoughts, and fluent writing. He has a thorough understanding of the cultures of various countries. There are not many Western thinkers who have a deep analysis of Mexican culture, but Northrop's vivid description makes people have a deep impression of Mexico. He is also very clear about the current situation in our country, analyzing the desire for a completely modern Western-style country on the one hand, and being deeply influenced by the Eastern family thoughts with thousands of years of history on the other hand, so that it is still wandering and confused to this day, and it seems that it cannot find a way out in world culture! This point has also been seen by our Chinese scholars. It can be seen that Eastern and Western scholars see the same thing. Therefore, we hope that scholars from both East and West can first have a big unity in culture and thought, start by communicating Eastern and Western cultures, and create a new world culture. This is the most fundamental way to eliminate war and seek world peace. October 20th

### A Plain English Translation of the Constitution of the Republic of China

The Constitution of the Republic of China has been translated into English by Mr. Hao Zhixiang of the Central News Agency and will be published in a separate volume by the Commercial Press in September of this year. The book is formatted with Chinese and English side-by-side. The text is accurate and fluent, allowing people around the world to understand this newly established constitution. At the same time, Chinese people learning English can also study this practical English. There are three differences between the English translation and the original text, which the translator believes are more reasonable expressions in English.

The first article originally states: "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, of the people, by the people, and for the people." The phrase "of the people, by the people, and for the people" is originally an idiom from U.S. President Lincoln, and there were initially objections during the legislative process to using this phrase with such a strong Western flavor. However, the translator did not translate it as the original "of the people, by the people, for the people" but as "of the people for the people and governed by the people." This is because the translator believes that Lincoln's original text only applies to the government and not to the nation.

Article 8 originally states: "Arrest, detention, interrogation, or punishment not in accordance with legal procedures may be refused." The translator believes that if a person is subjected to arrest, detention, interrogation, or punishment, they are physically unable to refuse, and at most, they can only make a mental refusal. Therefore, the translator believes it is best to use the word "protested." However, because the original meaning is refusal rather than protest, the translator had to translate it as "refused."

"複決" (Fùjué) is translated as "referendum," because the translator wanted to be faithful to the original text. In fact, he thinks it should be translated as "ratify" or "vote on."

The entire text is very faithful to the original, which is a characteristic of this English translation of the constitution. However, there are two points we would like to discuss with the translator: (1) The Chinese word "得" (dé) is correctly translated as "may" because it means "can do this, but not necessarily must do this." However, "不得" (bùdé) has a mandatory meaning, so it cannot be translated as "may not," because this means "can not do this, but can also do this." Therefore, we feel that it is best to use "shall." (2) Article 135 originally states "Delegates to the National Assembly from interior areas having peculiar conditions of living and habits." There are two problems with this. First, "國民代表" (Guómín dàibiǎo), or national representatives, does not only refer to representatives of the National Assembly but refers to all kinds of national representatives, so it should be translated as "delegates of the people." Second, the word "peculiar" is inappropriate because sometimes this word can mean "strange" rather than necessarily "special." It should be translated as "particular." We wonder what the translator thinks?

### Introduction to "Pocket-Sized Detailed Provincial Map of China"

— Gong Peixuan

(Revised 12th Edition, compiled by Jin Qingyu, published by Yaguang and Geography Society)

Chinese people have a deep concept of territory, but their knowledge of geography is poor, which is a common problem. Because the concept of territory is deep, it cultivates the habit of being reluctant to leave one's homeland. Because there is a habit of being reluctant to leave one's homeland, it is difficult to broaden one's mind. Therefore, the desire to acquire geographical knowledge is even more insufficient. However, as the times progress day by day, science leaps forward, and the space for human survival gradually decreases, it is no longer permissible for us to live in a small circle and eke out a living. Therefore, the imparting of geographical knowledge is the common sense that we should have. Humans living in this era must learn geographical knowledge.

In China, finding an accurate world map is almost a difficult task, and finding an accurate and detailed map of one's own country is also not very easy. This pocket-sized detailed provincial map of China, published by Yaguang Geography Society and compiled by Mr. Jin Qingyu, is not entirely satisfactory, but it is relatively useful as a reference.

Now, let's first talk about its advantages: This map has been published since the 30th year of the Republic of China, and the revised edition has now reached the 12th edition. In the most recent revised edition, it can correct changes in human aspects at any time, making this map the most up-to-date work, giving the Chinese people a clear understanding of all aspects of attention. For example, the nine northeastern provinces and Outer Mongolia, Tangnu Uriankhai, etc. The provincial maps have markings for the larger market towns, and the locations are quite accurate. This is a very difficult thing to do. According to the author's experience in various provinces and cities over the years, the market towns passed through are generally consistent with the locations on this map. This map is called "pocket-sized," so of course, the size is very small and easy to carry. Making the size small can be done by any map, but making it thorough is not something that any map can do. In terms of thoroughness, this map is generally acceptable.

However, this map is an ordinary reference map, not a map used by scholars, experts, or the military, so it is not an objective attitude to demand that it be complete in every aspect. For example: The terrain is not shown in detail in the sectional maps. The locations of products are not specifically marked in the sectional maps. Municipalities directly under the central government are attached to the sectional maps. The loss of national territory over the years has not been marked. These are all unsatisfactory aspects.

Based on the above, we hope that the following four points will be corrected in the 13th edition of this map: Add terrain contours to the maps; this may be difficult in projection, but several maps on the market have already done it. Clearly mark the production areas or storage locations of products in each province. All municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan should be drawn on a separate page to show their importance and deepen the public's recognition. The loss of Chinese territory over the years has been significant, and it seems that all lost territories should be marked, which would greatly benefit the enhancement of national consciousness.

This map was published in February of this year. At that time, the boundaries of the nine northeastern provinces and the South China Sea were still to be adjusted. Now the Ministry of the Interior has clearly delineated the provincial boundaries of the nine northeastern provinces, and they should naturally be corrected in the next edition. The Xisha Islands in the South China Sea also seem to need a special page after surveying and determination, because they are overseas borders and should strengthen the public's attention. In addition, the author hopes that the compilers can follow Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan and mark out our national construction strategies, which would also be very educational for readers.

As for the minor flaws in this map, the author believes that the explanations are too brief and that there are quite a few typos. For example, in the explanatory text of the Shandong map, the Fangzi of "坊" (Fáng) County is made into the Fangzi of "肥" (Féi) County. Not to mention that Fangzi is not in "肥" County, but Shandong only has a "肥城" (Féichéng) and no "肥縣" (Féi Xiàn).

### The Revelation "Mozart" Gave Me

— Fei Qiong

"Love shook my heart, like the mountain wind falls on the trees.

"Love shook me—melted limbs love, bitter and sweet, irresistible thing.

—Poef: "To My Beloved"

After reading B. Balázs's three-act play "Mozart," I suddenly remembered the poems of the Greek poet Sappho. My heart felt a tremor.

Was it the life of the great artist Mozart that moved me? No, it wasn't this, but rather the silent sacrifice of his sister that moved me even more.

A person who grows up in a poor family, a person who has nothing but a sincere heart, he sacrifices himself as a sacrifice to art, and inevitably makes his father and his sister (Nannerl Mozart) silently sacrifice along with him.

I say "inevitably" because I have truly surrendered to these great human natures. "Love" shook me, overwhelming my selfishness and indifference.

Also Sappho's poem: "That which seems beautiful must be good, and that which is good will also be beautiful."

The kind Nannerl is by no means a protagonist in the whole play, but she controlled me, and her great love for her brother shook me. When her father said to her: "Nannerl... I know... I know everything... As for me, an old man sacrificing his life is not a big deal; but when you sacrifice your youth and love, sacrifice your happiness and musical skills, that is another matter!" (Sand, page 9)

An old man spends his life copying music for his son; a young girl with musical talent weaves lace all day long for her brother. "That which is good will also be beautiful," so even if the old man said some inappropriate things to his son in the second act, it was also his right, because he had exhausted his strength and his duties.

"That which is good is also beautiful," and I admire Nannerl even more. When her father's credit went bankrupt, she blushed, but firmly and bravely whispered: "I will sign this loan agreement; I will sign... I can guarantee it with my dowry." She is still a young girl, but I cannot help but think of her as a great hero.

I have not yet talked about Mozart, no, I have already talked about him. Growing up in such a family, growing up surrounded by such things, the talented Mozart should have a more brilliant future.

We appreciate Mozart's music, but we forget that Mozart himself is a perfect work of art—a painting, a requiem, a kind and flawless soul.

But society persecuted him. When the theater made a fortune by performing his music, when the girl Aloysia became famous by singing his music, even when a beggar earned bread by playing his music on the street, our genius musician Mozart was suffering for a few ducats.

(The beggar starts playing again, Mozart looks at him, walks up, and takes his violin). Mozart: Old man, lend it to me for a moment. (Starts playing)

Music, if it weren't for you, what would I have become? Ah, music, music...

(He plays, the beggar is moved, and turns his two invisible eyes towards him, passersby gather around: silver coins rain into his hat).

Mozart: There, old man, you play, my bad luck will pass, and my music will last forever.

Beggar: (Confused) Who are you? Which one? Mozart: A popular person these days... a partner of yours, a blind man and musician like you, good night, old man.

(Mozart leaves, he disappears into the night, the blind man takes a few steps, stretching his hands forward as if groping, wanting to follow Mozart).

Mozart called himself a blind man and musician, he still had some self-awareness, Dostoevsky once criticized Tolstoy saying: Tolstoy is a Russian full of a sense of justice, he has his wisdom, but he can only look forward, and never see clearly what is beside him.

Mozart also ignored the surrounding environment, unaware of the cold and terrible world, and did not lose his innocence until his death. Social persecution destroyed his body, but his kind heart was always warm. He struggled, ignoring social persecution, so he called himself blind.

He ignored it when his lover Aloysia flattered the theater owner; he ignored it when Aloysia's mother, Mrs. Weber, played despicable tricks; he ignored it when people who made a fortune by relying on him surrounded him, and he wrote his last few pieces of music. A pure and kind person can never imagine that the world is so cruel, he has to ignore it.

On his deathbed, he finally spat out a few accusations:

"No, Süssmayr, death is not my enemy, if it ruthlessly prevents me from completing this last chapter... it is the enemy of music!"

Only thirty-five years old, he was like that white dove carrying an olive branch, flying above the unclean waves, his wings were already tired, under the cold persecution of the world, he fell down and sank into the unclean waves. This is the end of a pure, lovely, and great soul!
