### Government Officials Gather in Beijing to Discuss Peace, New Proposal Being Drafted, Content Includes Military and Political Themes

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Ten key government officials involved in peace negotiations, including Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhizhong, Yu Dawei, Chen Lifu, Lei Zhen, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, and Wu Dingchang, convened a meeting at Sun Ke's residence at 4 PM on the 14th, adjourning at 7 PM. According to sources, since the government convened the National Assembly and formulated the constitution based on the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolution, and scheduled constitutional governance to commence on December 25th of this year,

numerous important matters still require resolution during this period. Therefore, it was decided to invite the Communist Party again to discuss national affairs. The meeting on the 14th focused on studying a peace proposal, with content covering two aspects: In military affairs, seeking a rational solution based on the military reorganization plan. In political affairs, inviting the Communist Party to participate in the government and discussing the resolution of local government issues. As for the two demands of the Communist Party, they were not considered. This meeting may continue for two or three days. Once the peace proposal is drafted, it will be reported to Chairman Chiang for approval before being presented to the Communist Party. The format for resuming peace talks, whether a round table conference or sending representatives to Yan'an, has not been decided and will depend on the Communist Party's preference. The source expressed the hope that the Communist Party would prioritize the nation, allowing the door to peace to be reopened.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] After government officials held an important meeting on the afternoon of the 14th, reporters visited Sun Ke to inquire about his views on peace talks. He stated that the government is making "every effort within its power" to break the deadlock, and a new proposal is being drafted, but it is not yet finalized. When asked if it includes the past eight points, Sun replied, "The past is not being discussed." When asked if the "two points of the CCP are being considered," Sun did not give a definitive answer. When asked whether direct negotiations or a round table conference would be held, Sun replied, "Whichever is convenient, whichever is possible." He also indicated that a round table conference is different from the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) because the former has no binding force.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] President Sun stated: The only crucial task at present is to restore peace, and to restore peace, we must first resume peace talks. The possible ways to restore peace talks are direct negotiations, but direct negotiations seem difficult to initiate at present, so I propose convening a round table conference, inviting all relevant parties to participate. As for the content of the peace talks, it should focus on: (1) restoring transportation, (2) implementing reorganization. Other issues can easily find solutions. Sun then recalled the efforts made for peace over the past year, believing that good opportunities have been missed repeatedly. Today, the country is facing a serious crisis, and the people unanimously demand peace, believing that there should be full confidence and optimism in the future of peace.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Minister Zhang Lisheng stated: Government representatives gathered today and discussed the method of resuming peace talks for a long time. A decision has been made in principle. It is still unknown whether the CCP will accept this plan. Regarding the issue of government reorganization, the government is ready to reorganize at any time, regardless of before or after the resumption of peace talks.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Lei Zhen said on the morning of the 14th: The new peace proposal is being discussed by key government officials. The military reorganization plan, for which an agreement had been reached in the past, and the restoration of transportation plan, for which no agreement had been reached, are both important reference materials. The issue of local government is the main issue of the new proposal. In some aspects, the government will make as many concessions as possible within its capabilities.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] It is said that several political receptions will take place in Shanghai in the coming days. Sun Ke himself may go to Shanghai again on the 16th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Amidst the calls for the resumption of peace talks, all parties believe that the CCP's insistence on two demands is the biggest obstacle. The government has not yet considered them. American sources also said that these two demands are the two bolts on the door of peace talks. People in the capital who care about national affairs hope that the CCP will reconsider and not use these two demands, which deviate from the facts, as a prerequisite, which would affect the resumption of peace talks.

### Local Government and Military Region Issues, Government Willing to Make Reasonable Concessions, Rumors that the CCP Also No Longer Insists on Two Prerequisites

[Our Report] Sun Baoyi, a spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, solemnly told reporters yesterday that the basic proposition of the Democratic Socialist Party regarding the current situation is that the resumption of peace talks must be conducted with sincerity, and one should not presume failure. Even if peace talks unfortunately fail, the government must first make various important reforms, such as improving financial and economic policies and ending political tutelage, before considering participating in the government. This basic policy has now received unanimous support within the party. Speaking of the concrete suggestions the government is about to put forward, Sun said: Lei Zhen indicated when he met with representatives of various parties in Shanghai that the government is willing to make reasonable concessions on local government and garrison areas. It was recently heard from Nanjing that the CCP no longer insists on two prerequisites, which, if true, would be good news. When the reporter asked why Zhang Qun had hoped that the Democratic Socialist Party would propose a plan for the current situation when he left Shanghai, but it was not ultimately proposed, he replied: There are two reasons: (1) A complete plan requires considerable time to solicit opinions from all parties behind closed doors, which may lead to impracticality. (2) The draft of the Democratic Socialist Party's plan differs greatly from the opinions of the Youth Party and still needs to be discussed and considered, so it could not be put forward immediately.

### Sun Baoyi to Go to the United States

Also, Mr. Sun Baoyi is scheduled to go to the United States in February or March to reorganize the party's newspapers in the United States and seek the development of overseas party affairs for a period of one year. According to Mr. Sun; The World Daily in San Francisco, the party plans to increase the English version in the future for the reading of elderly overseas Chinese, Mr. Sun also intends to take advantage of the opportunity to go abroad to study political philosophy in the United States.

[Our Report] Zuo Shunsheng told reporters that, according to his personal observation, the formal reopening of peace talks is still difficult at present. There is no formal representative of the Youth Party in Beijing at present. He may go to Beijing in the short term because of the Senate, but it has nothing to do with the restoration of peace talks.

### Xiong Shihui Visits Mausoleum

And Meets with Wei Daoming, etc.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] After Wei Daoming arrived in Beijing at 7 AM on the 14th, he visited Xiong Shihui at Bai Chongxi's residence at 10 AM, and then Gan Naiguang came to talk for a long time. It is likely that the topic was still Northeastern diplomacy. After Wei and Gan left, Xiong Shihui visited the mausoleum at 11:30 AM, and attended a banquet hosted by Zhu Jiahua at 6 PM.

### Detailed Rules for Amnesty Decree to be Announced Soon

### Marshal Ma's Mission Unfinished, Ambassador Will Continue to Carry It Out, Reports of Wedemeyer, Etc., Coming to China Are Inaccurate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] An authoritative source close to the U.S. side told our reporter: Washington will not send any more military generals to China. The speculation about Wedemeyer and Li Hai are all unfounded. Ambassador Stuart will continue to carry out Marshal Ma's unfinished mission, striving to restore peace talks and promote their success. As for the way to reopen peace talks, all possible ways to achieve the goal of cooperation between the KMT and the CCP will be adopted and tested.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Ambassador Stuart hosted a banquet for Bai Chongxi at 7 PM on the 14th. Chen Lifu and Yu Dawei also engaged in "social" style conversation after the meal and dispersed late at night.

Shao Fangzi presided and delivered a speech, stating briefly: Living in today's world, from politics and economy to daily life, is influenced by international relations. It is a mistake not to care about international relations. It is also a mistake to only know how to value international relations without in-depth research and to easily follow others, resulting in the abuse of the times.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Sun Ke announced at the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 14th that, according to regulations, all electoral laws and regulations related to the constitution should be drafted within three months after the promulgation of the constitution. Now, there are only two and a half months left in the specified period, urging that this matter be actively carried out. All committee chairmen believe that the election law is important and very specialized and that a special committee should be set up to handle it. It was decided that the five committee chairmen and conveners of the Legislative Yuan would make a preliminary study of the organization and number of members of this special committee and make various necessary preparations so that when the newly added legislators joined, they could jointly promote it. It is heard that the number of members of the special committee will not be too large, possibly fifteen people, at most not more than thirty people, and one-third of the quota will be reserved for the newly added legislators. Regarding the issue of amending all current laws and regulations that conflict with the constitution, Sun also asked all committees to actively study them in order to make necessary revisions. Chen Changheng asked whether the organizational laws of the five Yuan should also be drafted at present, since the organization of the five Yuan will be different from the current structure after the new constitution is promulgated. Sun replied: The establishment of the new government may be around the end of the 36th year, and this work seems to be delayed slightly.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to various electoral laws and regulations related to the constitution and recently ordered Wang Chonghui to draft an initial draft of the election law for reference by the Legislative Yuan when formulating laws. After receiving the order, Wang is collecting various relevant materials and inviting experts to help him carry out this important work.

### Legislative Principles Draft of the National Bank Law, Legislative Yuan Decides to Resubmit for Review, Mineral Tax Regulations Draft Amended and Passed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Legislative Yuan, which had been in recess for nearly two months, held its 312th meeting at 9:30 AM on the 14th to deal with backlog cases. More than 50 legislators attended, and President Sun presided. First, the legislative principles of the National Bank Law were discussed. Chen Changheng, chairman of the Finance Committee, explained the review process. Regarding the legislative principles of the Central Bank Law, Chen pointed out that, according to the new draft, the Central Bank is a bank of banks, subject to the supervision of the Ministry of Finance, and is responsible for assisting national finance and regulating national finance. The responsibility of finance is to regulate national finance, and its capital is all allocated by the national treasury, so that the Central Bank can become a "bank of banks" with completely national capital. At the same time, according to the legislative principles, the maximum amount of currency issued by the Central Bank should be decided by the Legislative Yuan, and its issuance should also be checked and announced by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Accounting. In addition, the principles also stipulate the businesses that the Central Bank shall not engage in. These are all progressive points. What should be discussed is how the directors and supervisors should be produced. According to the draft, the National Bank Association, agriculture, industry, labor, and commerce can each elect two directors, and the National Bank Association can also elect two supervisors, and the National Accountants Association can also elect one supervisor. There is a lot of disagreement from all sides on this point, and I hope to discuss it. Lou Tongsun spoke, believing that all parties attach great importance to the Bank Law. If new proposals are put forward to change the system, it may have an adverse impact on the market, and hoping that when discussing this issue, we can always remember that our work is to establish a solid foundation for the future financial system. President Sun Weifa spoke, disagreeing with the point that agricultural and industrial groups can elect directors and supervisors of the National Bank, repeatedly explaining that since the Central Bank is a national bank, the directors and supervisors should be produced by the government. Now it is stipulated that they should be elected by people's organizations, which is not in accordance with the law or reason. The reason is that the directors represent the shareholders' equity. Only those with equity can elect directors. Now that the capital of the Central Bank is all allocated by the national treasury, I don't know what the reason is to allow the above-mentioned groups to elect directors. Sun also cited the British and American banking systems as examples, explaining that this type of regulation is rare even in foreign countries. It is said that after the Bank of England was nationalized, the state has become a shareholder and director of the bank, which is designated by the government. After nomination by the Ministry of Finance, it is appointed by the British King, and there is no regulation that the public association can elect directors. Therefore, the directors and supervisors of the National Bank must be appointed by the government, and at most they are only nominated by the group and then decided by the government. Otherwise, the National Bank is no different from "Public Bank of National Groups", wouldn't it be a joke. Lou Tongsun spoke again, believing that the legislative principles do not explain the legal relationship between the China Jiaotong and Agricultural Banks and the Central Bank, and it seems that it should be included. Hong Ruizhao advocated that this case is of great importance and should not be taken lightly, and should be resubmitted for review, and suggested that the legislative principles should stipulate how the policies of the National Bank should be coordinated with the national financial and financial policies. At the same time, acts such as speculative profiteering by the National Bank should also be curbed. Hong pointed out that today's Central Bank appears in the speculative market as a speculative merchant, using speculative merchant methods to crack down on speculators, and everywhere appears as a bullish position in the gold policy, fighting with merchants, leading speculators into its trap. This approach, even if successful, is not enough to be a lesson, let alone to be proud of. If unfortunately it fails, may I ask where will the national interest and the people's livelihood be placed? Therefore, the future National Bank Law must restrict this.

### Recovering the Official Shares of the Small Four Banks is Also Decided to Resubmit for Review

Zhang Zhaoyuan expressed his deep dissatisfaction with the current situation in China's banking industry, which is neither official nor commercial, pointing out that according to the world trend, the division between national banks and commercial banks is very clear. After the integration of the two, the abuses are very serious. At present, there is no need to continue to allow the small number of merchants in the national banks to get involved. Zhang continued to point out that although the number of official shares in the small four banks varies, the abuses caused by not being official or commercial should be eliminated. Because the official shares are mixed in the small four banks, all kinds of unnecessary disputes arise with commercial banks, and the losers are often commercial banks. Therefore, all official shares in the Zhāng small four banks should be withdrawn. Finally, it was decided that the draft of the legislative principles of the National Bank Law should be resubmitted for review, and the case of recovering the official shares of the small four banks should also be resubmitted for review.

In addition to discussing the Bank Law issue today, the Legislative Yuan also passed two important laws, one of which was to amend the draft of the Mineral Tax Regulations. The main point of the case was to reduce the tax rate of coal, gas, petroleum, iron and other materials related to industry and national daily necessities to 3%. Another important case was to amend the draft of the organizational regulations of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

### Timely Abandon Political Disputes, Resolve the Difficulties of Constitutional Governance, President Sun's Speech at the Legislative Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] At noon on the 14th, the colleagues of the Legislative Yuan hosted a public banquet for President Sun at the Yuan. Sun delivered a speech, briefly stating: This Yuan has been established by Mr. Hu Zhantang from freedom for eighteen years, and I have been here for fourteen years. This is really a valuable time in a short life. Those who were in their thirties or forties at that time are now in their forties, fifties, or sixties. During this time, this Yuan completed the revision of the draft constitution, which has now been amended and passed by the National Assembly. The reason why we gave up insisting on the Five-Five Draft Constitution is the spirit of tolerance and respect for the wishes of others. Although the constitution has been promulgated, there are still practical difficulties in constitutional governance. Therefore, if political disputes are not abandoned in a timely manner, I am afraid that the day for constitutional governance next year will still not be able to be implemented.

### Communist Army of 100,000 Attacks Zaozhuang; National Army Fights Valiantly, One Against Ten; Communist Army's Offensive in Northern Jiangsu Thwarted

[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 14th] The area centered on the Zaozhuang coal mine, approximately eight kilometers north to south and twenty-nine kilometers east to west, remains firmly defended by the National Army as of the 14th. The Communist army attacking Zaozhuang numbers several hundred thousand, more than ten times the defending forces. Fierce fighting has continued for three days and nights.

[Another dispatch] The Communist army, which had been rampaging in  County, launched another main force attack on Zaozhuang on the night of the 13th. However, the attack was unsuccessful after the defending army calmly responded. The remaining troops of Liu Bocheng, numbering over ten thousand, continued to launch a fierce assault on the outer areas of Jinxiang on the 14th, again engaging in fierce fighting with the National Army.

[This newspaper Zhenjiang, 14th] Approximately three divisions of the Communist army, retreating from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and the eastern bank of the Grand Canal towards Shuyang and Suqian, are under the personal command of Chen Yi. After valiant resistance by the National Army and the recapture of Yanji, their offensive has been somewhat thwarted. Using the people as human shields, they are digging in at the old site of Qian, virtually leveling the entire county with artillery fire. The battle for Suqian has reached its climax, but as of this morning, the county seat still stands firm.

[This newspaper Zhenjiang, 14th] It is reported that: (1) The Communist army in southern Shandong is actively reinforcing its troops for a southward offensive, and Liu Bocheng has ordered his forces to consolidate southern Shandong in preparation for a counter-offensive in northern Jiangsu. (2) Xu Xiangqian, after his defeat in Funing, has been reorganizing his remaining forces in the area of  Taishan, eighty li northeast of Xinpu on the Tongyu Line, showing signs of resurgence. (3) The "People's Union" led by Hao  Ju, with over five thousand troops, attacking Xinba Town on the Pu-Shu Line, was routed and scattered after a counter-attack by the National Army. (4) Fierce fighting continues along the Yao Yao Wan and Zao He sections of the Longdong Canal today.

[This newspaper Xuzhou, 14th] The war in southern Shandong is escalating. The Communist army, consisting of the Jiejin Division, the New Fourth Division, the First Division, the Third Division, and the 7th, 8th, and 9th detachments of southern Shandong, a total of five divisions, launched another fierce attack on Rongxian on the night of the 11th. A brutal bayonet battle ensued with the defending forces. At midnight, the Communist army concentrated its firepower, launching a fierce assault on the South Gate and Tanshi Mountain outside the urban area. The Catholic Church in the South Gate was stormed by the Communist army. The defending troops of the Zaozhuang coal mine are still engaged in intense fighting with the besieging Communist army.

[This newspaper Zhenjiang, 14th] After a week of intense attacks by the Communist army, the National Army abandoned Hancheng a few days ago and retreated to Hantai to complete a counter-encirclement strategy. The Communist army only gained an empty city when they invaded  County. The high ground surrounding  County is now under the control of the National Army. The battle for Zaozhuang is extremely fierce, and it is reported that the Communist army has suffered over ten thousand casualties on that front.

[This newspaper Xuzhou, 14th] The Twelfth Brigade of the New Fourth Army, led by Zhang Taisheng, along with local militia totaling over ten thousand people and over four hundred cavalry, sneaked into Kongzhuang and Liwa in Xiayi on the 11th, attempting to make trouble. If this group of Communist army is allowed to infiltrate and roam freely, it would be a serious problem for the ten or more counties in the Su-Yu-Wan border region, similar to a spreading disease.

[Central News Agency Hefei, 14th] The Communist army disturbing the Wo River area is retreating towards Haoxian and Yongcheng after being engaged by the National Army.

### Complete Deployment of National Army Units; Situation in Eastern Hebei Stabilized; Normal Traffic Restored on the Pingjin Highway

[This newspaper Beiping, 14th] Eastern Hebei has become stable, and the National Army has completely seized the initiative. Shangguan Yunxiang, Deputy Commander of the Eleventh War Zone stationed in Tongxian, and Chief of Staff Song Kentang have returned to Beiping today. The strength of the National Army stationed along the Pingjin Highway is sufficient to maintain control and ensure safety. The deployment of National Army units has been completed. In Derenwu, on the border between Tongxian and Wuqing, over a thousand Communist soldiers are surrounded by the National Army. The Communist soldiers in Renmiao Town and Sanbaihu south of Xianghe are trying to break out and return to the mountains. Douzhi County, which has been occupied by the Communist army for several days, may be recovered soon, and the newly appointed County Magistrate Wang has advanced with the army. The strength of the National Army defending Nanyuan has also been strengthened.

[Another dispatch] Military intelligence: (1) The Communist Party's Central Hebei Military Region is holding war preparation meetings in various counties and is actively expanding its army, initially recruiting one hundred thousand people. (2) In villages near  County in eastern Hebei, motorized Communist forces equipped with American equipment, disguised as the National Army, have appeared at night recently.

[Central News Agency Beiping, 14th] Ma Ju Bridge, Xiji Town, and Yongledian southeast of Tongxian were recovered by the National Army on the 14th. Small groups of Communist soldiers are still causing trouble in the area, and the National Army is still fighting. The Pingjin Highway is calm along the way and is now open.

[United Press Beiping, 14th] Reliable military sources here claim that the Pingjin Highway has resumed normal traffic for the first time in a week.

### Communist Army of Northeast China Crosses the Songhua River for a Southern Offensive; Zhongchang Railway Bridge Destroyed Again

[This newspaper Beiping, 14th] Liang Huasheng, Chairman of Jilin Province, telegraphed Gan Guze, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Northeast Headquarters, today, stating that the Communist army attacking Jilin has been repelled one after another.

[This newspaper Pan Yang, 14th] The Communist army has recently gathered its forces and launched an offensive, crossing the Songhua River in three routes for a southern offensive. The eastern route is in Wulajie and Shulan, north of Jilin, and Qitamu on the west bank of the West River, heading towards Jiuhe, intending to cut off the traffic between Changchun and Jilin. The western route is in the Nong'an area, and the central route is crossing the river from Taolaizhao and attacking Dehui. The offensive is quite fierce, and the National Army is reinforcing and counter-attacking.

[This newspaper Shenyang, 14th] The situation in Yongji has become critical under the threat of a large Communist army force. Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang and his staff flew to Changchun on the morning of the 14th to deploy counter-offensive military operations. Yi Guorui, Deputy Commander of the First Air Force District, accompanied them.

[Central News Agency Shenyang, 14th] The 24th and 25th Brigades of the Communist army attacking Huadian were defeated by the National Army, but they have been reinforced by over 7,000 troops and continue to attack the National Army stationed at Datoushan (20 kilometers northeast of Huadian) and Gonglangtou. The fighting is extremely fierce. Another group of Communist army attacking Heishi Town is still engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army in the southeastern area. Over 2,000 Communist soldiers attacking Changshantun have been repelled by the National Army, but they are still planning to attack again.

[Central News Agency Changchun, 14th] (1) The Communist army invading the Liao'an border area, after being defeated by the National Army's counter-attack, still occupies Yuchang (east of Benxi), Pingtingshan, and Balidianzi (50 kilometers west of Huanren), and harasses them from time to time. In order to eliminate the threat, the National Army advanced into the above-mentioned areas on the 11th, and the Communist army fled south. (2) The main force of the Communist army is concentrated east of Dehui, along the Qiaohe and Qitamu areas, and attacks the National Army stationed in Chengzi Street and Daqing  zi (30 kilometers southeast of Dehui) with four columns. (3) Over 10,000 Communist soldiers are concentrated near Taolaizhao and attack the National Army stationed in Bajagou. It is said that the 5th Division among them is a mixed division.

[Central News Agency Changchun, 14th] After the Communist army destroyed the Zhongchang Railway's Zhongde Iron Bridge between Changchun and Songhua River again before dawn on the 12th, they built fortifications near the bridge to prevent railway workers from repairing it. On the afternoon of the 12th, the Communist army attacked from Weichun and retreated to Dehui. The bridge is located 97 kilometers north of Changchun and has two parallel bridges. The upstream bridge was built by Imperial Russia with nine spans, while the downstream bridge was built by the Japanese with fifteen spans, each approximately 300 meters long and 20 meters high. In late May, when the Communist army retreated north of the Songhua River from Changchun, both bridges were damaged in four spans. After the Zhongchang Railway employees repaired the breach with over 10,000 sleepers, it reopened to traffic. It is reported that the Communist army has now burned all the sleepers. According to the responsible person in charge of the railway engineering here, the bridge is the largest bridge between Changchun and Songhua, and the engineering work is huge. The damage is very heavy after being destroyed twice. However, if not hindered by artillery fire, it is expected to be repaired in about three or four days.

### Changchun War Criminals Investigation Committee to Conclude Work Soon

The Changchun War Criminals Investigation Committee was officially established in September 1946 and has successively reported 108 suspected Japanese war criminals, including seven criminals from the secret organization Japan National Essence Group formed after the victory. They have been sent to the Changchun Garrison Headquarters for interrogation and transferred to the Shenyang Northeast Headquarters Military Tribunal for trial, three of whom have died of illness.

### The Closure Project Cannot be Delayed; The Closing Work Must be Completed in One Go During the Dry Season; Water Conservancy Authorities Express Opinions on the CCP's Protest

[Central News Agency Kaifeng, 14th] After the news of the CCP's protest against the closing of the breach and the diversion of water, as well as their demand to stop, spread, it aroused a wave of anger among the 30 million people of Henan, especially the people in the Yellow River flood area. Our reporter paid a special visit to the person in charge of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to inquire about their opinions. They expressed the following: The Yellow River breach closure and levee restoration project is in response to the urgent demands of millions of victims in the flood area and is related to the fundamental plan for national reconstruction. Since the victory, the central government has ordered that efforts be accelerated to promote it. Not only are the people of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu eagerly awaiting it, but people at home and abroad are also paying close attention. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission's Breach Closure and Levee Restoration Engineering Bureau is currently working day and night to complete the joint observation work in one go during the dry season. Otherwise, if the major flood arrives this year, all the projects that have consumed infinite human and material resources in the past year will be threatened by floods. If there is an unforeseen event, who will be held responsible? Therefore, the key to the closure is to race against time. It is rumored that the CCP plans to build dams to block water and breach levees in the middle to continue flooding Hebei and Henan. Zhao Mingfu, the representative of the CCP, recently told reporters in Shanghai: "If the Water Conservancy Commission and the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ignore the CCP's request and accelerate the closure, the local people will take self-defense and self-rescue actions." The claim of building dams and breaching levees is not without reason. If the people can build dams and breach levees, why not actively devote themselves to levee restoration work? The intention is incomprehensible. If this is the result of the CCP's leadership, it is very unwise. We sincerely hope that this is just a rumor and will not become a reality.

### Discussion of Proposals at the Work Relief Conference; Proposal to Adopt Agricultural and Industrial Materials Accepted; Egerton and Hopaum Fly to Beijing to See Chairman Chiang

[This City News] Yesterday was the second day of the UNRRA Work Relief Conference. At 0900 hours, representatives from various member states attended as scheduled. Director Lu Guangjin presided over the meeting. First, the heads of various departments reported on the work of their respective departments, followed by representatives from various sub-bureaus who raised issues with the work. After a break, the financial group, general affairs group, and storage and transportation group of the General Office reported on the progress of their work. One opinion was that the greatest difficulty was the excessive transportation costs, which resulted in the financial group's funds being mostly used for transportation (it was reported that the average cost of transporting materials was 100,000 to 150,000), putting the staff in a difficult situation. This was one of the proposals. A suggestion was made on the spot whether one-tenth of the relief materials could be used as transportation expenses to reduce the burden on the Finance Department. In addition, it was proposed to make full use of agricultural and industrial materials as work relief, which was also accepted by the conference. The meeting continued at 1400 hours, and Mr. Smith, a representative of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, reported on the main policy of relief work and discussed it. Mr. Smith continued: The assistance and supply of work relief have gradually weakened due to the approaching end of the UNRRA and the General Office. We must make the most of the short time and small amount of materials, so as not to lose the greatest significance of work relief. The conference will continue today and will discuss more than one hundred proposals submitted by the conference in turn.

[Another message] Egerton, Director of the UNRRA Sub-Bureau, and Ho Shishu, Director of the General Office, flew to Beijing together yesterday morning to see Chairman Chiang and make some requests. Price, Deputy Director of the UNRRA, accompanied them and is scheduled to return to Shanghai this morning.

### Date of Public Trial for Main Culprit of Wanbaoshan Incident Still Undetermined

[Central News Agency Changchun, 14th] It is reported that the date of the public trial for Hao Weide, the main culprit of the Wanbaoshan Incident, has not yet been determined. Since the local prosecutor's office prosecuted him for the crime of forming a gang to rob, the case is clearly within the scope of the amnesty decree according to the provisions of the amnesty decree. However, since the case involves collusion with foreigners to sell out rights and interests, the situation is different. If it constitutes the crime of internal disorder and external troubles under the criminal law and applies the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, it cannot be pardoned. The Changchun District Court is currently investigating in many ways, and it has not yet been decided whether it can be handled as a robbery case.

### The Calmed Military Mediation Department Quietly Passes Its First Anniversary

[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office] The first anniversary of the establishment of the Military Mediation Department quietly passed today. There were no gatherings, no ceremonies, and not even a single word of sentiment was expressed by the three committee members. Government committee member Zheng Jiemin said, "He completely forgot that today is the anniversary of its establishment." This day last year, when Mr. Zheng assumed office, he said to the surrounding reporters that he came by plane and hoped to return to Nanjing by train soon. In the past year, he has been to Nanjing several times, but he has not yet taken the Pingpu train once! Communist committee member Ye Jianying, upon seeing reporters today, immediately hung up a "no war" sign. His first and last sentence was: "I cannot say a single word today." The American old committee member, Robertson, could not withstand the torment and aged long ago. General Gillon had to come and take on this difficult task. He was also determined to be a golden man who kept his mouth shut, and preemptively instructed his staff to have reporters wishing to see General Gillon contact the press office. On this anniversary, the only noteworthy movement in the Executive Headquarters was that at around 3:30 PM, Gillon first visited Zheng Jiemin and spoke for about 20 minutes. Then, Ye Jianying visited Gillon and left after speaking for about 25 minutes. Ye said that it was just a conversation of a routine nature. In these days of mediating disputes amidst the flames of war, the three committee members often do not see each other for ten days or half a month, and it is simply rare to meet. The Military Mediation Department today is not what it was in the first half of last year. The Communist guards at the entrance have long been removed, and only government military police are aimlessly wandering around. The three-ring armbands issued last year, weathered by the year's wind and rain, now look like nothing. Although people still come and go in the corridors of the building, they all lack tension and vitality. The rhythm of the typewriters in the offices is also slower and more subdued than before. The tents of radio stations used by teams spread throughout the country to communicate news, which used to be all over the courtyard, have long been completely dismantled. The leaves of the rows of willows all fell off last spring, and not even a single new bud can be seen on the bare branches. Apart from this desolation and loneliness, the Military Mediation Department spends more than one billion yuan on meals and heating alone each month, costing every Chinese person two yuan! Bao Wen, the head of affairs at the Peking Union Medical College, the landlord of the Military Mediation Department, is a very good old man. He did not complain that the ineffective Military Mediation Department was delaying the college's recovery. He said that the American side had made the greatest effort for peace in China, and he welcomed the Military Mediation Department to continue working for peace in China at their hospital.

Editorial

### After the Municipal Council Adjourns

The second general meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council opened on the 6th. The original agenda was for one week, but because there were so many proposals that could not be fully discussed, it was decided to extend the meeting by one day. Then, in order to carefully review the municipal government's financial budget proposal for the 36th year, it was decided to temporarily adjourn the meeting until early February for a general meeting to discuss it. During this adjournment period, the budget proposal will be submitted to the Finance, Budget and Regulations Committees for review. Therefore, starting yesterday, after the Municipal Council completed its eighth meeting, it temporarily adjourned, and its agenda came to an end.

The Municipal Council is a body of public opinion that emerged in Shanghai after the restoration. It was established in August of last year and held its first general meeting. The second general meeting was held on January 6th of this year. Looking back, although the resolutions passed by the first general meeting have been gradually implemented by the municipal government, they may not be able to fully satisfy the Council. Therefore, in his opening speech at the second general meeting, Speaker Pan had to say, "I hope that all colleagues, representing the opinions of all parties, must consider the burden on the citizens on the one hand, and understand the difficulties of the municipal government's administration on the other hand, and fulfill the responsibilities that representatives should fulfill in this general meeting." Councillors are situated between the citizens and the municipal government, and inevitably find themselves in a difficult situation. During the eight days of the meeting, we heard a lot of debate within the meeting, and at the same time, we saw the disturbances outside the meeting. Although it can be seen as a manifestation of the spirit of democracy, it is also sufficient to prove the difficulty of the current situation in Shanghai. If the municipal authorities cannot have a broad vision and strive for innovation, it will be difficult to produce good political achievements for a while.

Shanghai is the first trading port in our country and the cultural center of the country. The large population and the prosperity of industry and commerce are above other cities and provinces, and it is also the focus of Chinese and foreign attention. Therefore, the reform of Shanghai's municipal administration is urgently needed and cannot be delayed. However, what is the objective environment like? It makes it almost impossible to reform municipal administration. Shanghai has been gloriously recovered for a year and a half, but affected by the domestic situation, it has not only failed to achieve the goal of prospering Shanghai, but even stability is out of the question. Take the hawker problem as an example, which caused a great uproar. In December of last year, the wild rise and fall of gold notes caused a financial turmoil. This year, major manufacturers in this city have successively experienced labor unrest due to the year-end bonus issue. One after another, problems have emerged endlessly. Other problems such as the bankruptcy of national industries, the price issue, the housing shortage issue, and the electricity saving issue... all show the difficulties of the people's livelihood and the unrest in society. However, these problems cannot be solely blamed on the municipal authorities, nor can they be solved by the Municipal Council. To be honest, is not all this caused by the influence of the overall domestic situation?

At present, the overall domestic situation is too dangerous. If domestic wars do not stop for a day, domestic transportation cannot be restored for a day, and goods cannot flow smoothly. Not only is it impossible to start production and construction, but the price problem cannot be fundamentally solved. As a result, Shanghai has become an abnormal city. On the one hand, the surge in population and massive consumption have created superficial prosperity; on the other hand, due to the influence of the overall situation, industry and commerce are in recession, the number of unemployed people is increasing, and those with jobs also feel the hardship of life. Therefore, superficial prosperity and the hardship of the people's livelihood have become an ironic contrast in Shanghai. In addition, Shanghai's municipal administration is extremely complex, and any reform is "impossible without money"; and the economic capacity of Shanghai citizens is very limited, and they are already overwhelmed by the budget proposal put forward by the municipal government. Therefore, if we analyze the current environment in Shanghai calmly, we are unwilling to criticize the past municipal facilities, and even if we want to talk more about the things that should be done and reformed in the future, we are really unwilling to say more.

At this meeting, the Municipal Council raised many questions about the police, health, education, society, public utilities, public works, finance, and land administration, which was quite verbose. As representatives of the citizens, it was their duty, which should not be criticized; however, we believe that these are all passive in nature and can only vent the accumulated grievances of the people; and they still lack the power to promote the reform of Shanghai's municipal administration. We believe that the Municipal Council should put forward more constructive opinions on the future municipal administration. In fact, the demands of the four million citizens of Shanghai today on the municipal authorities are very simple. In a word, it is to build a stable and prosperous Shanghai. However, in the current environment, if the municipal government wants to meet the people's requirements and make their expected stable and prosperous Shanghai a reality, there are also two prerequisite fundamental issues:

The first is how to establish a good social atmosphere? Everyone knows that Shanghai's social atmosphere is extravagant, decadent, and licentious to the extreme. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly mentioned this in his instructions to the Shanghai municipal government. We have studied that the formation of this atmosphere was left over from the "concession era" and must not be allowed to exist in today's Shanghai society. But how can we change customs and make Shanghai's social landscape new? We believe that it should start with the municipal government independently establishing a good political atmosphere. All the civil servants of the municipal government cannot be generally referred to as "no official is not corrupt", but there is indeed a small number of people who, after coming to this ten-mile foreign land of Shanghai, cannot resist the temptation of pleasure and are assimilated by the social atmosphere and live their extravagant and licentious lives. The cases of seeking personal gain and engaging in malpractice that occurred during the term of the previous mayor have now been exposed one after another, which is really the most shameful stain in the history of Shanghai's municipal administration. Therefore, we hope that the current mayor can accept our opinions with the attitude of "correcting if you have mistakes, and making efforts if you don't", and that the transformation of Shanghai's decadent social atmosphere should start with the municipal government establishing a good political atmosphere.

The second is how to prosper industry and commerce? This issue is certainly related to the rise and fall of our national industries, and it should fall within the scope of the national economic policy. However, every time we meet a friend in the industrial and commercial circles and talk about the future of China's industry and commerce, they all shake their heads and sigh, and unanimously believe that taxes are too heavy and unbearable, making it impossible for industry and commerce to revitalize. We read in the newspaper that the budget proposal submitted by the mayor to the Municipal Council totaled 33 million yuan, and each citizen had to bear an average of 60,000 yuan, which cannot but be said to be too heavy. Shanghai is the center of China's industry and commerce, and its rise and fall are greatly related to the development of China's economy. We have to speak out loudly to the municipal authorities on behalf of the industrial and commercial circles and ask them to reduce the burden on the people, and never "drain the pond to catch fish", so that industry and commerce cannot exist at all. As for the income of the municipal government, it should give priority to solid things and reorganize tax collection, which can also increase income. As for expenditures, although it cannot live within its means, it should also give priority to austerity. At present, the structure of the municipal government is also too large.

In short, the Municipal Council has now adjourned. The municipal authorities should immediately and earnestly implement the resolutions passed in the eight days to show that Shanghai's municipal administration has been able to achieve true democratization. Since Mayor Wu also knows that "the 36th year of the Republic of China will be the most difficult and arduous year in Shanghai's history", he should also know that any reform and all implementation must focus on stabilizing society and prospering industry and commerce. Conversely, the municipal administration that is related to these two should be postponed in this difficult year. As for such a huge budget issue, the most attention of the Council is still on whether the people's economic capacity can bear this burden! Fortunately, it has not yet been passed and is still under review by various subcommittees. All four million citizens of Shanghai are holding 120,000 points of enthusiasm for the Council's review of the budget proposal. Whether the councillors can truly represent public opinion is a major test facing all the councillors!

### Jiangsu Province's Grain Collection Is About to End; Great Improvement After Supervision; Zhejiang Province's Grain Collection Also Set to Be Completed by the End of the Month

[Special Dispatch from Our Zhenjiang Office] Jiangsu's grain tax collection work is about to end. The Provincial Grain Bureau issued a series of orders last month to collect the full amount within the time limit to meet the needs of military grain and civilian food. Bureau Chief Liu Yunheng immediately dispatched Deputy Bureau Chiefs Hong Qishen and Zhang Silin, as well as relevant section heads, to travel to various counties on both sides of the Yangtze River to sit and supervise the collection. It is now learned that after the supervision, the collection performance has greatly improved. Even if some counties cannot collect the full amount, it is actually due to the poor innate environment of those places. The bureau is now presenting the performance of each district to the ministry separately for rewards and punishments, hoping to achieve the effect of encouragement and improvement. The number of collection departments is recorded below: The planned rice collection involved 27 counties, and 2,071,087 shi have been collected.

### Yuyao Salt Price Turmoil: Ox Carts Follow Up With A Strike

[Special Dispatch from Our Yuyao Office] After the current increase in salt funds in the Andong Salt Yard in this county, the wave of salt farmers demanding supplementary salt funds has now spread to the ox cart industry. According to salt yard merchants, salt is distributed and transported out. Whether it is inland river or offshore, it must be transported by ox cart to the river port. Therefore, the ox cart is the only means of transportation for the salt yard. There are more than 300 ox carts on each road, and most of the car drivers are salt farmers who also work as car drivers. Now, because the car drivers' request to the authorities to increase the cart price has been rejected, all the car drivers have gone on strike in response since the 7th of this month, causing salt transportation to be suspended and the salt yard to become more chaotic.

### Bengbu Merchants Close Down One After Another

[Special Dispatch from Our Bengbu Office] As the Lunar New Year's Eve approaches, the market is becoming more sluggish. Under the shadow of recession, the wind of closure is swirling. According to a survey by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, another 27 businesses announced their closure in December of last year due to financial stagnation and inability to make ends meet.

The largest number of closures is in the timber industry, mostly due to tight credit and inability to survive the New Year's Eve under high interest rates. Since the beginning of the month, Fucheng Money Shop announced its closure on the 4th due to insufficient chips. Although the industry has tried to help, there is no hope of resuming operations. In order to curb high interest rates, the municipal government has strictly banned underground money shops. Tongyu Money Shop was found to be operating without the approval of the Ministry of Finance and was ordered to cease operations on the 9th, with a deadline of 10 days to complete liquidation and fined 500,000 yuan as a warning to others.

### As Lunar New Year Approaches, Huaiyin Urgently Distributes Relief

[Special Dispatch from Our Huaiyin Office] The recovery of Huaiyin has brought about popular suffering. As the Lunar New Year approaches, prices have doubled, and the general poor people feel even more embarrassed. Mr. Wang Shuxiang, as chairman of the Relief Association, has an inescapable responsibility. He specially convened a temporary conference on the afternoon of the 9th to discuss emergency relief measures. Bian Jinqian, Commissioner of the Huaiyin Office of the Jiangsu-Ningxia Branch Office, attended and reported that the relief materials for the entire Huaiyin County included 800 bags of rice, 30,000 sets of cotton clothes, and 20,000 yuan in cash, ready for distribution. However, because Director Zhang's communication is very cautious and he dare not entrust it to others to avoid abuses, the internal personnel of the office are not numbered and allocated, resulting in the inability to seize the time, which is considered slow. County Magistrate Huang Jiaju said that Director Zhang is realistic and his good intentions are deeply admirable. However, in the middle of winter, cotton clothes should be issued to the poor disaster victims as soon as possible to keep them warm, otherwise, spring breeze warmth cotton clothes will not be suitable for needs and will lose the meaning of relief. He is willing to do his best to assist. Wang Shifu, a representative of the Chamber of Commerce, also expressed his willingness to mobilize all the cloth industry merchants to cut and measure the clothing materials. After discussion, it was decided that in addition to the distribution amount of the Relief Office, a portion of rice or flour and bean flour would be allocated for an emergency relief in the seven townships in the urban area recently to help the poor people spend the New Year. The distribution procedures should be as simple, rapid, and effective as possible. It was stipulated that the Association should send four people, the Chamber of Commerce should send three people, the County Government should send seven people, the Party Headquarters should send one person, the Youth League should send four people, and the Township Office should send two people. They should be divided into seven groups, each with three people, and go to each township on the morning of the 11th at 8:00 AM to conduct household surveys together with the Pao-Chia chiefs. After the survey is completed, the flour certificate will be issued immediately so that the poor people can receive the flour early with the certificate. It is estimated that there are nearly 6,000 poor people in a total of 84 pao in the seven townships. If 6,000 bags of flour and 3,000 bags of bean flour are allocated, each person can receive one bag of flour and half a bag of bean flour. In the future, if there is any surplus in the allocated accounts and relief rice, it can still be given to the most severely affected households in Huaiyin.

### Ferry Service Restored in Minhang and Fengxian, Facilitating Traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway

[Our Newspaper, Minhang] The Shanghai Engineering Office of the Highway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications considers the Minhang Huangpu River a vital transportation route on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Before the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Communications had a special ferry for automobiles to cross the river, which was very convenient. During the occupation, this transportation means was destroyed long ago. A Minhang Ferry Management Office was specially established and ordered an amphibious landing craft from the United States, specially for military, government, commercial, passenger cars, and animal-powered carts to cross the river. The ferry has now arrived in Minhang and has begun operation. The fare for first-class cars is 1,500 yuan in national currency; for animal-powered carts, it is 750 yuan in national currency. This has been implemented since the day before yesterday.

[Our Newspaper, Fengxian] Xidu Estuary in this county is a key point on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Before the war, a state-run ferry used to run to Hangzhou to maintain traffic on the Huangpu River. Since the enemy invaded, the ferry service was suspended. Usually, wooden barges were relied on for crossing, which was quite inconvenient. Now that the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway has been restored and opened to traffic, the Huangpu River ferry service urgently needs to be restored. It is reported that the Ferry Management Office has approved the Shanghai-Fengxian Ferry Company to operate the service before the establishment of a state-run ferry, in order to facilitate the safe and prompt passage of passengers. The company is actively preparing and will resume service soon.

### Proclamation to the Families of Martyrs Zhu and Tang

I am an active-duty soldier currently serving as an education adjutant in the First Battalion of the Seventh Officers Training Corps in Wuchang. During the War of Resistance, I served in the 79th Army of the Army. Because two of my fellow soldiers from the same hometown in this army sacrificed themselves for the country and were buried in foreign lands, now that victory has been achieved, their families may not know the truth and may still be waiting hopefully for news of their beloved sons or fathers. Now I am announcing the facts so that their families can understand the truth, no longer harbor empty hopes, and can apply to the government for pensions and transport their loyal remains back home.

The first is Zhu Shiwei from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, who was around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old at the time. Before the war, his family lived in the Yong'an Street of the French Concession in Shanghai. After the War of Resistance began, he entered the 15th class of the Infantry Department of the Central Military Academy. After graduating, he was assigned to work in the 79th Army. During the Battle of Changde in the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic, he was a company commander in the 194th Division of the 79th Army. He was seriously wounded and died on the way to treatment. He is now buried in the countryside of Dayong, Hunan.

The second is Tang Yiming from Yixing, Jiangsu, who was fifty-three or fifty-four years old at the time. His wife had passed away, and he had only one daughter in Shanghai. During the occupation, he taught at Sizaobang Elementary School in Pudong. Before the war, Tang had worked as a teacher and clerk in the district government in Xiaofeng and Anji, Zhejiang. When the area was occupied, he joined the 79th Army and served as a clerk, etc. In the summer of the 34th year of the Republic, he was working as a clerk in the 10th Regiment of the Fourth Training Corps of the Chinese Army Headquarters when he died of illness in Sanyanggang, Taoyuan County. He is now buried there.

The above-mentioned Zhu and Tang were both my friends during their lifetimes, and I worked with them in the 79th Army for many years. Zhu was also a classmate from an earlier class at the military academy. Because the two gentlemen were unable to communicate with their hometowns during the war and passed away suddenly, and because so much time has passed and they are far away in foreign lands, it is very difficult for their families to find out. Therefore, I dare to expose this in the newspaper, hoping that the relatives and friends of the two gentlemen in Shanghai, knowing this news, will quickly arrange for the transportation of the coffins and apply for pensions, etc., so that my wish will be fulfilled. If Zhu and Tang knew about this under the spring, they would be able to rest in peace. Cheng Hander's mailing address: Wuchang Jinshuizha Headquarters

I couldn't help but feel sadness when I read the article about the abandoned baby in Chongming published in your newspaper on January 9th. Yimin even witnessed a baby being wrapped in rice straw and placed on an open-air fresh produce stall as if it were fish, on the morning of the day before yesterday. This situation is truly heartbreaking. If Chongming is like this, other impoverished and disaster-stricken areas must be even worse, which is truly painful. Before the war, infant care institutions were established everywhere, varying in scale depending on local economic conditions, but they were all supported and managed by local philanthropists and gentry. During the war, due to the oppressive environment, most were destroyed. I sincerely hope that local authorities and philanthropists and gentlemen will actively plan to restore the original infant care institutions in those places, and for those places where economic capacity is limited, the government should find ways to provide subsidies to promote their establishment. At the same time, the baojia system should be used to strictly prohibit abandonment and protect humanity. There is nothing more urgent than this. I hope philanthropists everywhere will quickly take action! (Qian Yimin)

On the 10th of this month, this newspaper published an article by reader Zhang Yucheng, "Request to Restore Telegram Branch Offices." We have now received a letter from the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau in response, stating: "In order to avoid congestion for telegrams sent and received by all sectors, this Bureau has successively established eight branch offices at No. 25 Changzhi Road, Sichuan Road Post Office, Fujian Road, Ennan Road, Yuyuan Road, North Railway Station, and Wusong Pudong. Furthermore, because the location of the Bureau's main business office is not spacious, we have recently expanded the telegram receiving area to reduce congestion and achieve the goal of allowing telegram senders to send telegrams as soon as they arrive. However, due to the drastic fluctuations in prices recently, the congestion situation is uncertain from morning to night. This Bureau has been doing its best to add manpower and work overtime at any time. The sections pointed out by Mr. Zhang, such as the branch office refusing to accept telegrams and having to wait until the next morning to send them out, may not be consistent with the facts. We sincerely hope that Mr. Zhang will specify the date and time or come to the Bureau's business office to explain the process in detail. We will of course answer sincerely."

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The four-power deputy foreign ministers' meeting opened today. French representative Hervé, American representative Reber, British representative Sir Strang, and Soviet representative Gusev will be responsible for drafting the treaty with Germany and drafting the agenda for the Moscow four-power foreign ministers' meeting. The treaty with Austria will be drafted by British representative Lord Hood, American representative General Clark, and Soviet representative Gusev.

[Associated Press, London, 14th] The representatives of the four foreign ministers met today to discuss the drafting of the German and Austrian treaties. This meeting must be concluded by the 25th of this month so that the various agreements reached can be submitted to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March for review. Although it is not known what the Soviet Union's requirements are, the attitude of the United States has recently become more conciliatory. It is generally believed that the German and Austrian treaties should be treated differently. Austria should be granted full restoration of independence immediately, but the treaty with Germany must be harsh, making it pay the price for causing World War II, compensate the losses of various countries, and prevent the resurgence of dictatorship. However, in addition to the issue of punishing Germany itself, if its new border is determined, the interests of the victorious countries will vary, and disputes are bound to become a major obstacle.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The meeting of the four-power representatives to discuss the German and Austrian issues is scheduled to begin here at 3:00 PM today (11:00 PM Shanghai time). The first thing to be decided today is whether the meeting will be open to the public. All previous deputy foreign ministers' meetings were confidential, but at the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference, ample news was released to the press. Therefore, the attitude to be adopted this time should be decided at the beginning of the meeting. Today's meeting may not immediately formulate a work plan for the two separate meetings on Germany and Austria. This plan should be decided in separate meetings. The Austrian issue meeting is also not as simple as generally imagined. The first thing to be decided is the extent to which Yugoslavia and Austria are allowed to participate in the discussions, and to review Yugoslavia's demands on Austria (Yugoslavia had previously submitted a note to the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference, wanting to demarcate the Carinthia Province, inhabited by Slovenian people in Austria, to Yugoslavia). Secondly, it is to decide what kind of German funds within the military districts of Austria can be transferred as reparations. In addition, there is also the issue of navigation on the Austrian part of the Danube River. This issue may once again cause a conflict of interest between Western countries and the countries along the Danube River, because the countries along the Danube River hope that the river will be controlled only by each of them, while the Western countries hope that the river will become a truly internationally controlled river for all countries to navigate. This position has not changed to this day. The main task of the German issue meeting, in addition to reviewing the opinions of the smaller countries, is to decide whether to allow the future German government to sign the German treaty. Luxembourg's land claims against Germany are expected to conflict with France. Luxembourg requires its eastern border along the Our and Sauer rivers to extend up to five and a half kilometers further and also requires a small square of land south along the Moselle River. Part of this land is within the so-called Greater Saar region claimed by France, so France is expected to oppose this claim.

### Germany and Austria Hope to Attend and Present Arguments

[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] The four-power deputy foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the German issue is scheduled to begin tomorrow in London. German political and official circles hope that at least two or three of the four powers will agree to allow German experts to attend and present their opinions. Although they have not yet formally submitted a request to the Allied Control Council, they claim that two of the four powers have already paid attention to this issue. Before returning to Moscow, Marshal Sokolovsky, commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces, had informally discussed this matter with the German side and the Allied side. It is heard that Murphy, the American political representative, agrees to allow German experts to attend and present their opinions. Although Britain has not formally expressed its position, it is expected to take the same attitude as the United States and the Soviet Union. The only question is the attitude of France. It is heard that each major German political party will soon submit a list of experts to the Allied Control Council for approval. After approval, the Allied Control Council can instruct them on the scope of their activities.

[Reuters, London, 13th] The Austrian government has formally requested the four powers to allow it to participate in the negotiations on Austria's future as soon as possible. The Austrian government's note points out that Austria was the first country to be invaded by Hitler. The current discussion on Austria's future should aim to restore Austria as destroyed by Hitler. Obviously, it is impossible to revive it without Austria's participation.

### Czech Republic Requests Revision of Border Treaty

Denmark States Its Position on the Treaty with Germany

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 13th] After the Czech government issued a memorandum to the four powers explaining its views on the future fate of Germany, it is widely believed that it requires the current border line between the Czech Republic and Germany to be moved into German territory so that the Czech Republic can control the Bohemian hillside originally in German territory. It has been said that the memorandum also raises other demands on German territory, such as Ratibor and Hlubiszów, controlled by Poland after the Potsdam Agreement. This statement has been corrected by people here, saying that it is not true. Since the Czech government did not mention Hlubiszów in the memorandum, everyone believes that the Czech Republic supports the current border between Germany and Poland near Mies and Wodzisław.

[Agence France-Presse, Danzig, 13th] People here said that when the four countries hold a deputy foreign ministers' meeting in London to discuss the German issue, Denmark's position will be the same as in the recent memorandum to the four powers, that is, Denmark believes that the meaning of democratic rights stipulated in the Weimar Constitution is not sufficient and that the people's rights and individual freedoms of the German people still need to be protected before they can be qualified. The minority non-Germanic people in Germany, especially the pro-Danish people in the Southern Schleswig region, should also be given the same protection. Denmark also advocates that the Holstein administrative power in the Schleswig region should be self-governing in nature and that the local people should have the right to self-determination. In addition, Denmark should also demand that hundreds of thousands of foreign refugees in the region be sent elsewhere.

### On the Issue of Atomic Control, Britain Will Support the US Position

[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Responsible parties declared today that if the United States and the Soviet Union face off in the Security Council, Britain will support the United States and firmly advocate that the issue of atomic energy control should be discussed before the issue of general disarmament. The Soviet Union advocates that the issue of general disarmament should be discussed immediately and opposes prioritizing the discussion of atomic energy. The United States believes that if a control method for atomic weapons is not decided first, the control of other weapons cannot be discussed. Representatives believe that the fundamental dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union is expected to be resolved at the Security Council meeting on the 15th. At the same time, representatives of the Security Council reviewed Britain's lengthy complaint against Albania, accusing Albania of planting mines in the Corfu Strait, killing and injuring 44 British soldiers. The case is expected to be submitted for discussion before the 17th.

### Prime Minister Blum in London: Anglo-French Negotiations Underway, Events of Common Interest to the Two Countries Are the Theme of the Discussions, Talk of an Anglo-French Customs Union Rises Again

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The negotiations between French Prime Minister Blum and British Prime Minister Attlee were held at 10:00 AM today at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Ambassador to Britain Annet also participated. Bevin hosted a luncheon at noon, and the meeting continued at the Foreign Secretary's official residence in the afternoon. The meeting will continue tomorrow. The British government will formally host Blum tomorrow afternoon. Prime Minister Blum can only stay in London for sixty hours. The British side is well aware that he will withdraw from politics as soon as the French President is elected. If this opportunity is missed, it may not be available again for a while.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] On the day of French Prime Minister Blum's visit to Britain, many French economic experts were in London, including Baraduc, assistant to Alphen, Director of Economic Affairs of the French Foreign Ministry. According to well-informed sources, Baraduc's mission to Britain is to discuss the issue of reducing tariff barriers with the British government and to make the same request to the sixteen countries that participated in the trade preparatory meeting here last November. According to the information, the meeting at that time suggested that each participating country could propose various concessions before December 31st of last year. Today, Baraduc is discussing this matter with the British Ministry of Commerce representatives and exchanging views with British economic commissioners on the procedures for the Geneva Tariff Conference in April. It is recalled that when French Transportation Minister Moch recently visited the UK, there were rumors that the UK and France would sign a customs agreement. Now that Blum has arrived in the UK, this rumor has become even louder, but officials have not confirmed it. However, it is a fact that the two countries are currently conducting economic negotiations. In addition, British and French economic experts will hold a meeting in Paris on the 17th to allow the British side to learn the details of the French plan, and then carry out plans to develop British production. The parliament will study this matter next month.

Political and Economic Issues are Interrelated

[Reuters, London, 13th] The Prime Minister's residence at No. 10 Downing Street officially issued a communiqué tonight, stating that the topic of discussion between French Prime Minister Blum and British Prime Minister Attlee this week was issues related to the common interests of the two countries. The official statement from the French Embassy in London also said that the discussion was about issues related to the common interests of the two countries. According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, although French Prime Minister Blum's main motivation for coming to Britain was the issue of coal, well-informed sources pointed out that in fact, economic issues are difficult to separate from political issues, so the future of the entire Ruhr region will be reviewed at the same time. According to this agency's report from Paris, a French Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that Prime Minister Blum's visit to Britain will discuss the coordination of the British and French rehabilitation plans and France's coal shortages with the British Prime Minister.

Leaders of the Two Countries Exchange Letters

Blum responded and decided to go to the UK on the weekend. When French Transportation Minister Moch went to London on January 1st, he carried a letter from Blum to Attlee, expressing his hope to strengthen Anglo-American economic cooperation and strongly emphasizing that France's coal issue is inseparable from economic cooperation. However, at the current stage, France cannot be supplied with more coal. He sincerely hopes that Blum can go to London and talk directly with British cabinet members. The French spokesperson then said that Prime Minister Blum will return in time to participate in the French presidential election on Tuesday afternoon.

### Anniversary of the First UN General Assembly Session - Guo Taiqi Praises the Achievements of the United Nations

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] On the first anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly, Dr. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese representative to the Security Council, issued a statement praising the achievements of the United Nations. He stated that the economic, social, racial, and territorial issues to be resolved by the Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship Council are of great importance. Although China was in a state of hardship and unrest last year, it was still able to adhere to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. In this environment, China can be said to have made its greatest contribution to the United Nations. China firmly believes that to reach a political agreement on the above issues, far-reaching steps must be taken, and international cooperation is especially necessary. We believe that the treatment of people in all territories of the world who have not yet achieved self-government must be improved, and their economic and social rights should be recognized. If this is done, it will greatly benefit international understanding and world peace. The achievements of the United Nations General Assembly are significant, which is very gratifying. Among the most important achievements is the unanimous adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of a resolution on universal control and reduction of armaments and troops. If concrete and effective measures can be taken, the world will enter an era without war, and the human and economic resources of all countries will be used to promote human happiness and no longer for war.

### New French President - Auriol Expected

Herriot as Candidate for Speaker

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 14th (Radio): French Radical Socialist leader Herriot has secured the qualifications of a candidate for the National Assembly after the Popular Republican Movement provided unanimous guarantees.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] French Communist Party Secretary-General Duclos declared in the parliamentarians' lounge today that the party would not nominate any candidate for Speaker of the National Assembly, but intends to nominate a candidate for Speaker of the Senate. The various political parties in the parliament are scheduled to convene a joint meeting tonight to exchange views on the presidential election scheduled for the 16th of this month. Observers predict that the various parties can form the following arrangement: (1) Socialist leader, the current Speaker of the National Assembly, Auriol, amiable, capable, and talented, will serve as President of the French Republic. (2) Communist Maran will serve as Speaker of the Senate. (3) As for the Speaker of the National Assembly, it will be Radical Socialist leader Herriot, allowing him to display his eloquence. (4) As for the position of Prime Minister, Blum, due to physical weakness, may not want to continue (his temporary position as acting Prime Minister will last until the formal election of the president), then it will be filled by a leader from the Popular Republican Movement, if not former Prime Minister Bidault, then it will be former Minister of Justice Teitgen.

### Viet Minh Counter-Offensive in Hanoi - Safety of Overseas Chinese District Is Worrisome

[United Press, Hanoi, 14th] Fierce fighting resumed in Hanoi today, with Viet Minh forces attacking French military positions surrounding the Overseas Chinese district of the city, and using 75mm field guns to bombard various areas of the city. The French military headquarters stated that the attackers on foot were members of the Viet Minh armed youth group, with the apparent intention of testing the strength of the French military positions. The intensity of the Viet Minh's offensive today was unprecedented in recent days, with simultaneous attacks on several locations, sometimes gathering hundreds of people to attack one place. The Overseas Chinese district, with a population of 10,000 overseas Chinese, has been surrounded by the Viet Minh forces, which has become a difficult problem for the French. The Overseas Chinese district occupies 500 square yards and stretches for a mile along the south bank of the Lo River. The Doumer Bridge, which crosses the Lo River and connects to Hanoi's airport, is located in this district.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 13th] An official communique was recently released, stating that French forces conducted a mopping-up operation in the southwest suburbs of Hanoi, and the Viet Minh troops retreated in haste, abandoning many corpses. In the Lang Son area, the Viet Minh regular army was forced to withdraw from the Bac Ninh district.

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] According to a French observer who just returned from Vietnam, the recent killings of overseas Chinese in the south of the city were instigated by the Japanese, who falsely accused the overseas Chinese of being French spies as a pretext. The observer also said that the stage of large-scale military operations in Vietnam has passed, and there will only be mopping-up operations against the remaining forces in the future.

### Grafting Brings Back the Light

[United Press, Reno, Nevada, 14th] Here, a 31-year-old Catholic priest, Edmund, who lost his sight in his right eye ten years ago due to a gunshot wound, has regained his sight after a local surgeon inserted the eyeball of an executed murderer into his right eye.

### Blum Government Will Clarify France's Attitude Towards Vietnam

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Reliable sources say that the Blum government will propose a resolution at the last meeting of the National Assembly this Wednesday or Thursday before the new president is elected, clarifying the French government's attitude towards the situation in Vietnam. The resolution will be based on the agreements signed between France and the Viet Minh last spring and summer.

### Truman and Marshall Can Talk Across the Ocean

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] President Truman spoke with General Marshall in Hawaii by long-distance telephone today. White House Press Secretary Ross said that the two had a heartfelt conversation, and the time of General Marshall's arrival has not yet been determined and will be announced after the President speaks with him again.

### U.S. State Department Secret Files for Marshall to Refer to at Any Time

[United Press, Washington, 13th] An official revealed today that when General Marshall takes office as Secretary of State this week, he will receive a secret file detailing the current diplomatic policies of the United States towards major countries, guiding him in handling diplomatic affairs. Marshall is the first Secretary of State in American history to receive this type of file. The nature of this file is very confidential, clearly explaining the basic policies accumulated by the United States. It was compiled by the State Department in conjunction with the Joint Chiefs of Staff based on reports from major ambassadors and opinions from informal advisors and famous university professors over several months, becoming a kind of national policy. This is of particular value to Marshall's urgent preparation to participate in the Foreign Ministers' Conference in early March. Although Marshall is familiar with the situation in China and is a world-renowned military strategist, he is still an outsider to the detailed inside story of post-war diplomatic developments in the United Nations, Europe, and other locations. The preliminary preparation for this comprehensive formulation of national policy began during Secretary of State Hull's time and was completed by Secretary of State Byrnes. After Byrnes' sudden resignation, he told a friend with admiration that he hoped he could have had this kind of file when he first took office as Secretary of State, as a compass for diplomatic negotiations.

Negotiating to Organize a Coalition Government

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th (Special Dispatch)] Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida returned to Tokyo yesterday from his hometown of Oiso, and the Japanese political situation will soon undergo rapid changes. Political activities in Tokyo yesterday were very active. Shigeru Yoshida visited the Imperial Palace to pay respects to the Emperor, and met with Kijūrō Shidehara, the leader of the Progressive Party, and Secretary-General of the Cabinet, Rinji Numata.

### London Labor Strike Worsens - Labor Circles Oppose Military Transportation of Essential Foods

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] London dockworkers have decided to strike until the military withdraws from the market, in sympathy with the strike of food porters and truckers.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The London transport workers' strike will be delayed until the 21st for a decision by the Central Wage Handling Bureau due to legal reasons, but employers and workers are still seeking other ways to break the deadlock.

[United Press, London, 13th] Senior British government officials told reporters here today that Prime Minister Attlee threatened to resign on the 10th of this month during a dispute with three ministers who opposed the use of the military to transport essential food supplies. At the same time, another 10,000 workers joined the strike of 14,000 truck drivers today in a sympathy strike against the military transportation of essential food. The tense situation has become increasingly serious. Although the differences of opinion within the cabinet have been reduced, they have not yet been resolved, and the labor community has expressed unanimous dissatisfaction with Attlee's issuance of this order and will publicly express it again. Subway, bus, tram, and other drivers have openly discussed their dissatisfaction, but there has been no formal action to join the strike so far. One thousand trucks driven by the military are all stationed with police, and food markets are also protected by the police, but no disturbances have occurred. It is reported that truck drivers are demanding a 44-hour work week and two weeks of paid vacation per year.

### Improving Equipment to Ensure Aviation Public Safety - British Consortium Formed - Many Airplane Accidents in Various Countries in Six Weeks

Overseas Airlines, British European Airways, and British South American Airways have received permission from the Ministry of Civil Aviation and have now formed a consortium to ensure the safety of aviation travel. The company is named "International Aviation Wireless Electricity Co., Ltd.", equipped with wireless radio transmission, flight guidance, and blind landing equipment. The company does not aim to make profits, and is subsidized by the governments of relevant countries and the airlines using the equipment. It is expected to be established within six months and can start providing services.

[Reuters, London, 13th] There have been many airplane accidents around the world in the past six weeks, resulting in the deaths of 200 people. Therefore, the authorities concerned announced today that they will take two major actions. The U.S. Senate committee summoned representatives from the U.S. Civil Aviation Administration and various airlines today to investigate the causes of the recent series of plane crashes.

Aung San, the chief representative of Burma, and representative Ba Shin responded directly, demanding complete independence for Burma. Aung San said: "The Burmese people unanimously demand complete autonomy. We certainly hope to exercise this right as soon as possible, and at the same time hope to exercise law and fact in the future." Ba Shin said: "Nothing but complete independence can satisfy the wishes of the Burmese people." The meeting will continue under the chairmanship of Wendeli. During the meeting, both sides avoided discussing the details of actual independence.

### Gandhi Marches and Inspects - Calls for Indian-Muslim Unity

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 14th (Radio): Mahatma Gandhi of India continues to tour the areas of conflict between Hindus and Muslims in East Bengal Province, preaching his doctrine of non-violence. There are no railways there, and the roads are extremely bad. He is accompanied by a small number of followers and four black goats. When his followers arrive at a village, they always sing hymns together. Opinions on the success of Gandhi's trip vary. Newspapers supporting Gandhi say that his trip has given many Indians comfort and restored peace and goodwill to the conflict zones, but Muslim newspapers say that Gandhi's trip was a failure.

[United Press, Karachi, 13th] Gandhi set off from Lenchur at 7:30 this morning and arrived at Karachi on foot in half an hour. Because the soles of his shoes were broken and his toes were bleeding, Gandhi plans to walk through the villages of East Bengal in six days to call on all walks of life to unite Hindus and Muslims.

### The Soviet Union and Afghanistan Exchange Agreement Documents

### Will There Be a Food Panic Around the World This Year?

In terms of the world's food production as a whole, large quantities of wheat, sugar, potatoes and fish are actively increasing in supply. This year, the production of rice and vegetable oils will increase, but meat, milk and cheese and other animal fats will still be as scarce as last year.

According to reports from wheat-producing areas on various continents, when various grains are harvested this year, their quantity will exceed any year during the war. The total harvest this year is about 5.9 billion bushels. From this figure, the future of bread-eating countries is optimistic.

Rice Production Still Insufficient

Most of the rice-eating countries are located in Asia. A large amount of rice production can also be expected this year, but it is still inferior to that before the war, decreasing by about 10%. Because Asia's population is multiplying rapidly, this year's grain production may not be enough to avoid serious famine. The total world rice production is estimated at 6.9 billion bushels, which is an improvement compared to last year's production of 6.3 billion bushels, but it is still far behind the pre-war production of 7.4 billion bushels. As a result, the Chinese and Indians will face localized famines.

The key to the current food problem is Europe and Asia. In Europe, wheat is the main food. The harvest of grains this year will be 1.2 billion bushels, which is a slight improvement compared to the 1.03 billion bushels last year, but it is still far behind the pre-war production of 1.62 billion bushels.

The heavy rain in the United Kingdom and Western Europe and the drought in Eastern Europe are the reasons for the decrease in wheat production in Europe. British wheat is often soaked and cracked by excessive rain during the autumn harvest. Naturally, these moldy grains are only suitable for animal feed and cannot be used to bake bread for human consumption.

Eastern Europe and the European part of the Soviet Union are both places where rain is lacking and it is difficult to harvest large quantities of rice and wheat. This year in Central and Eastern Europe, the production of wheat, potatoes, and sugar beets will not exceed 70% of pre-war production. The lack of fertilizer and political upheaval are the main reasons.

The Mediterranean Basin has plenty of sunshine and the production of food will have a good future. Greece, Italy, Spain and French North Africa can all have richer production than last year. The yield of grains, rice, potatoes, beets and olive oil may advance from 55% to 85% of pre-war levels. The most critical areas in Europe are western Germany and Austria. Poor weather, political turmoil, and lack of manpower all foreshadow a dark food future this year, similar to last year.

The increase in rice production in Asia cannot keep pace with the increase in the birth rate. In the past five years, India alone has added 25 million hungry people waiting to be fed.

Thailand, Burma, and French Indochina used to be surplus rice-producing areas, but their production is still far from what it was before the war. The reduction in production in this area is mostly affected by the Japanese occupation, as well as the lack of tools and political unrest.

China and India Face Even Greater Difficulties

China and India will continue to feel the threat of hunger. The crux of China's food problem lies in political instability, and the north-south railway trunk lines cannot be smoothly connected. Therefore, the people in the south and central regions cannot obtain food from the north. According to pre-war consumption, China still lacks 5.4 million tons of rice. The only way to save China from famine is to import rice and miscellaneous grains.

In India, the three months before last December's harvest were already experiencing an urgent shortage. To overcome this difficulty, India must import grain and reduce rationing. The United States, Brazil and other countries will supply rice to India, but the quantity is limited. Famine is unavoidable.

Abundant food will be produced in the Western Hemisphere.

Canada is expected to harvest 400 million bushels of wheat this year, which has not been seen since 1942, an increase of 35% compared to last year. Large quantities of grain are now being transported directly from farmers' wheat fields to the United Kingdom via Hudson Bay, which takes just over a week. Oats and barley will also have abundant yields.

The United States will produce 1.16 billion bushels of wheat this year, an increase of 37 million bushels compared to last year. The Department of Agriculture estimates that if the climate is normal this year, it is possible to reach this fixed number. Last year, in order to relieve the famine in Europe and Asia, the United States opened up its warehouses, and the remaining grain was the lowest in 20 years. This year, it is expected to increase to 275 million bushels, and it is possible that a large amount of wheat will remain in storage for emergencies.

Animal fats in the United States will decrease slightly compared to last year. It is necessary to increase imports and prohibit export dumping. Storage capacity is also very limited. Although pig breeding may increase in a certain area of the United States, it is still difficult to catch up with last year.

Last year's strike by the US shipping industry occurred when the famine in the Far East was severe and the US urgently needed to import food, which exacerbated the hunger and malnutrition of the people in the eastern countries.

Argentina's grain and wheat exports are far below pre-war standards. Only meat exports exceeded the 1945 quantity. Argentina's rural areas have planted 10% more this year than last year, and it is predicted that exports will have significant progress this year.

Food rationing will still be implemented in many countries to reduce the aggravation of food panic. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will continue to ration bread.

Food Controls Will Still Be Maintained

International food controls will still continue. It is necessary to find ways to transport large quantities of food to the countries that need it most. The production and consumption of food in the current world cannot be left to natural evolution. But controlling surplus food to eliminate food shortages this year is not as urgent as last year.

Countries experiencing food panic, such as China and India, also need economic assistance. The United States must take on this responsibility. Areas that were trampled on by the Japanese army are continuing to need food imports.

The United Kingdom and several Western European countries will also need food imports due to poor harvests. The British will reduce the purchase of daily goods and raw materials to compensate for the lack of food. The UK's national budget will need to be increased in preparation for food imports.

There are still some obstacles in world shipping. Although the harvest is expected to be better this year, the famine-stricken areas are very far from the abundant harvest areas. This year, more ships will be needed to transport food to all parts of the world.

Wheat flour will flood the markets of countries around the world that do not use wheat flour as their main food. Indians originally only knew how to eat rice, but now they have accepted wheat flour as a substitute food. In Mexico and Brazil, rice-eating workers have now tried eating wheat flour, and they all like to eat pasta.

Opening up New Land Solves Food Shortages

This year, food storage will increase compared to last year, and there will be no more risky measures to empty warehouses to save famine like last year.

New soil must continue to be opened up and cultivated. The world's population is now about 5-10% higher than before the war. But food production has not yet reached pre-war quantities.

But it can be asserted that there will not be a large-scale famine this year. Although the people of the entire world cannot reach the pre-war "normal" food standard, there may be hope for food abundance by 1948. (Translated by Yu Jing from "World Report Weekly")

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] The Department of Agriculture recently announced that the UN will ship 8,500 tons of grain to China in February to aid refugees. The total US grain exports in February totaled 460 million bags, which is almost the highest figure in 1946-1947. The distribution is as follows: United Kingdom 19,000 tons, British territories in the Pacific 42,500 tons, India 69,500 tons, British and American occupied areas of Germany 301,000 tons, French occupied areas of Germany 35,500 tons, Japan 16,500 tons, Korea 16,500 tons, Belgium and the Netherlands 38,500 tons each, Switzerland 27,000 tons, Austria 35,500 tons, Greece 30,000 tons, Italy 22,000 tons, Poland 2,500 tons (Note: This grain refers to wheat and other items, excluding rice. The UN plans to ship 245,000 tons of rice to China in the first half of 1947).

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Relations Division declared that the pre-war rice production standard was 7.4 billion bushels. If it is desired to restore the original state, it depends on whether Asia can restore its production. The 1945 production was 11% short of supply and consumption. It is feared that in the coming year, the Western Hemisphere will need to transport rice to the Eastern Hemisphere, reversing the past situation. It will take two to three years before countries hope that rice-producing countries in Asia will restore their pre-war status and export rice.

[Report from our newspaper] The day before yesterday, the Senate discussed the tuition standard for private primary and secondary schools for the next semester (second semester of the 35th year), but no result was reached. Yesterday, during the plenary session, the senators spoke enthusiastically and emotionally, which still caused a fierce debate. As a result, it was decided that the maximum amount for primary school tuition would be 130,000 yuan, junior high school would be 170,000 yuan, and senior high school would be 220,000 yuan. (According to the tuition standard for the previous semester, primary school was 80,000 to 120,000 yuan, junior high school was 120,000 to 160,000 yuan, and senior high school was 160,000 to 200,000 yuan, an increase of about 10%. The standard proposed by the Bureau of Education for discussion in the plenary session was 100,000 to 150,000 yuan for primary school, 150,000 to 200,000 yuan for junior high school, and 200,000 to 250,000 yuan for senior high school, an increase of 25% compared to the previous semester.)

During the discussion, the Director of the Bureau of Education took the stage and explained the tuition standard proposed by the Bureau of Education with numbers, saying: Before the war, primary school tuition was about 8 to 12 yuan. Taking 12 yuan as the base and multiplying it by the living index of 6,000, the current tuition should be 72,000 yuan. However, the salary of primary school teachers before the war was 20 to 40 yuan. Taking the average of 30 yuan and multiplying it by 6,000, it is only 180,000 yuan per month. Before the war, secondary school tuition was 25 to 30 yuan. Taking 30 yuan and multiplying it by 6,000, it should be 180,000 yuan. The salary of secondary school teachers before the war was 120 to 160 yuan. Taking 100 yuan and multiplying it by 6,000, it should be 600,000 yuan. Please compare these with the proposed standard.

Those who opposed the tuition increase for this semester included Jiang Huaisu, Huang Bingquan, Fei Shuzeng, and Zhou Lianze. Their reasons were: The life of teachers and staff should be sympathized with, but the burden on most parents should be taken into consideration. After the fee increase, the treatment of teachers and staff has not improved, but the principal has made a fortune. Now the tuition has increased by about ten thousand times compared to before the war, so the treatment of teachers and staff should also be increased by this multiple. Otherwise, it will only increase the interests of a few people. Schools are not like shops and should prioritize education. If the funding is insufficient, the board of directors can subsidize it. As Director Gu said, before the war, secondary school tuition was 30 yuan. Calculated at today's living index of 6,000 times, it should be 180,000 yuan. But in the previous semester, when it was 3,700 times, 200,000 yuan was charged, which is half more. If interest is added, not only can this semester not be paid, but some can be taken back. How many people have committed economic suicide recently reported in the newspapers? In the previous semester, some borrowed money for their children's tuition. With this year being so tight, how can they afford this tuition? We are here to represent the majority of the people, not just a few. Please look outside the door more!

Those who supported the standard proposed by the Bureau of Education included Xi Yushu, Deng Fuchun, Tao Guangchuan, and Fu Xiaozeng. Their reasons were that private schools rely entirely on student tuition to maintain themselves. In the past six months, rice, yarn, gold, and paper money have all risen in price. According to the cost of living index, it has risen by about 50% compared to the previous semester, but the proposed tuition standard only increases by 25%. Teachers' lives are threatened, but tuition is not allowed to be adjusted, which is unreasonable. Everyone has children and hopes to receive a good education, but the teaching efficiency can only be improved after the lives of teachers and staff are stable. Today, we should encourage people to run education, and we must not dishearten those who are already in the education field and make them leave. If it is said that the board of directors can subsidize the funding, most of the board of directors are nominal. Among the participating senators, there are also those who serve as directors. May I ask how much funding has been taken out? Which school has it been given to? As for saying that parents are a cow and cannot bear the burden, teachers are also a cow, and they not only have to be a cow for their own children, but also for educating other people's children! Senator Tao Guangchuan even shouted loudly: Having participated in education work for 20 years, I am disheartened to witness this situation today.

Subsequently, many people put forward compromise opinions. Zhu Wende advocated maintaining the original amount for primary schools in the previous semester, while increasing 20,000 yuan for secondary schools. Qu Yue advocated that the maximum for primary schools should be 100,000 yuan, and the maximum for secondary schools should be the standard proposed by the Bureau of Education. Wang Xianqing advocated that primary schools should be 100,000 to 140,000 yuan, junior high schools should be 140,000 to 180,000 yuan, and senior high schools should be 180,000 to 220,000 yuan.

Voting At the end, when Speaker Yuan was about to put it to a vote, Senator Lu Yinchu suddenly requested the Speaker to explain Article 13 of the Senate's organizational law (which stipulates that when voting on motions related to their own interests, they should withdraw from the venue, so senators related to the education sector would not be allowed to participate in the vote). Speaker Yuan immediately stated that he had no right to interpret it. If this article is implemented, then regardless of the discussion of agricultural, commercial, and industrial laws, agricultural associations, chambers of commerce, trade unions, or lawyers would not be allowed to participate in the vote. If there is a lack of communication, this article can only be explained by the central government. Subsequently, the two opinions of appropriately adding and not adding were put to a vote. As a result, the majority voted for appropriately adding, and the various amounts of appropriate addition were put to a vote. As a result, the majority passed the decision that the maximum amount for primary schools should not exceed 130,000 yuan, junior high schools should not exceed 170,000 yuan, and senior high schools should not exceed 220,000 yuan.

Free Quota Furthermore, the Ministry of Education stipulated that private schools approved by the Municipal Senate must have a 20% free quota and a 10% half-fee quota. The senators spoke one after another, saying that most private schools in the previous semester did not comply with this regulation. Speaker Yuan expressed his opinion on this, saying: The Municipal Senate approved the tuition standard for private schools and the free quota in the previous semester. Now private schools only know how to charge fees according to the standard, but do not comply with the free quota regulations, which is simply a deception. It is proposed that the Bureau of Education thoroughly investigate the issue of free and half-fee quotas for private schools in the previous semester. If anyone does not comply with the regulations, the board of directors should replace the principal, otherwise the board of directors should be disbanded. Director Gu then claimed that the average free quota for each school in the previous semester accounted for 15%, the main reason being that when the Senate passed this case last time, most schools had already charged fees. It is not easy to ask them to spit out the fees they have already collected. Therefore, the Speaker said that the responsibility for replacing the principal for failing to comply with the regulations is probably heavy, and the entire group will be replaced. This is because I did not supervise effectively in the previous semester, and I am very sorry. Speaker Yuan then changed this proposal to asking the Bureau of Education to thoroughly investigate the situation of free quotas for private schools last year and report it to this council. This year, please notify all schools in advance and strictly enforce it. Otherwise, the principal will be replaced and the board of directors will be disbanded. The entire room applauded and passed the motion.

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the case of abolishing the Municipal Experimental People's School and the Municipal Experimental Drama School, which was resolved in the previous Senate meeting, the Mayor submitted a request to the plenary session for reconsideration in order to promote the promotion of people's education. During the discussion of the case yesterday, Senator Fei Shusheng advocated allowing the continuation of the operation. The plenary session applauded enthusiastically and passed it by a majority vote.

Before the meeting, students from the Municipal Experimental People's School came to the meeting to petition, and students from the Municipal People's School also participated to appeal on their behalf. When the council discussed the proposal, they gathered in the gallery upstairs and listened attentively. When the case was discussed and put to a vote, they were overjoyed to see that most of the senators raised their hands in favor of continuing the operation, and the applause resounded. When the meeting adjourned, they lined up to wave flags and cheer for the senators who came out.

In addition, regarding the request for reconsideration of the case of abolishing the Municipal Normal School, because Director Gu reported that the students of the school have been merged into the Xinlu Normal School, which does not hinder the cultivation of teachers, the plenary session passed that there is no need for reconsideration.

### The "Miss Luzon" Tragedy A Moving and Tragic Scene… Red Star Dancer Sacrifices Herself to Save a Friend Li Suolan Wrongfully Sinks in the South China Sea Luo Zhifeng Dies of Serious Injuries in Luzon Zhou Lijuan Escapes Death and Telegrams Peace

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the missing passengers of the "Miss Luzon" accident, Miss Feng Ying, who bravely rescued her companion Luo Zhifeng but unfortunately "went to sea," has been identified as Li Suolan, from Ningbo, only 19 years old, a "red star" in the "Metropolitan" ballroom. Li came from the flower world. She used to have a room in Qunyufang Ronghua's house, but she stopped for a while and went to Beijing to visit relatives. This time, she returned to the entertainment venue and lived in Yihua's house at No. 4, Lane 4, Xinhui Le Li, which was only two months ago. Li was tired of living in a brothel for a long time, so she changed to the "Metropolitan" and became a formal dance partner. Unexpectedly, not long after she went to sea, she became famous for "going to sea." Moreover, her death was a sacrifice to save lives, which is also a rare character in the entertainment industry.

Li's departure from Shanghai on this flight was purely due to the call of a regular customer for a short meeting in Hong Kong. Li's best friend, Zhou Lijuan (alias Zhou Ping on the list), was originally a friend in the dance world. Zhou participated in the "Miss Shanghai" beauty pageant when she was a dance queen and was a red star at the MGM Ballroom. The two usually had extensive contacts and got to know Li Chengyu, the chairman of Dafu Company. It happened that Dafu planned to set up a branch in Hong Kong, so they agreed to go together. In addition to Li Chengyu, the other people traveling together were Luo Zhifeng, the person in charge of the company, and Li's friend Sun Ziqing (mistakenly listed as Sun Zhiqing on the list).

The "Miss Luzon" was originally scheduled to depart on the 10th, but it was heard that it was temporarily postponed due to bad weather. At that time, Li Suolan stayed at Zhou Lijuan's residence before the trip for the convenience of traveling. On the morning of the next day at 6:30, when the "Miss Luzon" decided to take off, Li and Luo drove to Zhou's residence to urge them to go together. The two women were still dreaming, and after hearing the news, they were very excited, so they hurriedly dressed up and rushed to the airport.

Looking back at the China Airlines plane crash on Christmas Day, Zhang Chunhua, a martial arts actor, was injured and treated at Zhongshan Hospital. Zhou Lijuan went to visit and comfort him. Witnessing the tragedy at that time, she was deeply wary, so she also considered this flight, and her family also advised her not to take the risk. However, Zhou Lijuan thought that Far Eastern Airlines was run by foreigners, and the plane was a DC4 four-engine aircraft, so she thought it was absolutely reliable, so she decided to take the trip regardless of everything. Unexpectedly, after flying away from Shanghai, something happened again, which was not expected at the time.

Furthermore, when the "Miss Luzon" flew out of Shanghai and approached Kaitak Airport in Hong Kong, it was also unable to land due to dense fog, so it continued to fly to Manila. Unexpectedly, when it approached the sea near Luzon, it was forced to crash into the sea due to an engine fire. At that time, Zhou and Li were the first to be rescued and were safe and sound, but because Luo Zhifeng, who was traveling with them, had unfortunately been injured when the plane made a forced landing and could not climb into the rubber dinghy, Li could not bear to see him die, so she bravely returned to the plane to rescue Luo. Unexpectedly, at that time, the bay was constantly invaded, and Li was swallowed by the waves and forever fell into the "sea of suffering." At this time, the plane had also sunk, and there were still five people on board, who sank with the plane, including Li Chengyu!

At this point, 36 passengers have been rescued. Seeing the plane submerged by the waves and Li Suolan's graceful figure disappeared into the waves, everyone who saw it felt pity!

Although Luo was rescued, he had been seriously injured on the plane and moaned in the rubber dinghy. After drifting at sea for more than ten hours, he was rescued by the "General Gordon" ship.

After arriving in Manila, the injured were immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Luo Zhifeng eventually died due to severe blood loss, confusion, and a very serious situation. He finally died of illness at about 2:00 a.m. yesterday.

### Far Eastern Airlines Planes Ordered to Stop Flying

### Identities of Five Missing Confirmed

Guo Kuangying, who is missing, is a delegate from Guangdong Province and a businessman in Hong Kong and Guangdong. He is a member of the Guo Linshuang family, the general manager of Wing On Company. After the news of the "Miss Luzon" accident reached here, Wing On first telegraphed this newspaper to inquire about the news of Delegate Guo. Unfortunately, he was reported missing. It is said that Guo was returning to Guangdong via Hong Kong.

Mr. Huang Boying is the owner of Yikuang Candy Factory in this port. He enjoys a good reputation in the industrial and commercial circles and is a leader of national product manufacturers.

In addition, Mr. Li Chengyu, mentioned earlier, is the chairman of Dafu Trading Company and the son of Li Peiyan, the former Minister of Civil Affairs of Yunnan Province.

Chen Ningguan is the assistant manager of the Overseas Chinese Xingye Company and went to Hong Kong on business.

Chen Yizhi, another missing person, is the chief of the general affairs section of the Taiwan Provincial Trade Bureau's Hong Kong office. Chen and his colleague Mr. Guo returned to Hong Kong from Taiwan via Shanghai. They were originally scheduled to fly to Hong Kong on China Airlines on the 6th of this month. However, due to the Ministry of Communications' order to suspend the flights of China and Central Airlines for one week, they changed to a Far Eastern Airlines ticket for the 7th. Later, due to the "Miss Luzon" being repaired, it was postponed to the 10th, and then to the 11th. "Far Eastern" reduced the number of passengers to 30 because the plane had just been repaired. Chen and Guo were assigned to the next flight. Later, someone canceled their ticket, and Chen was able to board the plane because he had important business to attend to. Unfortunately, he died.

Zhou Decheng, whose name appeared in the list of rescued passengers, is a mistake for Dai Zhicheng. Dai is the business manager of Dihua Economic and Construction Company. Zhou Lun is a mistake for Guanglun, who is the shipping manager of the company. The two were traveling to Australia via Hong Kong to take over the company's ships and purchase wool for "Fangjian."

### Another Unfortunate News: US Aircraft Crashes and Destroyed in Shantou

[Report from Our Newspaper] A C-46 type aircraft, number 584, belonging to a certain US unscheduled airline, piloted by Chester Pickcup, took off from Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 11th of this month. After flying near the Taiwan Strait, it suddenly went missing. On the 14th, it was found on a beach in Shantou, the entire aircraft destroyed.

Last Saturday, aircraft number 584 and another C-46 type aircraft, number 586, belonging to the same company, took off from Shanghai simultaneously under adverse weather conditions. Aircraft number 586 was also forced to land on a beach on the South China coast due to the bad weather, but later took off again and safely arrived at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong.

Pickcup's aircraft was destroyed on a beach 30 miles south of Shantou. It is reported that pilot Pickcup has walked to Shantou city. It is also rumored that three other flight personnel were with him, but this has not been confirmed.

When these two aircraft took off from Longhua, they were dissuaded by some experienced pilots. However, the two American pilots test-flew over the airport for four hours, considering it satisfactory. When the two aircraft left Longhua, they did not go through inspection procedures. Initially, the airport staff thought they were just conducting test flights in the area.

These two aircraft were leased by the Central Aviation Transport Corporation at the beginning of last year, with a three-month contract. However, before the contract expired, they were grounded due to poor engine condition and excessive fuel consumption.

After the US airline company repaired the two aircraft at Longhua Airport, they flew to Hong Kong last Saturday.

It is rumored that after arriving in Hong Kong, the two aircraft were originally intended to be equipped with new engines and then fly to Manila, crossing the Pacific Ocean to Mexico. Another theory is that the two aircraft were sold to a certain American airline in Southeast Asia, but neither has been confirmed.

### Flowerbed Hiding Opium Case Unveiled: Pei Yuanjun Knew About the Planting and Fragrance but Failed to Report; Drug Trafficker Ye Qinghe Suspected as the Owner; Thousand Pounds of Opium to be Sent to the National Health Administration

[Report from Our Newspaper] A large quantity of opium, weighing one thousand pounds and valued at 3.3 billion, was unearthed from the soil in a flowerbed at the residence of Pei Yuanjun, number 31 Dade Lane, Lin Sen Middle Road. Details have been reported in this newspaper. According to Pei Yuanjun's statement at the Changre Precinct yesterday, he was unaware of the opium. He purchased the house from Shi Zhaoguang in June 1942, with a purchase contract as proof. On the first day he moved into the new house, he noticed a mulberry tree planted in the flowerbed in the courtyard, which he considered inauspicious, so he asked the gardener Zhou Asan to replace it with a nandina plant. When excavating the soil, he discovered that the soil contained fragrant substances. After investigating, he realized it was opium. He originally intended to report it to the police, but he was afraid to cause trouble during the enemy occupation. He also stated that when he moved in, there was a safe buried under the stairs, the contents of which he did not know. Later, he ordered it to be cemented over, and now coal briquettes are piled there. According to the statement, Chief Zhao of the precinct immediately ordered officers to investigate. They found many loads of coal briquettes, which they removed, revealing white cement and a safe underneath. They then hired a coppersmith, Mao Peilong, to pry it open with a hammer, only to find the safe full of sewage and no other items. Pei also stated that Shi Zhaoguang is currently located at number 5, Lane 53, Zheng Lu. Police were dispatched to that address, and Shi was brought to the station. Shi stated that after the house was completed in 1930, he rented it to a Korean (surname forgotten) for about nine months. After that, he rented it to Ye Qinghe, who ran the Guomin Pharmacy on Shenhua Road. Unexpectedly, before a few months had passed, the "January 28th Incident" broke out, and Ye moved elsewhere. Later, he saw in the newspaper that the Shanghai Municipal Council had offered a reward for Ye's arrest, and he realized that Ye was involved in a major case of privately trafficking morphine. At that time, he moved his family in to live there, but soon moved back to his old house at number 1235 Siwen Lane, Datong Road. The house was then rented to Hu Songgao, a technician at the Academia Sinica. In April 1935, Hu moved out, and the house remained vacant for six months. After that, he moved back in and lived there for eight years. In June 1942, he sold it to Pei Yuanjun. He knew nothing else. Gardener Zhou Asan also came to the station for questioning, and his statement was largely the same as Pei Yuanjun's. Chief Zhao of the precinct further told reporters that the interrogation of the suspects in this case has been completed, and tomorrow they will be sent to court. The opium is planned to be sent to the Narcotic Drugs Administration of the National Health Administration for use in manufacturing medicines. Although Pei Yuanjun is indeed a legitimate businessman, his failure to report the matter is also difficult to excuse.

Miss Wan [Missing Character], the beloved daughter of the Wan family of Wengongguan on Lin Sen West Road, is in her early twenties and has a beautiful appearance. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, she suddenly received a strange phone call, asking her to talk at the Nanjing Cafe. When she asked his name, he said that she would recognize him when they met. After saying that, he hung up the phone. Miss Wan thought this was peculiar and wanted to find out what was going on, so she went as agreed. When she arrived at the cafe, she sat alone. After a while, a man in a Western suit came up and asked, "You've been here for a while. Would you like to go dancing?" Miss Wan, seeing a stranger, was [Missing Characters] and ignored him.

### A Gift of a Son from Heaven Turns Out to Be False

[Report from Our Newspaper] A reader with the pseudonym "Qiu Hai" sent a letter to this newspaper, stating that among the passengers on China National Aviation Corporation aircraft number 115, which crashed beside the Heta Temple last year, in addition to the four-year-old Wang Didi who was safe and sound, there was also a swaddled infant who was ejected and caught in the branches of a tree, also unharmed. The infant was taken back and raised by a nearby village woman. The child was fair and beautiful, and the village woman believed it was a gift of a son from Heaven. Mr. Qiu Hai described it in detail. Therefore, this reporter was ordered to go to Heta Temple yesterday to investigate.

Was there really such a thing? The reporter returned empty-handed from Heta [Damaged] Labor Protection Supplies Temple. On the way back, I thought of this Mr. "Qiu Hai." Perhaps he really is "childless in middle age," thinking about "a gift of a son from Heaven" all day long, to the point of confusing his mind. Furthermore, the news of recent plane crashes happened one after another. The old man was therefore dazed and associated it with the branches of the tree at Heta Temple. There are plenty of "fair and beautiful" infants in the world, but the miracle on the branches of the tree at Heta Temple is just a figment of his imagination.

The wreckage of aircraft number 115 is still there, with a dozen workers dismantling parts. The part of the Heta Temple that was crushed is still a pile of rubble. The reporter also met the principal, Mr. Sun, who survived the disaster, as well as the simple villagers nearby who showed surprised looks. They all laughed when they heard the reporter describe this unconfirmed story. Some said, "It's a joke!" Others said, "We all have children at home." Principal Sun, seemingly the hope of the village, said to me with certainty, "Absolutely not such thing. It's simply absurd. Good for a little reward. If it was hidden at home, would people not know?"

We left Heta Temple laughing and took a photo of this "reborn" Principal Sun on the pile of rubble as a harvest for this trip. The broken trunk of the tree next to the wreckage of the destroyed aircraft [damaged], the dead branches are swaying empty in the wind.

Detailed description came in a letter, but the trip to Heta Temple was in vain.

### High Court Collegial Panel Rules: Wen Lanting Granted Bail Due to Serious Illness; Son Posted Bail Last Night and Welcomed Him Out

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wen Lanting, one of the "Three Elders" on the sea during the enemy occupation period, who was detained in Shanghai Prison, was granted bail for medical treatment outside the prison due to old age, frailty, and multiple illnesses, as requested by his family. The High Court collegial panel ruled that the defendant was indeed seriously ill and granted bail for medical treatment. Last night, his son, Wen Chunnan, posted bail and welcomed him out.

Wen Lanting is 78 years old, from Wujin. He served as the supervisor of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the supervisor and director of the Shanghai Business Association, and the director of the Shanghai Cotton Association and the chairman of the Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association under the puppet regime.

The defendant appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial. The retrial was completed on the 9th, and yesterday the High Court sentenced Wu Jianchong to three years of imprisonment for colluding with the enemy country and serving in relevant military organs, depriving him of civil rights for three years, and confiscating his property except for the living expenses necessary for his family.

### As Squad Leader of the Security Team: Admits to Murder

(Report from Our Newspaper) Zhang Xuegen, who once served as a squad leader of the puppet security team, killed another squad leader, Xiang Yingtang, due to uneven distribution of taxes during the enemy occupation period. He was arrested by the puppet security headquarters and imprisoned in the puppet court. After the victory, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution for the crime of treason and murder. He was tried in the High Court yesterday. The defendant was gaunt and wearing a gray prison uniform, one trouser leg gray and one blue. He confessed to the murder, but as for the motive, he claimed that it was not due to the uneven distribution of taxes, but because he had persuaded Xiang Yingtang to join the Loyal National Salvation Army, which Xiang had not agreed to. He was afraid that it would be detrimental to him, so he took the opportunity to kill Xiang, seizing Xiang's Mauser pistol and fleeing. The court then asked why he did not join the Loyal National Salvation Army but instead joined the enemy's garrison force as a secret agent. The defendant prevaricated. Then, witness Shen Guanlian testified that the defendant had threatened him with a kitchen knife, demanding two rifles, and he settled the matter by paying 10,000 yuan in counterfeit currency. Finally, the defendant requested that Ma Desheng, the former captain of the Loyal National Salvation Army, be summoned to testify. The court ordered a change of date for retrial and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.

They were released only after the victory of the Resistance War. During their imprisonment, their family property suffered significant losses due to extortion by Hu, Jin, and others. Victim Zhang Xianliang reported the matter to the High Court. During yesterday's trial, Hu's testimony was cunning, and he tried his best to deny it. After the court hearing, it was determined that witnesses still needed to be summoned, and a new hearing date was set.

### Police and Civilians Clash Over Removal of Shantytowns

(Report from Our Newspaper) The shantytown removal patrol team, jointly formed by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Police Bureau, has been inspecting various prohibited construction areas in recent days, ordering the demolition of newly built shantytowns. When they passed Lane 30, Jessfield Road yesterday morning, police officer Zhang Aixian got out of the car to inspect, while other patrol team members did not get out. Unexpectedly, Zhang suddenly had a conflict with the shantytown residents. Zhang Aixian was severely injured on the spot. Other police officers mediated and sent Zhang to the Walder Road Police Hospital for treatment. The shantytown residents burned incense and candles, claiming that many people were injured and bleeding, and two people were missing in the chaos, demanding that the police bureau release them immediately. Lu Xia, chief of the Traffic Section of the Police Bureau, rushed to the scene after hearing the news and summoned the shantytown residents to talk, expressing that if there was indeed such a matter, he could guarantee their immediate release. However, according to the investigation, the Jiangning Road Police Precinct has already released all the perpetrators. The police bureau is currently continuing to investigate the truth.

### First Person to Re-enter Prison After Amnesty Order After Fifteen Days

Zhao Ganxian, from Huaiyin, residing at number 210, Zhongzhou Hotel, Shandong Middle Road, carried 1.5 million yuan in cash, divided into two large packages, to Yulun Socks Factory at number 126, Jinling East Road, to purchase goods yesterday morning around 9:00 AM.

### American Sailor Stabs Pedicab Driver Case: Rogers Indicted; If Victim's Injuries Are Fatal, Indictment Clause May Be Changed

(Report from Our Newspaper) In the case of Rogers, an American sailor from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) fishing boat, stabbing pedicab driver Cheng Rongfang, the local prosecutor's office has been summoning relevant witnesses and collecting various materials in recent days. It has just been learned that the prosecutor has concluded the investigation of the case and filed a public prosecution yesterday. The indictment is based on Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law (intentionally inflicting an injury, which results in grievous bodily harm, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no less than three years and no more than ten years). Cheng Rongfang suffered injuries to his lungs and gallbladder, and the injuries were extremely serious. Even if the wounds could be healed, his health would be greatly affected in the future. Therefore, the prosecutor believed that he should be indicted for the crime of causing grievous bodily harm. If the victim dies due to the injuries during the trial, the indictment clause will be changed. The prosecutor also stated that the defendant Rogers also suffered a minor injury to his left forehead. According to his statement, he was injured by Cheng Rongfang with an iron ring. However, he could not provide the iron ring or other evidence, which was insufficient to be credible. Furthermore, because the victim only identified Rogers as the assailant, and the investigation confirmed that there were no other accomplices, the other relevant people are not intended to be prosecuted.

### Ohrdruf Agency Case Concluded: 21 Defendants Make Final Arguments; Await Decision on the 17th to Determine Fate

(Report from Our Newspaper) After months of continuous trials by the US military court in the Ohrdruf Agency spy case (Nazi intelligence agency in China), in addition to Shen Ke and six others who have been declared innocent, the remaining 21 defendants were announced in court yesterday to be sentenced at 2:00 PM on the 17th. That time will mark the complete end of the case. All defendants, whether guilty or innocent, will be repatriated to their home countries for execution.

Yesterday was the last hearing in the case. Both sides debated fiercely. The speakers for the prosecution were Colonel O'Connor and Major Du Hua, while the speakers for the defense lawyers included lawyer Jiang Yiping, lawyer Prime, and Lieutenant Colonel Labor.

Colonel O'Connor believed that the 21 people in the defendant's seat could be seen as a microcosm of Nazi Germany. This organized group has been engaged in secret activities in China since 1941. After Germany surrendered, they believed that Japan, a member of the Axis powers, could still win in the Far East, so espionage work continued unabated. Their secret radio stations in South China intercepted information about the Allied Air Force, resulting in countless casualties among our pilots. Their Beijing branch provided the Japanese with information about the absence of Soviet troops on the Manchurian border, which emboldened the Japanese to act.

Major Du Hua, based on the findings of the investigation and the testimony of witnesses in previous court sessions, pointed out that all the defendants of the Ohrdruf Agency continued to engage in espionage work after Germany surrendered, violating the laws of war and were undoubtedly war criminals.

Lawyer Jiang Yiping defended Pu Kaimai, the former director of the Shanghai German News Agency, arguing that there was no evidence to prove that Pu Kaimai provided military intelligence to the Japanese after Germany surrendered.

Lawyer Jinlem also argued that there was no accurate fact that would allow the prosecutor to point at the defendant and say, "This is part of your military cooperation with the Japanese," or "This is the military activity you were engaged in." Therefore, he believed that his clients, Fuerkele and Haixue, could not be called war criminals.

Lieutenant Colonel Layou similarly argued that the prosecutor's office had failed to present sufficient evidence and believed that the accusation that the Shanghai part of the Ohrdruf Agency continued to work after Germany surrendered could not be established.

Luo Men, a former staff member of the Shanghai German News Agency and one of the defendants, also defended himself yesterday, requesting the court to acquit him. He admitted that he had printed propaganda pamphlets, but these pamphlets were never distributed to the front lines, so in fact they did not cause any loss or harm to the United Nations.

After the debate, the 21 defendants were dejectedly remanded in custody, awaiting the decision that would determine their future fate this Friday.

### General Huang Jie's Interview: A Refined General with a Distinguished Air Who Has Fought a Hundred Battles; Shedding Tears at Dachang

[Exclusive Interview by This Newspaper] General Huang Jie (see photo taken by our reporter), known for his refined air, recently took time out from his position as the Education Director of the Central Training Corps to come to Shanghai to preside over the opening ceremony of the Shanghai branch of the corps. General Huang returned to Nanjing after the war last year and has been busy with the duties of the Central Training Corps. The day before yesterday was his first time in Shanghai after the victory. Ten years is not a long time, and the people of Shanghai are familiar with General Huang Jie, who defended Dachang at the beginning of the War of Resistance. This trip to Shanghai also carried a sense of remembrance for General Huang.

General Huang was one of the most prominent graduates of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. Looking through old newspapers from the autumn of 1937, it can be seen that in addition to commanding operations in the trenches, General Huang often brought his "impromptu poems" to reporters for publication. This signified a unique calmness and courage on the front line of life and death, and its side effect was to encourage morale and stabilize people's hearts.

General Huang is from Changsha, Hunan, and his Mandarin has a heavy Hunan accent. The reporter had the opportunity to visit him for the first time at a cocktail party yesterday. Dressed in a grey-green long silk robe, which complemented his fair and rosy complexion, he appeared very refined. If not for the introduction, no one would know that he was General Huang Jie, who had fought hundreds of battles. He talked a lot with the reporter about the issue of officer demobilization. The Central Training Corps was responsible for training party and government personnel during the war, and now it is an institution for officer demobilization training. General Huang has been shouldering this difficult task since the victory the year before last. Officer demobilization and returning to civilian professions is not difficult in foreign countries. Due to China's military service system and national financial issues, it is not possible for this large number of officers to obtain suitable jobs after being discharged from the army. However, the government, in view of their wartime achievements, will naturally provide them with reasonable placement, not to mention that national construction requires a large amount of manpower. According to General Huang's estimates, there are 200,000 demobilized officers after the war, including 30,000 who are overage, injured, and retired; 70,000 who have passed the vocational transfer examination; 30,000 selected as cadres by the Gold Country Division and Garrison Area; 22,000 selected as reserve officers; 26,000 assigned to various provinces for training; and more than 10,000 others who volunteer to serve in the Northeast or participate in military news work.

During the September 18th Incident, General Huang served as the commander of the 2nd Division and fought against the enemy at Gubeikou. During the August 13th Incident, he served as the commander of the Air Tax Police General Regiment and the commander of the Xuhai Garrison. Not long after, he was promoted to commander of the 8th Army and transferred to Shanghai to fight. Of the more than 20,000 men he led, only over 500 remained when they finally withdrew from Shanghai. General Huang stayed in Shanghai for three days this time. He spent two days working at the Shanghai branch office, and yesterday morning he made a special trip to the "ancient battlefield" of Dachang to pay his respects. According to his secretary, Wang Luchang, General Huang lingered in front of the graves of his subordinates in Dachang and eventually shed his "heroic tears." He decided to build an immortal memorial tower in Dachang for his subordinates who died in the War of Resistance. This is the meaning of military education, and he cherishes his subordinates as if they were his own children.

General Huang finished his official business in Shanghai and is scheduled to take a train back to Nanjing this morning to attend the officers' general team compilation meeting of the Central Training Corps.

### Ma Zhanshan Returns to His Post in the Northeast; Departs Shanghai for Tianjin on the Changcheng Ship

Yesterday morning, hundreds of representatives from all walks of life in the city and Ma's relatives and friends came to the wharf to welcome him, all holding flags with the words "Farewell to General Ma Zhanshan" and setting off firecrackers. Ma, dressed in a blue robe and a black woolen coat with a fur collar, looked radiant. He arrived at the wharf at 7:00 a.m., shook hands with the welcomers and said goodbye, and told reporters that he hoped for the early realization of peaceful reunification. At 7:30 a.m., the Changcheng ship left the wharf amidst the sound of firecrackers.

### The Police Bureau Intensifies Winter Defense; A People's Security Conference Will Be Held

[Report from This Newspaper] Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, stated at a press conference yesterday: The Lunar New Year is approaching, and in the current situation of economic depression, the number of unemployed people has increased. At the same time, local ruffians, vagrants, and idlers have not been thoroughly eliminated. In addition, the criminals who were recently released from prison after being granted amnesty are still wandering the streets, without a place to go, which has greatly affected the security of the city. Although the police bureau has mobilized all police officers from various branches, as well as the Security Police General Team, mobile units, volunteer police brigades, and police training school students to fully undertake security duties, it is hoped that citizens throughout the city will pay attention to prevention in advance and maintain contact with the police bureau at any time so that thieves and robbers have no opportunity to take advantage of. The police bureau will also convene people's security conferences in various districts starting today to explain the knowledge of theft prevention, and use radio broadcasts and slide advertisements to publicize widely.

### Dentist Situ Bo's Land Rent Case; Judgment Yesterday: Payment Increased by a Thousandfold

[Report from This Newspaper] The land of 9.43% owned by landlord Xie Zixian at the corner of Linsen Middle Road and Madang Road, rented to dentist Situ Bo, had a land rent of 560 yuan per year before the war. Recently, Xie sued Situ Bo in the local court, requesting an increase in the payment of this year's rent to 1.2 million legal tender in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery. The local court concluded the trial on the 9th of this month, and the verdict was announced at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The main text of the judgment stated: "The defendant, Situ Bo, shall pay the plaintiff 560,000 legal tender for the land rent of the year 1947. The remainder of the plaintiff's claims is dismissed. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant, except for the part borne by the intervenor." It is noted that the local court has ruled that pre-war deposits should be repaid at a rate of one thousand times the original amount as a standard. In this case, the pre-war land rent was originally set at 560 yuan per year, and now the judgment orders an increase in payment to 560,000 yuan, which is also approximately one thousand times the original amount.

### Striving for Light; Too Unfair; The Red Dancer; Shouldn't Steal

Hu Ping, 23, and Hu Jinmo, 21, red dancers from the Great Eastern Stage, live together in a third-floor attic at No. 14 Yongshan Street. Although the room is small, it is exquisitely decorated. The room is equipped with a small electric meter, and the monthly usage reaches more than 30 degrees. Recently, due to the restriction of electricity usage, the light has become dark. Therefore, Hu and others instructed an electrician to connect the electric wire to the main switch. As a result, although the electric lights are lit as much as possible, the number of degrees has been greatly reduced, only two or three degrees per month. This was discovered by Mrs. Wang Huang, the second landlord of the house, who broke into their room at 9:00 p.m. the night before to check the small electric meter and discovered the theft of electricity. Therefore, all nine households of the tenants attacked them. The two sides disagreed and fought each other. Later, the police officers arrived and took them to the police station together. First, the informants stated the previous situation, and said that the defendants had lit hundreds of light bulbs in the room. How could it be that they only used one degree in two weeks? When questioned, Hu Ping said that the electric wire was actually repaired by the electrician, and it was not that we deliberately told him to connect it illegally. The police also summoned the electrician for questioning, and then sent the two Hus to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.

It is said that detailed information will be determined after the company's general manager, Shu Yunzhang, returns to Shanghai from Nanjing.

### Representatives of Various Factories Visit President Song; Discuss and Decide on Adjusting Flour Prices; And Allocate 60,000 Bags of Lilan Flour

[Report from This Newspaper] Five major flour mills in this city, including Fuxin, Zaofeng, Huafeng, Maoxin, and Yutong, have gradually reduced production due to production costs, which has hindered the daily allocation of 12,000 bags of flour needed by various industries in this city. At about 11:00 a.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu specially summoned representatives of various factories at the municipal government, including Rong Yiren, Xi Debing, Bian Xiaoqing, Qian Shouchun, Wu Limen, and Gu Zhunian, chairman of the Flour Business Association, and Zhang Chao, standing director. However, no results were achieved in the discussion on adjusting the negotiated price. Mayor Wu accompanied the representatives of various factories to visit President Song. After the meeting, it was decided to adjust the negotiated price of domestic flour to 25,000 yuan per bag, and foreign Lilan flour (70 pounds) to 37,000 yuan per bag. The allocation price of the Flour Business Association, including transportation, is 26,000 yuan per bag for domestic flour and 38,500 yuan per bag for Lilan flour. This price will be maintained temporarily until the end of January of this year. Also, since domestic flour is insufficient for distribution before the Lunar New Year, it was decided that various factories should first supply 60,000 bags of Lilan flour for allocation by the Flour Business Association.

### As the Lunar New Year Approaches, the Financial Situation Is Still Good; All Banks Have Profits; The Exchange Situation Is Good

[Report from This Newspaper] After the accounts of various banks in this city were settled in 1946, the general situation was still good. Except for those that went bankrupt before the year, the large ones, depending on the size of their capital and the amount of deposits, had profits ranging from 40-50 million yuan to 500 million yuan. At present, the general financial situation does not seem to have changed much, and various banks should be able to get through the Lunar New Year safely.

According to news from the city's clearing house: Although the Lunar New Year is approaching, the exchange situation in various banks has been good in recent days, and there has been no case of overdrafts. The number of returned checks has also not increased.

### Deposit Reserves Reduced; The Central Bank Has Returned the Balance

[Report from This Newspaper] The deposit reserve of various banks was originally 15% and 20%, but it was reduced to 10% and 15% starting in December of last year. However, the reserve was changed to cash. The remaining amount of the reserve has now been returned by the Central Bank.

### The Banking Association Stipulates; Uniform Signature Samples

The Banking Association has recently found that the formats and methods of signature samples sent by counterparties have varied, making it inconvenient for preservation and verification. It is learned that the banks in Chongqing, Hankou, and other places have unified the methods for signature samples of counterparties through the local banking associations. It is now learned that the Banking Association has repeatedly received letters from various counterparties requesting research and improvement in order to achieve uniformity. Therefore, after detailed research, it has drafted a "Draft of Uniform Signature Sample Methods," with four pages of signature styles, and sent it to the Banking Association for circulation to counterparties for uniform adoption in order to achieve uniformity.

### Textile Construction Distributes According to Quota; The Yarn Market Is Depressed

Yesterday, the yarn market declined sharply. The yarn market was already depressed, and in addition, Textile Construction announced last night that all yarn requested for purchase would be fully allocated according to the quota, regardless of the factory number. Those who were thin on funds were all selling at reduced prices. 20-count yarn fell by 100,000, and 42-count double-ply was particularly miserable, falling by as much as 350,000.

### Tight Credit; Cloth Prices Fall

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened in the morning due to the approaching closing period and tight credit. There were many sellers, which caused fine cloth to fall across the board. Five Fortune fine cloth was once quoted at 110,000 yuan, and Three A Colorful Ball was quoted at 108,000 yuan. By the time the market closed, it was heard that Textile Construction had stopped opening fine cloth, and the price rose by 1,000 to 2,500 yuan. As a result, it was slightly lower than the previous day, down 500 to 1,000 yuan. However, Five Fortune fine cloth rose by 2,500 yuan compared to the previous day due to the scarcity of spot goods. Each grade of Shilin was still stable.

### Rayon Declines Again; The Factory Silk Market Is Very Quiet

Yesterday, the rayon market declined again. Because the China Trust Bureau's allocation has been implemented yesterday, the black market depreciated, which was expected. 120-count Asahi-brand shiny rayon was quoted at 3.4 million yuan at the opening in the morning, and was once quoted as high as 4.44 million yuan. In the end, due to a lack of buyers, it closed at 3.5 million yuan, down 170,000-180,000 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, it was quoted at 4 million yuan outside the market, but no transactions were made. Other half-point goods also lacked transactions, and there were no quotations. The factory silk market was very quiet. Most of the silk houses have already balanced their positions and are unwilling to sell. Those who need money and want to sell have reduced their prices. Yesterday's market was not much different from the previous day. The quotations and transaction prices of silk fabrics were very different. The quotations in yesterday's market were not much different from the previous day. Although the price of rayon was small, the price of Huajin crepe was still quoted at 3.5 million yuan.

### The Issue of Foreign Currency Circulation; Unprecedented in Other Countries; Should Be Banned Urgently; Opinions from the Financial Sector

[Report from This Newspaper] The National Federation of Commerce and Industry has suggested to the government to prohibit the circulation of foreign currency within the country. The reporter asked the person in charge of the financial sector about this matter. According to a responsible person of the Central Bank: The circulation of foreign currency within the country is originally extremely unreasonable. No independent country in the world expressly permits the circulation of foreign currency within the country. Therefore, the circulation of foreign currency in China is an unreasonable fact. The current problem is how to eliminate this fact. However, to reduce this fact, a single order cannot be effective. If only a clear prohibition is used, it is inevitable that it will circulate secretly, causing many abuses. Therefore, to ban foreign currency circulation, a thorough and effective method must be devised to achieve a permanent solution. According to a member of the Shanghai Bank, prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency within the country is a reasonable suggestion, and the government should adopt it in principle. However, there will inevitably be difficulties in its implementation. Prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency must be done carefully, and cannot be changed frequently. The speculative trickery of the Chinese people is often unimaginable, and strict prevention is also necessary. At present, the number of wealthy merchants in China who have deposits abroad is extremely large, and the situation of China's finances itself is very complicated. Prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency is only a small part of it.

### Longan Pulp Prices Rebound

Shima dried longan pulp had previously risen by 20-30% due to shortages. Now that a batch has arrived on the Haixiang ship, and the approaching end of the year is also imminent, merchants are not greedy, and the price has eased slightly. Yesterday, merchants only released a dozen boxes, and the rebound was weak, at just under 7%.

### Yesterday's Gold Market Was Calm; Bond and Stock Markets Also Showed Little Fluctuation

Gold Was Stable; Foreign Currencies Were Mediocre; Gold was still stable yesterday, hovering without much change. It opened in the morning at 3.71 million, and was first seen at the high price of 3.73 million. The Central Bank sold at the high price, and it once spun and fell. Before long, the 3.7 million mark could not be supported, and the low price was around 3.67 million. After struggling for a long time, the Central Bank allocated 140 bars at a price of 3.68 million. Afterwards, the supply suddenly became sluggish and restabilized. After 11:00, it crossed the 3.7 million mark again, and stood at around 3.73 million at noon. In the afternoon, the Central Bank tightened controls, so it was unable to rise. From 3.72 million, it gradually fell back, and some yarn industry insiders supplied it, so it looked tired when the market closed. As a result, it fell by 25,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold was 394,000, and the hidden interest rate was still around 1.5%.

Foreign currencies were extremely mediocre. The black market price of US dollars was 6,500-6,600 yuan. From morning to noon, it struggled at this price and there were no special changes. In the afternoon, it was stable with little change, and still hovered around 6,500-6,600 yuan. As a result, it was no different from the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar also had no gains or losses. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still quoted at 1,200-1,220 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,460-1,480 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 19,200-19,400 yuan. Except for the Indian and British exchange rates, only the Hong Kong exchange rate had some transactions.

Bonds Hovered

Chinese Stocks Were Dazed

Yesterday, the bond market was still hovering. There were sellers of 360-series and 503-series, and scattered buying was still active. Tongbing opened in the morning and rose to 2,200 yuan. The low price in the middle was 2,120 yuan. Finally, it hovered around 2,150 yuan. Compared with the previous close, Jiayi and Yi were flat, Tongbing fell slightly by 20 yuan, and Tongding and Tongwu each rose by 50 yuan. The transaction volume was 3 million yuan.

Yesterday, there was a short-term confrontation between the long and short sides of Chinese stocks. Large outside-the-market players were frantically selling, while 221 was frantically buying large quantities of current delivery Yong yarn in the market, and the market was chaotic and slightly dazed. The opening price of each stock in the morning was slightly lower. After opening, 232, 76, 83, 87, 47, and 180 entered, rising to 773 yuan. 224, 152, 14, 198, and 89 sold and fell by more than 10 yuan. 219, 4, 16, 172, and 232 entered, 15 and 145 entered current delivery Yong yarn. Qinxing was bought by 198 and rose to the limit, spinning and rising. Deferred delivery rose to 790 yuan, and current delivery rose to 777 yuan. Unexpectedly, after that, it entered a dogfight stage. 231, 213, and 154 frantically sold current delivery Yong yarn. 224 and 231 also sold deferred delivery Yong yarn. 212 suddenly came into the market to collect a large number of more than one million shares of current delivery Yong yarn, while large outside-the-market players suppressed it. After the high price of 785 yuan of current delivery was seen, it was finally suppressed because the outside-the-market quotation was very low. The noon market was the most tired, and it ended with a stalemate. Compared with the previous close, Yong yarn, Meiya, and Huafeng were slightly stable, Xinhe and Xinguang rose by more than 5%, Qinxing rose by 10%, Jingfu fell slightly, and among the unpopular stocks, Zhongfang, Match, and Jinglun fell slightly. The rest rose and rose by up to 5%. Deferred delivery of Meiya, Xinhe, Xinguang, and Huafeng rose slightly, Qinxing rose by 10%, and Yong yarn fell slightly. In the afternoon, 3 did not enter, and 154 also bought current delivery, seeing high prices of 785 yuan for deferred delivery and 770 yuan for current delivery. 156 and 173 came to Yi for current delivery Miaoyun, and 198, 185, and 152 sold deferred delivery Miaoyun from time to time, and saw a low price of 762 yuan. 22, 186, 231, and 30 entered, 4 exited and then entered again, and once rose to above 775 yuan. 152, 83, and 197 sold off, and were about to withdraw into 770 yuan when the market closed. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yong yarn, Xinhe, Jingfu, and Huafeng rose slightly, Meiya fell slightly, Xinguang rose by less than 10%, Dongxing rose by 10%, and among the unpopular stocks, Cement, Lian, Wuhe, Underwear, and Zhongsi Yonggong Rongfeng and Tongyi all rose. Match and Mutong were flat, and Jinglun, Zhongfang, and Xinya fell. Each stock in the outside market, such as Dasheng, continued to rise, and the rest fell slightly.

Yesterday, foreign stocks were slightly stable, but the ups and downs of each stock were more erratic. Yisha once approached the 9,000 yuan mark. Compared with the previous close, Meilian Copper rose by more than 5%, Yeguang, Shipping, and Paper were flat, and the rest rose slightly.

### Upright Coal Exhibits Excellence

In the coal market, white coal, Hongji lump coal, has active sales. The arrival of Jiaozuo lump coal at the station is relatively low, and the market price is rising. For Pingdingshan Coal Mine No. 2 bituminous coal, the factory shareholders are frequently absorbing it at low prices, and the market price is rising rapidly. Lump coal prices are also rising accordingly. The distribution of coal briquettes at the government price of 5,000 tons in the first batch will begin within the year. Currently, the Shanghai Coal Briquette Retailers Joint Office has a total of 1,200 registered members, divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A is allocated 7 tons, Grade B is 5 and 1/4 tons, Grade C is 3 and 1/2 tons, and Grade D is 1 and 3/4 tons.

[Further News] The Coal Briquette Price Stabilization Committee previously decided that the distribution would start on the 15th. It is reported that due to the rush of preparation time, it is feared that only the payment and collection procedures for retailers can be handled this morning, and the coal briquettes will be available on the market in the afternoon. The procedures for purchasing coal briquettes will still be as previously determined, based on the household registration card. Each household can purchase one "dan" (a unit of weight) from retailers (not limited to the region), and the price is 11,000 yuan per "dan". The sales method of coal briquettes in the various outlets of the Guohua Coal Briquette Factory is also handled in the same way as other retailers.

### China Production Promotion Association: Safeguarding Small-Scale Manufacturers

Li Jishen, Mao Qingxiang, Pan Gongzhan, Hu Boxiang, and others, the leaders of the China Production Promotion Association, in view of the recent precarious situation of domestic goods manufacturers and the cumbersome procedures for government-sponsored production loans, which most small and medium-sized factories do not meet, in order to maintain the market and care for the people's livelihood, specially initiated the organization of the "Shanghai Municipal Temporary Committee for the Protection of Small-Scale Manufacturers" to assist small-scale manufacturers in getting through the New Year. All factories and merchants who have finished products, raw materials, and commodities that do not meet the eligibility for production loans but need to borrow money can register with the association, and the association will allocate and introduce them to the supporting banks and firms for direct handling. The interest rate will be particularly favorable, and it is requested that they be allowed to pledge goods. Yesterday, the association distributed requests for assistance to various banks and money houses and scheduled to host news reporters at the association at 2 pm today.

### Sluggish Market: Four Major Department Stores Experience Dull Business

[Our Reporter] The major department stores in this city are feeling difficult to sustain due to sluggish business and labor disputes. At the end of last year, the employees of the four major department stores, in addition to demanding double pay and bonuses, also demanded a loan of 300,000 yuan per person. After repeated consultations between labor and management, it has been decided to issue loans, but the amount will be reduced accordingly. Currently, among the major companies, Wing On Company has the highest turnover, but the daily turnover is only over 80 million yuan, and other companies are far less than this number, so they have to attract customers by means of price reductions and gifts. According to the person in charge of the Joint Office of the Ten Major Department Stores, most of the department stores in this city are currently relying on inventory to get by, which is indeed an unprecedented difficult period for the major companies.

### Transportation Industry Granted Continued Tax Exemption for One Year Yesterday: Taxes Already Paid to be Refunded

The Shanghai Transportation Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, stating that the industry had served the country during the war and made great sacrifices. During the post-war recovery period, it was also responsible for military and public transportation, undertaking the task of post-war recovery, and bearing heavy responsibilities. It requested that the previous practice of exempting business tax for one year be continued. This request was approved by the Ministry of Finance yesterday, and the transportation industry tax will continue to be exempted for one year from October 1946 to September 1947. Taxes already paid will be refunded.

### Woolen Fabric Sales are Quiet

The sales of woolen fabrics are now coming to an end. Customers in this street no longer have formal demand, and the market is usually weak. Except for a few stores, most are burdened with high-interest loans. There are only a very few with sufficient capital. Therefore, there are fewer people who absorb and purchase cheaply in advance than in the past. Except for spring flannels, all prices are openly flat and secretly reduced. After the final settlement of 1946, except for the stores on Qipan Street, which have considerable profits, the gains of other large and small stores are less than the losses.

### Cooking Oil Rationing Continues as Usual

[Our Reporter] The Shanghai Cooking Oil Joint Distribution Office will soon come to an end since it began rationing cooking oil from various private factories. It is reported that the chairman of the office, Zhang Chao, will pay a visit to Mayor Wu tomorrow to discuss the timely allocation of 5,000 "dan" of cooking oil from state-owned oil factories that have already been agreed to be allocated for distribution, in order to maintain the people's food supply.

### Good News for the Silk Industry: Production Loans Approved for Participation; Joint Venture Company Established Today

[Our Reporter] The Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association has recently reached an agreement with the Production Loan Association that, in addition to the fact that the larger factories in the industry can apply for loans, other small and medium-sized factories have now been invited to participate in the application for loans.

### Taiwan Sugar Softens

Yesterday, the sugar market softened again. The association's division showed that the spot price for medium white sugar was 138,000 to 9,000 yuan, down 3-4,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were 133,000 to 5,000 yuan, small 4-5,000 yuan, medium sugar was 127,000 to 6,500 yuan, small sugar was 2-3,000 yuan, warehouse receipts were 121,000 yuan, small 4-5,000 yuan, Shunde green sugar was 98-9,000 yuan, with little change.

### Tea Sales are Quiet

Domestic sales of black and green tea are dull because customers are not taking deliveries, and the stores on this street are also very inactive in selling. The situation is dim. In the foreign tea market, the high-end Chen Qimen tea favored by British Jardine Matheson has quiet negotiation but no agreement. As for the Zhenzhen and Zhenmei green teas sold to Africa, the shipping dates are approaching, and the export firms are busy handling export procedures, so the momentum of inquiry is weaker than before, and transactions are rare. In terms of prices, they are as firm as before. Other varieties are evenly matched in terms of imports and exports, with little unique quality.

### Directors and Supervisors of Zhejiang Provincial Bank Elected

It is learned that the current board of directors of Zhejiang Provincial Bank was held in Hangzhou on January 10 this year. The Ministry of Finance appointed 13 directors and mutually elected standing directors. Those elected were Xu Fu, Tong Mengzheng, Zhang Renfu, Jin Baishun, Chen Baolin, Si Lie, and Yan Bian, a total of seven people. Zheng Wenli, Xu Shaodi, and Yang Yun were elected as standing supervisors, a total of three people.

All kinds of plants entering and leaving the island must be released after inspection and approval.

### National Insurance Industry's Premium Income Exceeded 100 Billion Last Year: Foreign Reinsurance Accounted for 60%

According to an authoritative source in the insurance industry, the total premium income of the national insurance industry last year exceeded 100 billion yuan. However, more than 60% of this income was reinsured by Chinese companies to foreign companies. Therefore, the loss of foreign exchange from our premiums last year is quite noteworthy. In view of this, the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association initiated the organization of a savings group last year to control the outflow of premiums, but very few people participated in the group. Recently, Chinese companies have signed reinsurance contracts with foreign companies one after another, and the loss of foreign exchange cannot be estimated. If these reinsurance contracts can be handled in the same way as salt reinsurance, a lot of foreign exchange can be saved.

### Refined Rice Increases and Reduces Prices: The Oil Market is Said to Be Rising and Falling Slightly

A total of 15,000 to 16,000 rice shipments arrived from both the north and south. The goods arrived in abundance, but the actual sales were dull. The price of medium and low-quality southern refined rice continued to fall by 1,000 yuan, while the price of high-quality rice remained flat. Northern refined rice was in short supply and stable. The arrivals were mostly southern refined rice, and the market was still in a state of increasing and reducing prices. Indica rice showed a mediocre trend. White rice and Yinyuan rice were actively sold, up by more than 1,000 yuan. The price of flour fell by 200-300 yuan due to the ample supply of foreign flour, and it was still hovering in a weak state. Bran continued to rise in price in the countryside, up by 300 yuan. The supply and demand of soybeans were both strong. This street had a very strong appetite. However, as the end of the year approached, the owners of Dazou soybeans were very eager to sell them, and the price dropped by 5-600 to 1,000 yuan. The market for Northeast soybeans became more and more stable, but the market situation showed both ups and downs. Soybean cakes and oil dregs were in great demand, up by 2-300 yuan. The oil market showed mixed ups and downs. Raw oil shops were cold and sluggish, and Ningbo shops were also weak, down by 1-2,000 yuan, showing a situation of rising and falling slightly. Sesame oil was still in demand, up by 3-4,000 yuan. Clear oil was fair. Soybean oil was not yet available due to a shortage of goods. Red beans were still sluggish, down by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans, horse beans, and corn from Qingdao were still dry and in demand, up by 3-400 yuan, and the market situation was firm. Raw peanuts were still lacking in price fluctuations.

### Sichuan's Finances are Extremely Difficult: Education is on the Verge of Total Collapse: More than 40 Presidents and Principals of Specialty and Middle Schools Resign Jointly

[Our Chengdu Dispatch] Under the extremely difficult financial conditions in Sichuan Province this past year, education is on the verge of total collapse. Last year, the post-war rehabilitation funds for education in Sichuan Province were 800 million yuan, but the Central Government only allocated 450 million yuan, and the Sichuan Department of Finance deducted 200 million yuan, only allocating 250 million yuan, resulting in the inability of dozens of schools to rehabilitate and the extreme shortage of funds. For this reason, Liu Ming, the director of the Department of Education, has firmly resigned to the provincial government and is currently being retained by Acting Chairman Deng and the Sichuan Provincial Assembly. In addition, more than 40 presidents and principals of provincial specialty and middle schools in Sichuan Province, including Yang Youzhi, have recently jointly petitioned the provincial government, stating that they are unable to promote education due to a lack of funds and requesting permission for all to resign. The future of education in Sichuan Province is truly worrying.

### Hu Shuyi Returns to China: Talks About Inspection Experience

Educational expert Mr. Hu Shuyi, who was ordered by the Ministry of Education to go to the United Kingdom and the United States to inspect education, returned to Shanghai from the United States the other day. Director Gu of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education and educators and journalists successively held banquets at the International Hotel and the Yu Restaurant on Sanma Road to welcome him. Mr. Hu took the night train to Beijing today to report to the Ministry of Education. Yesterday, he released his inspection experience to reporters as follows: This time, he was ordered to inspect major cities in England, America, and Canada, such as London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Oxford, Cambridge, and Birmingham in England; Washington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Missouri in the United States; and Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto in Canada. He visited more than 300 universities, middle schools, and other educational institutions, and collected extremely practical educational materials. Moreover, because he had been engaged in journalism for many years, he also visited the Times in London, the New York Times and the Daily News in New York, and the United Press, Reuters, and Associated Press news agencies. The US State Department's Information Bureau invited him to broadcast his impressions of visiting the United States to the Shanghai area and to attend the annual meetings of various academic groups.

……University Education……

Oxford University and Cambridge University in England are the most outstanding institutions of higher learning in England, and they are also the highest organs for training "British gentlemen." These two universities each have more than 20 colleges, forming university towns in Oxford and Cambridge. They are quiet and simple, and are indeed good places for young people to study and relax. The University of London is a modern university in England. Its modern architecture and equipment, the number of departments and students are very similar to modern universities in the United States. The famous middle schools in England are Eton and Harrow, which form a system with Oxford and Cambridge and can be said to be the primary training institutions for "British gentlemen."

……Primary Education……

Primary education in England is the most practical and effective. The good physique and good habits of the British are cultivated in elementary schools. Recently, pre-school education has been included in the formal education system. From the age of two, they receive independent and consistent basic training education, which is universally implemented throughout the country. The calm and experienced British Empire's performance in the previous wars can be said to be the success of elementary school basic training. Elementary and secondary education in the United States fully demonstrates the spirit of freedom and liveliness. Service, helping others, and the training of national life are the success of elementary and secondary education. Both England and the United States attach great importance to normal schools for teacher training. On the one hand, they train future teachers, and on the other hand, they guide the in-service training of current teachers. Therefore, guidance is a very important responsibility of normal schools in England and the United States.

……Women's Education……

Women's education in England and the United States focuses on household affairs training and children's education, which are very similar to our country's educational purpose of good mothers and are worthy of attention. The salaries of elementary and secondary school teachers in England and the United States are very similar. In the US education sector, there is a common and consistent requirement across the country that the treatment of elementary and secondary teachers be the same. As for seniority pay increases and various excellent treatment methods, England and the United States have gradually implemented them.

……Adult Education……

England and the United States advocate "Lifelong Learning," so adult continuing education is very developed. Whether in rural or urban areas, schools are open, providing citizens with opportunities to use them day and night. The age and time of learning are extended. On the one hand, higher education is extended to improve the quality of education, and on the other hand, the time of learning is extended, and pre-school education is included in the formal education system to strengthen basic national education. Parents and children learn education in the same school at the same time, with the only difference being the time and content of learning. This is commonplace in England and the United States. School socialization, treating schools as the central organs for improving society, has several pilot zones in England called "Community Centers," with remarkable achievements that are worthy of emulation.

### Last Night's Basketball League: Unexpected Delight in a Comeback Victory; Shantou Team Overwhelms the Navy and Marine Corps Youth; Elsewhere, Huayang Easily Defeats the Shanghai Railway Team

The second Basketball League held two Class A matches yesterday starting from 6:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium. Despite a small audience, the games were quite exciting. As a result, in the Class A Second Division match, Huayang defeated the Shanghai Railway team with a score of 59 to 36. In the Class A First Division match, the Shantou team staged a comeback, defeating the Navy and Marine Corps Youth team with a score of 40 to 37. The game details are as follows:

The opening match featured Huayang against the Shanghai Railway team from Class A Second Division. The Railway players lacked effective offense and defense, and their techniques were poor. They relied heavily on footwork, causing the Huayang players to frequently roll on the ground with the ball. The Huayang players excelled at long-range shots, hitting the basket with precision. At the start of the game, Ji Youkun from Huayang scored under the basket, opening the scoring. Sun Mingxin added to the lead, making it 4-0. After Chen Enrong from the Railway team scored with a long-range shot, Sun Mingxin from Huayang scored again. When Song Qihou left the court, Wang Huating substituted. The Railway team lacked coordination, and Huayang relentlessly pressured them, scoring repeatedly. Wu Binghao, Han Longhai, and Li Yao from the Railway team struggled valiantly. By the end of the first half, Huayang led with a score of 22 to 15.

After switching sides, Liu Benqin from Huayang quickly scored two points, followed by Dong Zhongyi, adding six points rapidly and creating a strong momentum.

At the end of regulation time, Huayang easily defeated the Shanghai Railway team with a score of 59-36.

The final match was between the Navy and Marine Corps Youth team and the Shantou team. The Navy and Marine Corps Youth team, composed of foreign players, was tall and strong, employing a man-to-man defense. They lined up on the court, resembling a pagoda and city wall. The young players of the Shantou team struggled to penetrate their defense. However, they managed to turn defeat into victory, exceeding expectations. At the start of the game, Cai Yanxiong from the Shantou team scored the opening point with a free throw. Folack from the Navy and Marine Corps Youth team scored with a long-range shot, followed by five consecutive points. Pittman added to the lead, quickly making it 7-1. The Shantou team rallied, with Lin Weicong controlling the ball and making long-range shots, closing the gap to 5-7. The Navy and Marine Corps Youth team regained momentum. By the end of the first half, the Shantou team was behind with a score of 18 to 26.

After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed play. Cai Yanxiong from the Shantou team made a shot, followed by two scores from Lin Weicong, closing the gap to 24-26. After the foreign player Pease scored, Lin Weipei from the Shantou team was injured and left the court. Chen Qingjiang substituted and re-entered the game. He Lide and Ji Nankang then scored successively, tying the game. The Shantou team began to see a turning point. The Navy and Marine Corps Youth team called a timeout, adjusting their players. Folack scored, regaining the lead. Cai Yanxiong from the Shantou team scored under the basket, and Chen Qingjiang scored two consecutive points, taking the lead for the first time with a score of 34-31. In the last four minutes, Chen Qingjiang scored again, and the foreign player Folack scored a point with a free throw. At the end of regulation time, the Shantou team staged a comeback, defeating the Navy and Marine Corps Youth team with a score of 40-37.

### Railway Interdepartmental Soccer Tournament: Transportation Department Heavily Defeats Accounting Yesterday

The interdepartmental mini-soccer tournament for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway District, which had been suspended for several days due to continuous rain, resumed yesterday under clear skies. The match between the Transportation Department and the Accounting Department proceeded as scheduled, with Yan Yougeng as the referee. The Accounting Department took the offensive first. Young players Lu Hongji and Chen Daoxing coordinated their attacks, but were thwarted by Jin Ning from the Transportation Department. The ball was passed to Xiao Ziwen, who dribbled it to the right wing. Zhang Da tried to break through, but the Accounting Department's goalkeeper, Tang Wenwei, reacted quickly and dived to save the ball. The two fell in a heap, and Huang Haosheng seized the opportunity to score, opening the scoring for the Transportation Department. Shortly after, Xiao Ziwen from the Transportation Department received a pass from Qian Peng, dribbled past Huang Jinquan from the Accounting Department, and scored from about twenty yards away, making it 2-0. After conceding two goals, the Accounting Department tried hard to retaliate. Chen Daoxing and Lu Hongji made several attempts to score, but Qian Peng from the Transportation Department defended effectively, making it difficult for the Accounting Department to succeed. Later, Xiao Ziwen from the Transportation Department made a brilliant pass, and Huang Haosheng scored again, making it 3-0. Before the first half ended, Huang Haosheng scored his second goal, making it 4-0.

After switching sides, the Accounting Department brought in fresh players Zhang Zonglin and Zhou, while the Transportation Department called up Chen Da to strengthen their lineup. The two sides were evenly matched for twenty minutes without any scoring. In the last five minutes, the Transportation Department's three forwards became active again, causing more trouble in front of the Accounting Department's goal. Ultimately, due to the weakness of the Accounting Department's defense, Jin Ning from the Transportation Department scored again, bringing the final score to 5-0 in favor of the Transportation Department. Today's match will be between the Engineering Department and the Affairs Department.

### HVA Engineering Project Deputy Assistant Engineer & Obstetrician Visit Shaanxi to Survey the Yellow River

— Special dispatch from Xi'an, January 4th — Our Xi'an reporter Li Chi

The New Year should have been a three-day holiday, but on New Year's Day, more than twenty Chinese and American hydraulic engineering experts were still holding a symposium at the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, exchanging opinions enthusiastically with each other. Attendees included the world-renowned Dr. Savage and the twelve members of the Yellow River Advisory Group of the Supreme Economic Council. They seemed to have forgotten that this was a day of rest, and continued to concentrate on discussing the vast Yellow River that flows through nine provinces, and the "diagnosis" and "prescription" of the Fen, Luo, Jing, and Wei Rivers, which are related to the thorough treatment of the "Yellow River calamity" and cannot be ignored. The Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau provided thick volumes of data, countless pages of correspondence, and statistics.

As soon as the symposium was over, the thirteen members of the "Yellow Advisory Group" rushed to the airport and took a special plane back to Bian (Kaifeng), without a moment to spare. They stayed in Shaanxi for a total of eighteen days, traveled more than a thousand kilometers by road, and completed several hundred kilometers of aerial surveys, but did not publish their final conclusions.

Middle Reaches of the Yellow River

Let's start with the group's flight from Bian (Kaifeng) to Ningxia on the 13th of last month: that day, the special plane flew west along the Yellow River bed. Upon reaching Tongguan, it turned north and followed the Yellow River waterway at the junction of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, conducting low-altitude surveys in the famous Longmen and Hukou areas. Then it continued to fly north, crossing the area near Hequ, passing over Suiyuan to reach Ningxia.

During the day's journey, they quietly landed along the Wei River in E County to refuel, before flying north and west, exploring the upper reaches of the Yellow River and its water source areas.

Four days later (the 17th), they flew back to Xi'an from Lanzhou. That afternoon, they went to Lintong to take a hot spring bath and visit the site where the world-shaking "Xi'an Incident" occurred ten years and five days ago. They returned in the evening and stayed at the Xijing Hotel, which is also a historical building related to the "Xi'an Incident." They started their survey work after waking up the next morning. The itinerary was divided into four sections.

The first route was to inspect the middle reaches of the Yellow River. They passed through Hancheng and reached the Longmen area slightly north of the Yellow River-Fen River confluence on the 20th. On the return journey, they visited the Luo River and its water conservancy and irrigation projects. They originally planned to go further north to Hukou in Yichuan County, but the east bank of Hukou is in Jixian County, Shanxi, which is close to the war zone, so they had to give up. At the same time, according to the survey report of the Yellow River Harnessing Group two months ago, it was almost unanimously agreed that the value of Hukou was not as high as that of Longmen. (Please refer to the Xi'an correspondence "Hukou·Longmen" in the December 28th edition of this newspaper last year.) When they arrived on that day, the Yellow River, which had long been frozen, probably wanted to welcome the "doctors" who had come from thousands of miles away. The river ice unexpectedly thawed partially, and the splashing yellow water showed vitality and hope.

Dr. Savage is a cautious person to the two-hundredth degree. It is said that he never made even a partial preliminary conclusion on these thousands of miles of road after departing from Nanjing. This reporter only learned indirectly that he considered Shimen Gorge, north of Longmen, to be the most satisfactory location for building a dam among the sixty-five kilometers between Hukou, Longmen, and Yumen. Other Chinese and American experts conducted a precise and multi-faceted inspection there, but no one was willing to publish individual opinions and estimates upon their return. The combined conclusion may only be published after it has been sorted out and considered in Nanjing.

Shimen Gorge is also known as "Ba Biandan" by local residents, to describe how narrow the Yellow River is in this section. According to the latest opinions of Zhang Hanying from the "Yellow River Harnessing Group" and Liu Zhongrui and Guan Wenqi from the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, they unanimously believe that the utilization value of Shimen Gorge is the greatest, and the future conclusion of the "Yellow Advisory Group" is likely to be very similar to this.

Mr. Sa and his party originally wanted to trace the upper reaches of the Luo River, but at present that area is in the control of Yan'an on the Chinese political map, so what they could see and reach was limited to the lower reaches of the Luo River and the irrigation benefit area of the "Lohui Canal." There, and in the "Jinghui Canal" benefit area, they saw the main cotton-producing area of Shaanxi Province, and highly praised the fact that the production volume per unit area of cotton fields in Shaanxi Province exceeds that of American cotton fields by several times. In fact, Shaanxi Province won the first prize in the country for increased cotton production this year, thanks to the improvement of varieties by agronomists, and to the irrigation provided by these canals.

The group returned to Xi'an, tired but mixed with excitement, on the eve of Christmas.

Upper Reaches of the Jing River

It is not to say that the "Yellow Advisory Group" spent the eve of 1946 here, and that the sixty-six-year-old white-haired Savage was already sixty-seven years old when he left Shaanxi and returned east. His birthday is the same day as Jesus Christ and the scientist Newton, and he happened to spend it in Xi'an this year. At noon that day, he held a silver knife and, with great joy, cut open a birthday cake made from wheat flour grown on the loess soil of Shaanxi.

The second survey route began on the 26th, following the highway to Na County in the upper reaches of the Jing River, and then northwest for forty kilometers to Tingkou. This is where the Jing River, the Malian River, and the Lingtai River meet. The river water is very turbulent, and some people used to think that it was extremely valuable to exploit, but this time the "Yellow Advisory Group's" opinion does not seem to give it such a high evaluation. The future conclusion may thoroughly revise the opinions of predecessors. However, the Jing River itself still has eighteen waterfalls downstream of Tingkou, which can all be used as hydropower. The source area of the Jing River also belongs to the "border area," and they did not go there for surveying.

The third route was on the 28th to the Baoji Gorge in the western section of the Wei River, fifteen kilometers west of Baoji. Mr. Savage expressed the same feeling about the future construction of a dam for power generation in this section of the river and was extremely satisfied. In his notebook, he has already drawn a sketch of the hydroelectric station in the Qinlong Plateau. They returned to Xi'an on the 29th, completing the entire survey work of the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River.

At this point in the description, it is necessary to briefly explain the "Yellow Advisory Group's" consideration and emphasis on the Luo, Jing, and Wei Rivers. At the same time, it can also explain the significance of the following fourth itinerary to inspect the Sanmen Gorge in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

Long before Savage and others came to China to conduct a field survey of the Yellow River, the Supreme Economic Council collected a lot of data in advance in the United States as preparation for the trip. However, many of our country's Yellow River management experts only focus on the lower reaches of the Yellow River, especially the area near Sanmen Gorge in Shanzhou, Henan, which is most valued. They believe that as long as a dam is built there, it can prevent flooding in the lower reaches and use the collected water to irrigate fields and generate electricity. However, other experts believe that the thorough management of the Yellow River must start from the upper and middle reaches first, otherwise it is still a palliative measure that does not address the root cause. With regard to the section of the Yellow River related to Shaanxi Province, Liu Zhongrui believes that the reason for the breach of the Yellow River in the lower reaches is closely related to the water of the Fen, Jing, and Wei Rivers. Therefore, to build dams to control the Yellow River water, one should start with the tributaries first. From the point of view of geology, hydrology, and transportation, the Jing, Wei, Luo, and Fen Rivers and the area near Longmen in the middle reaches of the Yellow River not only have many excellent dam construction sites; moreover, measured by the standards of economy, practicality, durability, etc., these locations are more ideal than the Sanmen Gorge. These two different views are a major topic in the management of the entire Yellow River, and cannot be easily concluded. In order to solve this question, the "Yellow Advisory Group" successively surveyed the Luo, Lian, and Wei Rivers in Shaanxi, and then ran east to the area along the river and spent two days inspecting near Shanzhou. This was their fourth trip. When they returned to Xi'an, it was exactly the last day of 1936! Of course, this big question cannot be concluded in one go. However, we learned late that the "Yellow River Management Group" believes that the Bali Hutong in Xin'an County, slightly east of Sanmen Gorge, still has a gorge that is more suitable for building a dam to store water than Sanmen Gorge.

Thirteen Advisors

The lineup of the thirteen members of the "Yellow Advisory Group" is "super": Mr. Savage does not need to be introduced again. Others such as Mr. Rebaude and Mr. Grotto are not well-known to ordinary people in China, but they are all first-class experts in the United States, just like the several Chinese consultants in the group, who are also leading figures in the "think tank" of their motherland's water conservancy undertaking. Some people think that the stay in Shaanxi for more than ten days is long enough, but insiders still think that it is only a preliminary "look at the flowers while riding a horse." Despite countless volumes of reference materials, one ruler and one foot thick, and countless large and small photos taken from land and air, it is still not enough to write the final conclusion, let alone a specific plan and the time of starting and completing construction. However, the great "Yellow River Valley Authority" (HVA) plan is undoubtedly being conceived on the slide rulers in the hands of experts.

Yes, science can overcome the Yellow River flood that began before Chinese history, but there are other conditions from blueprint to implementation, from implementation to achieving results. "Governing the Yellow River is not just a technical issue; putting China's entire economic and political issues on the right track is a prerequisite for all water conservancy construction." A senior official from the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Authority once told the reporter.

Why couldn't the "Yellow Advisory Group" go to Hukou and see the upper reaches of the Luo River and the Jing River this time?

Railway Hero: Ji, Director of the Western Section Management Office of the Ping-Sui Railway (Reported by our Suiyuan correspondent Liu Yingyuan)

### The Re-Creator of the Ping-Sui Railway: News from Gui Sui, 6th Day by Airmail, Our Correspondent in Sui, Liu Yingyuan

Since the construction of the Ping-Sui Railway began, only two great engineering masters have emerged: one is Mr. Zhan Tianyou, who pierced through the thousands of mountains and valleys of Nankou, and the other is Director Su Jinin of the Western Section Management Office, who has been rushing to repair the damaged roadbeds along the entire line with the speed of a military advance. Zhan Tianyou built the Ping-Sui Railway by conquering the ocean of mountains and the desert; Su Jinin repaired the Ping-Sui Railway by finding the ocean in the desert. The former used scientific technology and civilized intelligence, while the latter used primitive perseverance and barbaric drive. Therefore, Su Jinin opened the railway to traffic one week after the siege of Sui Bao was lifted, within half a month after the siege of Datong was lifted, and within a month of the recovery of Zhangyuan, it reached Beiping and Chaigoubu. In less than two months, the entire Ping-Sui Railway was opened to traffic. This series of glorious achievements is comparable to the achievements of Zhan Tianyou and is considered a miracle by many. Therefore, people in society generally say: "Su Jinin is the re-creator of the Ping-Sui Railway."

Under the Flashes of Artillery Fire, Rushing to Repair the Railway

We cannot introduce Su Jinin's brilliant achievements without first explaining the cruelty of the Communist army towards the Ping-Sui Railway. Su Jinin took office as the director of the Western Section Management Office of the Ping-Sui Railway after Japan surrendered last year. The advance troops of the Second War Area entered Baotou on August 13th, and the Communist army immediately began to destroy the railway between Baotou and Datong. When Guo Changqing, the commissioner of Sui South, took over Gui Sui on the 18th, the Communist army first decided to besiege the provincial capital of Suiyuan and sent elite troops to block the eastward advance of the National Army at the Bikqi Township station, completely blowing up the nearby railway bridge, making it impossible for military vehicles to pass. It was raining heavily those days, and Director Su Jinin rushed to the front line with the army. Commander Fu ordered General Sun Lanfeng to drive out the bandits in Bikqi Township and gave him 24 hours to repair the railway. At that time, the railway workers had scattered and fled due to the war, so Su Jinin commanded the engineering soldiers of the troops to rush to repair the railway in 18 hours under the flashes of artillery fire. This allowed the reinforcements to reach Gui Sui quickly to relieve the provincial capital.

Su Jinin was admitted to the United States on government funding after graduating from the Department of Civil Engineering at Peking University in the sixth year of the Republic of China and transferred to the Department of Civil Engineering at R.P.I. University. After graduating in the ninth year of the Republic of China, he interned at the Walter Bridge Engineering Consultant Office. After returning to China in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, he successively served as the director of the Engineering Department of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau and the engineering technician of the Longhai and Zhengtai Railways. During the eight-year War of Resistance, when he worked underground for Commander Fu, traveling between Pingjin, Shanba, he understood the suffering of the railway employees. Therefore, after he took over the Western Section Management Office of the Ping-Sui Railway, he did not regard every employee in the occupied area as a traitor; instead, he paid special attention to their lives. At that time, the Ministry of Communications could not remit funds to Suiyuan, so Su Jinin borrowed money from Commander Fu to keep the employees well-fed. Therefore, they were willing to serve the country by restoring transportation under his leadership. Even though the Communist army destroyed it every day, the employees always repaired it every day. Before the Communist army launched a large-scale siege of Sui Bao on October 17th, the 1,000-li railway from Baotou to Datong was never interrupted.

Risking Great Danger to Negotiate for Locomotives

Last month, on the 17th, when the Communist army began to move in Sui Dong, Su Jinin personally risked great danger to negotiate with the Second War Area in Datong for four or five locomotives. If it were not for this stubborn bull, there would only be four military locomotives operating in the Western Section. When the Communist army besieged Baotou, he calmly completed the evacuation of the military station and unloaded the important parts of the locomotives to the city of Baotou, unlike the nine Jiang-class locomotives at the Datong military station, which were completely burned into scrap iron by the Communist army. The siege of Sui Bao was lifted in the twelfth lunar month of last year. The Communist army removed all the sleepers between Gui Sui and Taige, and no bridge or water tower between Sui Bao escaped serious damage. It was freezing cold at that time, with the temperature below zero. According to many people's estimates, it would take more than a month to restore traffic. No one thought that traffic would be restored within a week. The secret was that Su Jinin and the employees fought side by side on the icy and snowy fields. When his fingers were frozen purple, the employees below would not feel the cold. From that time on, the soldiers and civilians of Suiyuan began to recognize Director Su Jinin as not only a hardworking engineer but also a resolute general.

Disguised as a Merchant, Penetrating Deep into Enemy Lines

When Su Jinin was studying at the middle school of Shanxi University in the third year of Xuantong, he encountered the Xinhai Revolution. At that time, he and General Fu Zuoyi of the Army Primary School joined the Shanxi Student Army at the same time and went to Niangziguan to resist the Qing army, where he once served as a company commander. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, he retreated from the Zhengtai Road to Xi'an, breaking through the areas occupied and harassed by the enemy, puppets, and scattered soldiers, and ran to Hequ to follow Commander Fu in the war of resistance. When he met Fu Zuoyi in Wugong, he parted ways with Commander Fu in Xi'an and went to Pingjin for underground work via Hanoi and Hong Kong. It was not until after the Pearl Harbor Incident that he returned to Shanba from Tianjin. On the surface, he served as the chief engineering consultant of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, but in reality, he still traveled along the Ping-Sui Line to collect information about the enemy and puppets. He was of great help to Commander Fu in making combat decisions.

In February of the 33rd year, he was finally arrested in Tianjin by the military police sent by the Baotou Japanese Special Service Agency. Because Su Jinin's attitude was very tough, standing on the position of a Chinese, he engaged in a powerful debate with Tanaka, the person in charge of the Baotou Japanese Special Service Agency. As a result, the Japanese were overwhelmed by his慷慨激昂 spirit and did not kill him. Instead, they escorted him back to the National Army's defense line. Last year, when the news of the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan reached Shanba, Commander Fu again sent Su Jinin, disguised as a merchant, to enter Baotou by car to instigate the puppet army. On the night of August 10th, when the enemy accepted the Potsdam Declaration, he was the first to publicly run to the Japanese headquarters and happily inform them to surrender to the Twelfth War Area, almost being dragged out and shot by the enemy. However, the Kodama adviser of the Special Service Agency was finally persuaded by Su Jinin. Japan originally announced its surrender on the 15th, and the National Army would have to enter the city on the 16th at the earliest. They received the advance troops of the Twelfth War Area in Baotou on the night of the 13th. At that time, many people regarded "Su Jinin's tongue is equal to Commander Fu's three divisions" as a good story of surrender. It was also from that time that many people knew that the mysterious chief engineering consultant of Suiyuan was originally an unknown hero of the Twelfth War Area. From Su Jinin's extraordinary experience in the past, we can see that this offspring of a farming and studying family in Meiyang Town, Yishi County, Shanxi Province, not only has the temperament of a farmer and the cultivation of a worker but also has the decisiveness of a military officer and the demeanor and skill of a great politician.

### Carrying Two Railway Police While Fighting

The employees of the Western Section of the Ping-Han Railway had completed various preparations for repairing the road in May because the train could only run from Baotou to Sandaoying before the Jining Campaign. However, they could not start construction for a long time, so everyone fell into the boredom of having nothing to do. During this stage, Su Jinin paid special attention to the cultural activities and learning atmosphere of the employees. He used the library and the theater to energize the minds of his colleagues. Therefore, when the Jining Campaign began, Su Jinin seemed to lead a group of lively and vigorous people to the front line. They quickly laid a roadbed of 60 li between Sandaoying and Zhuozishan under the range of the Communist artillery shells and the hidden guns of scattered bandits. After the National Army completely occupied Jining on September 14th, Su Jinin personally supervised the construction of the large bridge shortcuts of Xin'anzhuang and Sichengsi. On October 1st, he was the first to take two railway police officers, fighting the Communist army while walking in Baoziwan, and took the track-pressing vehicle to clean up the dilapidated situation of Datong Station. Many Datong employees who had no one to care for embraced and cried with him on the rubble of the burned locomotive field.

The Communist army saw that the repairs west of Datong were progressing rapidly, so they destroyed the railway between Datong and Zhangjiakou more thoroughly than between Sandaoying and Zhuozishan. In the entire length of 180 kilometers, more than 90 kilometers had no sleepers left. The rails were bent with ropes, the water towers were completely destroyed, and the platforms were all set on fire. They also used the valuable manpower to flatten the roadbed. Su Jinin arranged the project of Datong Yuhe Bridge and returned to Jining before Double Ten Day. He took a car to Zhangjiakou to repair the road. When he reached the vicinity of Rose Camp, he discovered a group of Communist cavalry 300 meters away, almost capturing the lonely car he was riding in. However, after Su Jinin arrived in Zhangjiakou, he took the old and weak employees of the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan and a large number of expert technicians from Beiping and raced from Zhangjiakou and Xibozi to Xiahuayuan, surpassing the reputation of the champions of the two stations meeting in Shacheng, compensating for the horror he suffered on the Jining Zhangyuan Road. Now Su Jinin has returned to Gui Sui and is scheduled to go to the east of Datong to rush to repair. He guarantees that the track can be connected by the end of this month. Our beacon of the transportation industry will once again radiate brilliant brilliance to the Ping-Sui Railway line, which is full of haze.

Director Su Jinin is 52 years old this year. This little old man has the body of a farmer and the demeanor of a soldier. He loves to wear workers' clothes, always has a cigarette in his mouth, and always carries a pistol on his waist. He is unkempt and does not pay attention to eating and drinking, and he has a spirit of adventure and a sense of justice. He is very friendly to promising young people. When he goes to the theater in his spare time, he sits with the young people, applauding and cheering. He also helps students and cultural figures and is loved by young people. He is very straightforward with people and points out what is wrong at the time, without considering face or courtesy. His wife, Ms. Tian Yuce, is the daughter of Tian Zixuan, a famous person in Shanxi, and is now leading women's work in Suiyuan. His only son, Su Tingyan, went to Fang before the war and was later admitted to the Aviation Juvenile School and is currently studying at the Aviation University. Because he has been engaged in the war of resistance and eliminating obstacles to national construction, the father and son have not seen each other for ten years. Therefore, he cherishes the students of Rotary Elementary School as if they were his own children.

### Liaodong Peninsula in the Freezing Wind and Cold Snow

— News from Xiuyan, 4th Day by Airmail, Our Special Correspondent, Guan Rongqin

The people of the Liaodong Peninsula are praising this year's "winter" for coming especially late, and are enjoying the taste of "little spring" weather, when clouds suddenly descended from the sky like flocks of white birds. The uneven wilderness and the large and small towns and villages are covered with a plain white coat: the peaks that stood far away alone before are now leaning against each other at the same time and running to the front of the people; like human beings, they can't resist the suffering and freezing of several winters, and they are all huddled together, as if to get some warmth from each other.

The compatriots living on the peninsula, like the Northeast compatriots in other places, have also slowly endured the hardships imposed on them by the enemy and puppets for more than ten years. In the two or three years after the "September 18th Incident," they also heard terms such as volunteer army and guerrilla team; some of them even reluctantly joined the volunteer army and fought guerrillas. However, "time" has diluted their memories, and this winter, unexpectedly, new things have appeared that revive their memories.

"Big brother, more than 2,000 of our comrades are coming to your village today, please prepare some food for us!"

"Fellow villagers, more than 5,000 of our comrades will pass through your place tomorrow on their way east. We are all Chinese, please prepare some charcoal and tea for us! At the very least, don't leak the news!"

This kind of sudden news made the villagers, whose brains were squeezed by the cold wind and white snow and were not very active, shudder and wander around like homeless ghosts. Those who were brave and strong-willed braved the wind and snow to report to neighboring villages or towns where the National Army was stationed. For the first one or two times, some National Army or local security teams rushed out, but they all came back empty-handed. Then people heard the news that a certain village had caught two representatives who had asked for charcoal and food.

"Damn it, I don't care if he has thousands or tens of thousands!" The people whose brains were not very active in the first place became bold!

More than a month ago, I went to Xiuyan. I heard that a certain Eighth Route Army staff officer had surrendered to General Long Tianwu's headquarters.

They said that the staff officer was "ordered to fight guerrillas in the Liaoyang-Haicheng area and was not allowed to come out." I had not seen him because he had been sent to Shenyang a few days before I arrived in Xiuyan.

In the past month, I have seen several batches of Eighth Route Army soldiers who have surrendered or been captured. They were prepared to be transferred to Shenyang. Once, I saw more than 40 people in a dilapidated temple. Some were wearing cotton clothes, and some were only wearing lined clothes, huddling their hands and gritting their teeth, shivering in the cold wind. According to a short political worker, he (she) said that they were all relatively important, so they were sent first, and there were several hundred more to be sent in a few days. Many National Army brothers also came to "watch the fun." They looked at him, and he looked at you, but they couldn't see any hostility: this reminded me of my childhood: at that time, in the countryside, I often played "soldiers and thieves" games with wild children of my own age; I had captured "prisoners," and I had also been captured and became a "prisoner." Could it be that the more than 40 compatriots in front of me are more serious than the "prisoners" I used to be? Among the more than 40 prisoners, there were five women. The oldest one was about thirty-five or six years old; and with her as a prisoner was her one-year-old child. The short political worker told me: her husband was the head of the education section of the Eighth Route Army county government. Among the five female prisoners, she invisibly became a representative! First, she was older; second, she was wearing a yellow cotton military uniform and a military cap, while the other four were wearing civilian clothes; third, her eyes were always shooting at everyone who came to "watch the fun," showing a "must-answer" look. I started chatting with her. She was from Hebei, and her husband was from Liaoyang. He went to Hebei to teach, and they got married in Hebei. She said, "During the War of Resistance, there were only Eighth Route Army soldiers in our hometown. If there had been Central Army soldiers, we would have joined the Central Army long ago." The other four women who were captured with her were all from Shandong, only had elementary school education, and were forcibly conscripted by the Eighth Route Army. They said, "We can't not go." The other one was from Zhuanghe, a junior high school student of seventeen or eighteen years old. Strangely, among the more than 40 prisoners, there were three Japanese. Two men and one woman. It is said that the two men were technicians and the woman was one of their wives. The men didn't care, but the woman sat slumped on her bedding. I heard that she cried for a while later: because dinner was delayed. I also heard that among the prisoners who had not yet been transported, there were many Japanese light and heavy machine gun shooters. Is this group of Japanese prisoners for the second or third time?

In General Xu Ying's command post, I saw three Eighth Route Army cadres who had surrendered. One was Ge Gui, the political instructor of the first battalion of the second regiment of the Independent Division, a native of Hebei, in his thirties, who joined the CCP in Yan'an seven or eight years ago; one was Wang Youren, the deputy political instructor of the first battalion, a native of Shandong, who joined the Eighth Route Army only two years ago; and the other was Wang Chunhua, a special agent leader of the third company of the first battalion. Among the three, Ge Gui was more calm and didn't talk much. The most excited was Wang Youren, the Shandong native. All three of them surrendered near Junzi in southwestern Xiuyan, and with them, there were more than 40 Eighth Route Army brothers who surrendered.

"When the people in our battalion saw the National Army, they scattered, slipped away, and surrendered. 'Fellow villagers, we are all Chinese, don't shoot, we are all Chinese, we surrender!' They put down their guns and raised their hands, a total of more than 40 people," Wang Youren's words were full of laughter, scolding, and inexplicable sadness. He also said:

"We fought for several years during the War of Resistance, and we won. Originally, we could have gone home. Damn it, they dragged us to fight again! ... We go here today and there tomorrow, marching in the mountains late at night, stepping on that thick snow... All day long, we don't know when we will have something to eat, maybe one meal or half a meal... We are all Chinese!"

Who says we are not "our own people"? In a bathhouse used as a transit station for the wounded, the trustee saw more than 20 wounded National Army and Eighth Route Army brothers: gray cotton clothes, yellow cotton clothes, sitting shoulder to shoulder, lying foot to foot, they were all wounded in the Shuimenzimiao battle in Fuxian. A National Army brother with a bandage on his head told me: "The battle at Shuimenzimiao was really fierce. The light machine guns and small mortars were fired without aiming!" Among the wounded Eighth Route Army brothers, there were two who were only eighteen or nineteen years old: one was Song Yingjie, a native of Baoshan, Yunnan, who was wounded in the head, wore a bandage, couldn't turn his head flexibly, and didn't like to talk. The other was Liu Wanyou, a native of Liaozhong, who was wounded in the arm. Perhaps because his injury was not serious, he talked freely about his story.

"When we saw the National Army, Song Yingjie and I turned the light machine gun around and shot at our company commander. He also shot at us with his pistol, but he died, and we were only slightly injured!"

"Damn it! Eighth Route Army! Dead end! Running south, there are big noses, running west, there is the sea, running east and north, there are all Central Army soldiers, isn't that a dead end!" As soon as Shi Wanyou finished speaking, a commotion arose among the gray cotton clothes and yellow cotton clothes sitting next to him and lying opposite him.

According to National Army officers who returned from the front lines, in order to prevent surrendering on the battlefield, the Eighth Route Army often used column attacks to advance and did not dare to disperse, because once they dispersed, surrenders would occur one after another. Advancing in dense columns may reduce surrenders, but when they are killed or injured, they are in piles and piles, how cruel! Comforting the National Army, comforting the wounded soldiers, is often seen in Xiuyan, Fengcheng, Zhuanghe, Piziwo, and Pulandian... The place is so poor, and prices are so high. Looking at the three, five, ten, and hundreds of yuan bills that he (she) moved out for comfort, it is better to say that it is "tears" than "money"! When I saw the letters from the primary and middle school students in Fengcheng comforting the National Army, countless small faces with tears in their eyes floated before my eyes!

The Japanese ruled the Northeast for fourteen years, so that the Northeast compatriots, in literature and even language, were indeed dyed with a bit of "Concord" color, but if they wanted to squeeze the concept of the motherland out of the minds of the Northeast compatriots, not only would fourteen years not be enough, even forty or fifty years would not be enough. Chengzitun is a small town at the northeastern end of "Kwantung State." The compatriots in the town saw Japanese troops landing from Woshiwo in the southwest of the town and heading north to fight the imperial Russian army during the Russo-Japanese War. After the Russo-Japanese War, they actually lived under Japanese rule. When the National Army (General Long Tianwu's Chen Ying Department) entered the town this time, the elders in the town were so excited that they went crazy. They pulled their brothers and cried and laughed, saying that they had not seen the National Army for fifty years! The brothers were also moved to tears!

In the areas recovered by the National Army, the common people have opened their storefronts to do business, but because everyone has more "Eighth Route Army tickets" that have become waste paper than goods around them, everyone is poor. The price of grain has risen by several yuan per catty, so they sit together and sigh. After sighing, there is always the sentence "When will this war end?"

The primary and middle schools in several counties here have resumed classes one after another after the Eighth Route Army left; however, the school equipment is "empty." The usual phenomenon is: there is not a single reference book, and the textbooks are not delivered until the end of the semester, and there are still some missing. Xiuyan Boys' Middle School can't even get enough chairs and desks, and two classes of students are still standing to attend classes. The principal's office of Xiuyan Girls' Middle School, which was used as an Eighth Route Army wounded soldier's hospital, is more dilapidated than the army's front-line command post. The school resumed classes in October, but the funding issued by the provincial government is calculated from November: the funding is so small that, in addition to buying chalk, there is not enough firewood left to buy for heating, let alone add any equipment? What physics and chemistry lab, library, except for the small plaques hanging at the door, this small piece of wood cannot be found. There is only one handyman in the whole school. When the handyman is sick, the teacher rings the bell to start and end classes. There is not enough funding, and there is not enough firewood. The only way is to start the holiday early. Once New Year's Day is encountered, there will be a big exam. Once there is an exam, everyone will go home. I heard that the military will perform a play in a few days to raise funds for the school. I don't know how much money can be raised?

Taking Xiuyan as the center, whether it is to the sea, Fengcheng, Andong, Zhuanghe, or Gushan Street, there are highways that can be reached. More than a month ago, sitting in a car would make you vomit, just like the destruction of the highways before the Eighth Route Army retreated. The road was cut every three or four feet; after the villagers repeatedly filled it in, it has been much better in the past month. Charcoal-burning commercial vehicles have occasionally appeared; however, the fare is so expensive, and sitting in the car has to be exposed to the wind, so no one wants to climb up unless it is necessary. The train from Fengcheng to Andong is open; however, it is the same as the commercial vehicles on the highway: it burns charcoal; it stops every three steps, and some people would rather take a board car or even walk, saving trouble. Piziwo in southwestern Zhuanghe and Pulandian in Fuxian have been recovered by the National Army. The people on the peninsula, especially the 200,000 Dalian compatriots who fled to Shenyang, are all nostalgic for Dalian - the "Japanized" water capital!

The New Year is coming, and the compatriots on the peninsula do not seem to have any "new" plans. It is the innocent children who are still in groups pushing snowplows and skating on the frozen riverbanks. They seem to be the only living creatures on this white and red peninsula?

### Construction of the East Liao River

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao, Shenyang, 4th Telegram

The Liao River is the Yellow River of the Northeast. It lacks the benefit of boat transportation and irrigation but suffers from frequent flooding and siltation. The enemy and puppets spent a long time, investing a large amount of capital and manpower, determined to turn the disaster into a benefit. A lot of engineering has already been done. Of course, eighty to ninety percent of this is the crystallization of our compatriots' blood and sweat?

These projects are valuable and worthy of attention. This report covers a large-scale engineering project that was among the first to resume work after the recovery, thanks to everyone's cooperation. That is the East Liao River water conservancy project, a tributary of the Liao River.

The East Liao River—one of the tributaries of the Liao River—originates in the continuous mountain range within the jurisdiction of Xi'an County, in the Saha Ridge. It flows meanderingly southeast until it crosses the Chinese Changchun Railway and enters the fertile Taiping Plain. This is indeed a place of "intersecting fields" and "verdant green," suitable for farming. According to the "Outline of Northeast Water Conservancy," the river's total length is 333.5 kilometers, with a drainage area of 10,180 square kilometers. It flows through Xi'an, Huai'de, and Lishu counties and enters the Liao River at Kuyushu.

Japanese Management During the Puppet Regime

In order to increase production for immigration and strengthen their capital for aggression, the Japanese considered the "East Liao River Flood Control and Irrigation Project" as one of the emergency projects. Their planned project included three major components: dam construction, water storage, diversion, irrigation, afforestation, wind protection, and sand control. Their expected goal was to reclaim 600,000 mu of paddy and dry land, increase the production of rice and miscellaneous grains by more than 86,000 tons, and reduce the flood volume of the East Liao River from 2,700 cubic meters per second to 510 cubic meters per second, thus eliminating flood disasters. At the same time, it would solve the problem of low-water navigation downstream and industrial water use in Siping City.

In order to realize this plan, the puppet "Manchuria Colonization Corporation" began constructing a large dam across the East Liao River at Didazuizi, east of Siping Street, at the end of 1943. The original plan for the dam was to have a height of 26.8 meters and a length of 560 meters, of which 100 meters would be a steel-reinforced concrete spillway with a height of 18 meters to discharge floodwaters. By August 15th, before the recovery, only 80 percent had been completed. It is said that at that time, in order to meet military needs and save time, the Japanese did everything possible to complete a five-year project in two years, forcing our country's farmers to serve, organizing so-called "diligent service teams" and "patriotic diligent service teams," working day and night regardless of the cold and heat.

Launch of Reconstruction Work

The Northeast Regional Office of the Water Conservancy Commission, considering that the most important part of the project, the earth dam, had been partially completed by the enemy and puppets, but its height was still below the flood level and its thickness was insufficient. If a summer flood or autumn flood were to suddenly arrive, not only would this project be likely to be destroyed, but the downstream area affected by the disaster would reach 2.28 million mu. Therefore, it negotiated with the Northeast Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Liaobei Provincial Government to establish an "East Liao River Engineering Committee" to be responsible for promoting, guiding, and supervising the resumption of the project. At the same time, the Water Conservancy Special Envoy Office established the East Liao River Engineering Bureau to be responsible for the implementation of the project.

The Engineering Bureau was officially established at the Didazuizi construction site on August 1st. At that time, the principles of construction were determined: major projects would be contracted out to merchants, while scattered projects would be handled by self-established construction teams. After the establishment of the East Liao River Engineering Bureau, it immediately began various preparatory works, clearing and sorting out the construction site, organizing residual materials, repairing tools and equipment, purchasing equipment, repairing houses, gunpowder depots, power rooms, machine shops, and repairing roads. At the same time, it handled commercial recruitment in Shenyang. By the end of August, most of the above work had come to an end. After deliberation by relevant parties, the contracting part was undertaken by Zhongxin, Lihua, and Jiancheng Construction Companies, with a total contract price of 57,717,775.00 Northeast circulation coupons.

Progress of Major Projects

The main parts of this project include eight items: dam body filling, quarrying stone blocks, rubble revetment, rubble retaining wall, concrete revetment, concrete bridge deck, concrete pier, and turf revetment. Among them, dam body filling and quarrying stone blocks started first in early September. Rubble revetment, concrete, spillway, and pier projects were then implemented accordingly.

The concrete pier started in late September. As of early November, the progress was still smooth. The rubble revetment project only started in mid-October due to the relationship between the dam body filling and the blasting stone. As of the beginning of December, only 3,420 cubic meters had been completed. Currently, they are working day and night, hoping to complete it in January 1947.

Going from Siping to the construction site, north of the Shiling Station, you can see piles of buckets, axles, and remnants of machinery. After another thirty li, the large dam stands majestically on the East Ban River. The green artificial lake also has a preliminary form. It is said that the Japanese had specially established machine tool repair shops, lumber mills, and pneumatic factories for the East Liao River project, as well as drilling machines, mountain-opening machines, excavators, and crushers. Unfortunately, due to the destruction after August 15th, there are only two radio-style iron tower cranes on the dam top, and six tank-style compactors are roaring. The rest of the water pumps, cement mixers, mountain-opening machines, and various types of machinery are rumbling. One hundred and sixty transport vehicles on the seven rails on the dam top are constantly transporting earth and stones.

At the end of 1946, the reservoir project was mostly completed. As for the irrigation area, it is still far west of the Chinese Changchun Railway, more than sixty kilometers away from Didazuizi. Its range stretches from Xiaochengzi, Laosonglinzi, Ergushan, and Gujiazi in the south to the south bank of the Liao River in the north. This new agricultural area was previously sparsely populated and very desolate. Although it has not yet been completed, there are already crisscrossing canals. Once the auxiliary works of the canal, such as water diversion and water-saving gate dams, aqueducts, drops, and highway bridges, are completed, water can be diverted for irrigation. This project has not yet started due to insufficient material preparation and local instability. It is expected to start in April next year and can be completed before the ground freezes in July. This is a great project, and it is also not to be ignored for the national economy and the people's livelihood!

### American Domestic and Foreign Policy

— Chu Yukun

Sufficient to Determine the Future Destiny of the World

Post-war America has become the core of world problems. The domestic and foreign policies that President Truman should adopt in the future are sufficient to determine the future destiny of the world. Therefore, people all over the world have focused their attention on President Truman's message to Congress on the 6th. In this lengthy message, the domestic and foreign policies that the United States should adopt in the future were explained in detail. Although President Truman's policies are not as rich in far-reaching and lofty ideals as those adopted by the late President Roosevelt, they are still practical and moderate. Under the current circumstances, Truman can only take this approach to gain the unanimous support of the Democratic and Republican parties.

Cooperation Between the Two Parties Stabilizes the Political Situation

The Republican Party expressed satisfaction with Truman's message, except for some opinions on domestic affairs. As Senate Speaker Vandenberg said: "President Truman's message is mild and tactful, and is unanimously approved by Republican senators. The president's arguments on the relationship between the White House and Congress are also reasonable." At the same time, Republican Congressman Halleck also said: "The Republican Party is also willing to cooperate with President Truman to achieve a fair resolution of American problems. I believe that the Republican and Democratic parties will be able to work together in the House of Representatives." From this, it can be seen that President Truman's message to Congress has received a good response in the United States, and there is no problem with cooperation between the two parties. From this, it can also be predicted that President Truman will not have disagreements with Congress before the expiration of his term and cause political turmoil. Therefore, President Truman's message to Congress finally brought temporary stability to the American political situation.

Marshal Returns Home, Appointed Secretary of State

Marshal's departure from China and return home is already noteworthy news. When he boarded the special plane in China, the news that Secretary of State Byrnes had resigned and been succeeded by Marshal also reached China. This is indeed the first important news of 1947, shaking the world.

The US Senate unanimously approved President Truman's appointment of Marshal as Secretary of State on the 8th, without any dissent. This is a rare phenomenon in American political history. Time magazine praised Byrnes as a great man of 1946. We can really say that Marshal is a truly great figure in modern American history. Marshal was ordered to come to China to mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for eleven months. He not only contacted all parties, but also silently observed the evolution of the situation in China and the Far East, so he deeply knew the political situation in China and understood the core of the situation in the Far East! Therefore, we predict that after Marshal returns home and takes office, the focus of American foreign policy will be concentrated in the Far East. Marshal will rely on his superhuman wisdom and his undefeated strategy. With his diplomatic skills, he will make greater contributions to the peaceful resolution of the Chinese problem. At the same time, he will also try to improve US-Soviet relations, restore the spirit of mutual trust and mutual assistance during the war, and work together to create peace, at least to make the international situation in 1947 unfold a beautiful prospect.

### Leprosy Treated with Sulfa Drugs

The US Public Health Service's Leprosy Advisory Committee recently published a plan to eradicate leprosy, hoping to use powerful new "Sulfa" drugs to cure 3 million leprosy patients worldwide, reducing one of humanity's greatest enemies. The committee specifically pointed out that leprosy can be effectively treated, and even completely cured, but it must be diagnosed early and the latest treatment methods must be applied. The committee hopes to completely eliminate the leprosy epidemic in the United States in the next few years, and hopes to quickly and universally contain leprosy around the world with new diagnostic and treatment methods.

### Japan has become a Battlefield of Ideological Warfare

— Translated by Xu Hong from Reader's Digest

Japan in the second year of Allied occupation has become a battlefield of ideological warfare. Challenging the United States is the Soviet Union. The outcome of this battle will determine whether Japan is "a strong fortress of peace, or a dangerous springboard for war" (MacArthur's words).

The outcome of this battle is decided only by the Japanese themselves; some observers believe that this nascent democracy is no match for red pressure, while other Americans familiar with Japan believe that although the foundation of Japanese democracy has only recently been planted, it is strong and planted on very fertile ground.

Now, the battle that has turned postwar Europe into terror is also fiercely attacking Japan. Japan is now being torn apart by two opposing forces, both of which confusingly allow the people freedom.

After the surrender, the release of political prisoners restored the activities of communists. A team came from the Chinese communist area. As a result, the Communist Party took control of the burgeoning Japanese labor movement, radio broadcasting, and publishing.

In January 1946, most of the widely circulated newspapers in Tokyo and Osaka and the smaller provincial newspapers were clearly leaning to the left. Those newspapers that did not openly admit to belonging to the Communist Party loudly supported the Communist Party's arguments. In Tokyo, the employees of three major newspapers drove away the bosses and editors - and seized the management rights of the editors. Before the government ordered a ban, this method replaced the usual weapon of workers: strikes.

At first, the Supreme Command seemed unwilling to intervene and in fact, there were still a few of the command's workers who went around and secretly encouraged Japan's left-wing elements, but when these were noticed by MacArthur, newspaper rations were handed over to trusted personnel, and some Americans were also "sent back."

### Pressure Comes from Moscow

Today, the Japanese people are living under tremendous pressure from the left. There is no way to conceal the fact that the source of this pressure comes from Smoko. This pressure is implemented in two layers: openly in the Allied Advisory Council in Tokyo; hiddenly in public opinion, which is used to confuse and agitate the Japanese masses.

At the upper level, a suitable but bloated diplomatic corps, led by Brigadier General Kuzma Derevyanko, represents the Soviet Union. It includes more than 500 people. (The British delegation has only thirty-two members.) The Soviet Union has no active task in the occupation work. Derevyanko's task is to bring out criticisms of MacArthur's policies (all domestic) at bi-weekly meetings - these are cleverly avoided by MacArthur's representative, Acheson.

In the next stage, the Soviet Union's strategy is roughly effective. The Soviet Union's Warm Wave Radio Station in Siberia broadcasts strong anti-MacArthur, anti-government rhetoric to Japan every day. Although there are less than five hundred shortwave radios in Japan, its existence sends this propaganda into the hearts of the Japanese people, and any special broadcast can be found in the Japanese newspapers in 24 to 48 hours.

Many Japanese wonder why the United States does not stop these activities. The answer is: In a democracy, even opinions that are extremely contrary to reality have the right to speak out, criticize, and discuss, and even distort facts. This only allows everyone to distinguish between right and wrong themselves. Now the Japanese have begun to see through Soviet-style democracy.

### To the Moon

— Translated from Magazine Digest

"Lunar travel" is about to become a reality. Now mankind has begun to make practical preparations for the unprecedented first journey to the outside world. The organizers this time are not pseudoscientists who like to show off, but the down-to-earth US Army.

This year, the US Army has "reached" the moon through the medium of radar waves. Next year, an unmanned rocket, loaded with radio automatic reporting instruments, will attempt a one-way flight of 240,000 miles. After that, as soon as science solves a few more difficult problems, humans will be able to actually try "lunar travel." Major Carl Hahne, director of the US Air Force Rocket Group, recently told a United Press reporter in Washington that he hopes to make a round trip to the moon in his lifetime.

Regarding the preparation and purpose of "lunar travel," scientific paper writers have had detailed discussions in famous magazines.

Because there is no water, air, or food on the moon, and there is no climate like on Earth, lunar explorers must wear specially made suits weighing seven hundred pounds, containing all the necessities of life. However, due to the smaller mass and gravity of the moon, these suits weighing seven hundred pounds on Earth weigh only one hundred and forty pounds on the moon, and at the same time, the explorer inside the suit, weighing one hundred and eighty pounds, weighs only thirty-five pounds on the moon.

If humans want to fly out of the Earth, they must invent a super-high-speed rocket with a speed of seven miles per second, which is enough to overcome the Earth's gravity. The efficiency of the motor used only needs to be twice that of the existing motor. There are two purposes for mankind to conquer the moon: one is a far-reaching purpose, that is, in case of a "cosmic war" and a war between humans on Earth and humans on Mars or Venus, the moon can be used as an outpost of the Earth. The second purpose is immediate, that is, scientific exploration, such as discovering extraterrestrial and other unknown valuable substances on the moon.

"What will we find on the moon?" To know the answer, please read the following. This is a two-week broadcast report sent to Earth on the first day (equivalent to half a month on Earth) by the first human lunar expedition team after arriving on the moon. Part of the content is based on various famous astronomical works.

### July 1st Temperature - Over Two Hundred Degrees Below Zero

Dear listeners! I am Major Smith, rocket pilot XR701 of the US Air Force, broadcasting from the moon! That's right, we arrived here safely an hour ago, but as for the situation on the moon, what we know at this moment is no different from what you know on Earth: we only know two facts now: it's very dark and very cold here. After two weeks of continuous night, the temperature drops to minus two hundred and forty-two degrees. We are saved from freezing to death by specially made insulated clothing.

While we are waiting for dawn, let us report our broadcast program. The scientists in our expedition team, such as Professor Gray, physicist and radiation expert, Dr. Dunn, biologist and bacteriologist, and Jackson, geologist and mineralogist, will make reports on their findings. I will make a general broadcast of our experiences and discoveries day by day. All materials will be provided by the scientists.

Since you millions of people watched us depart from the Arizona desert, a wisp of flame shooting into the sky, the situation is probably like this:

We have been rising, and the speed is getting higher and higher, until the electronic speed indicator shows a speed of seven miles per second, I turned off the motor, and then we "reached the shore." Now there is no danger of falling. There is no place to fall here. We have broken away from the Earth's gravity and are hanging alone in the vacuum of space.

After advancing a few thousand miles, it began to rain, at least the sound of dripping on the rocket's outer shell was like rain. I talked about this on the communicator, only to see Dawson smile. He said, "No, there will be no rain, hail, or sleet where we are now, and there will be no wind..."

I thought to myself, "Tennyson sitting in a spaceship"!

Dawson said, "It is stardust, cosmic particles floating around the solar system. We must pass through this cloud of particles."

"I hope we don't encounter particles as big as Rhode Island," said Rocket Technician and Co-Pilot Lyon seriously, followed by a quiet silence.

### Touching the Surface of the Moon

The sky is pitch black, dotted with stars like wide-open and unblinking eyes. There is no moon.

No moon... We are speeding towards infinite space, towards an invisible target. This is in accordance with the original plan. We must arrive on the moon before the dawn of the three hundred and thirty-six hours of the lunar day, so that we can make full use of the daylight to engage in our exploration work. In the next hundred hours, we had nothing to do in the rocket except watch the countless instruments, cherish all kinds of hopes, and play cards.

But in the last two hours, I sat in the pilot's seat, my eyes fixed on the instruments. The rest of the team stood in their respective positions, their emotions extremely tense. ... We were not very sure how the lunar surface would react to our altimeter. When the instrument indicated a thousand miles, at our speed, we only had a little more than two minutes left, and I began to use reverse rockets to "brake."

Within ten seconds, the instrument indicated that we were moving away from the moon. I was sweating profusely and at a loss. I saw Lyon smile coldly and say, "The moon's gravity is only one-sixth of the Earth's." Under the tense emotions, I forgot this point and had an Earthling's reaction.

I relaxed the reverse rocket controller, and we slowly descended. Seven hundred miles... six hundred, five hundred... one hundred miles. I held my breath and prayed silently. After passing through the vast and boundless space, our rocket finally slowly touched the surface of the moon.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. We helped each other put on those seven hundred pounds of heavy "moon suits," carefully stepped out of the rocket, and waited for dawn. This was ten minutes ago. After we passed through the rocket's double vacuum door, we felt much more relaxed. We can move freely, but we dare not. We don't know if we are standing on the edge of a valley or at the bottom of a five-mile-deep volcanic crater.

It is pitch black all around. We can't see anything and we can't hear anything. We are curled up next to the rocket, and dawn will come in only thirty minutes. (To be continued in the next issue)

### Not Easy to Climb Up

This is where the former traitors were buried.

### Left to the Next Generation

— Yecao

After Viewing the Exhibition of Anti-Japanese War Documents

Living expenses for the families of traitors have already begun to be returned, and impressions of corruption in the takeover are still scattered in people's minds. At present, we cannot but force ourselves to acknowledge these realities that have already become facts.

But this kind of recognition is painful enough. Especially after we have seen the Exhibition of Anti-Japanese War Documents with our own eyes.

The eight years of the Anti-Japanese War have left behind so many moving documents. This glory belongs to countless heroes who sacrificed themselves for the country before and behind enemy lines. The martyred heroes left this glory to us, but we have lightly forgotten it; those comrades who survived behind enemy lines are also full of scars, carrying physical disabilities in exchange for their lives. These disabilities once exchanged for the health of the nation, but haven't we all forgotten them again in the turbulent reality?

We were greatly moved by this Anti-Japanese War Documents Exhibition organized by the Society for the Relief of Martyrs. Everyone who stepped into the Municipal Museum relived the faces of the heroes who suffered lifelong hardships to liberate ourselves.

Mr. Jiang Menglin's only scrotum, and Mr. Liu Zhigang's deformed body after being injected with poison, fully illustrate the undisguised bestiality of the invaders, and also illustrate the price we paid to fight for justice. Although Mr. Jiang and Mr. Liu have lost their personal health, they are still able to live with us on this free land. This is the highest honor of our generation.

Ms. Fan Yunfang and her business - the Xianle Photo Studio, have also left an indelible page for underground work. This page will forever illuminate the bottom layer of this muddled city, making thousands of urban daughters who sing and drink yearn for this noble example!

Martyr Ping Zuren finally left us. What a magnificent rest! Victory is painted with blood like this. Facing his quietly lying remains in the photo, we should have a deep realization!

Bless these heroes who have suffered hardships and torments! We will leave this brilliant memory to the next generation!

### The Story of Collapse

— Shu Xun

I returned home today, and my wife's face didn't look good. I panicked: Had she found out about my dancing at the tea house this afternoon? My own face couldn't help but tense up, but I had to relax my facial muscles and gently probe:

"Why are you unhappy? Is Xiao Manli being disobedient? Then it must be that Da Guan isn't studying diligently." I was a little annoyed. My wife was too doting on the children, and the children were too naughty and outrageous.

My wife just shook her head, and her eyes were a little moist.

It must be Da Guan making Mom angry, because he's the only one who often makes Mom cry with anger.

"Da Guan, come here!"

I wanted to play the role of a temporary judge again.

"No, no, don't scold him, I'm just sad."

I panicked even more. In these times, getting sick is no joke. Consultation fees, medicine fees, surgery fees—it all adds up to millions. My God! But I had to be extremely careful and concerned:

"Do you need a doctor? Dr. Wang is my childhood classmate, and Dr. Zhao is a consultant at my company. I'll call them. Dear, where exactly are you feeling unwell?"

"I'm sorry to you, Third Brother has collapsed, and he's disappeared!" My wife finally burst into tears.

I understood. She didn't know about the tea house dancing, and a weight lifted from my heart.

But, Third Brother has collapsed! I thought of how capable my wife usually is, able to lend a million to others and collect two hundred thousand in interest each month to supplement the household income. She often went out shopping.

"Look, I bought a piece of clothing material, one hundred thousand and five thousand, is it cheap? Is it pretty? This is the money I earned." Whenever this happened, I always praised her for being capable. And only in these situations would she be as happy as a little bird, her smile as radiant as blossoming flowers—not even as beautiful as she was during our honeymoon. At the same time, she was also very proud, as if saying that I wasn't as capable as she was. Under my humble admiration, she became even more pleased and triumphant, seemingly even more so than when she stepped into the wedding hall during our wedding…

But today, she collapsed. Like a phoenix, suddenly having its beautiful tail cut off, or like a flower, withering in an instant.

I really didn't expect Third Brother to collapse! He usually saved every penny, was steady and reliable in his work, and never told a lie."

My wife sobbed as she explained to me.

"Someone wanted to arrest him to report to the authorities. But Big Brother couldn't bear it and ordered an audit to be conducted. It turns out that he lost five million in business last March. To save face and maintain his credit, he started borrowing money to get by, moving funds from one place to another to cover debts, with interest rates getting higher and the debt amount increasing. To borrow money, he also had to engage in more socialising. To socialize, the events became bigger and more lavish, increasing expenses and loosening his grip on money. He also generously provided for the household. No wonder Third Brother's wife bought a leather coat last month, and Xiao Baoshi is covered in gold jewellery. It turns out they were all spending other people's money!"

"How much did he lose?"

"In the end, he owes a total of eighty-seven million."

"Your share?"

"My five million is all gone!"

My wife cried very sadly.

I felt like the sky was spinning and the earth was turning. Five million, five million, five million…

### "Opinion Meter"

— Jia Yuan

Holding a vote in a huge venue is indeed an extremely troublesome matter. With so many people and hands involved, it's easy to make mistakes in the calculations. Even a slight oversight can require starting over, wasting a lot of time, and also negatively impacting the order of the venue. Another point is that while a person can absolutely agree or absolutely disagree with a question, sometimes they may only partially agree. For example, 75% agree, 25% disagree. But in a normal venue, it is impossible to accurately calculate this. This has to be considered a major flaw.

But humans are ultimately intelligent animals and have finally invented a tool that can precisely calculate opinions. This thing is called the "Opinion Meter." It was designed by General Electric of the United States and can record all kinds of opinions, from "1% agree" to "99% agree." As for absolute agreement or absolute disagreement, that's even less of a problem. This machine can record up to 150 different opinions. Each opinion takes an average of ten seconds to record. Finally, turning the mechanism, the pointer can tell you the accurate percentage, such as 53% agree. Its precision is beyond what can be achieved by hand calculation. In the 20th century, which has a particularly large number of meetings, it is indeed extremely useful. (The above is based on a United Press report from New York.)

### Stability First

— Wan Shi

Talking About New Tricks in Labor-Management Disputes

Since the victory, especially in Shanghai, labor-management disputes have arisen one after another, endlessly. At that time, the weapons of the labor side against the capital side were nothing more than "lazy work," "slow work," and "strike." However, recently, many labor-management disputes have been caused by the year-end bonus issue. The labor side has two new weapons against the capital side, and these two new terms are "worried work" and "slow work."

The originator of "worried work" is the Little Luzon department store on Nanjing Road. Their employees set up a rectangular wooden sign at the entrance, with the words "worried work" written in large letters. Inside the department store, on all the walls and glass counters, they pasted slogans, stating that the Lunar New Year is approaching, prices are expensive, and daily life needs cannot be met with low wages. They demanded that the capital side understand their plight, issue double salaries, increase wages, and promptly issue the public funds due to them. Because the labor side did not want the capital side to suffer losses, they continued to operate as usual, meaning that "worried work" was only a spiritual expression, a new trick and a passive form of resistance.

As for the originator of "slow work" is the French-owned tram company. They also implemented "slow work" as resistance for the year-end bonus issue. The so-called "slow work" means reducing the speed of the tram to that of walking. For example, it takes an hour and a half to go from Shanzhong Road to the Bund's 16th Pier, which can really be said to have created the record for the slowest vehicle speed. The intention was to reduce the capital side's income, which is also a "new trick."

When we see the above situation, we will feel that this is unfortunate for both labor and capital. But why can't labor and capital understand each other? Why can't labor and capital coordinate with each other? Both sides are to blame. Mayor Wu once said last year: "If you want to eat eggs, you must protect the hen." We hope that whether it is the hen or the egg, from now on, they should love each other. Currently in China, in a thousand words, one sentence stands out: "Stability first." We hope that the new terms regarding labor-management disputes will also end here.

### "Opportunity" Passes in an Instant

— Ge Chunliang

There is an idiom that says "opportunity" will knock on everyone's door once, but only once. Often, the sound of its knocking is not heard, and it becomes a regret. Here are some stories of regret.

It is very difficult to find out who lent money to Robert Fulton and allowed him to invent the steamboat, because the supporter was afraid that his name would be ridiculed for sponsoring this project, so he hid his name. But later, the steamboat was invented, and he was still an unknown person.

When George Westinghouse designed a steam brake in 1875, he sent the plan to Vanderbilt, the key figure in the railway industry, who returned Westinghouse's letter to him and wrote a sentence at the bottom of the letter: "I don't have time to mess around with stupid idiots!" Idiot? Ha, Westinghouse later became one of the leading inventors in the United States!

One day, a stranger walked up to Mark Twain and asked him for five hundred dollars, saying that he was willing to offset half of the benefits of his invention as the price for that money. Mark Twain "bit his lip" and considered it for a long time, then resolutely refused. However, for the sake of politeness, he asked the stranger's name. "Bell," the man replied, turning to leave, "My name is Alexander Graham Bell." Now, everyone knows that he is the inventor of the telephone.

The person who made a suggestion to the author of Sherlock Holmes (Conan Doyle) was also not a stranger. He was a young actor in Conan Doyle's play. He suggested that from now on, the writer's income and his own, no matter how much, should be put together and divided equally until death. Doyle couldn't help but laugh, "If I didn't know you were joking," he said, "Charlie Chaplin, I would have fired you long ago for your presumptuous and audacious suggestion." Now this Charlie Chaplin is the star of "The Great Dictator," a unique comedic film star. Ha, needless to say?

(Chunliang translated from this month's "Your Life")

### County Magistrate Today

— Ruo Si

To be a county magistrate today, unless you are a genius, it is difficult to handle affairs. People, finance, construction, education, military, law, grain, society, land... everything is concentrated in one person. If the county magistrate is a political official, then the section chiefs of each department should be administrative officials, so that they can barely handle matters. However, today's county magistrates mostly bring a team with them. This year they are county magistrates in County A, and these few people jump around. If they don't do well, they are sued by the local people, and they can't sit still. Next year they will be county magistrates in County B, and it is still this team, still these few people jumping around. This is of course one of the miracles of Chinese politics, but now it seems to be commonplace. If the county magistrate does not bring a team and takes office alone, even welcoming him cannot be handled. The superiors will definitely not have a good impression, "Huh, this person doesn't even have cadres." The team does not have great ability.

Some county magistrates have a monthly salary of only ninety thousand yuan (believe it or not), while the secretary and section chief have fifty to sixty thousand yuan. Currently, the salary of a county magistrate in Jiangsu is only more than two hundred thousand yuan, which is stronger than a rickshaw puller in Shanghai. But everything has to be done, local people are quarrelling, the army wants rice, conscription, if you do it seriously, you are busy from morning to night, and twenty-four hours a day is not enough. It can be seen that the county government's office expenses are only a few hundred thousand yuan. Should this amount be used to send telegrams or to eat snacks? Not to mention pens, ink, and paper.

If money is needed, it can only be moved from one place to another. If the county magistrate has a clear conscience, the accounts cannot be checked. The county council has great power in hand. If they put on a serious face to check, the consequences would be unimaginable. The budget and expenses, especially under the special expenses item, must be approved by the council, but the council is not necessarily ideal. If the county magistrate does not deal with them well, it will be quite terrible. It may be impossible to promote anything, and you can only pack up and leave. If you want to implement some facilities, it is not possible to do it boldly, because there are too many constraints. "Dictatorship" is not possible, and "democracy" does not seem to work well either.

A certain county magistrate told me four rules for "county magistrate theory":

Use him like a sage;

Drive him like an ox or horse;

Discard him like worn shoes;

Defend against him like a thief.

This can be a portrayal of today's county magistrate. In fact, there are many people who want to be county magistrates but cannot. Do they have a strong interest in local administration? Not necessarily. Some county magistrates have to rely on special relationships to survive and promise everything. Today, politics is not on track, and there are too many people in positions. When the county magistrate takes office, a large number of resumes of staff members are introduced. Is it true that no one is doing county administration? Not necessarily. The county magistrate's head is flattened, and it depends on each person's means.

If there is an old team and someone promises everything, then the county magistrate will become more and more old, and the work will become easier and easier. Even if he does nothing and closes his eyes, he can handle things well, and it does not necessarily require any talent.

### Various Fire Extinguishers

— Yu

Fire, like water, can benefit mankind and also harm mankind. We make use of fire and also worry about fire. Since ancient times, mankind's weapon for extinguishing fire has always been water. Now, although fire trucks have been improved and pumps have been invented, the main weapon for extinguishing fire is still water.

Ordinary fire extinguishing equipment has many shortcomings. It cannot approach objects that are on fire and producing high heat to extinguish them. But how can intelligent humans sit idly by and let the fire god run rampant? Some new fire extinguishing weapons have been invented. Here, I will introduce three to the readers:

The first is colorless, chemically inert carbon dioxide. The gas we exhale when we breathe is it. The old-fashioned carbon dioxide fire extinguisher uses sodium carbonate and sulfuric acid to produce carbon dioxide gas. The new carbon dioxide fire extinguisher directly fills a high-pressure sealed cylinder with liquid carbon dioxide. When used, the lid is opened, and the pressure inside the cylinder disappears. The carbon dioxide then sprays out rapidly, expanding to five hundred times its volume, covering the fire scene like cold frost, with a temperature as low as minus one hundred and ten degrees! The snow-like carbon dioxide immediately turns into a gas, enveloping the fire scene, isolating it from the outside oxygen, making it impossible to continue burning.

Another new fire extinguishing weapon is called "fire-covering foam." "Fire-covering foam" is a sticky, sponge-like foam that sticks to everything, even on vertical glass sheets. Wherever there is a fire, it can extinguish it, just like using a wet straw bag to extinguish embers.

The strange feature of foam fire extinguishing is that it is not a chemical reaction, but a completely mechanical action. The liquid used to make the foam is usually aluminum sulfate or a secret product made from soybeans used to make wine. This "soybean soup" is mixed with water and air, pumped out, and sprayed out through a nozzle, becoming fire-extinguishing foam. "Fire-covering foam" is as harmless as carbon dioxide. It is harmless to clothing and human skin. After the fire is extinguished, 90% of the foam disappears.

Now there is a fire brigade that carries only "fire-covering foam" and a powerful pump, and no other fire extinguishing materials. By mixing one hundred gallons of water, they can make one thousand gallons of foam. The foam is sprayed out, either flowing or evaporating due to the heat, but the foam sticks tightly to the burning object. Therefore, in places where water sources are scarce, "fire-covering foam" is a valuable fire extinguishing weapon. Another fire extinguishing weapon is "water mist," which is not made of any secret chemicals, but is simply mankind's original fire extinguishing weapon - water - broken down into a "mist wall." A water hose, passing through a specially made spray nozzle, will be divided into many needle-shaped jets. These jets collide with each other as they flow from the top of the hose, and are further divided into billions of tiny water droplets. These water droplets, when sprayed out, create a fire-extinguishing "mist wall."

The principle of "water mist" fire extinguishing is very simple: countless water droplets surround the fire scene, absorbing the heat and lowering the temperature, while isolating it from the oxygen in the air, so the fire god is captured.

"Water mist" has many advantages: because this mist wall is non-conductive, when a high-voltage power plant catches fire, firefighters can use "water mist" to approach and rescue without the risk of electric shock. Also, because the water particles are almost weightless, it is especially beneficial for rescuing burning ships. Ship fires are very difficult to extinguish because the ship is loaded with fuel for navigation, and the ship's hull generates high heat when it burns. Although there is no shortage of water sources, the ship is filled with water. Although the fire is extinguished, the ship also capsizes. Last year, the "Normandy" ocean liner caught fire in New York Harbor. The result of using water to extinguish the fire day and night was that it capsized. But if "water mist" is used for rescue, this drawback can be avoided. During the war, the United Nations' large transport ship "Manhattan" caught fire and was out of control. Fortunately, "water mist" was used for emergency rescue. After spraying for three days, the fire was extinguished, and the ship only had a slight list. If seawater had been used for rescue, the "Manhattan" would have been "pulled away" by the Sea Dragon King long ago.

### From *The Grapes of Wrath* to See America

The American novel scene of the past decade has been dominated by Hemingway, Saroyan, and Steinbeck. Hemingway's technique is commonplace, merely using novel subject matter to attract readers. As for "For Whom the Bell Tolls," the lived experience is insufficient, and the imagery fails to materialize. It is only appreciated by vulgar petty bourgeois individuals, and cannot be considered literature. Saroyan's vocabulary is too limited to grasp complex characters and grand scenes. Steinbeck, on the other hand, uses his powerful pen to portray the reality of American people's lives. "Of Mice and Men" is a timeless masterpiece, while the artistic and social value of "The Grapes of Wrath" has reached a peak.

Chinese intellectuals tend to have a certain perspective on America, often placing their hopes on the United States as if it were paved with gold bars, gold nuggets, stocks, and bonds, just waiting to be picked up; as if every city and village were holding grand cocktail parties day and night, waiting for you to attend; as if every woman were as glamorous and passionate as described in film advertisements, waiting for you to kiss or embrace. "The Grapes of Wrath" is a good book to correct this tendency.

Under the scorching sun, the fields of Oklahoma are barren. The wind blows incessantly, and the sky is forever filled with dust and smog. The barren fields are divided into countless irregular patches. Layers of dust cover the land, burying the already scarce and desperately thirsty plants. Farmers, with handkerchiefs wrapped around their heads and wearing sand-proof glasses, diligently cultivate this land, irrigating it with their sweat and blood. However, they cannot enjoy their harvest because, although they reclaimed the land, they borrowed from the bank during lean years, and the ownership of the land has been transferred to the bank. Now, they must pay a sum of rent to the landowners. Moreover, because a tractor can replace the labor of twelve or thirteen farm families, the supply of labor becomes redundant. "The tenant system is no longer viable."

Now, the farmers must leave these desolate fields. Where will they go? How will they live in the future? The bank does not care about these matters. The bank only demands its profits and interest. The landowners of California have distributed many leaflets in the East, saying that they need a lot of labor to pick grapes or do other work, and that the wages are quite favorable. But what is the reality? They only need a small amount of labor, and they deliberately advertise in this way because, according to the law of supply and demand, the more people who come to California seeking work, the lower they can drive down wages, thus gaining more profit.

In the flood of refugees, some carry their entire families, buying a used truck to serve as transportation, loading their families and everyday household items onto the truck, packing it as full as a can of food. In their illusions, California is ideal, the Garden of Eden on earth. The grandfather says: "Over there, it's full of grapes, with clusters of grapes hanging everywhere. Guess what I'm going to do? I'm going to pick a basin full of grapes and sit in the middle of it, letting the juice soak through my pants." The mother says: "But I can't help but think that California is very good, the weather is never cold, there are fruits everywhere, and people live in small white houses hidden among the bushes, a place to one's heart's content."

Death and flight are always close-knit twin brothers. In the Joad family's journey, the first to die is the grandfather. Originally, when it was time to set off, he was reluctant to leave his hometown. They got him drunk with medicinal wine and carried him onto the truck. Forcing an old man to leave the land where he grew up is already enough to cause him spiritual pain, and adding the hardship of the journey, an acute stroke ended his life. Before crossing the desert, the grandmother also died. In order to help everyone escape the arid desert sooner, the mother kept the news of the grandmother's death a secret, sleeping with the grandmother's cold corpse all night. It was not until the truck reached the Great Plains that the news was revealed. Another event that cast a shadow over everyone's hearts was the disappearance of the eldest son, Noah, who went off alone to fight for his life.

After they arrive in California, the little money they had saved has been used up, and they still cannot find work. The filthy Hooverville camp does not allow them to stay. The police come to make trouble every two or three days. Later, they finally find a place to settle down in the Weedpatch Camp. Here, the poor masses are well-organized, well-equipped, and live a disciplined, autonomous life. However, the problem of work cannot be solved, so they have to leave their ideal living environment and go to a farm to pick peaches. The wages they earn are pitifully small. Because Tom beats up a man, fearing further trouble, the family gets back into their dilapidated truck and goes to another place to pick cotton. There, they encounter a flood that sweeps away their meager possessions and threatens their lives…

I would like to use "The Grapes of Wrath" to illustrate the current situation of American society:

First, American landowners and capitalists have discovered that to obtain more profits, it is not necessary to increase capital and expand the market. Controlling labor and the market can achieve the same goal. The book "The Sixty Families" describes the trend of enterprise trusts and analyzes the political background of each trust, which can help us understand "The Grapes of Wrath." As a result of landowners and capitalists controlling labor and the market, workers are forced to accept the lowest wages in order to survive, but they still cannot make a living.

Second, Washington's revolutionary ideals and what Mencken longed for, "Of the people, For the people, By the people," have not been fully realized to this day. Although American-style democracy gives every citizen a limited freedom of speech, it cannot guarantee them freedom from hunger. In the United States, all freedoms have been transformed into economic commodities due to high capitalization. As a result, the living space of the poor has become extremely narrow. Parking a car overnight in a parking lot requires a considerable rent, and arguing with the police even a few times can get you labeled as a radical. We believe that the U.S. government's progress is too slow and should pay more attention to the people other than the landowners and capitalists.

Third, it is true that the source of modern European and American civilization is Greek and Hebrew thought, and it is true that the spiritual life of modern Europeans and Americans cannot be separated from the church. However, the degeneration of the religious beliefs of the general population is a fact. In "The Grapes of Wrath," the pastor initially doubts the efficacy of prayer and eventually quits being a pastor altogether, which illustrates the attitude of the younger generation of Americans towards religion.

Fourth, apart from the philistine class, Americans welcome guests. A stranger traveling in a foreign land will be warmly received and greeted with kindness everywhere, making you feel as if you are at home. This is because the population is excessively concentrated in cities and life in the wilderness is too lonely. Therefore, poor families like the Joads still use their most precious food to treat unexpected guests. The real American people are lovely, and we should sympathize with them.

After reading this book, we will appreciate Steinbeck's angry emotions, and we ourselves cannot help but feel angry.

### Valley

— Ye Feng

I have long yearned to come here and sing a song, along the winding stream flowing in this valley. It is very desolate, but everything appears so quiet and lovely, like a rose-colored dream for a long, long time; I have long yearned to come here and paint a picture without colors.

Here there are: light soaring of flying birds, murmuring of a small stream, fragrant wild flowers, and the resounding of a high-pitched shepherd's flute on the hillside...

Although it is a foggy dawn, the sound of logging is already echoing in the lush green forest. Cooking smoke is also rising. The working people have already stepped out of the low, damp thresholds to work in the fields. Who would still linger in the bitter dreams of the long night!

Thus, the laughter of village girls tinkles by the stream, a boisterous pastoral song rises from the fields, and the silent valley immediately echoes with the hurried footsteps of travelers heading to distant places.

### Aphorisms

— Ou

Poetry is a copper flute; a skilled musician can play out its sorrows and joys.

Poetry is like a rainbow after the rain, spanning the heart when people's thoughts are clear.

Poetry is the eye of the soul, in which truth and beauty are hidden; only those who truly love her can comprehend her and be intoxicated by her.

In fact, the essence of poetry is beauty.

### The Oyster Gatherer

— John Singer Sargent

### An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

There is also one person that must be met: who? It is the leader of the Fifth Column's special agents, the one-eyed gentleman, Sargent. He is very busy and not always by Konoe's side. But if he happens to be here, he will be a very tricky fellow, because his brain is more flexible than any of the Japanese dwarves. Perhaps he is watching coldly from the sidelines and might be able to expose Tsurumi's plan at once. If he is in Beppu, Tsurumi must meet him. The meaning of this meeting, in Shanghai dialect, is called "bie miao tou" (sizing each other up). Of course, the first sentence of the meeting must be straightforward, telling him that "this is a small matter of opinion among 'our own people' in this country. VIPs need not interfere, otherwise you will be greatly embarrassed." If Sargent knows what's good for him, each will avoid the other, and Tsurumi may not necessarily want to put him in an awkward situation. But if Sargent insists on fighting it out, Tsurumi has already made arrangements, and will not let him gain any advantage.

Meeting these few people has taken up a lot of space in writing, but in reality, if all goes well, it will only take three to six minutes. Even if it doesn't go smoothly and a fight breaks out, it won't take much time because arrangements, both overt and covert, have already been made. According to the original plan, unless absolutely necessary and a major fight really breaks out, there will be no cutting off the electricity and telephone, etc., to cut off Beppu's external support. However, at this time, Tsurumi had only just grabbed a knife and had not encountered anyone. Why were the lights turned off? So even Tsurumi himself was baffled.

Seeing that the situation had changed, Tsurumi knew that things were not good, but in any case, he had to find out the reason. What he could not forget was the basement, where he expected his people, all of whom held important positions, to be in that area. If an unexpected change occurred at this time, he guessed that it must have occurred within that area. Sure enough, when he ran to the end of the passage and suddenly pulled open that small room, he heard the clanging sound of knives and swords clashing. He listened quietly to determine the direction of the fierce battle. Unfortunately, with the heavy doors and stacked houses, high walls and low fences, the echoes were too much, and he could not determine the source of the fighting.

At this point, Tsurumi could not help but be anxious, because the plan had already gone awry. He couldn't care about much anymore and went straight into Konoe's Japanese-style hall.

"Hmm… Hong ji jiu ju…?" Someone shouted in the hall. "Yan," is the opening word of Japanese martial arts, probably imitating the sound of a tiger or lion roaring; at the same time, this hum contains the important meaning of preempting the enemy. But the thing is, the Japanese have too many inherent deficiencies, and the nasal sound problem is too serious. When they try to imitate it, they don't quite sound like tigers or lions. Isn't the secret code of the Black Dragon Society "Kong ji jiu ju"? Why is this one "Hong"? That is also because the nasal sound is too heavy or the throat sound is…究.

### Stranger

— Su. Libijieff 作, Li Li 譯 (translated by)

It was a summer morning. I was carrying my fishing rod and going to my familiar and favorite place, about two versts from the town, to fish. There I met a man I had never seen before.

"I often come here to fish. Please forgive me, I wanted to sit next to you," I said to the stranger.

"What do you mean? If you need this place, I can let you have it!" he replied.

"Please sit, please sit, you haven't taken my place. Have you been here long?"

"Yes, almost an hour."

"Any luck?"

"Nothing!"

After I cast my line, I began to scrutinize my neighbor. He was about forty years old, with graying hair, an unshaven chin, a dirty, lace-trimmed hat, a greasy woolen undershirt, and a dirty, patched leather jacket, and worn-out, crooked boots. All this gave me a general impression; my neighbor was a poor drunkard.

We sat quietly for nearly an hour without saying a word to each other. By this time I had already caught several roach and carp.

"Eh? What's the matter?" my neighbor finally began to speak. "I've been here for almost two hours, and the bait has only been nibbled at once. You came after me, and you've been 'stealing' all the fish from me."

"If you want, I can give you the fish," I said casually.

"What do you mean? Please forgive me, I never accept charity from others, even if I am a poor wretch in tattered clothes…"

"I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to be charitable," I hastened to explain. "The reason I wanted to give you the fish is just that it is something I don't need."

We were silent again for a few minutes.

"Do you often come fishing?" I broke the silence.

"Often, and you?"

"I come almost every holiday in the summer. It's a very good pastime."

"What do you do for a living?" I continued to ask.

"I... I... I am just who I am!"

"Just who I am, what does that mean?"

"It's very simple, ... it's just, not anyone else."

"I still don't understand what you mean."

My neighbor was so amusing to me that I had forgotten the float on the water.

"In the Tsar's time, I was a clerk in a county yamen, but the work was very heavy and the income was limited, so I quit. Now I am like a free bird, and I can go wherever I want..."

"Didn't you ask anyone to help you find a job?"

"Alas! So desolate! They all say I am an "objector." "Compromiser"."

"What does that mean?"

"Objector" and "Compromiser" means I am a dangerous element."

"Where do you live now?"

The strange man tapped the ground with his toes.

"Right here on this land with you..."

"Some people call me a vagrant, some people call me a wanderer, and some people call me a poor bachelor, please choose any three of those!"

"Alas, it's been like this for a long time! I don't want anything more. He picked up a big carp and said with emotion: "Good carp, my lovely carp, you show me warm kindness, you give me infinite warmth..."

After he finished saying these words, he threw the carp at my feet, picked up his fishing rod, and walked quickly along the bank.

"Goodbye, friend!" he shouted, about fifty yards away from me.

After a few minutes, the strange man turned back, carrying the hat he had forgotten. When he got the hat in his hand, he laughed and said:

"Can you lend me thirty kopecks tomorrow?"

"Do you need it urgently?"

"Because the addiction to half a glass of old wine is acting up" he smiled.

I took out my purse.

"You can take the fish too." I handed him the fish.

"Thank you, not necessary for this one. For your health, I won't bother you anymore."

I picked up my purse and fish basket, and he had disappeared from my sight in a hurry.
