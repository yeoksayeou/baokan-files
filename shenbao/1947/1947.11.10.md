### Marshall Reports to Both Houses' Foreign Affairs Committees: Estimated U.S. Aid to China - $1 Billion Available Next Year

(United Press International, Washington, 8th) Secretary of State Marshall will report to the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees on the 10th regarding estimates of aid needed for China (possibly including other regions) as well as aid to Europe. According to well-informed sources, China may be able to utilize approximately $1 billion in U.S. aid in the coming year. However, the scope of the aid has not yet been finalized. It is certain that the United States has reached the minimum level of aid and is actively seeking ways to support China to prevent economic collapse, communist military oppression, and political division. Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Vandenberg advised the government weeks ago, and recently reiterated his view, stating that the government should not only report to Congress the estimated aid needed for Europe but also the total amount of aid in order to favorably prepare for the promotion of American interests in other parts of the world. The only other part of the world needing U.S. aid is the Far East. The State Department has been studying the Far East issue because it is not only related to China but also to the economic interests of China, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and other countries in the region. The region is not as closely linked as Europe, but if the entire region can reach a common understanding, some problems can be alleviated. Marshall's main task on the 10th will be to discuss the urgent needs of France and Italy and their relationship to the long-term recovery of Europe. It is expected that he will only discuss the China issue in general terms. Marshall intends to reiterate the government's theory that the restoration of Europe can promote the revival of world trade, which will greatly benefit other parts of the world, including the Far East. However, this action does not provide as much practical assistance to the Far East as it does to other major regions. In this context, Marshall will mention the issue of U.S. aid to China. Apart from supplying some relief goods, transferring some surplus war materials, and providing a limited amount of ammunition for Chinese army rifles, the U.S. has done little. One of the difficulties encountered by the State Department in estimating China's needs is that China is too disorganized, and only a relatively limited amount of funds can be used for relief in the region.

Editorial

### The Soviet Union Deliberately Disregards China!

The Foreign Ministers' representatives of the four major powers, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, recently held a meeting in London to begin discussing the German peace treaty issue. The representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France unanimously advocated that China should be invited to participate in drafting the German peace treaty and that China should also be one of the invited nations, along with the four major powers, when the German peace conference is convened in the future. Unexpectedly, the Soviet representative, Smirnov, uniquely held a different opinion at the meeting on the 8th of this month, refusing the suggestions of the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on the grounds that China was not a signatory to Germany's surrender, causing a setback for the Foreign Ministers' conference of the four major powers. Although this is a "rehash of old tunes" by Soviet diplomats, at a time when our Foreign Minister Wang is strongly advocating that the Soviet Union should participate in the Japanese peace treaty and resolutely opposing the American saying of "excluding the Soviet Union," the Soviet Union insists on opposing China's participation in drafting the German peace treaty. I wonder what our diplomatic authorities will think? Moreover, the Soviet Union's behavior of harming others without benefiting itself will only arouse unhappiness between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. What good will this do for the Soviet Union? It is truly puzzling.

First, under the current international relations, world peace is indivisible. Before World War II, Soviet diplomats had already loudly proclaimed the theory that peace is indivisible, and it was applauded by the peoples of various countries. Now, after the end of World War II, international turmoil is even more closely related. The isolationists in the United States have long become outdated, and no one believes in the fallacy of glorious isolation anymore. Therefore, creating peace after the war is a common task for all countries in the world, especially the five major powers, which bear special responsibility for creating and maintaining world peace. However, the most important work in creating peace after the war is to draft the two peace treaties with Germany and Japan. The signing of these two peace treaties concerns the fate of all mankind and must be treated with special caution. Therefore, when the Big Three of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Potsdam in August 1945, they decided that China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France should form a "Council of Foreign Ministers" to be responsible for drafting peace treaties with Germany and its vassal states. Later, when the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union met in Moscow to discuss the drafting of the peace treaty, the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom and the United States accommodated the Soviet Union and decided that the peace treaty should be drafted by the representatives of the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. However, the peace conference to discuss this peace treaty should still be convened by the "Council of Foreign Ministers" consisting of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Legally speaking, China should be an invited country to the German peace conference, which can be said to be beyond doubt. Furthermore, in terms of the actual situation, although China was unable to directly participate in the European theater and fight against Nazi Germany and its vassals due to its geographical environment during this war, it has always contained Japan, Germany's ally in the Far East, causing it to be mired in China and unable to provide effective assistance to Germany. It must be said that this is China's arduous contribution. Especially the Soviet Union, during the German-Soviet war, did not suffer the pain of being attacked on two fronts, and it cannot but know that this is due to China's strength in resisting Japan. We believe that Soviet political diplomats, as long as they are not prejudiced, are not unaware that China's resistance to Japan in the Far East is equivalent to assisting the Soviet Union in Europe in resisting Germany. But why today does the Soviet representative reject its ally China's participation in drafting the German peace treaty and deny its qualification as an invited country? Our Foreign Minister Wang, however, must express a different view from the United States, confirming that the Soviet Union, which only fought Japan for five or six days, must participate in the Japanese peace treaty. How can the Soviet Union be so arrogant and China so respectful!

Second, the diplomatic policy of the Chinese authorities after the war has always been to strive for the friendship of the Soviet Union, even at any cost, to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union. Even in any international conference, the Chinese representatives have consistently adopted an impartial policy. When the American and Soviet representatives had irreconcilable disputes, our representatives have never dared to offend the Soviet Union with a single word, and instead often acted as mediators, hoping to resolve the difficulties. For example, the United States and the Soviet Union had a great dispute over the veto power in the United Nations General Assembly. The Chinese representatives repeatedly proposed compromise plans to reconcile the views of both sides, in an attempt to reach an agreement. Furthermore, in the Far Eastern Commission, the United States and the Soviet Union often had disputes over the Korean issue. The Chinese representatives always wanted to be a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union to communicate the views of both sides so that the meeting would not be deadlocked. These facts are too numerous to mention. Even today, our country's attitude towards the Soviet Union is still very clear. As long as the Soviet Union can faithfully fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty, our country is ultimately very willing to be friendly with the Soviet Union and has absolutely no prejudice or resentment. However, what does the Soviet Union answer to China?

Third, the Soviet Union often disregards our country's international status in international conferences and attempts to exclude our country from the list of invited countries. Many disputes have already occurred. For example, when the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers met in Paris in July last year and decided to convene the European Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov strongly argued and opposed China being an invited country to the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference. Although this unfriendly and almost insulting behavior of the Soviet Union made every Chinese person with self-esteem angry, our diplomatic authorities have always been cowardly and fearful. Not only have they not protested to the Soviet Union, but they have also adopted a consistent attitude of enduring humiliation in international conferences. This attitude of fearing and flattering the Soviet Union will not only make the Soviet Union look down on China even more, but will also cause other allied nations to laugh at it. For example, regarding the issue of convening the Japanese peace conference, the United States has repeatedly expressed its intention to exclude the Soviet Union and convene the Japanese peace conference alone. However, our country resolutely opposes any proposal for a peace treaty with Japan without the participation of the Soviet Union. Our Foreign Minister Wang even rashly stated in the United States: "If the Soviet government refuses to participate in the preliminary meeting of the Japanese peace treaty proposed by the United States, then China will reconsider its position on this matter." I wonder if Foreign Minister Wang's efforts to secure the Soviet Union's position in the Japanese peace conference can win the Soviet Union's favor and leave some room for China in the international arena?

Fourth, the post-war world has already created a situation of confrontation between two major blocs because the United States and the Soviet Union cannot work together to build world peace. Especially since the emergence of the new Communist International, the gap between the two major blocs has become increasingly deep. On the one hand, it has raised the banner of anti-imperialism and called on European countries to undermine the American aid plan to Europe. On the other hand, it has used anti-communism as a slogan and actively assisted other countries in resisting the invasion of foreign forces. At the same time, the "Cold War" currently underway between the United States and the Soviet Union is also intensifying. Soviet representatives often accuse American diplomats of being "warmongers." In the United States, the responsibility for the failure to build peace is attributed to the Soviet Union. Alas! China, standing as a third party, originally did not want to take sides in the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union's diplomatic style deliberately demonstrates against China. The more China retreats, the more arrogant the Soviet Union becomes. Whether the Soviet Union truly loves world peace cannot but make us greatly doubt it. And we, who are willing to be friends with the Soviet Union, cannot but express indignation at these scenes of facts being performed!

### Stores in Xiangtan and Jinshi Cities Restore the Use of Copper Coins: Rice Only Requires Three Coins per Liter

[Our Newspaper, Hengyang, 7th] Stores in Jinshi City have voluntarily restored the use of copper coins. Each 50-wen copper coin is worth 1,000 yuan in legal currency.

### Guangdong and Jiangxi Border Will Launch Suppression and Hold Joint Defense Meeting Mid-Month

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 9th] The security authorities of Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces believe that the bandits in the border areas of Nanxiong, Dayu, and various counties in southern Jiangxi often take advantage of the relatively lax border defenses of the provinces. When suppressed in Jiangxi, they flee south into Guangdong, and when suppressed in Guangdong, they flee north into southern Jiangxi, making suppression very difficult. Therefore, it has been decided to hold a joint defense meeting of the two provinces in the middle of the month to suppress the bandits in the border areas. It is heard that the joint defense meeting will be held in Nanxiong, and Chairman Song will also allocate additional security forces to strengthen the strength of the eastern Guangdong defense forces. Furthermore, joint defense will also be held in counties such as Kaiping, Zhaoping, Wuzhou, and Xindu on the Guangdong-Guangxi border. Huang Xuchu is scheduled to fly from Guilin to Guangzhou on the 13th to meet with Song Ziwen to discuss the suppression of bandits in the Guangdong-Guangxi border areas.

### Guangzhou Dance Hall Dancers Increase, Second Phase of Retraining Class Canceled

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 9th] The first phase of the Guangzhou dance hall dancers' retraining class was just opened five days ago, and the second phase of the dancers' training has suddenly been announced to be discontinued.

However, the number of dancers in Guangzhou's dance halls is increasing daily, and the tax revenue from dance halls is extremely high.

### All Universities in Beiping to Resume Classes Today

### The Unequaled Cotton Production of Shaanxi Province (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent Hu Longchang, Xi’an News Agency

In the economy of Shaanxi Province, cotton production occupies a crucial position. The abundant cotton production of Shaanxi not only enriches the province's inherent economic capabilities, but also benefits the Longhai Railway—China's only east-west artery—and the counties and cities along its route, which were built upon cotton transport. When speaking of large-scale, high-quality cotton production, Shaanxi cotton is truly unrivaled domestically.

Generally speaking, Shaanxi Province has a high and dry geology, fertile soil, moderate temperatures, and appropriate rainfall. These superior natural conditions, combined with the promotion of improved cotton seeds by human effort, have led to today's achievements. According to statistics, from 1934 to 1939, the cotton field area in Shaanxi Province remained between 3 and 4 million mu, with ginned cotton production around 1 million dan. The war halved both the area and the yield of ginned cotton. Starting last year, through continuous efforts, the cotton field area has expanded to 2,370,000 mu, and the ginned cotton production has increased to 711,000 dan. This year is even more promising. According to the second estimation report from the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the cotton field area has expanded to 3 million mu, with an expected ginned cotton production of 880,000 dan, closely approaching the peak figures of the pre-war era.

Nearly all of Shaanxi's cotton production now consists of improved American cotton varieties. Among these improved varieties, the main ones are "Tuozimian" from the southern Shaanxi area and "Sizimian" from the Guanzhong area. The former accounts for 10% of the area, with 300,000 mu planted, while the latter accounts for 90%, with 2.7 million mu planted. These cotton varieties are characterized by their long, fine fibers, mostly over one inch, and their pure quality, making them suitable for spinning fine yarns of 32 counts or higher.

Shaanxi's main cotton-producing areas are four: the Jingwei area, the eastern Shaanxi area, the western Shaanxi area, and the central Shaanxi area. Shaanxi's natural environment for cotton cultivation is excellent in every aspect, except for water scarcity. The Jingwei area, benefiting from the appropriate irrigation of the Jing and Wei rivers, accounts for one-third of the province's total cotton production. This area includes Jingyang, Sanyuan, and Gaoling counties. The eastern Shaanxi area includes Weinan, Lintong, Huaxian, Hejin, Chaoyi, and Dali counties. The western Shaanxi area includes Xianyang and Xingping counties. The central Shaanxi area is concentrated around Xi'an, and its production is also considerable.

The reporter personally visited the cotton fields in the Jingwei irrigation area. Although 80% of the cotton had already been harvested, the cotton fields still stretched endlessly for thousands of acres. Here, due to the appropriate amount of water, the height of the cotton stalks and the density of the branches and leaves are just right, so the cotton bolls are both large and numerous. An average cotton plant can yield around twenty cotton bolls. The Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Office is now actively further improving the "Sizimian" variety, and the number of cotton bolls per plant has already exceeded thirty. They have given this further improved cotton variety a patriotic name, calling it "Jingzimian."

Speaking of Shaanxi's achievements in cotton production today, everyone praises two Mr. Lis for their contributions to cultivation. One is the late water conservancy expert, Mr. Li Yishe, who built a water gate in the Jingwei area to irrigate the cotton fields with the Jing and Wei rivers. What was once barren land has now become a lush green landscape. The other is Mr. Li Guozhen, the current director of the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute and the Xi'an branch of the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. He is known as the "Cotton Bodhisattva" by the cotton farmers of Shaanxi. After graduating from the agricultural science department of National Central University in 1930, he returned to Shaanxi with Li Yishe, where he was in charge of the provincial agricultural cotton experiment field, starting the promotion of "Tuozimian" and the organization of marketing cooperatives. From 1936, he studied cotton industry at agricultural science universities such as those in California for three years. After returning to Shaanxi, he continued to work hard for the increased production of cotton in his hometown. He has been engaged in cotton improvement work for fifteen years. Mr. Li's contributions to the history of cotton production improvement and promotion in Shaanxi Province are undeniable. Mr. Li, simple and honest, repeatedly explained to the reporter the common misconceptions in the cotton market, indiscriminately classifying the high-quality Shaanxi Xingyang cotton as Henan cotton. In fact, Henan is in western Henan, and transportation has long been cut off, so no cotton has been shipped out for a long time. He urged the reporter to correct this in writing at all costs.

### Siamese Soldiers Suddenly Launch Coup d'état, Prime Minister Captured, Marshal Phibun Assumes Power, United States, Britain, and China Adopt Neutral Stance

[Reuters, Bangkok, 9th] Marshal Phibun Songkhram, leading the Siamese army, launched an armed coup d'état this morning, having already seized control of the Siamese government. Phibun immediately issued a proclamation to the people, declaring that he would recall capable administrative officials to serve and that the nation's shortcomings would be swiftly rectified. Phibun particularly urged the Chinese residing near the borders to remain calm and avoid causing trouble, asking them and other citizens to continue living and working as usual. Troops under Phibun's command have already taken control of all transportation equipment and radio stations in Bangkok. The diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, and China in Bangkok were notified of the impending coup d'état one hour before its launch. The diplomatic representatives of the three countries have maintained a completely neutral attitude during the incident. Traffic in Bangkok had completely returned to normal by evening, but strategically important locations were blockaded, and the number of people gathering on the streets was greater than usual. The people held hopeful attitudes, but there was no state of panic. It appears that Marshal Phibun has reached an understanding with Marshal Apun Songkhram, the commander-in-chief of the Siamese army, with Apun remaining in his original post. Phibun met with opposition party leaders this afternoon. When issuing lenient statements of assuming power, Phibun instructed all government officials to continue serving as usual, so all government agencies continue to operate as usual, only with some additional guards stationed. It should be noted that the Siamese government was originally led by Luang Thamrong, and most cabinet members were members of the People's Party and anti-Japanese resistance fighters. Marshal Phibun was the Prime Minister of Thailand during the Japanese occupation and declared war on the Allied forces in 1942. After Japan's defeat in 1945, he was placed under surveillance and was to be charged as a war criminal. However, in early 1946, three months after Siam and Britain signed a peace treaty that year, the Bangkok High Court ordered his release. Political figures believe that today's coup d'état will not affect the Siamese royal family. As of now, no official statement has been made regarding this coup. The U.S. and Chinese embassies have both declined to comment. Unofficial British sources suggest that this coup is purely a matter of domestic politics, but all sides believe that the military government after the coup will last for some time, and Phibun is expected to announce the new cabinet lineup tonight.

[United Press, Bangkok, 9th] Siamese troops suddenly launched a coup d'état this morning, led by tanks, taking control of the country. Prime Minister Luang Thamrong was captured before the end of a dance party.

### Gu Weijun Reiterates Stance Against Outer Mongolia's Application to Join the UN, Soviet Representative Defends Outer Mongolia's Invasion

[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The Soviet Union stated in the Political Committee that Chinese troops invaded the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia in June of this year, and the Chinese representative engaged in a heated debate with the Soviet representative on the 8th.

Chinese representative Gu Weijun stated that this was completely false and that Soviet and Outer Mongolian armed forces had repeatedly crossed the Chinese border, invading Chinese territory and advancing to Baitashan, 100 li from the border. The Chinese government has lodged a strong protest with the Soviet and Mongolian governments, but has not yet received a reply. Gu opposed Soviet representative Gromyko's claim that Baitashan belonged to Outer Mongolian territory. It is said that Gromyko's statement was based on an old map from the Tsarist era, drawn in 1907 after Russia and Japan secretly divided their spheres of influence in Manchuria and Mongolia. Gu made the above remarks during the Political Committee's discussion on whether to request the Security Council to reconsider the rejection of the application of ten countries to join the UN. Gu stated that he would not allow Outer Mongolia to participate unless the country could change its policies and show a desire for peace.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 8th] Ambassador Gu Weijun declared in the UN Political Committee today that the Chinese delegation supports the recommendation that the Security Council not use its veto power in matters of membership application.

### Balkan Committee to Go to Greece to Execute Mission

[Reuters, Lake Success, 8th] Since the UN's eleven-member Balkan Committee was approved for establishment, the United States has appointed former ambassador to Belgium and minister to Luxembourg, Kirk, as its representative, and China, Mexico, and other countries have also appointed their representatives. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting in Athens on the 21st of this month and arrive in Thessaloniki on the 24th to set up its headquarters to carry out the mission of supervising peace in the Balkans.

### "Little Assembly" Plan Being Drafted in Political Committee

[United Press, New York, 8th] Disregarding the opposition of the Soviet bloc, the UN Political Committee has established a subcommittee to draft a "Little Assembly" plan. If the Soviet Union withdraws from the United Nations, it is questionable whether this world organization will collapse. However, it is widely believed that the Soviet Union will not take this action. However, the "Little Assembly" proposal is likely to gain a majority vote in the General Assembly. The "Little Assembly" plan currently being drafted by the Political Committee is more moderate than the American proposal, but although this Little Assembly has no legislative power and cannot make any decisions, it will have a great influence on world opinion.

### Eleanor Roosevelt Criticizes Soviet Foreign Policy

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th, United Press] In her "My Day" column, Eleanor Roosevelt criticized Soviet foreign policy, denouncing the Communist Party for fostering the idea that war is inevitable. In fact, the country that makes people believe that the actions of other countries will inevitably lead to war is the Soviet Union. I do not believe that the American people want war, but it is difficult to make the Soviet Union understand this point.

### McCormick to Arrive in Shanghai

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] Mr. and Mrs. McCormick, publishers of the Chicago Tribune, arrived here from Osaka on the 9th and will leave for Seoul on the morning of the 10th, departing for Shanghai on the morning of the 13th.

### UN General Assembly Expected to End This Month, Committees Intensify Work, US and Soviet Union Seek Compromise on Holy Land Issue

[Reuters, Lake Success, 9th] The chairman of the UN Palestine Committee, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, stated that he would intensify the committee's work to finalize a resolution on the Palestine issue by the weekend. According to Evatt, he will convene a plenary session of the 57 member states on Tuesday morning and intends to continue the meetings without interruption until the final decision is made.

UN General Assembly President Aranha has sent a letter to the chairmen of each committee, asking them to try to complete their work within seven days. He suggested starting the meetings half an hour earlier each day and, if necessary, holding meetings at night.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 8th] The small group formed by the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, and Guatemala to seek a compromise on the proposals for implementing the plan to divide Palestine made by the United States and the Soviet Union had a long discussion today, but made little progress.

The Soviet representative promised to consider the proposal put forward by the Canadian representative, namely, that the General Assembly should elect a committee to implement the partition plan, but be responsible to the Security Council. Relevant parties believe that at this stage, it is not yet possible to predict whether the United States and the Soviet Union will accept this compromise proposal, because the US position is that the General Assembly rather than the Security Council should be responsible for the control of Palestine during the transition period. Canadian representative Pearson raised three major questions in the small group meeting: whether the United States and the Soviet Union can agree on the date of termination of the trusteeship; whether Britain and the Soviet Union can agree to the appointment of a committee by the General Assembly; and who will be responsible for local security before the establishment of an independent Palestinian state after the termination of the trusteeship. The representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union failed to express concrete opinions on these three key points at the meeting.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 8th] It is learned that the police in Berchtesgaden, at the request of the denazification court, have transferred Lieutenant General Meisel, who participated in the assassination of Field Marshal Rommel, the former commander of the German Africa Corps, by secret order of Hitler, to the court for trial. Although Meisel himself denied the matter, his documents have been submitted to the prosecutor for review.

### Truth of Hitler's Assassination of Roosevelt Revealed by Court

Rommel died on October 14, 1944. After being wounded by American aircraft fire while supervising the war on the Western Front, his injuries had gradually recovered. Hitler granted him an estate and told him that if he committed suicide, he would receive a state funeral and his family would be spared punishment. Otherwise, he would be killed, because Hitler believed that Rommel was involved in the attempt to assassinate Hitler with a bomb in July 1940 and that Rommel's reputation was too high, which would be detrimental to him. According to Rommel's wife, Rommel was gradually recovering from his injuries at his home near Ulm. Meisel and Hitler's adjutant, General Burgdorf, suddenly visited Rommel's residence on October 14. After meeting with Rommel, they told Rommel's wife that Hitler had ordered Rommel to die within fifteen minutes and that they had brought poison, which would kill him three seconds after being taken. Rommel then left with Meisel and the others in the same car. Soon after, Rommel's wife received a telephone

announcement that her husband's body had been sent to the Ulm Hospital. After his death, Hitler ordered a state funeral for Rommel.

### Good Impression of Harriman Report in France

[Reuters, Paris, 8th] The French government has a good impression of the Harriman Committee's report, but is naturally disappointed that the amount of aid is less than that recommended at the Paris Conference. Generally speaking, it feels that this report has fully demonstrated its understanding of the European economic situation.

### Burmese Ambassador Arrives in US to Assume Post

[United Press, New York, 9th] The first Burmese ambassador to the United States, U Soe Nyun, arrived in New York from Calcutta on the 9th.

### Japanese Right-Wing Groups Attempt to Revive, Most Participants are Veterans

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Right-wing groups in Japan, which had disappeared after the surrender, are secretly

### Tone of the Street Corner Replaces Diplomatic Understanding, Anecdotes from the Second UN General Assembly

[Central News Agency, New York Dispatch] At the historical international political conference, in addition to the fact that the representatives of various countries strive for truth, accuracy, and solid evidence in their speeches, theoretically and factually, they also pay special attention to their personal attitude when speaking, doing their best to be courteous, gentle, and elegant. It is better to be graceful and firm, with a smile hiding a knife, rather than being direct and blunt, losing etiquette and making a fool of oneself. Anyone with a little diplomatic experience can have such a graceful demeanor.

The situation at this second UN General Assembly broke all the conventions of past international conferences. Not only was it not gentle and elegant, but there was also verbal sparring. Some representatives even used vulgar terms from the streets in the conference hall to attack the speakers of the other side. On October 7, there was an unprecedented chaotic scene at the meeting of the Political and Security Committee discussing the Greek issue. Everyone scrambled to speak out of order, contradicting each other. Some pointed and shouted, others pounded the table, and some spoke again and again without the chairman's permission. In the Social, Human Rights, and Cultural Committee, some even shouted loudly, "The chairman cannot maintain order in the meeting, we should change the chairman."

The central figure in the chaotic situation in the Political and Security Committee was the Yugoslav representative, Bebler, a so-called revolutionary youth with black hair, intense emotions, and a beautiful appearance. He had a brilliant war record, and he distinguished himself during the Spanish Civil War and the Yugoslav resistance against the German army. He is currently the Secretary of the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a capable talent of General Tito and Deputy Secretary of State Kardelj. He cannot restrain his emotions and is easily triggered. In the conference hall, he specializes in opposing Belgian representative Spaak, British representative McNair, and Luxembourg representative Beck. Spaak is known for his intelligence, agility, and quick thinking. McNair is courteous and good at rhetoric. Beck has gray hair and a gentlemanly demeanor. However, serving as the chairman of a subcommittee of the General Assembly is a thankless task.

Bebler has no shortage of allies. His most powerful helpers are the Soviet Union's chief representative, Vyshinsky, and Ukraine's representative, Manuilsky. Therefore, an invisible division into opposing factions has formed in the conference hall.

First, the representatives of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia insisted that the incident of the American propaganda "brewing war" must be continued to be discussed in the conference hall. When Bebler spoke, he used many rude terms such as "traitor", "executioner", and "rumormonger". Beck, as the chairman of the subcommittee, said: "In this conference hall, I cannot allow anyone to use such rude terms to insult the work of the United Nations and the members of the United Nations." Bebler immediately retorted, "If the chairman does not allow it, then I will use these terms without seeking the chairman's permission."

Finally, the chairman interrupted the Albanian representative's speech because he was disrupting the order of the conference hall. The Albanian representative said angrily: "I just want to explain my position." Before Chairman Beck could answer, Bebler loudly said: "I object to the chairman's rules of procedure and the order of the conference hall."

Beck said: "I ask the Yugoslav representative to repeat the sentence attacking me just now."

Bebler really repeated it again and said: "I think the chairman should not interrupt the Albanian representative before he finishes speaking."

Beck said: "The Albanian representative is just repeating the opinions that he has already stated before. I cannot accept Mr. Bebler's criticism." At this time, Vyshinsky immediately stood up to speak for Bebler: "The chairman should give the Albanian representative a chance to finish his speech."

The chairman had to ask all the attending representatives to vote on whether to agree with the criticism of the chairman by the Yugoslav or Soviet representative.

McNair disagreed with the opinions of the Yugoslav and Soviet representatives. He said: "It is best to vote. It is very important that all representatives respect the chairman. More importantly, if we cannot accept the chairman's rules of procedure, then we don't have to come to participate in the discussion of world affairs at all. Chairman, we are very grateful to you because you have handled it very appropriately."

As a result of the vote, everyone unanimously supported Beck, and no one opposed him. They were speechless.

Then, Chairman Beck asked the Albanian representative what he wanted to say. He replied: "I have not prepared to say anything in advance, and I have nothing to add at this moment."

A disturbance was quelled.

At the third subcommittee meeting on October 7, the issue of whether the case of Vyshinsky's proposal to the General Assembly on September 18, that the American "war-mongers and fascist propaganda" should be dealt with, should be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion and submitted to the International Conference on Freedom of the Press for evaluation, was voted down by thirty-three votes to seven, but the order of the meeting was greatly disrupted.

When everyone was arguing without getting anywhere, Dr. Zhang Pengchun pointed out that what we are discussing now is whether we should submit this "propaganda" issue to the General Assembly for discussion (To recommend or not to recommend). It is not necessary to discuss the issue itself in this meeting. British representative Davies also agreed. Who knew that this immediately led to another argument from the Yugoslav representative, Metz, who said: "To be or not to be is a famous quote from Shakespeare. We are now meeting at the United Nations, not taking an English class, so there is no need to use this famous quote." In the eyes of the general audience, this was clearly quibbling and arguing for no reason.

In the end, the order was very chaotic. The representative of Argentina pounded the table and said: "This is too outrageous...too chaotic. We should change the chairman."

A group of experienced diplomats and journalists who have attended many international conferences believe that the blatant and rude terms used by Eastern European countries are unprecedented in international history, and they also believe that these new revolutionaries do not emphasize reason, but emphasize emotion. Even very rational remarks must be expressed in a loud voice and with forceful fists.

Some people said humorously: He walked into the conference room of the UN General Assembly, thinking that he had mistakenly walked into a teahouse. Some said: The current site of the UN General Assembly is at "Lake Success", but when you arrive at the conference hall, you can neither see the "lake" nor find "success."

### The Weather is Cold and the Year-End is Near, Endless Difficult Problems, People on Tianmu Road Anxious, District Representatives Hold Congress, Request Postponement of House Demolitions

After the City Council passed the Tianmu Road widening and house demolition issue, to be implemented in phases within six months, the Bureau of Public Works has decided to start construction on the 15th of this month. District residents in the North Railway Station area, in order to request the authorities to postpone the implementation, specially convened a district residents' congress at the North District National School on Kangle Road at 10 a.m. yesterday to discuss solutions. First, Chairman Yu Bingwen reported the significance of the meeting. Then, Li Muyun, a 71-year-old resident representative of Tianmu Road, made a passionate speech, saying: Residents are facing demolition in the midst of a severe housing shortage, and are very anxious. With the year-end approaching, problems such as children losing their schooling, factories settling accounts, and workers being laid off and unemployed are all very worrying. Subsequently, district representatives expressed their opinions one after another. Finally, it was decided to petition the City Council, the Municipal Government, and relevant sectors in the name of the District Residents' Congress, earnestly requesting a postponement of six months, to implement phased house demolition and relocation after April 15 next year, and requesting the cancellation of the Bureau of Public Works' mandatory execution order of November 15. Also yesterday, residents along Tianmu Road posted slogans such as: "A house requires a gold bar, we don't even have an iron bar", "Today we live in peace and work, tomorrow we will be displaced", "The mayor is our parent official, how can parents sit idly by and let their children freeze and starve", and so on.

### Light Bulbs Temporarily Allowed to be Imported, Guild Requests Correction, Hu Xiyuan Expresses Opinions

Yesterday, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance transferred a regulation from the Ministry of Economic Affairs ordering the Jianghai Customs to temporarily allow the import of light bulbs of 100 volts to 120 volts and 210 volts to 230 volts. According to Hu Xiyuan, chairman of the Electrical Equipment Industry Association of the Third District, the above-mentioned argon bulbs can all be manufactured by domestic companies, and the combined production volume can exceed 50,000 units per day, which is sufficient to supply domestic use. Moreover, with the current practice of saving electricity everywhere, there is already a surplus of argon bulbs. Once foreign goods are allowed to be imported again, the impact on sales will be even greater. The government should temporarily allow the import of foreign argon bulbs of 500 volts or more, which would be more reasonable. The guild has made reasonable representations to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, requesting correction.

### National Assembly Candidate Chen Peide Announces Political Platform

[Our Report] Senator Chen Peide (pictured) is running for the National Assembly. Yesterday, he issued the following statement outlining his political platform: He has always been involved in the labor movement, coming from the people. If given the opportunity, he wishes to represent the people in urging the government to achieve the following: Implement democratic politics, ensuring all political measures aim to enhance the welfare of the people. Construct a greater Shanghai, revitalize social enterprises, ensuring all Shanghai citizens can live and work in peace. Eliminate social vices, eradicate ignorance, eliminate poverty and filth, and promote thrift.

Encourage production, stabilize prices, and ensure people's livelihoods. Mr. Chen is currently 55 years old, a graduate of Jiangnan College.

He courageously led the factory workers in a strike as a warning, ultimately forcing the factory to comply and pay national taxes. During the War of Resistance, he served as a director of the first session of the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement and as a director of the National Workers' Anti-Enemy Support Association. After the victory, he served as a reorganization committee member and head of the propaganda section of the Shanghai General Labor Union and is currently a standing committee member of the 29th District Party Headquarters and a Shanghai City Senator.

### Yizhong Cigarette Factory Cured Tobacco Department Labor Dispute Temporarily Concludes

Workers at the British-owned Yizhong Cigarette Factory were dissatisfied because the factory calculated wages based on a six-day week, uniformly discounting them by 25%. They made two demands to the company: Workers should be paid in full for days worked, with days off calculated at a 75% rate. Wages should be paid for Sundays in accordance with the Factory Act. The company did not accept these conditions, and the factory's labor union directly petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. The bureau convened representatives from both labor and management some days ago for negotiations, which failed to reach an agreement, and further mediation is scheduled for the coming days. Furthermore, the workers in the cured tobacco department of the factory previously demanded the factory reinstate dismissed workers and establish a workers' welfare association, leading to friction. The workers collectively slept in the factory workshop as a protest. Now, after persuasion by officials from the Social Affairs Bureau, the workers have accepted the advice and left the factory. The Social Affairs Bureau has notified the factory to resume work first, and all issues will be mediated in the coming days.

The union has also scheduled a meeting of the board of directors this morning to actively discuss the matter. In the afternoon, the first meeting of the New Headquarters Construction Committee and the Construction Fund Management Committee will be held.

### Clarify Suspicion, Why Take Your Own Life? Guanghua University Student's Suicide Note Regrets Two Instances of Confusion

[Our Report] Around 4:00 PM on the 8th, a young man arrived at the Jinshan Hotel on Hankou Road, booked room 506 under the pseudonym Zhang Zhengming. At 7:00 PM, he called the tea server and asked him to buy food and rice. After eating, he closed the door and went to sleep. Around 10:00 AM the next morning, the room's call bell rang. The early shift tea server, Zhang Zhiqing, went in to inquire. The young man replied that nothing was wrong and said he still wanted to sleep. By noon, there was no movement in the room, and the tea server became suspicious. He entered the room and saw the young man lying on the bed, his face pale, his expression vague, not saying a word. Realizing something was wrong, he urgently reported to the front desk and called an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. He died en route.

(Picture: Wan Jiasan, who committed suicide)

Stolen Suit, Suspected Expulsion

After the fact, the Jinshan Hotel reported the situation to the Old Gate Police Branch. Chief Jiang ordered officer Zhang Kuidong to rush to investigate. It was learned that the deceased's real name was Wan Jiasan, a second-year student in the economics department of Guanghua University, a native of Suzhou, 23 years old. He had taken sleeping pills due to minor stimulation and committed suicide. A search of the room revealed an empty bottle of American-made sleeping pills in his bag, along with five suicide notes addressed to Mayor Wu, Director Yu, his father Wan Mengquan, his uncle Wang Jianying, and classmate Zhu Zhong. The suicide notes revealed that his father was a section chief in the Jiangxi Postal Administration, and his uncle Wang Jianying lived at 36 Shenyuli, Tiantong Road in this city. The investigating police officers summoned Wang Jianying to inquire about Wan's recent situation. Wang stated that recently, a classmate at school had a suit stolen, along with 480,000 yuan in legal tender. After the director of student affairs conducted a room-by-room inspection in the dormitory, a bottle of cod liver oil pills was found near Wan, leading to suspicions that he was the thief. Later, Wang received a notice from the school stating that Wan was suffering from acute orchitis and requesting someone to go to him (Wan's Shanghai address was Wang's residence). Wang rushed over immediately and learned that Wan was not sick but had been accused of theft and ordered to withdraw from school. Wan must have been angered by this and resorted to such a measure, taking poison to end his life, and so on. The suicide notes are recorded below:

Letter to the Mayor, Detailed Account

Letter to Mayor Wu: The gist of the letter is: "I am a student at Guanghua University named Wan Jiasan, 23 years old, from Suzhou. I have done two foolish things in the past. Because of this, I am forced to die, but I am being wronged. So, in order to be cleared after death, I am daring to write to the mayor, please investigate this incident thoroughly. I will now write down the process: Last semester, I mistakenly wore a khaki American military pants belonging to a classmate named Liu. This semester, because the school's food was not good, I secretly took a bottle of vitamins belonging to a classmate and was discovered. Therefore, this time, when the school's classmates had a suit and cash stolen, they forced me to admit that I was the thief and forced me to write a letter of compensation. Then why did I write that letter of compensation? Because I already had these two stains, who would believe me even if I explained it repeatedly? Moreover, at that time, the classmates were all convinced that I was a thief, and the situation was so unfavorable to me. Furthermore, Director Chen, Wen Lihu, and classmate Yang Baoqiu threatened me with police beatings. I was afraid that if it really blew up, I would definitely suffer immediate losses and be humiliated by my classmates. If it was published in the newspaper, my reputation would definitely be affected first, and my father would be angered to death. So I gritted my teeth and wrote that letter of compensation, but at that time, I did say that I could pay compensation, but I did not admit to stealing the suit and cash.

Please Order a Thorough Investigation

Now the school thinks I am a big thief and orders me to drop out. How can I face people in the future? How can I have the face to go home? So I decided to commit suicide, but this is not to avoid punishment, but because I feel that it is too difficult to clarify. Therefore, I am submitting a petition to Your Excellency, please order a thorough investigation of this case and find out the truth, so that I can die in peace. I think that with the Shanghai detective force, I will definitely find out who stole this suit and cash? If I know after death, I will be grateful." (Omitted below)

Letter to Director Yu: Briefly stated: "After my death, I hope the police will use the latest scientific methods to thoroughly investigate who stole the suit and cash from our school." (Omitted below)

Letter to Father: "Because of a moment of foolishness, I did two foolish things, which led to today's result. Uncle will tell you all the details."

Letter to Uncle and Aunt: "You two treat me so well, just like your own son, which makes the younger generation extremely grateful. This dishonorable thing happened, and I really have no face to see people."

Letter to Classmate Zhu Zhong: "I am so sorry for bothering you all night last night. In the future, when the police investigate, the truth will definitely come out. I died cleanly. If I know after death, I will be grateful to you."

### Young Police Officers Were Insulted; Gained Much Experience During Internship; Will Not Be Polite When Officially On Duty

[Our Report] The first batch of 40 young police officers in this city received more than three weeks of special training at the Caohejing Municipal Children's Education and Training Center. Once all the uniforms are prepared, they will officially begin appearing on the streets to perform their duties today and tomorrow. The work undertaken by these young police officers is threefold: To persuade frugality in various restaurants. To organize traffic and maintain order at tram and bus stops. To inspect unlicensed dance halls. (This task will be performed in coordination with female police officers selected from the Girl Scouts after they have completed their training.)

Yesterday, Zhou Zuwang, the director of the Children's Education and Training Center, invited newspaper reporters to visit Caohejing. In order to know how the young police officers' training was progressing, at the request of the reporters, he first asked them to do a simulation. During lunch, the reporters pretended to be restaurant patrons, and a team of young police officers ran forward to conduct inspections. Assuming that the food used had violated the regulations on frugality for banquets, the leader of the young police officers politely asked who the host of the table was and explained to the host that the dishes had exceeded the regulations, and set out the reasons for vigorously promoting frugality, persuading them not to violate the regulations again in the future. The host might have brushed them off or thought that they had plenty of money and it was none of their business. The other guests at the table also helped to speak, but the young police officers still politely explained one by one, persuading them to be frugal, deeply moving those who received the advice.

This kind of work of persuading frugality at banquets is not easy to please. During the training period, batches of young police officers also went out to various major restaurants to practice. Many diners had stubborn attitudes. One diner took a contemptuous attitude and joked: "Little brother, you haven't even eaten this kind of dish before!" One diner pointed to foreign wine as domestic wine, and because the police officer was young and didn't understand, he was confused. It was in the internship that the young police officers gained a lot of experience. In the future, when they officially perform their duties, if diners deliberately insult them, they will immediately report to the police station for investigation.

The uniforms of the young police officers are similar to the uniforms of the US Navy, except that the hats are the same as the current police officers. The uniforms are made of Melton wool, with white belts, black leather shoes, and white shoe covers. The left collar has the team number, and the right collar has the letters YP (Young Man Police). There are two police pigeons under the collar. The left arm has the Young Police Officer armband, and there is a police whistle ribbon across the chest, which is very heroic.

This group of fifteen or sixteen-year-old youths were mostly street urchins and needy children who lacked food and clothing in the past. After education and training, they will appear in front of you today with a new look that will surprise you. With a loyal attitude, they will perform their duties for the country. (The attached picture shows young police officers performing an inspection while reporters are eating.)

### Request to Waive Prohibition on Teaching Arts; 22 Training Institutes; Four Reasons

[Our Report] Twenty-two dance arts training institutes in this city recently believed that the authorities, after banning the business of dance halls on a regular basis, also decided to prohibit the teaching of dancing, believing that this move was a case of "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer." Therefore, it was decided that five representatives would be dispatched to the City Council, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Government this morning to petition for the revocation of the order. The reasons they held are as follows: "Dance arts training institutes do not sell tea or tickets, which is not contrary to the original purpose of frugality. The Department of Physical Education of the National Central University of Nanjing has recently adopted books published by dance arts training institutes as teaching materials. In diplomatic social occasions, whether international or private, if one does not know dancing at all, one will inevitably be ridiculed. Dance arts training institutes have been in Shanghai for more than 20 years, and there are thousands of people who directly or indirectly rely on teaching dance for a living."

### Forcibly Married Woman Cannot Live in Poverty; Meets Dance Partner and Becomes Pregnant; Dance Hostess Sued

[Our Report] Zhou Yaqin, a 24-year-old dance hostess at the MGM Dance Hall, was betrothed to a man from Haimen by her parents' order and the matchmaker's word. Zhou did not want to marry because the Huang family was poor and Huang himself was two years younger than Zhou. Huang had no choice but to bring more than ten strong men together on July 14 last year, kidnap Zhou, and force her to marry. Two months after the marriage, Zhou came to Shanghai on September 28 because she disliked the Huang family's poor circumstances. She lived in her mother's home on Xiamen Road and soon learned dance arts, selling her dances at MGM. She met dance partner Zhang Yousheng, and the two fell in love. Before long, they had a relationship, and soon she became pregnant. After Huang Guoming found out about this in Shanghai, he reported it to the Old Gate Police Station, which brought Zhou into custody and transferred her to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. Zhou directly admitted to the adultery. The District Prosecutor's Office prosecuted her for the crime of adultery and sent her to the District Court. The case is scheduled to be heard on the 14th of this month.

### Cha Liangzhu's Case, District Court Voluntarily Recuses Itself

[Our Report] Cha Liangzhu, the head of the Shanghai Office of the Zhangmin Road Engineering Office, took advantage of his position this spring to collude with merchants to sell more than 7,000 jin of bamboo steel purchased by the road for more than 100,000 yuan at a reduced price, from which he profited. After the incident, Yu Dawei, Minister of Communications, sent a special commissioner together with the Jinghu Road Police Department to rush to his residence at 27 Hongye New Village, Xiangyang Road, on the morning of the 26th of last month, and arrested him. He was immediately sent to the District Prosecutor's Office. After one interrogation, he was allowed to be released on bail. It is learned that the Control Yuan and the Ministry of Communications attach great importance to this case and have decided to investigate it strictly according to law. However, it is heard that Cha is a cousin of the Chief Judge of the District Court of this city, so the District Court voluntarily recused itself from the case and will transfer jurisdiction according to law, or the case will be investigated and handled by the Wuxian District Court.

### Printing Dictionaries, Infringing Rights, Jingwen Makes Three Demands

If this trend continues, it will cause great harm to those who are truly dedicated to cultural work."

As a result, an agreement was reached with three gold bars and 100 million yuan in cash, and Chen was released. The District Court once held a hearing on the case. In addition to Xingkong and Xingxian being detained for the crime of communicating with bandits, it also sent a letter to Zheng Shaoquan, commander of the Third Security District of Zhejiang, to investigate the beginning and end of the case. It is learned that Commander Zheng has sent a detailed account to the District Court, and at the same time, the two detained monks, Xingkong and Xingxian, specially filed a request to be released on bail because they were not accustomed to prison life. Judge Shao Renjie, who is hearing the case, has decided to hold a second hearing within this week based on the request.

### Aging Dance Hostess Injures Herself; Mistaken for Poisoning After Borrowing Wine to Drown Sorrows

Zhu Meili, a dance hostess at the Dahu Dance Hall, became mentally disturbed the night before last due to excessive drinking. Her dance hostesses mistakenly thought she was poisoned and accompanied her to the Xincheng Police Branch under their jurisdiction. Wang Ji, the duty inspector of the Judicial Section, sent her to Hongren Hospital. The diagnosis revealed that she was not poisoned, but was caused by excessive drinking and nerve stimulation. After taking a tranquilizer, she regained her senses. Inspector Wang asked her about the incident. According to Ms. Zhu, she is now 32 years old. As her appearance fades and fewer dance partners come, her recent dance income is only 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, which is not enough to live on. Moreover, the dance ban is imminent, and she thinks that her future is bleak, and she is depressed all day long. The night before last, she went out for dinner with her former boyfriend. Seeing her boyfriend's intimacy with his fiancée, she could not help but feel sorry for her own life. She wanted to borrow wine to drown her sorrows, but who knew that the wine entered her sorrowful intestines, adding to her sadness. Therefore, the wine surged to her head, she lost her mind and got drunk. After Inspector Wang comforted her, he sent a police officer to take her home.

### Home for Working Women, YWCA Dormitory: Full of Warmth and Joy

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] On the Yuanmingyuan Road, lined with tall buildings, near the end of Suzhou Creek, stands a faded red brick three-story building. Surrounded by magnificent architecture, it looks rather humble. However, within its old walls, it is full of youthful vitality, overflowing with warmth and joy, songs and laughter. This small building is the famous Home for Working Women, the Shanghai YWCA dormitory.

Living in this dormitory are forty-four single professional women who are far from their families. They come from all over the country, mostly between the ages of twenty and thirty, with at least a high school education. Their professions are mainly civil servants, bank clerks, postal workers, and nurses, teachers, but there are also outstanding individuals who are university professors or female architects.

Like a Harmonious Large Family

Because they have similar intellectual levels and are all single women far from their families, although they come from different cities or villages with different customs and habits, and each engages in different occupations, even with absolutely different personalities, they easily understand each other and easily develop close friendships. Every evening, they successively return from work. Just seeing the kind smiles of their companions and many caring inquiries makes them feel warm comfort. Every dinner time, girls from different rooms gather in a dining room, and there is unconstrained talk and laughter on each table, just like a harmonious large family. In the evening, some read, some play the piano, some sing. The sound of the piano and songs are accompanied by light laughter. These songs and laughter dilute their heavy homesickness. They return to the innocent golden age of girls. After a bell rings, everyone falls silent, preparing to go to sleep, until the wake-up bell the next morning startles them from their sweet dreams. Everyone greets each other, saying, "Good morning!" "Morning!" While busily washing and dressing, they each begin a day's work. After nine o'clock every morning, the dormitory is once again in an empty mood.

Never Any Unpleasant Incidents

The management of the dormitory is quite strict. Male guests can only go as far as the reception room. Lights are to be turned off at 10:30 every night, and the front door will be locked. Unless the young ladies have special matters to declare in advance, otherwise they will be turned away. Although this is inconvenient for some young ladies who are in love, they all know how to abide by the rules. According to Ms. Hua, the officer in charge of management, no unpleasant incidents have ever occurred in the dormitory.

The monthly dormitory fee, including breakfast and dinner, is only 600,000 yuan this month, which can be said to be very economical for working-class ladies. If the payday is not far away, and money is tight for the time being, it can be accommodated for a few days. Therefore, most of the young ladies never leave after moving in, unless they get married, go abroad, or change jobs. The proportion of people who get married is very small. From the time the dormitory opened in March last year to the present, in more than a year, only four or five young ladies have left due to marriage.

Hoping to Expand the Scope of the Dormitory

Many working women aspire to this "large family" dormitory, but cannot be accommodated due to limited places. Up to now, more than a hundred people have registered with the YWCA. Every day, several girls from afar come to visit the dormitory officer, telling of their plight of having no home to go to. The YWCA now only hopes to use the power of society to expand the scope of the dormitory, and to accommodate as many sisters as possible who are serving society away from their hometowns, allowing them to find rest and warmth in simple and quiet residences.

### Another Beautiful Corpse in Fuzhou: A Bride Commits Suicide by Drowning Three Days After Marriage

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Fuzhou, 6th] A graduate of Wenshan Girls' High School in Fuzhou, 24 years old, named 　　　, is a native of Fuzhou. Her mother died early, and her father is serving in the military in Guangxi. She lived with her aunt since childhood. In August of this year, her aunt acted as a matchmaker and arranged for her to be engaged to Li Hongchi, a merchant from Songchun at No. 48 Yanping Road in this city. Li is 28 years old, does business in Shanghai, and has a wealthy family. His wife died by suicide by jumping into the sea in April of this year due to some reason. After becoming engaged to Miss Zheng, he was eager to marry her. With the consent of both parents, the wedding was held in Fuzhou on October 28. On the second night of the marriage, the bride suddenly cried out in her dream, frightening the groom, saying: She dreamed of a terrifying woman with disheveled hair, sitting sadly on the edge of the bed, and told the groom the woman's clothing and condition in the dream. The next morning, the groom showed her the deceased's photo. Miss Zheng said: It was indeed like her, but since she believed in Christ, she didn't take it to heart. Li was afraid of being haunted by ghosts, so he enshrined his ex-wife's portrait in the room. On the first of this month, the woman returned to Ningde to visit her 96-year-old grandmother at her mother's home. At about 7 o'clock that evening, she brought two boxes of Western-style pastries and returned to her husband's house alone. Unexpectedly, she suddenly felt uneasy on the way, and wandered along the roadside in Wangzhuang. Because her clothing was beautiful, she was seen by a nearby farmer, who suspected her and asked, "Why don't you go home?" The woman ignored her. After that, no one knew where the woman went.

After his wife returned to Ningde, the husband waited until the next day and did not see her return, so he sent someone to inquire at his wife's home. They returned and said that the woman had already gone out. Her husband inquired everywhere, but found no trace of her. At first, he suspected that the woman had eloped. After a day passed, her husband found one of the leather shoes she was wearing under the Twelve Bridges near Wangzhuang, so he determined that the woman must have committed suicide by drowning. He hired workers to salvage the body, but after two days, he still found nothing. Until yesterday morning, the corpse finally floated up and was discovered by the villagers, who fished it out and notified her husband to collect and bury it. As for the gold chain, gold ring, gold bracelet and other ornaments worn on the woman's body, her husband gave them to the villagers as a reward. (Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu)

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Tianshui, 5th] Ye Mudao, a convalescing soldier from the 73rd Rear Hospital, was ordered to transfer to Tianshui Hospital on October 29.

The soldier fought for the country and shed blood to become disabled. This time he suffered this torture, and had no way to appeal for injustice. He believed that the insult to the veterans was a small matter, but affecting the morale of the front line and hindering the suppression of the rebellion and national policy were major matters. He appealed to people from all walks of life to lend their support.

[Guoguang News Agency] In a friendly football match, Qingbai and White Eagles clashed at Yiyuan Stadium at 3:00 PM yesterday. However, due to the threat of rain, only a thousand fans attended, and the atmosphere was not as lively as desired. Qingbai fielded a Qingbai-White lineup, while the White Eagles had a balanced attack and defense. As a result, the White Eagles narrowly defeated Qingbai with a score of 3-2. The lineups were as follows: Ivanov White Eagles Xu Erzige Grifis Olov W Pantoson Ef Kui C Edward Laqin Wang Edward Novy Fu En Milan Upper.

Qin Biga Qingbai Zhang Fenggang Zhou Yongfang Upper Wu Kaimin Down Zhang Renxi Wu Kaimin Upper Wu Jialu Xue Peiran Down Ha Zengming Down Gui Qing Upper Luo Shoufu Gao Xiuqing Jin Lusheng Jiang Qing.

At 3:10 PM, referee He Chunhui blew the whistle to start the game. Both sides lined up, and the White Eagles attacked first. Qingbai defended with all their might, without making any mistakes. At 5 minutes, Edward committed a foul, and Wu Kaimin committed a foul and was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty. Pantoson took the penalty but missed. Fu En fouled again on the right, and Salaqin broke through in the center, hitting the bullseye in the crowd. The White Eagles took the lead with a score of 1-0. Qingbai launched a counterattack with all its strength, creating a melee. At 19 minutes, Xiao Luo, Lusheng, and Xiuqing advanced side by side, penetrating deep into the enemy camp. Xiao Luo passed to the center, and Xiuqing powerfully shot the ball into the back of the net before Ivanov could save it, tying the score at 1-1. However, four minutes before the end of the first half, the foreign soldiers became active again, and Milan scored a single-handedly, giving the White Eagles a 2-1 advantage in the first half.

After the break, both sides changed formations and fielded fresh troops. Qingbai took the offensive first, but the foreign soldiers were fierce and unable to advance, resulting in a stalemate. At 7 minutes, Fu En advanced rapidly on the right and crossed from the baseline. Qin Biga rushed out to rescue, but foreign general Salaqin arrived first, and the ball bounced off Biga's foot and into the net. The foreign troops gained another goal, making the score 3-1. Two minutes later, Qingbai committed a fierce foul in front of the enemy goal. Gao Xiuqing made two attempts but failed to score. At 19 minutes, Ha Zengming hooked the ball in from the left corner, and Xiuqing shot powerfully, breaking through the net. The score was 2-3, with only one goal difference. Qingbai's morale was greatly boosted, and they were planning to recover lost ground, but the closing whistle sounded, and the White Eagles narrowly defeated Qingbai with a score of 3-2.

### To Prevent Price Fluctuations, Authorities Plan to Expand the Scope of Rationing

After the news that the United States has not yet made a concrete decision on loans to China, those who rely on foreign aid feel greatly disappointed, and speculators take the opportunity to absorb goods in the market. In addition, the long-standing tight money supply gives them good opportunities for activities, resulting in price stability that has lasted for a considerable period of time, and price movements are showing signs of activity again. The relevant authorities are paying close attention to this. It is reported that after Mayor Wu returns to work after his leave, he will resume holding economic inspection meetings within a few days. The Economic Section of the Police Department has decided to carry out investigations in order to prevent the spread of rising prices. It will investigate whether there are any acts of manipulation and deliberate price increases in various markets. Because at this time of price stability and supply-demand balance, there should be no more rising prices! If there are fluctuations, it is clear that someone is causing trouble, so it is decided to strictly crack down on them. In particular, the black market for gold and banknotes must be completely eliminated to eradicate this bad phenomenon. At the same time, the relevant authorities have decided to implement the rationing of briquettes, cloth, sugar, and cooking oil as scheduled. They are also planning to expand the scope of rationing to reduce the burden on civil servants and citizens.

Farmers Bank Releases Agricultural Loans for the First Half of the Year

According to the Farmers Bank, the agricultural loans issued by the bank in the first half of this year have reached 206.5 billion yuan. Among them, agricultural production loans are the most, accounting for more than 57%, about 119 billion yuan. The second is agricultural product transportation and marketing loans, accounting for slightly less than 17%, and rural sideline business loans are the second, accounting for slightly more than 9%. Farmland water conservancy loans accounted for slightly more than 8%, emergency loans for the recovered areas accounted for slightly more than 1%, agricultural extension loans accounted for slightly more than 4%, and resettlement area loans accounted for slightly less than 2%. All the above-mentioned loans do not include the Northeast circulating currency portion.

In addition, special agricultural product loans are a special type of loan organized by the bank to assist in the processing and manufacturing of special products in various [Blank], improve quality, and facilitate transportation. In the first half of this year, more than 400 billion yuan in silkworm silk loans were issued. Cotton loans issued 136.6 billion yuan. Tobacco leaf loans issued more than 28 billion yuan. Tea industry loans issued more than 81 billion yuan. Due to the limited scope of fishery loans to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the loans were only 10 billion yuan. In addition, emergency loans in various disaster areas were also numerous. 100 billion yuan in loans have been approved for the Yellow Flood Area, and 20 billion yuan has been issued. 3.9 billion yuan has also been issued in the Huai Flood Area. The bank plans to issue a total of 900 billion yuan in various loans this year. In addition to those issued in the first half of the year, the remaining amount will be issued continuously by the end of this year.

### Raw Material Supply Falls Short of Demand, Wool Spinning Outlook is Bleak

The city's Wool and Flannel Spinning, Weaving and Dyeing Industry Association currently has 61 members, including 11 full-fledged factories (spinning, weaving, and dyeing), 5 spinning and weaving velour yarn and weaving hiberolon each. There are 3 spinning coarse yarn, and the rest only have weaving equipment. There are approximately 7,000 workers, with the largest factory having approximately 800 workers and the smallest having a dozen or so. Although there is no precise estimate of output, the average is approximately 500,000 to 600,000 yards per month. If all the factories are operating, output can be doubled, then the monthly raw material requirement requires approximately US$3.5 million in foreign exchange, a total of US$10.5 million per quarter. According to the current limited allocation, the proportion is only one-fifth. In order to maintain the livelihood of workers, manufacturers with slightly thicker funds do not hesitate to collect raw materials from the market to make up for the shortage. Unfortunately, inventories are not large and supply cannot meet demand. Wool is currently valued at 240,000 yuan per pound, and high-quality combed wool has risen to more than 400,000 yuan. Those with weak funds have switched to operating in shifts, or have stopped completely, or have switched to using flying cotton as a substitute.

According to the association, the state-owned Textile Construction Company accounts for 28% of the foreign exchange allocated, foreign merchants account for 16%, and factories in other cities account for 19%, while private factories in this city account for only 37%.

In the past, the association's method of allocating foreign exchange to member factories stipulated that old factories would be calculated based on 300% of the number of operating spindles, and new factories would be one-third of that proportion. If a new factory started operating in the last month of the quarterly allocation, its allocation would only be one-ninth. At that time, disputes arose between the two parties. The association's reason was that the foreign exchange given by the government in the first quarter was 1.4 million yuan, and then it was 2 million yuan, and the amount of increase was one-third, so the amount allocated to new factories should only be limited to this amount. The new factories believed that absorbing idle funds into production was in line with national policy. A factory has huge expenses at the beginning of its establishment and cannot afford to purchase raw materials on the market. What they hoped for was that the association would uphold fairness, that is, equal opportunities and equal distribution, and not favor one over the other, creating discrimination. The former has become the past, and the latter should be re-solved reasonably.

### Six Types of Government Bonds to be Drawn Today

The Ministry of Finance has scheduled the drawing of the 25th Year Unified Public Bond D-Type Bond Tickets, the 28th Year Military Supply Public Bond First Phase Bond Tickets, the 30th Year Military Supply Public Bond Second Phase Bond Tickets, and the 32nd Year Allied Victory Public Price and other redemption drawings at 9:00 AM on November 10 at the Central Trust Bureau, 4th Floor, No. 74 Renji Road, Shanghai. The ministry has already sent official letters to relevant agencies, requesting them to send personnel to the venue to supervise and perform the drawing matters at that time.

### Ge Jingzhong Plans to Improve Guangdong Silk

Guangdong is one of the most prosperous regions for the silk industry in China, but there has been little improvement after the war. At this time when export efforts are being sought, it is difficult to expect recovery unless improvements are made quickly. Mr. Ge Jingzhong, manager of the China Silk Company, in view of this, went to Shunde to inspect and based on his inspection, formulated an improvement plan. It is reported that the main points of its plan are roughly as follows: In the coming year, the supply of improved spring silkworm seeds to Guangdong Province will be increased to 20,000 to 30,000 sheets. Guidance

### Rice from Siam Arrives in Shanghai

Our ordered 20,000 tons of white rice from Siam, the first batch is already being loaded onto ships there. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai early next month, and the rest will be shipped within the month.

### Overseas Remittances Decrease Daily

If the black market is not eradicated in a day, overseas remittances cannot return to normal.

According to the person in charge of the Overseas Department of the Bank of China, overseas remittances have been decreasing daily recently, with the daily amount remitted being minimal. Previously, every time the Central Bank adjusted the exchange rate, overseas remittances did increase in the first month after the adjustment, but gradually decreased after one month. When the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee was established, overseas remittances increased, with weekly income of approximately 5 billion legal currency. Currently, due to the continuous rise of the black market, which is almost 40% higher than the market price, overseas remittances are decreasing daily under these circumstances. There are rumors that the Central Bank will set another exchange rate specifically to attract overseas remittances, but this is unlikely. The current focus on attracting overseas remittances remains on eradicating the black market. If the black market is not eradicated in a day, overseas remittances will definitely not be able to maintain normalcy.

### Japanese Securities Transaction Regulations to be Thoroughly Revised

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 9th dispatch] According to informed sources who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, the future Tokyo Securities Exchange will use the San Francisco Securities Exchange as a model. They stated: The Allied Headquarters insists that the regulations and most of the details of Japan's planned central exchange must be based on the major exchanges on the US West Coast. In order to facilitate the establishment of the new Tokyo Securities Exchange in accordance with the regulations of the Allied Headquarters, the new Securities Transaction Regulations passed in February of this year must be thoroughly revised.

### Before Trademark Examination is Approved, Factories Can Produce Based on Payment Receipts

The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs jointly issued a public notice stating that commodities with registered trademarks must be approved with an examination certificate before being allowed to leave the factory with unified tax. In order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the bureau had previously temporarily allowed verification of the application for registration payment receipt, tax payment and sales, and instructed compliance. Now, it is feared that manufacturers in various places may not be fully aware, so it is jointly announced again that all taxable commodities, such as cigarettes, matches, wine, etc., and other items, during the trademark registration process, before the examination certificate is issued, will be verified based on the application registration payment receipt, and will be temporarily allowed to pay taxes and sell products, and the examination certificate will be presented later. In addition to instructing all provincial and municipal tax authorities under the jurisdiction of the bureau to comply, all manufacturers are also informed.

### Alleviating Raw Material Panic in the Match Industry, Import Management to Relax Quotas

The panic over raw materials in the match industry is very serious, and the foreign exchange quota for raw material imports is far from sufficient. Therefore, the industry previously submitted a petition to the Import Management Committee and the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office and other agencies. It is now learned that the Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee has yesterday replied to the Industrial Association and the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, etc., agreeing to appropriately relax the foreign exchange quota for raw materials for the match industry starting from the fourth quarter, in order to solve the panic over match raw materials.

### Reader's Mailbox: "Scalper Organizations" Abound in Pudong Riverside

A letter from a reader of this newspaper in Fuzhou exposes illegitimate demands.

In the Bund and the 16th Pier area of this city, there are many "travel agencies" whose business is to purchase ship tickets from various shipping companies and then resell them to passengers. The price is often higher than the face value. General passengers often endure and buy because they are in a hurry. It is heard that many poor compatriots, because they are displaced in Shanghai and eager to return home, are being blackmailed by these "travel agencies," with no room for negotiation. Furthermore, because they absorb a large number of tickets, they create a "ticket shortage" situation, thereby satisfying their desire for extortion. If the authorities allow these disguised "scalper" organizations to run rampant, passengers will suffer endlessly. Mr. Xu Huiping, a reader of this newspaper, recently sent a letter from Fuzhou, mentioning this matter. It is hereby published, hoping that the relevant authorities will pay attention to it to reassure travelers. The original letter is as follows:

Editor Guang Sheng: On September 14th, I took the "Nanshan" ship from Shanghai to Rong. On the ship, I happened to meet Zhang Yongzeng and Guan Huaizhen, two families (12 people, including 8 children) of refugees from Xuezhuang Township, Linyi County, Shandong Province, who came to Rong for survival. They were introduced by the "Shanghai Zhonghua Travel Agency" at 148 Zhongshan East 2nd Road in Shanghai to take the ship. They were forced to pay 135,000 yuan per ticket. These poor refugees could not afford this huge sum, and repeatedly pleaded for a reduction, but were not allowed. Finally, they sold several pieces of winter clothing to raise a total of 1,080,000 yuan. Later, the agency sent someone to lead them onto the ship and took 2,000 yuan per person for car fare and ferry fare, totaling 32,000 yuan. The ship did not provide meals. When I learned about this, I immediately inquired with the ship's comprador, who said: "Only 40,000 yuan per person was received from the agency leader, totaling 320,000 yuan, and the ship has free preferential treatment for refugees and veterans. The huge sum they paid was obviously embezzled by the agency." Everyone was indignant. After arriving in Rong, I specifically sent a letter to the "Shanghai Zhonghua Travel Agency" to inquire and asked them to return the remaining money to the refugees (they now live in the Rong Electric Company's new factory). Unexpectedly, more than a month has passed, and the agency has ignored it.

The "Shanghai Zhonghua Travel Agency" was originally a service organization and should sincerely serve the public and take fair profits. Especially for the poor, it should do its best to serve them. Now, the agency not only fails to fulfill its service duties, but instead takes the opportunity to defraud refugees, disregard the law, damage the business ethics of the industry, and corrupt the good social atmosphere, causing anger and indignation. In addition to reporting the facts to the relevant authorities for investigation, I am sending the facts to your newspaper for publication, so that people in society can use the sympathy of human justice to warn the unscrupulous elements of the agency, in order to deter others from following suit. Sincerely, Reader Xu Huiping, October 20th.

### The Merits and Demerits of Science

— Steel Man

Science is like a bright and shining light, illuminating the path of humanity.

Since humanity began its struggle to conquer nature, the progress of world civilization has been invaluable.

People hundreds of years ago, or even just decades ago, could never have imagined today's world and the happiness it enjoys.

However, the jealousy, narrow-mindedness, and suspicion of humankind, those vile characteristics, have not been completely eliminated. Mad war-makers often bring about cruel catastrophes.

Here, unfortunately, rapidly advancing science, the driving force of human civilization, is controlled by evil hands to harm humanity. Science becomes the tool of criminals and the assistant of evildoers. People who do not deeply understand science cannot help but doubt and criticize it.

In fact, if we quietly look back at the past and present reality and examine them, we can see that this view is one-sided.

The radiation rays that were worried about becoming killing "death rays" have become important tools for studying various sciences and treating diseases today. The gunpowder that was a "war tool" is now a necessity for building large and small dams. Atomic energy is a huge source of power. And who would still want to live in dark, unlit nights and endure suffering from diseases? And what ultimately brought victory to the democratic countries with freedom and equality? Undoubtedly, it is the credit of scientific progress.

The latest two reports on ultrasonic waves are the clearest illustration. It is an interesting story.

Ultrasonic waves are what bats rely on to fly in the dark, and what humans use as the "invisible fingers" to touch the moon.

A wave that cannot be heard or seen. Now it is no longer something that no one cares about.

At the graduation ceremony of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, the invited speaker, US Air Force General George Kenney, talked about the mystery of this wave.

Ultrasonic waves may be a terrible tool when humans want to wage war again. In today's era of advancing science, it may not be alarmist. An aircraft equipped with "ultrasonic sensing equipment" (whose existence is no longer felt in human ears because it is silent) leisurely circles over a city, and the people there unknowingly lose their movements and thoughts because their nerves have been permanently destroyed.

At the same time, across the Atlantic, exciting news from scientists was heard. It was news about using these ultra-high-frequency sound waves.

The British Ministry of Information reported that the British Launderers' Research Association, based on the research of twenty-six scientists and their assistants, was building a new method, namely "Laundry by Sound."

The adherence of dirt to fabric fibers (the essence of what makes up the clothes and supplies worn by everyone and fills every home) is due to tiny electrical charges. Soap bubbles and scrubbing cause it to neutralize and then carry it away. But there are many tiny specks of dirt that are often difficult to remove. Scientists therefore plan to build a mechanism to make soap exert its full effect and effectively shake off the entanglement of that dust. They are preparing to use this Ultrasonic Vibration Method.

Don't laugh at the scientists' humor, and don't worry about evil hands controlling silent things to carry out the work of destruction. Associating the above two reports, perhaps the device for defending against ultrasonic weapons is unexpectedly this laundry mechanism. And the original "killing weapon" is treated like a guest and used as the most effective tool to clean the dirt of the entire family and the entire city.

Never condemn science for creating behaviors in the murderous and cruel enterprise of war. Know that science is always humanity's most loyal and powerful friend! Happiness and sin are grasped in humanity's own hands and created by themselves!

What reason is there to doubt the progress of science instead of truly eradicating the demons that turn happiness into sin?

### Why Germany Didn't Have the Atomic Bomb

— Yang Shi

Until the Nazi surrender, the US military was uneasy and panicked about the question of "whether the Nazis could build an atomic bomb." In fact, this was an overestimation. In early September this year, the British magazine "Nature" published an article by German physicist Werner Heisenberg, in which the Nobel Prize winner formally explained why Germany could not build an atomic bomb.

He said that they were almost successful in completing the construction of the "pile" and never attempted to build an atomic bomb, only using the "pile" to generate atomic energy. Before the war, physicists around the world knew that an atom of "U-235," a light and extremely rare isotope of uranium, could be split to release a lot of energy. At the same time, they also knew that the neutrons after the atomic fission would continue to cause other atoms to split in a "Chain Reaction," so what the United States considered a "secret" was actually known to Germany. When the war broke out in 1939, Germany also knew that the United States was using huge sums of money to explore atomic energy (Dr. Heisenberg did not explain how he knew). So they immediately formulated a plan to start research. However, the doctor lamented in the article: "The Germans were too negligent in atomic physics from 1933 to 1939," and therefore they did not have tools, such as the most important "Cyclotron." They only had two well-equipped test facilities, and their research encountered great obstacles in the absence of tools.

At the beginning, they adopted the same method as their enemy (referring to the United States). In order to obtain atomic energy, they decided that they must first extract a light and rare isotope of uranium, "U-235," from uranium ore. The United States had already done this at Oak Ridge (generally known as the Atomic City), but in order to save some other industries that were destroyed by bombing, the German scientists did not immediately create another one.

In building a chain-reacting pile that could complete the "chain fission reaction," they also made a big mistake. This pile is to make a certain substance react with uranium, which would cause the atom to split and slow down the neutrons released from the split, so that they could continue to cause other atoms to split in a chain reaction. In theory, both the United States and Germany knew that carbon and heavy water were this "certain substance," but the United States used carbon (a soft, black natural carbon) as a "controller," while the German scientists were determined to use heavy water. So they concentrated on manufacturing slow and expensive heavy water, thus letting the Americans take the lead.

The United States used carbon to generate the highly explosive "Piutonium," and the Germans' idea of ​​this possibility was very vague. So he simply did not attempt to build an atomic bomb, and naturally did not need a cyclotron to produce "Piutonium." Their goal was to directly use atomic energy from the pile in general industry, and they had too little funding, only one-thousandth of what the United States spent (the United States spent 2 billion gold). Moreover, the senior military leaders in Germany have always believed that the war would end in 1942, and there was no need to spend such a large sum of money to build an atomic bomb that was not necessarily successful, which also brought great obstacles to the German scientists.

Despite so many difficulties and obstacles, they were almost successful. Their experimental model of using heavy water to control the pile of neutrons was much better than the American carbon pile. In Norway, they painstakingly built a heavy water factory, but it was bombed by US planes after only two tons of heavy water were produced. The constant air raids caused great damage to German industry. Transportation was cut off, and the builders of the pile could not get the uranium ore they needed, and they had to work entirely in air-raid shelters. Finally, they even fled to a rock cave near a small village 32 miles from Stuttgart. At this time, their initial pile had already started working. But soon, on April 22, the US military captured the small village, and everything was confiscated by the US military.

### Aircraft Navigation Position

— Wan Gongyu

——A new method of measurement——

When an aircraft is flying, determining its position is a very important issue. Here we introduce a new measuring instrument and method.

To simply solve many flight position problems, the new Radio flight-position fixer provides the driver with a continuous, easy-to-follow image of the aircraft's position. This was invented by an Air Force officer and will be manufactured by the (Sperry Gyroscope) company for military use.

It is built as a way to improve airborne safety in adverse weather, as well as to save time lingering in preparation for landing over airfields. The radio positioner is suitable for point-to-point air navigation and can be used for low-flying landings when visibility is poor.

The principle of the radio positioner is nothing more than simple trigonometric relations. Two radio direction finders turn to two stations on the ground separately. From the center of each indicator, a light shines out through the transparent face of the instrument. Its angle corresponds to the direction of the aircraft from the station. The location of the flight position is the intersection of these two rays. Because this visible indicator point moves completely with the position of the aircraft, the trajectory of the movement of the intersection of the light rays is the road money of the aircraft's flight path projected on the ground. The direction of flight is indicated by the Elux gote in the middle point of the fast line of the two radio positioners. Because the centers of the two radio positioners are three inches apart on this instrument, the ratio scale of how many miles per inch is displayed on the instrument determines the distance between the two stations on the energy map.

The flight process to any selected destination can be drawn on the surface of the positioner with a crayon or fluorescent pen (at night), and then the intersection of the light rays is often kept on this drawn road money, which means that the aircraft is flying along the original route. In aircraft on regular flight routes, the area contained or a simple map of all the flight stations on the road money can be pre-made on another transparent surface for application. Obstacles, restricted areas, and other appropriate flight records can be indicated above.

The value of this device for blind approach and blind landing can be seen in the fact that any driver can follow the instructions to fly in a specified area or approach in any direction.

Including the wireless fixed position meter (the full weight) and other settings, the total weight of the positioner is 200 pounds. Most commercial aircraft carry at least one radio direction finder.

### Is Mutation a Chemical Change?

— Hao Tianhe

Another category, such as arsenic (:As) may be able to replace the sulfur (:S) and (:N) in mustard gas, but compounds containing arsenic are very unstable under physiological conditions, and most of them are poisonous. As for compounds containing phosphorus (:P), which can spontaneously burn in the air, sulfur dioxide (:SO2) compounds can similarly be expected to show some activity. There is also a possibility to use nitrites and isonitrites, as well as the corresponding thiocyanates and isothiocyanates as combined parts. Therefore, allyl isothiocyanate is noteworthy because this compound can exhibit a weak but definite mutagenic effect.

On the other hand, this kind of chemical structure is not necessary for mutagens. This is indicated by the fact that Hacorn and Nigri removed the ovaries of fruit flies and immersed them in a weak solution of Phenol, which also produced many mutations.

Allyl isothiocyanate exists in nature within Brassica plants. We do not know whether it has a mutagenic effect in this plant. It would be interesting to observe how much responsibility those natural mutagens should bear for spontaneous mutation. Miller and Mott-Smith have shown that Cosmic radiathion and natural radiation are quantitatively insufficient to account for the rate of spontaneous mutation we see. Timofeff-ressovsky, Zimmer, and Delbruk have all suggested that the irregular temperature generated in the cell nucleus can sometimes exceed the ability required to produce a mutation. Based on the results reported here, it is possible that some natural mutations are due to the effect of mutagens in the organism. The production of that mutagen may be the result of its own base action. Such an assumption can find support in known examples, that is, there is a kind of fixed base that can affect the rest of the bases and cause mutations, and even affect special bases. Therefore, it is extremely interesting to find natural mutagens, but it may be very difficult, because a natural mutagen may have a characteristic that it will not have a drastic effect on the organism itself, otherwise that organism cannot survive. There is also the fact that under certain physiological conditions, between the power of several effective substances and the sensitivity of one or several bases, in the course of evolution, a precise and rational balance will eventually be reached. This system contains mutagens, and the production of mutagens is regulated by the bases.

However, often when a base is separated from its normal factorial environment, a natural mutagen can produce

very different effects, or no effect at all. Therefore, the results obtained from a certain organism cannot necessarily be applied to other organisms. Sometimes it may even conflict with the results obtained by using drastic methods such as X-rays and mustard gas.

Although we still have to consider the possibility that the evolution of species adopts a mutation method to adapt to the needs of the environment, so that a balance can be reached between the production of mutagens and the sensitivity of the caps.
