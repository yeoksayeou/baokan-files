This order.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2:30 AM, 18th] In addition to issuing the appointment orders for the Presidents of the Five Yuan and members of the National Government on the National Government's Capital Nanjing Commemoration Day on the 18th, the National Government has also reportedly issued letters of appointment, additionally appointing Song Qingling, Hu Yisheng, Liu Zhe, Wei Huai, Chen Qicai, Xu Chongzhi, Chen Shuren, Chen Ce, Zhang Fang, Dr. Yao Yue, Diluwa, Xiao Xuan, and Li Genyuan as thirteen advisors to the National Government.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The candidates for Presidents of the Five Yuan remain unchanged, except for Zhang Qun taking the post of President of the Executive Yuan. The candidates for Vice Presidents of the Five Yuan have not yet been proposed. It is widely believed that the reorganization of the Executive Yuan will be completed in the short term.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The National Government's reorganization, which has been brewing for over a year, to broaden its base, the Kuomintang realizing the end of political tutelage, inviting people from various parties to participate in the government, and preparing to implement constitutional government, has finally been completed. The Republic of China will, from the 18th, step into the world's democratic trend with a new look.

Since the establishment of the National Government, it has implemented political tutelage, always wanting to return power to the people and achieve constitutional government. However, internal and external troubles have left it with almost no peaceful days. After eight years of the War of Resistance, victory was finally achieved. The National Government then convened the Political Consultative Conference to negotiate with various parties, especially the Communist Party, which held armed forces, sincerely discussing and solving national affairs. However, the Communist Party remained obstinate, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have not been followed, even disregarding the National Government and denying the National Assembly agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference and the constitution it formulated, closing the door to peace talks, resulting in the National Government reorganization being unable to invite the CCP to participate. However, the government's original intention has not changed. The significance of the National Government reorganization has finally been realized with the sincere participation of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and social elites.

The new National Government was formed on the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the National Government, declaring to the people of the country and the world that our Republic of China has begun to move towards the path of actual governance, and the Kuomintang is working together with various parties for the construction of a democratic political nation, which is an epoch-making event for our country and a symbol of world peace and progress. In the future, the new government will work hard to implement party politics and promote democracy under joint responsibility.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Information Department of the Central Executive Committee held a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Lizhi Society at 7:00 PM on the 17th. In addition to announcing the lists of the Vice Chairman of the National Government, members of the National Government Committee, Presidents of the Five Yuan, and members of the Central Political Committee, and the list of government committee members from the Kuomintang (see separate cable), Minister Peng also announced that Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, He Luzhi, and Yu Jiaju were from the Youth Party; Wu Xianzai, Hu Haimen, and Ji Yiqiao were from the Democratic Socialist Party; and Mo Dehui, Chen Huide, Wang Yunwu, and Bao Erhan were social elites. There is still one government committee member from the Democratic Socialist Party to be added, and the full list will be officially announced by the National Government. In response to journalists' inquiries, Minister Peng stated that the reorganized National Government is a government in which various parties participate during the transitional period before the implementation of constitutional rule. However, it is difficult for us to use an appropriate term, as this period is neither a completely tutelage period nor a completely constitutional period. The true beginning of constitutional government must wait until the establishment of the next National Assembly-elected government.

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] Minister of Information Peng Xuepei said that there are still eleven vacant seats on the National Government Committee awaiting representatives from the CCP and the Democratic League. Chairman Chiang is scheduled to hold a press conference for foreign journalists at 10:30 AM on the 18th, which is the Chairman's second reception of foreign journalists since the war, the first being held in Chongqing shortly after the victory.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The list of government committee members has been officially announced. The reorganization of the National Government will be completed on the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the National Government. Chairman Chiang will issue a brief statement on this in one or two days. The list of all government committee members, including those from the three parties and social elites, was announced by Minister Peng on the evening of the 17th, and all parties have expressed great excitement about this. The date of the oath-taking ceremony for the government committee members is currently unknown, but the Government Committee is scheduled to convene on the 21st.

Sun Baogang recently participated in the government and has already realized this. Because they were not nominated, they were dissatisfied and used the excuse of demanding full participation, falsely using the name of the majority to undermine party resolutions and slander Zhang Junmai, reversing right and wrong. Now, party members from all over the country are unanimously advocating expelling Sun and others from the party and severely punishing them to maintain party discipline.

### Legislative Yuan Discusses Banking Law and Completes First Reading; Bankers Association Petitions for Temporary Retention of Second Reading

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The full text of the Banking Law draft, consisting of 10 chapters and 119 articles, has been discussed at the 322nd regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 17th and has passed the first reading, which can complete the legislative process. The National Government promulgated the Banking Law in the spring of 1931, but it has not yet been implemented. After the end of the War of Resistance, the Legislative Yuan began to整理the Banking Law and has revised its draft seven times. The entire review was completed in mid-month and submitted to the General Assembly.

Chapter 1 of the law defines banking business as: (1) Accepting various deposits, (2) Discounting bills, (4) Domestic remittances, (5) Foreign exchange operated under special permit, (6) Acting as an agent for receiving and making payments, (7) Warehousing and custody business, (8) Buying and selling securities and investment, (9) Underwriting or subscribing to public bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate shares, (10) Trading in raw gold and silver and foreign currency under special permit, (11) Managing property in trust. Chapter 2, General Provisions, stipulates that the banks referred to in this law are divided into five categories: (1) Commercial banks, (2) Industrial banks, (3) Savings banks, (4) Trust companies, and (5) Native banks. It also stipulates that each bank shall not engage in business other than the type of business for which it is registered and approved. Violators may be fined up to 10,000 yuan for each responsible person of the bank or ordered to replace its responsible person. If the circumstances are serious, its business license may be revoked. Chapter 3 stipulates the ratio of guarantee reserve funds to be deposited by commercial banks, the scope of business, and the amount of loans. Chapter 4 stipulates the ratio of guarantee reserve funds to be deposited by industrial banks, the scope of business, and the amount of loans. Chapter 5 stipulates the ratio of reserve funds to be deposited by savings banks, the scope of business and savings deposits, the maximum limit per household, and the total amount of loans. Chapter 6 stipulates the scope of business and investment restrictions of trust companies. Chapter 7 stipulates the scope of business and loan restrictions of native banks.

### The Location of Branches Established by Foreign Banks Should Be Restricted

Chapter 8 stipulates that the areas where foreign banks establish branches in our country should be restricted and stipulates that they shall not engage in the business of concurrently operating savings banks or trust companies. Payments shall also be limited to legal currency, and it is stipulated that deposits shall be used within our country. Chapter 9 stipulates the registration and licensing of banks, and the final Chapter 10 is supplementary provisions.

After the case was presented at the meeting, Zhang Zhaoyuan, the original drafter, first reported the motives for the revision, the principles of legislation, and the difficulties encountered, explaining that the draft still inevitably has some limitations and constraints in guiding and rewarding. After the speech, a discussion on the principles began. Chen Guyuan pointed out that the draft had many points that could be discussed in substance and technically. Currently, it feels difficult to handle, and whether it can be immediately implemented is a big problem. Sun Jiulu also believes that the current economy will be in a state of emergency, the value of the currency is also unstable, and if controls are too loose, it will be enough to affect finance; and the banks also hope not to be too constrained. The Ministry of Finance previously stated that even if the method is passed, it is hoped that the announcement period can be determined by ministerial order. The facts are so, and cannot be ignored. Zhang Zhaoyuan explained separately, pointing out that the capital amount cannot be consistent nationwide, and the draft will divide the country into several regions and separately approve them, so that there will be no impact due to the unstable value of the currency.

### Whether Native Banks Should Be Considered Banks; The Most Intense Disputes During Discussion

Subsequently, a clause-by-clause discussion was held. The most intense dispute was whether native banks should be classified as banks. It was initially decided to include native banks, but later it was restored. Liu Xianqiao believes that the provisions regarding native banks can be regulated by special laws and regulations and do not need to be included in the Banking Law. Sun Jiulu pointed out that native banks operate commercial banking businesses and can be included in the chapter on commercial banks. Zhang Zhaoyuan disagreed, explaining that banks cannot penetrate rural areas, and native banks have a significant role in various places. In the future, to a considerable extent, they will be changed to banks, and at the same time, their nature will definitely be the same as commercial banks, so it seems appropriate to maintain the original plan. It was resolved that native banks will still be listed as banks referred to in this law, and a special chapter will stipulate their scope of business.

Another issue that caused a lengthy discussion was how to punish banks if they engage in business other than the type of business for which they are registered and approved. Cheng Yuanzhen said that fining each responsible person 1,000 yuan is too much. It is too light to only replace them if the circumstances are serious, and revoking the business license is not enough to make those who disrupt finance tremble. He advocated for severe punishment. Wang Yuxiang and others also believe that the amount of 1,000 yuan is like a drop in the bucket for those who disrupt the market. Zhang Zhaoyuan and others explained that the 1,000 yuan fine is stipulated by the Civil Law, and replacing responsible persons concerns their reputation and cannot be said to be a light punishment. As for revoking the license, its impact on the banking industry is more important than anything else. It was resolved to change 1,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan and change the clause to replace its responsible person, and if the circumstances are serious, its business license may be revoked.

Jian Guansan pointed out that the interests of depositors should be protected and advocated adding a clause, namely, "In order to protect the interests of depositors, banks should jointly establish a deposit protection organization," which was passed by a majority.

As the discussion was about to end, Wang Yansong, Xu Guowei, Xu Weiming, and Fu Rulin, representatives of the Bankers Association, came to the Legislative Yuan to petition, hoping to postpone the decision. Secretary-General Wu Shangying met with them and reported the progress of the meeting to the Legislative Yuan. All 119 articles of the draft were discussed and passed the first reading, and the second reading procedure was temporarily retained. The meeting did not end until after 1:00 PM.

### Central Political Committee to Be Established Next Week; Supreme National Defense Council Rushes to Complete Work

### Chairman Chiang's Political Power Is Consolidated; China Begins to Have Freedom; Vandenberg Asks Congress to Support Truman

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Vandenberg publicly stated in the Senate that he disagreed with the government's policies towards China and Argentina. Regarding China, he believes that there can only be peace when Chairman Chiang consolidates his political power. He went on to warn Congress that if Congress does not support Truman's plan, the United States will have no opportunity to oppose the Communist Party peacefully in the future, which is tantamount to telling the world that aggressors can act recklessly.

### CCP's Jiangsu-Shandong-Anhui Border Provincial Committee Opposes Seizing the World by Armed Force; Criticizes Mao Zedong for Using the People as Cannon Fodder

[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 17th] The Jiangsu-Shandong-Anhui Border Area Party Affairs Committee of the Extraordinary Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a declaration on March 1, opposing Mao Zedong's seizing the world by armed force.

### Washington Discusses Japanese Reparations Issue; US to Propose Overall Solution; China, Having Fought the Longest, Should Receive the Majority of Materials

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Personnel from the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo recently returned for discussions with the General Staff and the State Department regarding the issue of reparations. It is understood that generally, because China fought against Japan for the longest time, it is believed that it can make good use of heavy industrial equipment and transportation facilities, so it is appropriate to be the country that receives the majority of transferred materials. The Allied Headquarters representatives' return to the US for discussions has not changed the opinions of officials regarding the need to make a final resolution proposal. This is because they are aware that other members of the Far Eastern Commission will definitely make requests, but recent discussions have had a definite impact. This has caused some officials to change their opinions regarding what reparations materials can be obtained from Japan and what their value is. The Allied Headquarters representatives will conclude their discussions tomorrow. According to some sources, the Allied Headquarters representatives' return to the US for discussions this time has given officials a clear impression of the Japanese reparations issue.

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] It was learned today that some representatives of the Allied Headquarters reparations delegation in Washington told the Army Department and the State Department that they believe that after the final analysis, the domestic assets that the victorious Allied nations can remove from Japan for reparations will not exceed the US's provisional plan of 30%.

According to the US's provisional plan of 30%, MacArthur is authorized to propose 15% of Japan's domestic assets available for reparations for distribution to Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines. In addition to this, the US has already prepared a final plan, which will be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission. According to this plan, China will be redistributed 30%, and the remaining 10% will be distributed to other member states of the Far Eastern Commission.

Officials here have not changed their opinion that it is necessary to complete the overall resolution proposal, because they understand that other member states of the Far Eastern Commission should be allowed to submit their respective requests.

Our Country's Reparations Committee Holds Meeting to Discuss Dismantling and Transportation Plans

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Reparations Committee held a meeting at 3 PM on the 17th. Chairman Gong Xuesui, as well as representatives from the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the National Resources Commission attended the meeting. The main issues discussed at the meeting were threefold: (1) Dismantling will begin immediately after receiving formal notification; (2) The transportation plan will be handled by a special agency established by the Ministry of Transportation; (3) Funds for operations will be jointly raised by all parties. It is also heard that Gong Xuesui has submitted his resignation.

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] The National Resources Commission of the Executive Yuan has drafted a plan stipulating that China should receive 40% of the total Japanese reparations, focusing on rebuilding China's light industry. Once an agreement is reached between the major powers of the Far Eastern Commission, personnel will be sent to Japan to receive the reparations according to this plan.

### Japanese Textile Industry Plan; Drafted by Experts from Allied Headquarters; Next Year's Exports Will Account for 27% of Pre-War Levels

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th] According to exclusive news obtained by this agency's Far East Manager, Fang En, the Allied Headquarters textile experts have completed the Japanese textile industry plan. It is estimated that Japan's cotton textile production in 1947 will be approximately 285,000,000 pounds, which accounts for 27% of the pre-war peak of 945,000,000 pounds. The Allied Headquarters textile industry plan aims to ensure that the Japanese textile industry has sufficient spindles after the relocation of Japanese factories. The main points are as follows: (1) To have sufficient products to meet the needs of the Japanese people at the 1930-34 level; (2) To supply a considerable amount for export in the near future.

The Allied spokesman disagreed with the remarks of Huang Yuanbin of China. According to Huang, if the Japanese textile industry is encouraged to a considerable extent, it may, as before the war, serve as a precursor to regaining control of China and other parts of Asia. According to Chinese sources, approximately 3 million spindles in Japanese textile mills have already resumed operation, and another 3 million spindles will begin to be added with MacArthur's support, which is far greater than the currently planned reconstruction plan. However, according to a recent survey, as of February 28th of this year, the number of spindles operating in Japan was approximately 1,041,000. In order to meet Japan's domestic needs and supply the world's shortage of cotton textiles, it is necessary to increase the number of spindles. However, the Allied Headquarters strictly controls all expansion of Japanese industry, so there is no immediate danger of large-scale encroachment on the interests of other textile regions.

Allied authorities expressed surprise at Nanjing's high-pressure competition and talk of destroying the Chinese textile industry. They pointed out that China's 1,400,000 spindles can only supply a very small portion of the country's 450 million people. Since it will take many years for the expansion of China's textile industry to reach the point where it can meet domestic needs, it is reasonable to assume that China needs to accept any foreign supply, regardless of its origin. In this regard, the Chinese side's suggestion to raise tariffs to deal with Japanese textiles is actually a measure that is detrimental to the Chinese people. Officials at Allied Headquarters stated that they are very willing to cooperate with the Chinese government on the plan to rebuild China's textile industry, and are willing to assist the technical problems of the development of that industry by exporting a reasonable number of Japanese textile machines to China. According to them, China should expand its textile industry tenfold in order to supply the needs of the Far Eastern textile market. The Chinese side's suggestion to reduce the number of spindles in the Japanese textile industry to a minimum was countered by the Allied Headquarters' textile officials, who said that Japan's existing spindles have already reached below the minimum limit deemed necessary by Allied Headquarters to maintain Japan's peaceful economy.

### The Yellow River Flood Area is Barren for Thousands of Miles; If Water Conservancy and Irrigation are Not Developed, it Will Become a New Desert; Part of the Inspection Team Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 17th] The Yellow River Flood Area Joint Inspection Team, consisting of more than 50 Chinese and foreign individuals including Huo Shishu, traveled by car from Xuchang to Fugou at 5 a.m. on the 14th. The communist army retreated the night before the inspection team arrived, and the traces of the war were still visible.

At 11 a.m., it left Fugou and continued to advance into the flood area, crossing the Guolu River Cao Guojun警戒 line and delving into the empty area. After the closure of the breach, the Yellow River water had dried up. For more than a hundred miles west of Fugou, there were no signs of human habitation along the way, and the inspection team traveled as if in a sandy desert. At 2 p.m., it arrived at Lian Temple, where the UNRRA tractor team was stationed. The team had 26 new tractors plowing on the sandy ground, and 50,000 mu of land had already been plowed. The inspection team continued to advance westward on the same day and arrived at Xihua County at 3 p.m. There was a UNRRA orphanage in the city, which housed 409 orphans who lived on relief flour. Half of the houses in Xihua were submerged in sand. Yanling Fugou Xihua is only a part of the flood area. From here eastward, adjacent to the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, the land is barren for thousands of miles. If water conservancy and irrigation are not developed, it will become a new desert geographically. The inspection team included people from six countries: China, the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and India. They all agreed that the restoration of the flood area has become a major task for China. The inspection team could not stay in danger for a long time, and returned to Xuchang that night, taking a special car north.

[This newspaper, Wuxi, 17th] Recently, grain prices in the Wuxi area have soared, and merchants from Tianjin, Xuzhou, Chongming, Fuzhou, and other places have come to purchase grain, resulting in a disconnection between supply and demand. The grain industry believes that it is difficult to open up the source of supply and exports cannot be prohibited, so the future of people's food is worrying. Today, it is specially requested that the authorities follow the Shanghai method to allocate the government's rice purchased and stored in Wuxi for sale in succession, in order to enrich the people's food.

### Suzhou Police in Disguise Arrest Rice Merchants Raising Prices

Twelve Grain Stores Handed Over to the District Court for Trial

[This newspaper, Suzhou, 17th] The Suzhou County Government took emergency measures because grain prices have been soaring endlessly recently.

Editorial

### Earnestly Implement the Guidelines for Governance!

——Celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the National Government Establishing its Capital in Nanjing——

Today is the 20th anniversary of the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing. Twenty years ago today, the Kuomintang led the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, overthrew the warlords who divided and dominated the country, and established its capital in Nanjing, creating a new situation for national unification. At the same time, the Kuomintang implemented political tutelage, which also began on this day. But today, twenty years later, the National Government is voluntarily reorganizing, recruiting leaders from the Minqing (Democratic Socialist Party) and China Youth parties, as well as social elites, to join the government. At the same time, the guidelines for governance agreed upon by various parties and social elites are also officially announced today. This can be seen not only as the Kuomintang's practice of returning power to the people but also as a significant turning point in Chinese political history. Therefore, today, as we see the domestic political situation becoming clearer, we naturally have a beautiful vision for the future of Chinese politics. However, looking back and looking forward, it is not difficult to prove that China's political progress towards a peaceful and democratic path still requires the redoubled efforts of all parties and factions, as well as the people of the whole country, to make that beautiful vision a reality.

This government reorganization is not merely limited to personnel changes, but its true significance lies in expanding the democratic foundation of the government. Therefore, we believe that this government reorganization is indeed the Kuomintang's practice of returning power to the people. We can say fairly that the Kuomintang's twenty years of political tutelage, due to the double burden of internal and external troubles, failed to achieve the ultimate goal of political tutelage; however, it has made indelible contributions to raising the political awareness of the people and spreading democratic ideas; this is undeniable by anyone. And now the Kuomintang, in the spirit of treating the world as its own, is reorganizing the government, recruiting leaders from various parties and social elites to participate in the government and jointly shoulder the task of preparing for the implementation of constitutionalism. In the history of the development of democratic politics in our country, this is indeed an important turning point.

The initiation of the government reorganization dates back to before the opening of the Political Consultative Conference in January of last year, because at that time, after the victory in the War of Resistance, the whole country unanimously believed that during the transitional period from the victory in the War of Resistance to the beginning of national reconstruction, the Kuomintang should end its political tutelage, and all parties and factions and social elites should jointly shoulder the arduous task of handling military post-war affairs and preparing for constitutionalism. Therefore, the government reorganization plan was also one of the five major resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Later, disputes arose between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and conflicts continued, and it was never realized. It was not until after the close of the National Assembly in December of last year that the call for government reorganization became loud, although the Communist Party and the Democratic League refused to participate, the extension of other party members and social elites to join the government can naturally expand the democratic foundation of the government, thereby breaking the current political deadlock and embarking on a path of peace and democracy. After four or five months of effort, the government reorganization was finally realized today; skeptical people may complain about its slow speed, but its step-by-step progress has already achieved significant results. The first is the participation of the Minqing party and social elites in the government's four institutions (Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, National Political Council, and Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association). The second is the passage of ten kinds of laws and regulations related to the implementation of constitutionalism by the Legislative Yuan, which has already completed the procedure for implementing the constitution. Therefore, the government reorganization today can be said to be a natural culmination.

The reorganized National Government, in terms of its nature, is a temporary government that moves from the Kuomintang's end of political tutelage to the constitutional period; in terms of the tasks it undertakes, it is to complete all the necessary preparatory work for the implementation of constitutionalism as scheduled. The new constitution is scheduled to come into effect on December 25th of this year, only eight months from now. According to the prescribed implementation preparation procedures, it can be divided into two categories: (1) From the date of the promulgation of the constitution, the National Government should quickly amend or abolish existing laws and regulations that conflict with the constitution; (2) After the promulgation of the constitution, the National Government should, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, formulate and promulgate the following laws within three months: (1) Regarding the organization of the National Assembly and the election and recall of representatives of the National Assembly; (2) Regarding the election and recall of the President and Vice President; (3) Regarding the election and recall of legislators; (4) Regarding the organization of the five Yuan. If we take stock of the current situation, we can see that the first type of preparatory work has already been completed. Regarding the second type of work, the reorganized government still needs to actively carry it out. However, the most important work in preparing for the implementation of constitutionalism is not in the legislative preparation procedures, but in the people's understanding of democratic politics. Therefore, during this transitional period, special attention should be paid to the democratic style of politics, so that the people can be influenced by what they see and hear, and a democratic atmosphere can be cultivated. The first general election to be held in the autumn of this year is a major test of whether Chinese politics can be democratized.

During this transitional period, in addition to concentrating all its efforts on preparing for the implementation of constitutionalism, the government cannot neglect domestic affairs, foreign affairs, finance, economy, culture, and education because of the preparation for constitutionalism; therefore, before the government reorganization, the government should adopt which guidelines for governance, and it cannot but be quickly determined through consultation with various parties, as the highest guiding principle that the government should abide by during the transitional period. The Kuomintang representatives and the leaders of the Minqing parties have spent a lot of time and effort discussing this matter. From the beginning of the discussions on the government reorganization to the end of last month, they finally reached an agreement in principle, totaling twelve articles. In principle, provisions have been made on how to solve several important current problems, which can not only be a guideline for all parties to jointly abide by but also can be used to break the current political deadlock. This newspaper has already commented on it on the 25th of last month, and it is expected that the domestic political situation will soon become clear; and pointed out that these twelve key points are the common governance program that the people of the whole country unanimously demand. Now we are even more convinced that the announcement of the reorganized government's guidelines for governance is sufficient to clarify the current domestic political situation so that the people of the whole country will take an optimistic attitude towards the development of the political situation in the future.

But after celebrating the 20th anniversary of the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing with a pleasant mood and welcoming the reorganization of the National Government with the same mood, we still have some opinions to contribute to the leaders of various parties participating in the government.

First, these twelve guidelines for governance are the product of repeated consultations by the leaders of various parties and have been solemnly signed by the leaders of various parties. Although they cannot be regarded as the sacred charter jointly owned, the reorganized government must earnestly implement them. We dare to boldly say that these twelve guidelines are exactly what the people of the whole country expect from the government; if the government implements these guidelines, no matter what difficulties and obstacles it encounters, it will surely gain the support of the people of the whole country and overcome them. Otherwise, the people's joy today will inevitably be in vain again. And we also have to point out that the wording of the guidelines for governance is clear and easy to understand, and it is seen by the people of the country, and no one can distort it. In particular, the leaders who sign on behalf of a party or faction cannot arbitrarily interpret it.

Second, the foundation of the reorganized government has been expanded, and it is no longer a one-party government of the Kuomintang, but a government jointly organized by the Kuomintang and other parties. The foundation of this government is completely built on the sincere unity and concerted cooperation of all factions. Otherwise, it will be difficult to stabilize; therefore, we hope that the leaders of various parties participating in the government can use their political wisdom; for any problem, they can look at it from a distance and think from a broad perspective; put the interests of the country above the parties, and no longer be petty party members, but can be open and aboveboard politicians.

In short, the way out for Chinese politics lies in peace, democracy, unity, and national reconstruction; this government reorganization has already begun to move towards this path; but whether we can achieve our goals depends on whether the reorganized government can be enlightened, impartial, gather talents, and earnestly implement these twelve guidelines for governance!

### Foreign Ministers Conference Discusses Austrian Peace Treaty South Country Proposes Territorial Demands Austrian Foreign Minister Will Also Attend to Present Views Whether the Four Powers Can Compromise Depends on the Issue of German Assets in Austria

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Moscow, 17th—Radio Moscow: The Foreign Ministers Conference held two sessions today, both discussing the Austrian Peace Treaty. At the morning session, the Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia attended and reiterated the demand to obtain territory and compensation from Austria.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Moscow, 17th—Radio Moscow: When the Four Foreign Ministers Conference was held this morning, the Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia attended and delivered a speech, requesting that Austrian Carinthia be ceded to the South Country. It is said that one-third of the German troops fighting in the South Country were Austrians.

[Reuters, Moscow, 16th] Molotov stated at the Foreign Ministers Conference today that the Soviet delegation would do its best to complete the Austrian Peace Treaty at this session. However, whether this statement is truly effective will only become clear when Article 35 of the treaty, the issue of German assets in Austria, is discussed. After discussing the report of the coal expert committee for two hours, the four foreign ministers began to discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty. The report previously agreed upon by the vice ministers was passed by the four foreign ministers without discussion. Of the points on which the vice ministers had not reached an agreement, three were passed in principle and will be submitted to the committee for final drafting. There was no agreement on two points, one of which concerned the borders of Austria and will be discussed after listening to the views of South Austria.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 16th] The four foreign ministers held a double meeting on the Austrian issue today. Obviously wanting to rush to the end of the Moscow Conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov said that the Soviet Union hopes that the Austrian Peace Treaty will be completed and signed at this conference. But when Molotov demanded compensation from German coal mines, the four foreign ministers argued endlessly again. The four foreign ministers discussed 15 of the 59 articles of the Austrian Peace Treaty and reached agreement on 12 of them. Molotov's compensation demand was 12.5% of Germany's total coal production as compensation, and another 12.5% for export. It is said that Marshal Stalin also insisted on a huge amount of compensation when he met with Secretary of State Marshall last night.

### Discussion on the German Issue Is About to End Marshall-Stalin Talks Yielded No Results

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Moscow, 17th—Radio Moscow: A senior American representative recently declared that unless the Soviet side suddenly makes concessions, the foreign ministers believe that the discussion on the German issue has come to an end. The foreign ministers made this decision because the talks between Marshall and Stalin yielded no results.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] Regarding the rumor that Marshal Stalin's meeting with Secretary of State Marshall has failed, although newspapers here have published it in a prominent position, and semi-official sources also believe it to be true, the White House and the State Department have not issued an official statement on this statement. According to diplomatic sources: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's agreement to sign the Austrian Peace Treaty at this session of the four foreign ministers is a concession that the Soviet Union cannot refuse. Under the current circumstances, Marshal Stalin and Secretary of State Marshall are undoubtedly adhering to their own positions. Diplomatic sources summarized the current situation into three points: (1) The Soviet Union's expression of agreement on the Austrian issue is to save face for the United States; (2) The fate of Germany is still in the hands of the Soviet Union; (3) The purpose of the amendments proposed by Molotov to the four-power convention draft is to make the convention impossible. The Soviet Union is unwilling to sign any clauses in the Treaty of Germany that would allow the United States to maintain its interests in Europe. Semi-official sources believe that the meeting between Marshal and Stalin has caused new factors in US-Soviet relations, which is not absolutely impossible, but the consequences will have to wait and see in the future.

### The Soviet Union Has Proposed a Governor for the Port of Trieste

[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] The Soviet Union today nominated Per Albin Hansson, a liberal member of the Swedish Parliament, as the governor of the Free Port of Trieste.

However, it is expected that this action by the Soviet Union will at least enable the five powers to begin discussing this issue. According to regulations, the governor of the Port of Trieste must be appointed by the Security Council, but the five powers hope to first obtain private agreement on the candidate and then submit the appointment to the Security Council.

### New Cabinet Established in Chile

[Agence France-Presse, Chilean Capital, 17th] A purely Radical Party cabinet has been formed here, which will administer the government with the goodwill neutrality of right-wing parties and the moderate opposition tactics of the Communist Party.

The fleet included the battleship "Duilio" (23,000 tons), three cruisers, five destroyers, several small warships and submarines, and about 50 naval aircraft. Nine warships assigned to the Allied countries under the peace treaty also participated in the exercises.

### Bevin to Return Home Next Tuesday

Vandenberg said: The only way to deal with the Soviet Union is to let it know that there is an ultimate limit to ideals, and beyond this limit, we will not retreat. If Congress does not support Truman on this issue, we will never have another opportunity to impress future aggressors of this world by peaceful means.

### Hong Kong to Implement Restrictions on U.S. Imports

[United Press, Hong Kong, 17th] According to Finance Secretary Stewart, who spoke to a United Press reporter, the import of U.S. goods to Hong Kong, which has always been unrestricted, will soon be subject to a quota system. Before taking this measure, the authorities issued a statement prohibiting black market trading of U.S. dollars to meet the needs of U.S. imports. Stewart admitted that this measure is a partial ban on U.S. imports, because "it is absolutely necessary to preserve Hong Kong's U.S. dollars." But according to U.S. authorities, Hong Kong had $12 million in U.S. dollars two months ago, and only a very small number has been used during this period. The U.S. Consulate here has received complaints from many businessmen and is currently submitting a detailed report to the U.S. State Department.

### The German Fortress on Heligoland to Be Completely Destroyed

(United Press, Heligoland, Germany, 17th) The military installations on Heligoland Island in the North Sea, a point of pride in Hitler's grand plans, will be completely destroyed at 9 PM (Shanghai time) on the 18th. This is the largest man-made explosion since the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests, and also the most extraordinary action by the United Nations to eliminate Germany's war machine. This small island, only one mile long and about half a mile wide, was a sharp sword aimed at the heart of Britain by Kaiser Wilhelm. During World War II, it was used as an important base, capable of accommodating one-man submarines, with a line of 15-inch caliber cannons and radar equipment to detect Allied aircraft bombing Germany. In addition, there was a vast network of tunnels, storing huge amounts of ammunition and secret experimental workshops, hidden underground. The island currently has only ten British residents and one hundred and sixty Germans, and the plan is to destroy it so that it can no longer be used for military purposes.

The island was not only a naval base in the past, but also a scenic tourist destination. It originally had 2,500 residents who lived a relatively prosperous life. Now, all the houses on the island have been destroyed, and no public utilities remain. In the future, apart from fishermen temporarily building houses to stay in, it is unlikely that anyone will settle there permanently.

The island was ceded to Germany by the British in 1890 in exchange for the Zanzibar archipelago in East Africa. Due to its strategic location, it threatened Britain in both World Wars. During World War II, the island's military equipment included three 30.5 cm naval guns, three 10.5 cm anti-aircraft guns, two large howitzers, and a radar station. In the center of the island, there are the remains of a British four-engine bomber, and British and American pilots are buried in the island's church.

After a major British air raid on April 5, 1945, the residents evacuated to the mainland. Their private property, about 40,000 tons, was also transported to the mainland after the war. Other movable and useful items have been taken away by fishermen. The British flag is still flying on the island. The tunnels are as dense as a honeycomb, with entrances under the cliffs, winding and twisting inwards. Experts estimate that the ammunition buried inside is no less than 6,500 tons, of which 3,400 tons are explosives, and all will be destroyed together. The fuse is several miles long, connected to underwater cables, extending to a buoy nine miles away.

According to experts, the force of the explosion will penetrate 100 li underground, and scientists hope to use this to discover some secrets of the Earth's crust in Europe. Seismological observatories in London, Moscow, and Rome have been notified to pay attention to the Earth's vibrations during tomorrow's explosion. According to a British naval officer, the purpose of the explosion is not to completely destroy the island, but after the tunnels collapse, the island's height will be reduced, and the cliffs will also collapse. When the main tunnels are destroyed, one end of the island may split. After the explosion, they will wait about two days for the smoke to dissipate before entering the port for inspection.

### Seventy-Five Gasoline Tanks Ablaze, Texas City Fire, City Engulfed in Flames, Eight Hundred Dead

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Broadcast: The American Red Cross estimates that the death toll in the Texas City explosion disaster has reached as many as eight hundred people.

[Reuters, New York, 16th] Today in Texas City, a fire on a ship carrying ammonium nitrate caused explosions in chemical plants and oil tanks. A mushroom-shaped cloud, like after an atomic bomb, rose straight into the sky. The entire city was filled with toxic gas. The number of dead is between five hundred and one thousand, and the number of injured is between two thousand and eight thousand. This is an unprecedented tragedy in American history. All the oil tanks in the city are on fire, making it impossible for rescue teams to enter. All the houses are trapped in the sea of fire. Several hours after the explosion, the streets were still crowded with thousands of dazed residents. Many houses and tall buildings in the city were razed to the ground. Because the city's external telephone lines are completely cut off, accurate information is still lacking. Based on various reports, the situation can be summarized as follows:

Cargo Ship Catches Fire, Followed by Explosion

This morning, the 7,176-ton Liberty ship "Grandcamp," carrying ammonium nitrate fertilizer, arrived in Texas City. After reaching the dock, a fire suddenly broke out on board for unknown reasons. Efforts to extinguish it were unsuccessful, so it was towed into the river in an attempt to continue firefighting. Unexpectedly, an explosion occurred, affecting the Monsanto Chemical Plant on the riverbank. The plant also exploded, with copper and iron beams being blown up to fifteen miles away. The entire plant was destroyed. In Galveston, twenty kilometers away, many glass windows and ceilings were shattered. Residents at the time thought it was an earthquake and ran out into the streets to escape. Telephone communication between New York and Texas City and nearby cities was still unavailable by 6 PM. According to a Coast Guard report, the buildings along the dock have all collapsed. The most solid stone buildings in the center of Texas City were also razed to the ground.

Watching the Fire from Across the River, Tragically Buried Alive

[Agence France-Presse, Texas City, 17th] After the explosions in this city all day yesterday, 15,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate to prevent the danger of toxic gas. Seventy-five gasoline tanks were on fire at the same time, plus other fires, causing the entire city to be thickly enveloped in smoke. A curfew was declared in the city last night, and troops patrolled the ruined city to prevent looting. The first explosion on the "Grandcamp" was at 9:20 AM, followed by a series of explosions. At the time, firefighters bravely fought the fire, and many people watched the fire from the shore. Suddenly, an explosion occurred, burying all the fire watchers alive. Piles of bodies were stacked together, with as many as seventy-five bodies in some piles. The cargo ship "Grandcamp" has been blown to pieces.

Fire Approaching, Explosives Warehouse

[Reuters, New York, 16th] According to the latest report from Galveston, the fire in Texas City is approaching a warehouse storing explosives on the dock. Therefore, the police have ordered all rescue personnel to stop rescue work and evacuate immediately.

[United Press, Texas City, 17th] Two more explosions occurred here today. The flames spread, gradually approaching an armory, a poison gas plant, and another cargo ship full of nitroglycerin. Residents are fleeing in droves.

[United Press, Texas City, Texas, 17th] Following yesterday's shocking explosion of the French cargo ship "Grandcamp," another cargo ship "High Flyer," loaded with ammonium nitrate, exploded in the harbor at 2 AM this morning.

### Four Jewish Terrorists Hanged, Situation in the Holy Land Suddenly Tense, Irgun Gang Vows Revenge

[United Press, Jerusalem, 16th] After the execution of four Jewish terrorists, the situation in the Holy Land has become tense again. British troops have doubled and tripled their alert today. After the curfew was issued, 500,000 Jews were virtually confined to their homes to prevent further riots.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th] The secret radio station of the Jewish terrorist group Irgun declared today that it would hang forty British soldiers in retaliation for the execution of Gruner and the other three.

[United Press, London, 16th] The War Office received a threatening phone call this afternoon, saying that a certain group would blow up the War Office building at 4 PM. Upon receiving the news, the London Police Headquarters immediately dispatched detectives to thoroughly search the building, but found nothing suspicious. Earlier this morning, a homemade time bomb was found in the women's restroom of the Colonial Office in Dover House. A Colonial Office spokesperson said that this was the work of Jewish terrorists. It is noted that during the tense situation in Palestine last year, many buildings also received threatening phone calls.

### US Social Work Conference Opens, Discusses New Methods of Assisting China, Advocates Adopting a Clearer Relief Policy

[United Press, San Francisco, 16th] The US Social Work Conference opened here today. Many members called on the United States to provide China with new types of assistance, suggesting raising the Chinese immigrant quota and adopting a clearer relief policy. Mrs. Leach, Director of the Immigrant Protection League of Chicago, called for the enactment of new laws to make it easier for foreigners to be naturalized as US citizens. It is said that the only way to help Chinese people naturalize is to increase their immigration quota. If the United States had treated China fairly and without discrimination in 1924, the identities of 2,415 Chinese immigrants would have been confirmed in the past 23 years, and they would have become US citizens long ago. The United States should correct past mistakes and at least give Chinese people this opportunity without further delay. Howard, former Deputy Director of the UNRRA China Office, expressed pessimism about China's relief problems. It is said that if the United States attempts to help China, it must change its social assistance institutions and foreign policy. China's economic standards should be completely changed, its tax collection institutions should be reformed, and its military spending should be reduced. China is a poor country even by its own standards, so it should be allowed to find ways to save itself and decide what kind of foreign aid it needs. It is our duty to help China, but we must do so with humility and share weal and woe with them, not just give alms.

### United Nations Investigates Conditions in Trust Territories

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 16th] The Trusteeship Council has decided that United Nations agencies will send survey forms to various trustee states.

### United Nations Special Session to Convene on the 28th of this Month

Conflicts between Jewish and Arab Representatives Likely

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 16th] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie told the press today that he does not intend to formally invite President Truman to preside over the opening ceremony of the United Nations General Assembly special session to discuss the Palestine issue. The General Assembly will be presided over by Belgian representative Langehove, and there will be no formal opening ceremony. As of now, 35 countries have replied to the United Nations agency agreeing to convene this special session, with the last four countries being Turkey, Poland, Bolivia, and Uruguay. No country has yet requested that other issues be included in the agenda of the General Assembly. However, the General Assembly may elect two members of the Trusteeship Council. The permanent site of the United Nations agency, the first batch of new buildings, may be completed in 1949.

[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations special session is scheduled to convene on the 28th of this month to discuss the Palestine issue. Both Jews and Arabs are planning strategies, and major conflicts are expected to occur at that time. A spokesman for the Jewish Agency said that the Agency would formally request permission for Jewish representatives to participate in the discussion and immediately open Palestine to Jewish immigration. Arab spokesmen said that both proposals would be met with strong opposition. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie said that the General Assembly itself must decide the scope of the discussion, and he hopes that all representatives will not be constrained by formalities so that the discussion can proceed quickly.

### Philippines and Japan Resume Trade, Preliminary Agreement Reached

[United Press, Manila, 16th] Presidential Secretary Abello announced today that the Philippines and Japan have reached a preliminary agreement through MacArthur Headquarters, and both sides can resume trade. Trade will be conducted using accounts, rather than direct payment in currency. Foreign Ministry officials said that Japan wants to import 23,000 tons of coconuts and 150 tons of hemp per month, plus crude rubber. The Philippines hopes to obtain fishing nets, new railway equipment, and diesel engines for fishing boats.

### Britain Actively Prepares to Participate in the Peace Conference with Japan

Currently Exchanging Opinions with the Dominions

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Regarding MacArthur's proposal that the US government convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, Britain and the Dominions are currently exchanging opinions on this matter. It is reported that Britain has also provided guarantees to Australia and New Zealand's request to be major participants in the peace conference with Japan, backing them up. According to political figures here, the US State Department will likely accept MacArthur's proposal. The first task for Secretary of State Marshall after returning to Washington from Moscow will be to consider convening a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible. Considering that the US government previously ordered MacArthur to allocate 30% of Japan's war industry to China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines as reparations, but did not mention the requirements of Australia and New Zealand, it is imperative that Britain exchange opinions with its Dominions.

### Sugar Merchants Speculating, Authorities Investigating Thoroughly

Recently, with the resurgence of price inflation, the market price of sugar has also exceeded the negotiated price. The reporter visited Director Wu of the Social Bureau yesterday to inquire about this matter. Director Wu stated that the price of sugar has been jointly negotiated several times since September last year, and Taiwan Sugar Corporation has distributed sugar on a regular basis. The quantity is sufficient, and there is no problem with the supply. The recent rise in sugar prices is obviously caused by general speculative hoarders, and personnel are being sent to conduct a thorough investigation. In order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to hoard and to benefit the people, the Bureau has proposed to restore the household sugar rationing method at the first price evaluation meeting. The committee has passed the proposal, and all procedures are being expedited. After the resumption of household sugar at par, the general public will have a place to obtain sugar, and they will not need to search for it on the black market. In addition, the sugar distributed by Taiwan Sugar Corporation on a regular basis has been temporarily suspended due to the ongoing household sugar rationing. The company has been requested to temporarily suspend the distribution to avoid the sugar from flowing into the black market and fueling speculation.

### No Merchant Ships in Reparations, Shipping Industry Expresses Surprise, Private Ship Compensation Committee Urges Authorities to Pay Attention

[Report from our newspaper] According to a statement made by Zhong Shandao, the person in charge of the Private Ship Compensation Committee, there are no merchant ships included in the Japanese reparations. The Chinese shipping industry is very surprised and intends to propose to the government that it urge the Far Eastern Reparations Commission to pay attention. Furthermore, the Chinese shipping industry expresses its firm opposition to MacArthur's policy. Since Japan is a country that built its foundation on the ocean, its maritime power must be restricted, regardless of future international situations in the Far East. Furthermore, given that China's future national fortune is greatly dependent on the development of maritime power, it is imperative to strive resolutely. Currently, Japan has more than 1.5 million tons of remaining warships. The scale of Japan's shipbuilding heavy industry, preserved under MacArthur's protective policies, is very large. Its shipbuilding capacity could once again make it a first-class maritime power in the world within ten years. Therefore, all levels of the Chinese government and people must fully pay attention to the consequences arising from MacArthur's policy.

In addition: The committee will soon publish a written statement to attract the attention of the authorities and the US government, and will send telegrams to both houses of the US Congress to appeal. Mr. Zhou plans to travel to Nanjing next week to make recommendations to relevant parties.

### Southern Goods Merchant Song Zhuozai Suspected of Being a Traitor, Initial Trial Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] The case against Song Zhuozai, who runs a business selling southern goods, on suspicion of being a traitor, was heard for the first time in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Song is accused of serving as a member of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Welfare Association during the enemy and puppet period. When puppet government chairman Chen Gongbo, puppet Shanghai mayor Zhou Fohai, and puppet chief economic advisor Japanese national Ogura Masatsune, and others came to Shanghai, the defendant was listed as one of the participants in welcoming them. The accuser presented photographic evidence of the news published in the "Xinwen Bao" at that time. He is also accused of soliciting donations for airplanes and contributions of copper and iron, and of being sworn brothers with Xue Youwen, the puppet special higher section chief who has already been sentenced to life imprisonment. Presiding Judge Liu questioned him about each of the charges. The defendant simply replied "No" or "I don't know." Regarding the reason for the accusation by the accuser Wang Zhenzhong, he claimed, "Wang is a second landlord who assigned the house at No. 40 Zhejiang Road to the defendant in the 31st year [of the Republic], and a contract was established. Recently, the Wang family has gone back on their word and intends to take it back, but the defendant did not agree, leading to resentment." Regarding the relationship with Xue Youwen, he claimed they only knew each other and denied being sworn brothers. Xue Youwen was then brought in to testify. Xue said: "Song's southern goods store was located in Dongxinqiao. I served as the deputy detective in the Lao Zha police station. Dongxinqiao was within the jurisdiction of the Lao Zha police station. Once, the store reported a theft, and that's how we met. We can't even be called friends." Afterwards, defense attorney Gui Yu presented the house assignment contract signed by Wang and Song in the 31st year, to prove the accuser's motives. He also presented the New China Manual to prove that the defendant's name was not included on the list of puppet Municipal Welfare Association members. Finally, Presiding Judge Liu declared: "This case still needs further investigation. The defendant is entrusted to the defense attorney, and in addition to the original guarantor, another reputable shop must be added as guarantor."

### China Should Be an Invited Country to the Peace Conference with Germany Based on the Potsdam Agreement, Wang Zhuyi Expresses His Opinion

After Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference that China should be an invited country to the Peace Conference with Germany, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang issued a solemn statement the other day. A reporter visited Wang Zhuyi, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Branch of the National Diplomatic Association, to ask about this issue, which has attracted much attention from all parties. Wang Zhuyi expressed the following opinion: Whether from any angle, China is no less qualified than the Soviet Union to be an invited country to the Peace Conference. China was the first country to oppose aggression and declare war on Germany. Because of its full-scale war against Japan, it was unable to travel across the ocean to participate in military actions against Germany. Because it did not participate in military actions against Germany, it did not participate in the signing of the German surrender. However, from the overall perspective of the war situation, China consistently restrained Japan on the Far Eastern battlefield, making Japan unable to assist Germany, attack the Soviet Union, accelerate Germany's collapse, and end the entire world war ahead of schedule. Today, China is only demanding the strict implementation of the Potsdam Agreement and is not making any demands beyond this agreement. The Potsdam Agreement is the basic agreement for dealing with aggressors and rebuilding peace, and no country should be allowed to undermine it. We cherish the friendship of the Soviet Union and look forward to the Soviet Union changing its attitude, working together for international cooperation based on the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, to lay the foundation for the permanent peace of the future world.

### Academic Lecture by the Asian Literary Society, Jiang Tingfu Discusses China's Lifeline

[Report from our newspaper] Former Executive Director Jiang Tingfu was invited by the Shanghai Shangxian Hall (International Institute of China) yesterday to give a lecture on "China's Lifeline" at the Asian Literary Society, No. 20, Museum Road, at 5:30 PM. Shangxian Hall is an academic organization of international figures in this city with a history of more than 40 years. It is now cooperating with the Asian Literary Society to regularly hold lectures by famous people. The following is a summary of Mr. Jiang's speech yesterday: "Since the end of World War II, the development of international relations has been quite disappointing, and everyone hopes to improve it. Originally, international politics can be divided into two types: one is power politics, and the other is ideal politics. It is undeniable that the existence of power politics in the international arena today is an important fact. What power politics strives for is strategic areas and materials needed for strategic purposes. However, people cannot live without bread, nor can they live solely on bread. Humans have ideals and principles. Fighting for ideals and principles is more important than strategic struggles.

China's lifeline is not in ports, islands, coastlines, or the competition for materials. China's lifeline lies in being able to freely develop a social and economic system based on the will and circumstances of the Chinese people, without external interference.

The current world situation is a confrontation between the two major forces of the United States and the Soviet Union. Both sides believe in the perfection of their own systems and hold the prejudice of "either me or you." However, from an individual perspective, social and economic systems are highly adaptable. The system that China should develop is neither American nor Soviet. China cannot adopt the American-style private capital system because of the Chinese people's traditional concepts and lack of interest in the private capital system. Some industries, such as railways, munitions, and oil refining, must currently be operated by the government. In the future, as modern technology develops, industries such as water conservancy and electricity will also be more advantageous for the government to operate. Chinese historical traditions do not oppose the government doing more. As for the issue of efficiency, it can be gradually improved. On the other hand, China cannot be like the Soviet Union, where the national economy is completely controlled by the government. Because the Chinese people have a stronger individualistic color, and the traditional system of private land ownership has a history of thousands of years, the Soviet-style collective farms are impossible to implement in China. Moreover, the advantage of the collective system lies in the large-scale use of machinery, which is not the case in China. Because China's main crop is rice, and rice cultivation is more difficult to mechanize.

Therefore, China's social and economic system is one in which government enterprises and private enterprises coexist. Their proportions may vary from time to time, but it is believed that they will not follow the American or Soviet model. If the social and economic systems of countries around the world can have more variations other than the United States and the Soviet Union, then this world may be more sound."

### Rebuilding Hengfeng Bridge Requires 2 Billion

Public Works Bureau Hosted Reporters for a Tour Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] The Public Works Bureau hosted reporters from this city at 2:00 PM yesterday for a tour of the Hengfeng Bridge reconstruction project. At the original site of the bridge, there was previously a wooden bridge, commonly known as the Shanbanchang New Bridge. It connects the North Second Road of Zhongzheng in the south and Hengfeng Road in the north. The North Railway Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Zhabei area all use the bridge, which is extremely convenient. During the period of the occupation, it was dismantled by the enemy and puppets, causing the north-south transportation artery to be interrupted. All transportation vehicles had to change routes through the bridges in the lower reaches of the Suzhou River, and the traffic between the North Railway Station and the western part of Shanghai had to detour through the central area, which caused traffic congestion in the central area. The situation became severe and urgently needed to be resolved. In view of this, the Public Works Bureau proposed the reconstruction of the Hengfeng Road Bridge. In January of last year, the Municipal Council passed a resolution to actively plan it, and construction began in February of this year.

### Using Reinforced Concrete

The Public Works Bureau has been planning the design since June of the 35th year [of the Republic], and the drawings and budget were completed in October of the same year. The design principle is that the geology of Shanghai is soft, and the bridge seats of various bridges in the lower reaches of the Suzhou River often sink, making it difficult to remedy. Although the building structures such as the linked beam and the cantilever beam save materials and increase the span, it is also difficult to save them after the bridge seat is found to be sinking. After weighing the pros and cons, it was decided to use a five-hole single-beam bridge seat made of reinforced concrete and a movable steel bearing plate at the bottom of the bridge seat. If the bridge seat or abutment sinks, the steel bearing plate can be stretched and moved at any time, so that the bridge itself will not be affected in any way.

### Over 600 Million Yuan Has Been Paid

After the design of the project was completed, it was entrusted to the China Bridge Company. Construction of the bridge began on February 20th of this year. To date, a total of more than 600 million yuan of public funds have been spent, of which more than 470 million yuan has been used for the purchase of materials, accounting for 77%, and the labor part accounting for 23%. The main part of the cement has been requested to be allocated from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and most of the wood has been ordered from the Central Trust Company. Other materials have also been purchased through price comparison.

The budget for the bridge, calculated in October of the 35th year [of the Republic], was more than 800 million yuan in national currency. However, with the recent soaring prices of materials, it is estimated that the project will require a total of more than 2 billion yuan. A supplementary budget is currently being prepared and submitted to the municipal government for approval.

### Cultural Catastrophe, Antiquities Flowing Overseas, Antique Dealers Collecting Everywhere and Smuggling Them Out of the Country to Exchange for Foreign Exchange

According to reliable sources, several large antique dealers are currently collecting historical relics from all over China in places such as Beijing and Shanghai, and transporting them to the United States for sale in exchange for US dollar foreign exchange. It is heard that a hundred or so boxes of extremely valuable calligraphy and paintings, stone carvings, ancient bronzes, pottery, ancient porcelain, pottery figurines, etc., were secretly smuggled out of Shanghai two or three days ago. According to regulations, the customs has long banned the export of antiquities. Therefore, they are extremely secretive before shipment and use various relationships to smuggle them out. Furthermore, it is known that many of the Qing imperial family's old collection of antiquities were gradually shipped out under the name of being awarded to Pujie (Puyi's younger brother). Among them, ancient paintings are the most valuable. They were almost completely lost in the puppet palace in Changchun during the victory, and have recently been discovered in the Beijing and Shanghai areas. After hearing the news, the Ancient Palace Museum spent huge sums of money to recover several pieces, but many are still scattered abroad. It is also heard that many have fallen into the hands of antique dealers and will also be shipped to the United States for sale. Currently, people in this city who care about cultural relics have contacted the Antiquities Preservation Committee and the customs to find ways to prevent this, so as to prevent important cultural relics of our country from falling into foreign lands. According to a cultural relics and archaeology expert, a reporter was told that there are a large number of extremely important and valuable cultural relics in our country that are scattered abroad. For example, the best Zhan bronzes are in the United States, and the best Han bricks are in Canada. In addition to those flowing into Japan, a large number of famous paintings are in the United States. London, Paris, Sweden and other places also have a large number of extremely valuable antiquities from our country in their collections. During the War of Resistance against Japan, because of inconvenient transportation, there was less outflow of cultural relics than there is now. After the victory, overseas transportation was smooth, and unscrupulous antique dealers secretly and massively transported antiquities out of the country. This is a very large loss to our country. It is hoped that the government will quickly pay attention to this and strictly crack down on it, so as to preserve the only remaining part of our national quintessence.

### Two Thieves Who Stole Yang Pine Logs Are Caught

[Report from our newspaper] A barren field of the Yangshupu Power Plant in eastern Shanghai had a Yang pine log with a diameter of 24 inches, estimated to be worth 3-4 million yuan. Unexpectedly, it was stolen on the evening of the 6th. The owner, Zixingji Transportation Firm No. 512, 33 Sichuan Middle Road, reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau, which ordered all branches to pay close attention. It was later discovered by the Water Police Bureau that Ding Guigen, a suspected receiver of stolen goods, was planning to sell it, and he was detained for questioning. According to his confession, the theft was committed by Sun Wengui and Hua Xiaohu. The police were then ordered to go to the thatched shed at No. 7 Beihuajing Road to arrest Sun Wengui, and to No. 6 Sanrong West Road, Lao Sanjing, Pudong to arrest Hua Xiaohu. Both confessed to the theft after being brought to the bureau for questioning, and will be sent to the judicial authorities for trial soon.

### The Sugar Dispute, Both Parties Have Different Views

[Report from our newspaper] In the case of the sugar dispute at Xintaichang Firm, Prosecutor Liang Gengsheng of the District Prosecutor's Office summoned both parties for interrogation yesterday. Zhou Qibai (female) arrived at the court in a black-market private car at around 3:00 PM, dressed in a flamboyant manner. According to her, the original owner of the batch of Taiwanese sugar was named Xu Chuyuan, who later transferred and sold it several times. She purchased it from Zheng Dangquan in October of last year and holds proof. However, Huang Xianzhang claimed that the batch of Taiwanese sugar actually belonged to him and was stored in the Tongfeng Firm. Because he planned to export the sugar, he entrusted Zhou Qibai to handle the procedures and find a way to transport it out. All the evidence therefore fell into Zhou's hands. Zhou intentionally embezzled the sugar, moved it to Xintaichang, and presented witnesses Gu Qilu, Zhang Baorong, and Bi Jinjun. All three witnesses were able to clearly state the above facts. Prosecutor Liang determined that both parties had different views and that evidence needed to be investigated before it could be determined whether Zhou Qibai had engaged in fraudulent and deceptive behavior, and ordered a new hearing to be scheduled.

### Male Body Found Bound and with Knife Wounds

[Report from our newspaper] At 11:00 AM on the 16th, a male body was found in the Huangpu River in the North Ticket Terminal waters by the Huangpu South District Station of the Water Police Bureau.

A square wooden stamp with the four characters "Xie Guangming's Seal" was found in the pocket of his clothes. Upon close inspection, the deceased appeared to be a rural laborer who had been murdered and thrown into the Huangpu River. The body was retrieved and sent to the Tongren Fuyuantang funeral home. According to experienced staff at the funeral home, the deceased's hair had fallen out, indicating that he had been in the water for too long. The Water Police Bureau has dispatched personnel to take photographs for record-keeping. Relatives and friends who recognize the body can inquire at the Criminal Division of the Water Police Bureau.

### Notorious Gang Leader from Tianshenggang Arrested in Shanghai While Seeking Medical Treatment

[Report from our newspaper] Chen Youqing, a notorious gangster from Haimen, has been leading gangs in the Tianshenggang area of Nantong, committing numerous major robberies. In mid-August of last year, Ni Hanchun, the captain of the Criminal Police Team of the Chongming County Police Bureau, was riding a public bus in Tianshenggang with his officers when several of Chen's henchmen, armed with guns, suddenly boarded the bus and robbed all the passengers of their belongings. Even the official firearms of Ni and his men were taken. A month ago, Chen sent someone to contact Ni, promising to return the firearms and compensate for everything. Ni ignored the offer. It was recently discovered that Chen was the head of the People's Self-Defense Corps in Haimen, using the alias Tang Weishi. He recently went to Pudong to sell machine guns, but accidentally misfired, injuring his abdomen. He was accompanied to Shanghai for treatment at the China-America Hospital. Ni then prepared an official document and came to Shanghai to request the assistance of the Xincheng Police Branch. Zhuo, the branch director, ordered Section Chief Ding and officers Fang Shengwu and Gu Zhuobin to accompany Captain Ni to the China-America Hospital. They successfully arrested the main culprit, Chen Youqing, along with suspected accomplices Niu Chaozuo, Ni Wangnan, Chen Zhijiang (Chen Youqing's father), and a young woman, Xu Ding, who were taking care of him in the ward. All were taken to the police station for questioning, where they all denied involvement. However, it has been learned that several of Chen's accomplices, including Yang Hesheng, Lu Yun, and Xiaoyu Jinniang, have been frequenting Shanghai, staying at places like the Guanshi Da Shanghai Hotel and the Anshang Hostel on Yunnan Road. Police were dispatched to search for them, but they had all returned to the countryside. Chen and the other five suspects are to be handed over to Captain Ni to be taken back to Chongming County for further investigation.

### Dancer Accuses Bank Manager of Violence Over Items Demanded at Cinema, Biting Her Teeth and Calling Him 'Heartless'

[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Mingxia, a dancer from the Yangzi Dance Hall ten years ago, accused Gao Bokang, an assistant manager at Zhejiang Jianye Bank, of assault. The case was prosecuted by the District Procuratorate and was heard yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Mei Erhe. According to the defendant, Gao Bokang, Zhang Mingxia was a prostitute ten years ago, and was eighteen years old at the time. He redeemed her with two hundred gold pieces and sent her to Yangzi as a dancer. However, Zhang was too tall, and her dancing business was slow. When he occasionally went to support her, Zhang would complain and beg to marry him so that she could rely on him for the rest of her life. Thus, they once lived together, but they had long since separated. Zhang Mingxia claimed that she is now twenty-eight years old and had once lived with Gao. On March 13th of this year, she met Gao Bokang at the Shanghai Guangda Theater. Remembering that he had taken a watch and one tael of gold from her in the past, she demanded them back. The defendant not only refused to return them but also assaulted her, injuring her head. She requested that he be severely punished. The court scheduled sentencing for the 24th. When the two left the courtroom, Zhang Mingxia gritted her teeth and said to Gao, "Gao Bokang, you are so heartless. I will make you pay!" Gao did not answer and left with a smile.

### Reader Consultation Legal Clarification

Stolen Tombstones

Li Mingfeng asks: My late father's tomb has a tomb path made of stone. In May of the 33rd year of the Republic, I discovered that it had been stolen and sold. However, the local situation was complicated at the time, and I was unable to stop it. After investigation, it was found that my elder brother was responsible. I declared the property rights in the newspaper in April of the 33rd year of the Republic, and at the same time hired workers to retrieve the original items. The buyer did not interfere. However, in January of the following year, the buyer secretly removed the stone materials again. Recently, I hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in court accusing the buyer of damaging the tomb (Article 353 of the Criminal Law). However, the court believes that my elder brother sold the materials and that the civil lawsuit must be resolved before the case can be accepted. I have now withdrawn the case temporarily according to the court's instructions. I would like to ask: (1) Can tombstone building materials be bought and sold? (2) Can jointly owned property be disposed of individually? (3) Does my prior declaration of property rights in the newspaper have legal effect? (4) The sales contract is not in my late father's handwriting, and the intermediary also did not sign. It seems to have been written by the buyer. Is it valid? (5) How should the civil lawsuit be handled to be effective? (6) Can I file a public prosecution by directly reporting to the Prosecutor's Office? (7) If the buyer A resells to B, who resells to C, and C has built a tomb, is C jointly liable? (8) Does the delay in filing a lawsuit until now due to the enemy-occupied period mean that the statute of limitations has expired? (9) I have no physical evidence. The defendant's physical evidence consists only of two unwritten sales contracts. Is it possible to demolish someone else's tomb? (10) Can witness testimony be used as a basis?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) Yes. (2) No. (3) It cannot be used to oppose a "bona fide third party who is unaware of the situation." (4) A sales contract does not require handwritten form to be valid, so the sales contract is still valid even if it is not in the seller's handwriting. (5) According to the provisions on co-ownership in the Civil Code's Book of Property Rights, the co-owner should request the court to confirm that the sales contract is invalid, and then request the buyer to return the co-owned property. (6) No, because the same case has already been filed as a private prosecution and withdrawn, it cannot be filed as a public prosecution with the Prosecutor's Office again. (7) Not liable, because joint liability is limited to cases where it is explicitly and voluntarily assumed, or where it is stipulated by law. (8) The statute of limitations has not expired. (9) It depends on who owns the property. Within the scope of legal restrictions, the owner can freely dispose of their property, that is, they can demolish their own tomb. (10) It can be used as a method of proof.

### Salary Grades for Teachers in Schools in Jiangxi Province Determined

[Report from our newspaper, Nanchang] The salary grades and annual increment methods for principals and teachers in provincial secondary and higher schools in Jiangxi Province have been approved by the provincial government. It is understood that the salaries paid to principals and teachers in various secondary and higher schools in Jiangxi Province have in fact exceeded the standards set by the Ministry. For example, graduates of domestic universities can only be ranked at the fifth or fourth level of assigned posts at most, but in reality, most start at the third level of assigned posts. In another case, graduates of domestic and foreign universities with specialized publications that have passed review can be ranked from the twelfth or tenth level of recommended posts up to the fifth level of selected posts. However, teachers in specialized schools with qualifications equivalent to civil officials are ranked from the fifth level of recommended posts up to the third level of selected posts, which is much more lenient than the ranking of civil officials. Therefore, it is difficult to adequately meet the needs with the civil servant salary ranking method. However, it is heard that the salaries of teachers and staff in other provinces are actually higher than those in Jiangxi Province.

### Key Focus of Secondary Education in Shanghai: Expanding Vocational Education, Qibao Agricultural School to Open this Autumn

[Report from our newspaper] The key focus of the Municipal Education Bureau's work in secondary education for the 36th year of the Republic is to expand vocational education. It has been decided to add six schools: (1) Senior Midwifery School, (2) Senior Nursing School, (3) Shipbuilding Vocational School, (4) Fisheries Vocational School, (5) Agricultural Vocational School, (6) Secondary Business School. The Midwifery and Nursing Schools have already started classes in cooperation with the Health Bureau, but due to late enrollment, only one class has been recruited at each school. In the autumn, two classes can be recruited at each school. The preparation of the Shipbuilding Vocational School has been discussed with the Jiangnan Shipyard, which has agreed to assist, but there is no school building, so it cannot be established. Only a shipbuilding department can be attached to the Municipal Industrial College first, which has also started classes. The preparation of the Fisheries Vocational School has received support from the Fish Market authorities. They will soon convene all fish merchants to raise funds to build a school building on Fuxing Island. The Agricultural School will be established in Gaohang in the 7th and 2nd districts respectively.

### Teacher Training College in Fujian Province on Strike, Demanding to be Upgraded to Teacher's College; States that it will not Rest Until its Goal is Achieved

[Report from our newspaper, Fuzhou, 17th] Students at the Fujian Provincial Teacher Training College went on strike yesterday because their request to be upgraded to a teacher's college was not granted. According to the student union: When Chairman Liu visited the school last year, he promised to upgrade it within a year, and he should fulfill his promise now. Taiwan and Anhui provinces already have provincially run normal colleges, and Fujian province should follow suit. Furthermore, the Teacher Training College has been running for six years and is roughly of scale, so upgrading it would not increase the government's burden too much. If this legitimate request is not approved by the government, they will not resume classes, and they hope that all sectors will show sympathy.

### Soaring Yarn Prices and Cotton Shortages: Private Yarn Factories Face Difficulties; All Private Yarn Factory Committee Members of the Textile Control Committee Resign

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, and the other four private yarn factory committee members of the Textile Control Committee recently submitted their resignations due to the repeated soaring of yarn prices, cotton shortages in various factories, and unprecedented difficulties in resuming production. As Wang and the others are also standing directors of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District and serve as members of the Textile Control Committee, they are caught in a difficult position between implementing the government's decision to stabilize yarn prices and ensuring the survival of various private yarn factories. After days of discussion, they finally submitted their resignations collectively to the Textile Control Committee yesterday afternoon. The resignation letters were submitted by Wang Zhuyi, deputy secretary-general of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District, to Wu Guozhen, concurrent chairman of the Textile Control Committee, at 4 p.m. yesterday. It is reported that Chairman Wu is well aware of the current difficult situation faced by private yarn factories and expressed great sympathy. He expressed his desire to retain Wang and the others and instructed Wang to persuade the four committee members to attend a meeting at the Municipal Government this afternoon to discuss solutions to the difficulties.

According to Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District, yesterday, he told reporters that he and others, as members of the Textile Control Committee, are constantly seeking proper solutions for the future of China's cotton textile industry. However, the current difficulties are numerous, and they have ultimately failed to achieve a thorough solution. Feeling that continuing to hold their positions without action would be inappropriate, they had no choice but to resign. He suggested to Chairman Wu yesterday (the 17th) that a thorough plan be devised for the cotton textile industry to balance the national policy of stabilizing yarn prices and maintaining the survival of the industry. Chairman Wu expressed great sympathy for this. He believes that under this major premise, national and private yarn factories must act in unison, raw materials must be distributed equally, raw material prices must be determined, and the cost price of resumed production must be calculated reasonably and accurately. Otherwise, private yarn factories will be unable to survive, and national yarn factories will be unable to stand firm. He believes that the biggest difficulties facing the cotton spinning industry are still the shortage of cotton and the fact that negotiated prices are insufficient to cover costs. According to a survey at the end of last year, the average cotton inventory in each factory was about four to five months. Now that April has passed, the depletion of inventory in each factory is urgent. Since the sale of yarn began in September last year, not a single bale of foreign cotton has been settled. Although 24,000 bales of the 50,000 bales of cotton arriving in Shanghai from the Joint Administration have been allocated and contracts have been signed, the goods have not yet been received. There are countless practical difficulties. He hopes to obtain a thorough solution so that each factory can maintain the resumed production of cotton yarn.

### Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Decline in Unison

There was not much change in cotton yarn at the morning opening, but when the news of Tianjin's export ban spread in the market, people's confidence waned, and asking prices declined in unison. Except for 42-count Blue Phoenix, which saw a slight increase in asking price, most other counts declined, and the situation outside the market was quite scattered.

Cotton cloth suddenly declined sharply. The news report of Tianjin's export ban made people nervous, and the purchasing by out-of-town buyers became sluggish. Most bulls, seeing the unfavorable situation, frequently showed signs of panic selling, and asking prices declined in unison. Dragon Head fine cloth was asking for 220,000 yuan, but few people inquired. Five Blessings was 212,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen Gold Seal drill was 216,000 yuan, and other colored cloth, such as shilin, also softened.

### Social Affairs Bureau First Sells White Rice: Off-Floor Prices Continue to Rise; Rice Merchants Ask Mayor to Suppress Prices in Production Areas

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Rice prices in production areas such as Wuxi have continued to rise in recent days, which has also led to higher prices in this city. The special commissioners sent by Chairman Jiang to investigate grain prices have arrived in various production areas to effectively suppress rice prices in the production areas.

The sale price of red xian rice was 120,500 yuan, 125,000 yuan for negotiated transactions, and the retail price could not exceed 132,000 yuan.

Yesterday, only over 2,700 shi of goods were registered in the north and south markets. White japonica rice was still 144,000 yuan in the market, and off-floor prices continued to rise. White yin yuan continued to rise wildly by 10,000 yuan, and geng xian rice saw little trading. The situation was still rising. The Social Affairs Bureau's sale of nearly 10,000 bags of rice stabilized prices.

Qu Zhenhua, Xu Songren, Cha Baosan, Hu Wen'an, and Hu Xiangang, the responsible persons of the rice industry, went to the Municipal Government at 9 a.m. yesterday to meet with Mayor Wu and explain the current difficulties of the rice merchants. Because prices in the production areas have been rising continuously, it is difficult for rice merchants to purchase and transport rice. They hoped that the prices in the production areas would be suppressed as soon as possible. Mayor Wu replied that the commissioners sent by the government have now arrived in the production areas to suppress prices and restore order, which should be effective within a few days. The Municipal Government will also sell white rice, Saigon rice, and red xian rice every day. The city has a large inventory of foreign rice. Recently, 450,000 bags have arrived in Shanghai, and more will be shipped in the future. This will supply the needs of the citizens and maintain prices until the new grain is harvested. Therefore, rice prices should gradually fall within a few days.

Import of Foreign Rice

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Foreign rice has been imported again. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai" ship arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the day before yesterday, carrying 2,020 tons of rice (20,200 bags) from Siam, which is now being unloaded at the Zhongzhan Wharf. Among them, 520 tons are said to be donated by the Siamese government to our government, and the remaining 1,500 tons were purchased by the China National Trust and Investment Corporation.

Flour Loosens

Another report: Flour has loosened and fallen back by 2,000 yuan. Wheat bran is selling very slowly, and the situation is sluggish. Bean cake continues to rise by more than 1,000 yuan. However, because 7,000 to 8,000 bags of soybeans arrived in Shanghai from Hankou, people's confidence suddenly softened, and the price fell back by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Green beans are selling evenly, and the price is firm. Red beans are also rising firmly. Raw peanuts from foreign firms have become weak, and local traders expect a decline of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Sesame is stable, and corn is selling well to alcohol factories, with prices rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

### Frozen Fish Trade Suddenly Suspended Yesterday

Recently, the Shanghai Fish Merchants Association established a joint cashier's office and changed the payment method for fish vendors. Because it did not get the consent of the relevant parties, it caused opposition from the fish vendors, who stopped buying fish, resulting in no frozen fish at the market yesterday. However, the current period is the peak season for spring fish, and both production and sales parties will inevitably suffer adverse effects. At 2 p.m. yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting, including four representatives from the Fish Merchants Association, including Zhang Xinchang, four representatives from the Fish Vendors Association, including Wu Qiding, four representatives from the Seafood Transportation Association, including Jiang Guo, and fish market representatives Lu Yinchu and Ling Anlan, to discuss solutions. Department Director Wang and Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau attended. It was decided on the spot that the joint cashier's office method previously determined by the Fish Merchants Association would be suspended, and transactions would be restored immediately. A written record was made, and the responsible representatives signed it, bringing the matter to a close.

### Oil and Grease Prices Rise and Fall Unevenly

The oil and grease market fluctuated sharply. Coconut oil once soared to 850,000 yuan per dan, and there were many transactions at 800,000 yuan. However, under the high prices, many people sold out. The asking price yesterday was 600,000 yuan, and soap factories' appetite weakened, with few transactions. Asphalt, used by candle and soap factories, was still being absorbed, and the market price of Heben still stood at a high of 450,000 yuan. Prices in the production areas were very strong. According to Hongchang Trading Company in this city, there is little source of goods from Hankou, and many people who went to purchase were reluctant to start because of the high prices. Beef tallow prices are still stable, with no significant increase or decrease. Actual sales are sluggish.

### Appeal of the Transfer Industry

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Transfer Industry Association believes that the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Railway Administration's establishment of freight business offices in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou has oppressed and devastated the transfer industry. They invited the press yesterday and listed significant facts: (1) Exclusive joint transportation, (2) Adding mixed cars, (3) Special rights for car allocation, (4) Different car allocation, (5) Waste of tonnage, (6) Complex procedures, (7) Use of freight yards, (8) Operations of the business offices, etc.

### Tung Oil Suddenly Soars

It is reported that the money market in Hankou is extremely tight. The exchange rate for remittances to Hankou has risen to 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Banks such as the Bank of Communications are unable to recognize the remittances because Hankou has no position. Tung oil prices soared yesterday. Full-weight tung oil has risen to 440,000 yuan per dan, and Xihong has exceeded 400,000 yuan. The customer's inventory is insufficient. In addition, the tung oil market in Hankou also rose to 340,000 yuan, people's confidence is strengthening, and transactions are becoming more active.

### Coal Arrivals and Inventory Are Both Thin

The coal market is gradually gaining traction, and people's confidence is strong. Arrivals and inventory of white coal Jiaozuo lump coal are both thin, and once it is bought up, there is another shortage. Arrivals of other small mine white coal are intermittent, and the quality varies. The usual market price has no standard. Yesterday, the asking price was 10% to 20% higher than before. Anthracite coal is continuing the previous upward trend, and market prices continue to be strong. Kaiping No. 1 layer has risen to 745,000 yuan, No. 2 layer is also close to 700,000 yuan, and low-grade goods, such as the Baoshan layer, also had a large number of transactions at 380,000 yuan.

### Sugar Market Trend Is Dull

The sugar market has been extremely dull in recent days. Yesterday, the opening price of Zhuang Qing was 210,000, falling back to 200,900 yuan and 200,800 yuan, with only 40 to 50 bags traded. Zhang Diao Qing initially traded at 190,000, falling to 188,000, and closed at 189,000 yuan, with 260 bags traded. Xinghua white high-grade goods traded at 300,000, medium-grade at 290,000, and Xinghua red high-grade goods at 200,000, with few transactions.

### Edible Oil and Grains Are Prohibited from Export; Edible Oil Rationing Resumes Yesterday

To stabilize the people's food supply, Mayor Wu, in view of the large amount of edible oil and grains being smuggled out, telegraphed the Executive Yuan to prohibit export sales. The Executive Yuan recently approved a resolution restricting the export of soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, cottonseed, soybean oil, crude oil, sesame oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, and other grains and oils. Mayor Wu and the Jianghai Customs discussed and agreed that from today onwards, the above-mentioned grains and oils will be restricted from export.

The edible oil joint allocation office resumed rationing yesterday. There were 113 retailers who went to pay and receive oil, which was not very enthusiastic. The allocation price was 400,000 yuan per dan, and the retail price could not exceed the limit of 4,400 yuan per jin. Rationing will continue today, and the black market is expected to gradually disappear.

### National Bank Stipulates Procedures for Foreign Cotton Exchange Settlement and Payment

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The foreign cotton import quota of US$40 million from February to April this year has been settled with Citibank by the National Bank, and the details have been recorded in this newspaper on the 15th. Yesterday, the National Bank issued Circular No. 95 to all designated banks, stipulating eight items for the foreign cotton exchange settlement and payment method, which are recorded as follows:

(1) Foreign cotton spinning mills may apply to Citibank Shanghai through designated banks for the issuance of purchase certificates to American cotton exporters. The application form will be provided by Citibank New York. Each purchase certificate contract shall be signed by the spinning mill and co-signed by the designated bank to guarantee the payment of drafts issued under the purchase certificate.

(2) After obtaining the purchase certificate, the spinning mill shall prepare a draft payable at sight for the American cotton transporter to collect and present to Citibank New York for acceptance.

(3) The designated bank shall collect a deposit from the spinning mill equal to the purchase certificate price, calculated in national currency, and deposit it into a special account of the Central Bank called "American Cotton Deposit."

(4) After the American cotton is inspected and released by the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai, or 21 days after the ship carrying the American cotton arrives in port (whichever is earlier), Citibank Shanghai may submit the drafts issued by the respective spinning mills and request monthly foreign exchange allocation to pay in New York telegraphic transfer. The spinning mill shall deposit the price in national currency into the Central Bank's "American Cotton Guarantee" account. If the official exchange rate changes, resulting in an insufficient amount of national currency equivalent to the unexpired foreign exchange allocation, the spinning mill and the designated bank shall be responsible for making up the difference.

(5) For the portion of the price that is not yet due for foreign exchange allocation, the American cotton importing spinning mill shall issue a US dollar draft payable by the designated bank and pay it on the first business day of each month (one installment draft should be issued each month) and sign it. The draft shall be accepted by the designated bank and sent to Citibank Shanghai for the designated bank to cash out when the monthly foreign exchange allocation is due. When the installment draft is presented at maturity, the designated bank shall purchase foreign exchange on behalf of the spinning mill and remit it to Citibank New York for payment.

(6) The designated bank shall deliver the telegraphic transfer receipt to Citibank Shanghai and simultaneously transfer the equivalent amount of national currency from the Central Bank's "American Cotton Guarantee" account.

(7) The designated bank's commission for handling the purchase certificate on behalf of the spinning mill shall include Citibank Shanghai's commission of 0.0025.

(8) For American cotton belonging to the quota allocated from February to April, if it has already arrived in port or is already en route, when issuing the purchase certificate, the transporter needs to submit a sight draft equivalent to the full value of the landed price, which will be paid by the spinning mill after customs clearance in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 above.

### Resigned to Fate vs. Standing By Without Helping

— Canglong

"Resigned to fate" is certainly not good, but "standing by without helping" is also not acceptable.

However, due to the realities of the situation, we are heading towards the path of "resigned to fate" or "standing by without helping." What is the reason for this? Because if we just open the newspaper and take a look, we can see news of quack doctors killing people or patients dying unjustly almost every day. If I were a patient, I wouldn't know which doctor to go to when I'm sick, because the doctor who is a living god today will become a killer quack tomorrow. Then who should I go to? None of the doctors can be trusted, so wouldn't I have to resign myself to fate? If I were a doctor, I would be praised to the heavens today, said to be a living god, but tomorrow I would be called a quack. Moreover, the newspapers are full of news of accusations, detentions, and fines. Even if I have done nothing wrong, I would be scared out of my wits. How would I still have the courage to see patients? Therefore, experienced doctors are always ambiguous and noncommittal. Even if you patients secretly suffer losses, it has nothing to do with me. You can't catch me on anything. I will earn my money properly. What can you do? Alas! This is truly a passive state of standing by without helping.

Is "resigned to fate" good? Of course not. Is "standing by without helping" good? Of course, it is even worse. Then what should we do? I believe that there is no other way but to raise the level of education, strive to instill medical knowledge in the public, and demand self-discipline and efforts to improve from our medical profession.

Alas! Looking at this group of ignorant and uneducated people and those quack doctors who only know how to make money and do not know how to improve, I can only sigh and put down my pen!

### On Insomnia and Its Treatment

— Liang Junqing

"A-Luo! How come you're asleep again?"

"Oh, I leave everything to sleep."

I remember in early summer three years ago, I accepted an invitation to treat a typhoid patient in Bai Xia. At that time, it was the era when the enemy and puppets were rampant. No matter what, I refused to go, but because of my old friend Luo Jun's constant pleading, I had to agree. I stayed in the patient's house for a total of fourteen days, and only after the illness subsided was I able to get away. Although it was early summer, the sultry weather in Bai Xia made people feel exceptionally stifled. Whenever I finished my medical duties, Luo Jun would accompany me in the living room for a chat, and we could talk about everything under the sun. However, after three or four days of talking, there were no more topics to talk about. So, the two of us had no choice but to stare at each other and sit silently in the living room, passing those oppressively hot afternoons. It was truly unbearable. But my friend "A-Luo" enjoyed himself and didn't mind at all. As long as you didn't have anything to say to him, he would lean back in his chair and snore away, regardless of whether I was bored or not. So, when I was bored to the extreme, I would always wake him up, calling out, "A-Luo! How come you're asleep again?" And he, always with slightly open eyes, would smile and say, "Oh, I leave everything to sleep."

Good, "Leave everything to sleep," that's truly blissful! Truly enviable to those of us who can't sleep. Therefore, I specifically chose this topic "On Insomnia and Its Treatment" to write about. This may be what readers suffering from insomnia want to read.

We all generally think that sleep is the result of fatigue, but that's not necessarily the case. According to physiological experiments, we now know that there is a nerve center in the midbrain near the brain that specializes in sleep (according to Economo's experimental report). For example, if we do an animal experiment and use a mild direct current to stimulate the so-called sleep nerve center in the animal's brain, or apply a very small amount of sleeping pills to that area, then the animal will fall asleep immediately. This type of sleep phenomenon is completely different from what we know as fainting, coma, or anesthesia, as well as the drowsiness during a mental illness attack, because the sleep phenomenon that occurs after stimulating the sleep nerve center can be awakened at any time, while fainting, coma, and anesthesia are not easy or completely impossible to wake. Based on this experiment, we know that the sleep nerve center can receive various different stimuli from the brain itself or from other parts of the body, causing it to initiate the sleep process. Conversely, if this sleep nerve center experiences an obstacle and loses its function, then insomnia can occur. Therefore, most severe cases of insomnia are due to obstacles in the base of the brain itself. In addition, we must also know that many insomnia phenomena are caused by mental suggestions, because mental stimulation and psychological unease can often affect the function of the sleep nerve center. For example, for healthy people, simply making the room a little darker, isolating it from external noise, and loosening tight clothing can make it easier to fall asleep. But for people who are easily stimulated (such as patients with mental illness or neurasthenia), it's different. Using the above method is not effective. We must use other methods, such as improving lifestyle, improving diet, improving psychological suggestions, applying mild sleeping pills, and using physical therapy, all of which are necessary. This type of insomnia in mental illness or neurasthenia has its unique characteristic, which is that as long as one can fall asleep, the sleep nerve center can fully exert its function, allowing the patient to obtain a reasonable sleep. However, if the brain is subjected to significant stimulation or the brain is damaged, or the sleep nerve center experiences an obstacle, or the patient is experiencing significant pain, then the patient, even if able to fall asleep, cannot sleep soundly and can be awakened by any stimulus at any time. The treatment for this type of insomnia, of course, starts from the root cause. If it is insomnia due to mental or neurasthenic reasons, then it naturally starts from psychological therapy or the etiology. If it is caused by pain, then we simply need to find a way to treat that symptom, and the patient will naturally be able to sleep peacefully. For example, in cases of fractures from trauma, abscesses, and tooth extractions, if we stop the pain, then the patient can naturally fall asleep. Also, people with heart disease often have difficulty falling asleep, as do people with severe coughs, and patients with angina pectoris have particular difficulty sleeping peacefully. If we remove their pain, or stop their cough, and restore their heart function, then the patient can fall asleep even without taking sleeping pills. If the above methods are still ineffective, then we can only resort to sleeping pills. These sleeping pills directly reduce the brain's ability to sense stimulation or directly affect the base of the brain itself to induce sleep.

We all know that elderly people have difficulty falling asleep, and even when they do, they are easily awakened. Why is this? On the one hand, it is due to physiological aging, and on the other hand, it may be due to endocrine disorders, high blood pressure, and the ineffective elimination of metabolic waste products. Many elderly people believe that they haven't slept all night and can hear every chime of the clock. But if we observe carefully, they are merely waking up and falling back asleep at any time. We must not abuse sleeping pills for this type of insomnia, as it will further damage their health.

Regarding the treatment of insomnia, I believe that psychological therapy, dietary therapy, and physical therapy should be used first. If used properly, sleeping pills are often unnecessary. For example, not eating before bed, not eating too much for dinner, avoiding fermented foods, and maintaining regular bowel movements can often help patients sleep. In my personal experience, a warm water bath before bed (a 36 degrees Celsius warm water bath for half an hour) and a warm water bath with added oxygen or carbon dioxide often have a great effect. In addition, full-body massage, electrothermal massage, and direct current massage all have good effects.

As for sleeping pills, I think they can be divided into four categories: (1) mild hypnotics, (2) true sleeping pills (with a longer hypnotic effect), (3) sleeping pills for the elderly (i.e., those with a slower onset of hypnotic power and a slower elimination from the body), and (4) sedatives, which are sedatives that reduce the brain's state of stimulation and can be taken as usual during the day without affecting daytime work. Some pharmacology experts divide sleeping pills into two types: one is sleeping pills that specifically anesthetize the cerebral cortex, and the other is things that anesthetize the base of the brain itself. If the dose is too large, it can attack the medulla oblongata and cause breathing to stop. Sleeping pills that anesthetize the cerebral cortex include alcohol, Chloralhydrat, Paraldehyd, and bromides. Sleeping pills that target the base of the brain itself include Luminal, Veronal, Baldrian, Pernokton, and Somnifen. We must give them full consideration and selection when using them, otherwise it is easy to make accidental mistakes. Many people casually give patients large amounts of sleeping pills, which is a mistake, because on the one hand, it leads to the risk of patients committing suicide by overdose, and on the other hand, it can cause patients to develop a habit of taking them regularly. I once saw a lady who had insomnia for three years, and her sleeping pill dosage increased from one tablet to three tablets. She couldn't fall asleep without sleeping pills every night. Later, we all took a long trip together. Because of the long journey, she felt overly fatigued and fell asleep without taking sleeping pills. Since then, she has not used sleeping pills. From this, we can infer that sleeping pills are often overused. Shouldn't we doctors carefully consider and choose these sleeping pills? As for the medicinal properties of sleeping pills, because they are specialized and limited by space, I will have to skip them for now and talk about them next time when I have the opportunity!

### The Mystery of New Chinese Medicine (3)

— Hong Guanzhi

Now Mr. Lu wants to borrow the "experience" of objective experiments and associate it with Chinese medicine. Therefore, he exaggerates the value of Chinese medicine's experience. On the surface, it seems to make sense, but unfortunately, Mr. Lu still ignores the essence of "experience" and only works on the words. So, after saying it over and over again, it still doesn't help. It must be known that the "experience" in new philosophy does not refer to the result of subjective fantasy. Although it is also translated as "experience" in Chinese, the names are the same, but the reality is different. The so-called experience of Chinese medicine has not undergone objective experiments. This is a fact. Of course, it is not a valuable experience. How can we not admit that Chinese medicine's own experience is subjective just because there is objective experience! To be honest, the so-called "experience" of Chinese medicine is only personal "experience." It is not that Mr. Yu "narrows the scope of experience too much," but that is the fact. Strictly speaking, the experience of Chinese medicine is really not worthy of being called experience. Why? Objective experience, needless to say, even subjective experience must have a common understanding under the same subjective viewpoint, without ambiguity. For example, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west is common experience. Now we know that it is the earth's rotation, not really the "sunrise" and "sunset," but the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west is undeniable, and no one will ever say that it rises in the west and sets in the east. The sun has never exceptionally "risen in the west and set in the east." So, this kind of experience, although not valuable, is not too far from the truth, but it has not explained the true nature of the fact. However, the so-called experience of Chinese medicine is very different from this. One disease can be said to be phlegm, wind, dampness, or fire. Each person's diagnosis and judgment can be different, but they all claim to be experience. This is just "personal subjectivity" and cannot be called "experience." In addition, accidental and exceptional events are also associated with it, so there is even more experience. For example, if a woman's cun pulse is slippery, it means she is pregnant, and a rapid pulse also means she is pregnant... but we know that this kind of example is not common. Some pregnant women have slippery pulses, and some absolutely do not have slippery or rapid pulses. So, slipperiness and rapidity can only be seen as occasional and cannot be used as standards, because everyone is inconsistent. This kind of example, although it is the result of experience, cannot be compared with the subjective experience of the sun rising in the east and setting in the west, because this kind of diagnostic experience is not universally recognized and is too unreliable, so it cannot be called experience. All the arguments and treatments of Chinese medicine are like grasping at shadows and catching the wind. It has never clarified the treatment object, which is the essence of the disease. All the methods and results of treatment (the evaluation of treatment methods, efficacy, and drug effects) have also become unreliable records. How can it be called a field of knowledge? There are also many examples that are the result of observational errors. For example, we see a patient with epilepsy falling by the roadside. Someone gave him a bowl of ginger soup, and then he recovered. This seems to be a fact, it should be absolutely certain "experience," right? But in fact, it is not like this. If you encounter another patient with epilepsy and give him a bowl of ginger soup, he will continue to be crazy. In this way, the effect of ginger soup is unreliable! We know that there are many examples like this in the experience and treatment records of Chinese medicine. Some people record them and become "case studies" or "experienced" prescriptions. The value of this experience is really doubtful! (In fact, not all of it is effective.) If this kind of experience is also worth cherishing, then the idols in the temples are also very effective. Look at the temples, which are full of vermilion gold-lettered plaques, truly "powerful and effective." These plaques were sent in amid the sound of gongs, drums, and firecrackers after the gods and Buddhist disciples sincerely prayed and obtained results (?). It was not the monks or incense keepers of those temples who hung them up themselves to scare or deceive people. To put it simply, this is called a coincidental "stroke of luck." It is just a lucky coincidence, nothing great. Only the effect of drugs, part of which (not all) is the result of experiments by many people, can be called a product of "experience," but it is also subjective experience, which can only "recognize phenomena, but cannot recognize essence," and there is still a considerable distance from the truth of the facts. This kind of achievement that only knows the result but not the reason is just common sense. (To be continued)

### Prevention and Treatment of Respiratory Diseases Complicated by Measles

— Xu Shuping

Measles, commonly known as "cuo zi," is a highly prevalent acute infectious disease during the current period. According to clinical statistics, the mortality rate of patients is directly proportional to respiratory diseases. If patients do not develop respiratory diseases at the same time, the course of the disease is often smooth and without any danger. If high fever persists when the rash subsides, it is a sign of the development of complications. Therefore, taking precautions and preventing the occurrence of respiratory diseases is the key to treating this disease. The symptoms and prevention and treatment methods are briefly described below:

(1) Laryngitis

Patients with measles often have laryngitis. The symptoms are (A) hoarseness, (B) a cough that sounds like a dog barking, and (C) inspiratory stridor. At this time, a diphtheria culture should be performed for differential diagnosis, as true diphtheria can also be complicated by measles.

Prevention and Treatment: Boil water in a kettle and direct the steam into the bed tent. Adding one teaspoon of compound benzoin tincture (Tr. Benzoin Co.) to the boiling water kettle will enhance the effect.

(2) Bronchopneumonia Measles complicated by pneumonia is pathologically classified as interstitial pneumonia, which is the most dangerous complication. The symptoms are as follows: (A) rapid breathing and distressed cough, (B) blue discoloration of the lips and fingernails, (C) a sudden increase in body temperature to about 40 degrees, (D) obvious physical signs in the lungs, (E) an increase in the total number of white blood cells, with a significant increase in neutrophils in the differential count.

Prevention and Treatment: The fewer people in the patient's room, the better. Friends and relatives should not be allowed to enter at will. Family members and servants must wash their hands immediately when contacting the patient and wear masks. After a measles diagnosis is confirmed, prophylactic doses of sulfa drugs should be started to avoid the occurrence of pneumonia. However, once pneumonia has occurred, treatment requires large doses of sulfa drugs and injections of penicillin.

(3) Empyema Patients with measles often develop empyema after pneumonia. The symptoms are as follows: (A) fever and septic symptoms, (B) dyspnea and cyanosis, (C) a significant increase in white blood cells, (D) obvious physical signs in the chest, (E) diagnosis can be confirmed by X-ray and thoracentesis.

Prevention and Treatment: Preventing pneumonia first can avoid the complication of empyema. Treatment consists of repeated aspiration and injection of penicillin.

(4) Pulmonary Tuberculosis Children who have been infected with tuberculosis, once they develop measles, their resistance decreases, often allowing latent tuberculosis bacteria to suddenly break out. If the spilled tuberculosis bacteria enter the blood vessels, they can flow with the blood to various parts of the body and develop miliary tuberculosis. The symptoms are as follows: (A) irregular fever that persists, (B) rapid pulse, (C) pale complexion and listlessness, (D) weight loss, (E) splenomegaly, often without physical signs in the lungs, (F) a positive tuberculin test. If most of the spilled tuberculosis bacteria invade the lung tissue, it becomes tuberculous caseous pneumonia. The symptoms and physical signs are quite similar to pneumonia, but the course of the disease is prolonged and treatment is ineffective. At this time, tests such as white blood cell counts, X-ray fluoroscopy, and tuberculin tests should be used to differentiate it from non-tuberculous pneumonia.

Prevention and Treatment: The fewer people who are in close contact with the patient, the better. In particular, parents, servants, or relatives and friends with pulmonary tuberculosis should be absolutely prohibited from approaching the patient. Adequate nutrition, sunlight exposure, and fresh air are also important, and streptomycin can be tried, but the prognosis of this disease is mostly very poor.

Spring and Autumn

### Reunion

— Zhao Qingge

Wuhan grew more critical day by day, with air raids almost daily, causing widespread panic and making it impossible for anyone to focus on work, let alone life.

The theaters had already closed, so Lihua had to stay home. One evening, Baoling came and asked her to visit a wounded air force soldier who had been shot down during combat with enemy planes over Wuhan. Baoling wouldn't tell her who the wounded airman was, whether she knew him or not, and just dragged her along. Lihua always felt obligated to help in such situations, so she didn't ask too many questions.

In a hospital room facing the Yangtze River, bathed in moonlight and reflecting white waves, lay the airman they were there to comfort.

After the nurse led Lihua and Baoling into the room, she gently greeted the wounded airman, who responded weakly. Baoling, holding Lihua's hand, approached the bed and called out warmly:

"Guodong!"

Lihua paused, the name sounding familiar. But she couldn't place where she had heard it before. She looked intently at the patient's face: thick eyebrows, large eyes, full lips, and a messy mustache. It was the mustache that blurred her memory—the upper half of his face seemed familiar, but the lower half was a stranger. "Who is it?" "Who is it?" She strained to remember, but the more she tried, the less she could. The more she failed, the more intently she stared, as if she had forgotten a line or a whole passage of dialogue and needed to recapture it from her memory. She refused to admit her mind had lost its sharpness!

"You..." the patient asked hesitantly, looking somewhat lost.

"Don't you recognize me? Liao Dong—I'm Baoling, your old friend. And this is my sister, Lihua. She's come to see you too!" Baoling introduced them in more detail.

"Baoling!" The patient smiled with surprise. "It's you, Baoling! Baoling!"

They embraced, both shedding tears.

Then Lihua understood. From their enthusiasm, from their weeping, her memory conjured up the naive, lively, simple, and earnest young man who had once left her unmoved—her brother's good friend, also her brother's employer, named Liao Dong, a child of misfortune who shared the same tragic fate as her brother and herself! "Yes, it's him! It's him!" Feeling a pang of guilt, she stepped closer, her eyes beginning to moisten with emotion.

"She..." Liao Dong finally looked up and noticed Lihua.

"My sister, you've met her before, and you've heard her sing!" Baoling pulled Lihua forward again to introduce her to Liao Dong.

Liao Dong looked dazed, pausing as if quickly thinking something over, then excitedly reached out his hand.

"Yes! Yes! We've met, we've met," Liao Dong said, feeling a surge of warmth in his heart, his cheeks immediately flushing red.

Liao Dong's shyness vividly brought back Lihua's memories, drawing her in powerfully. She grasped Liao Dong's hand tightly, her smile conveying boundless care and admiration.

"You're injured?" Lihua asked softly.

"It's nothing, just a scratch on the skin, and a slight concussion! I'm almost fully recovered now," Liao Dong replied calmly, trying to hide his physical pain with a cheerful demeanor.

"I was so worried when I saw the news of your injury in the paper yesterday! That's why I brought Lihua to see you today," Baoling said. "Since you're recovering so quickly, you should come stay with us for a while after you're discharged."

"That's great. I have a month's leave after I get out of the hospital, and I'll definitely come and have fun with you all. Especially Miss Lihua's performances—I'd love to learn from them. Six years ago, I listened to Miss Lihua's operas several times here, which sparked my deep interest. Later, in Nanjing and Hangzhou, I kept listening to operas, and not just listening—I also learned to sing and play the huqin. There's an amateur opera club at our aviation school, and I joined it and even performed on stage. I often think: how wonderful it would be if I could perform on stage with Miss Lihua one day!" Liao Dong said, growing increasingly excited, as if he had forgotten he was a patient. His mind was no longer hazy.

"Ah, I never imagined that after five or six years, you'd become a flying hero, a famous amateur opera performer! It's truly a case of 'a scholar who has been away three days must be looked at with new eyes!'" Baoling joked.

"Miss Lihua, when I get better, I'd like to become your student. Would you be willing to take me on as a disciple?" Liao Dong asked earnestly.

"I wouldn't dare, Mr. Liao!" Lihua replied, shaking her head.

Baoling knew Lihua disliked people bringing up opera, so she quickly changed the subject, discussing their lives over the past five or six years with Liao Dong. It was only when the nurse came to urge them to leave that Baoling and Lihua said goodbye. As they left, Liao Dong warmly grasped Lihua's hand, inviting her to come again. Lihua readily agreed as she departed. For some reason, Lihua felt a sense of reluctance, unsure if it was because Liao Dong was a war hero, because of his friendship with Baoling, or because she admired, even loved, him.

Similarly, Liao Dong watched Lihua leave, feeling lost and disoriented, his mind slipping back into a daze. He struggled to connect the object of his silent pursuit for years with the Lihua he had just reunited with! He felt that Lihua was even more beautiful, even more lovable than before! And he felt that Lihua was treating him better than she used to. He was excited and longed to recover his health quickly, to realize the happiness he had envisioned! He had waited six years, secretly loved for six years, and he would use his greatest courage, like charging into battle, to fight for the bright and warm spring he had dreamed of for six years!

Like a silent bomb, it had blown open the door to Lihua's emotions, which had long been closed! A massive illusion rushed in, so powerfully disturbing the calm sea of her heart and tightly gripping her soul! Like a shadow, it firmly stuck to her eyes, her ears, everywhere she looked, everywhere she listened. She felt an unprecedented excitement, which made her toss and turn in bed, unable to sleep all night! She couldn't yet sort out a clear train of thought to calm herself. She could only think that she had to accept and tolerate this sudden attack, that she had to embrace that illusion!

Two days later, Lihua went to visit Liao Dong again alone, bringing some biscuits, cakes, and other snacks, making Liao Dong almost jump out of bed with joy! Lihua quickly restrained him, quietly touched by his enthusiasm.

Liao Dong asked Lihua many questions about Peking opera like a child, and Lihua patiently answered him, even though she had no interest in Peking opera herself.

"Why do you like Peking opera so much?" Lihua asked curiously.

"Because Peking opera is also art, and I love art. And also because of you..." Liao Dong blurted out.

"Because of me?" Lihua couldn't help but be surprised.

"Yes, because your art left a very deep impression on me, so I love your art even more!" Liao Dong's face turned red again as he said the last part. In fact, he wanted to tell Lihua: he loved Peking opera because he loved Lihua. But he didn't dare, he had already mustered a great deal of courage.

Lihua understood Liao Dong's meaning, so she didn't pursue the matter further, and walked awkwardly to the window, gazing at the ships swaying on the river, looking like fallen leaves in the distance, or like white gulls. At that moment, she imagined being able to drift aimlessly like fallen leaves, or fly freely like gulls to the ends of the earth! Suddenly, she heard a "rumbling" sound in the air, and several iron birds soared through the clouds, followed by the mournful wail of sirens. She thought it was a steamship leaving.

"Damn! Another air raid!" Liao Dong said. "You should go back quickly."

"Air raid?" Lihua was shocked for a moment, but she didn't quite believe it.

"The alarm's already been sounded," Liao Dong said with some annoyance, looking out the window at the clear sky.

"What about you?" Lihua wanted to leave, but hesitated and stopped.

"I'll just lie here, there's nowhere to hide anyway," Liao Dong replied sullenly.

"Then I'll stay with you, there's nowhere to hide when I go back anyway," Lihua said, sitting down calmly on the edge of Liao Dong's bed.

In Hankou, there was indeed nowhere to hide from air raids. Every time the alarm sounded, people could only take refuge in the foreign concessions. People believed in the concessions, especially in the foreign churches within the concessions. Lihua often huddled under the eaves of one of these churches. Because she was the most timid, she would run to the church as soon as the alarm sounded; she would cover her ears when enemy planes appeared; and she would fall to the ground when bombs exploded. Only when the alarm was lifted did she dare to stand up, her whole body still trembling.

But today was an exception. Lihua was surprisingly brave, and she actually stayed in the hospital with Liao Dong without batting an eye. She seemed to vaguely feel a sense of security, she felt that Liao Dong was not only unafraid of enemy planes, but also fought them. If she couldn't "fight" enemy planes, she shouldn't at least "fear" them! Therefore, she forced herself to be strong! Perhaps because of the above reasons, she respected Liao Dong even more. She thought: protecting someone who could fight enemy planes was, in a way, her indirectly fighting enemy planes! Thinking this, she felt that accompanying Liao Dong today was very valuable and meaningful!

"You don't usually hide?" Liao Dong heard that Lihua wanted to stay with him and was both happy and surprised.

"No, I don't hide," Lihua said, shaking her head insincerely.

"Aren't you afraid?"

"No, I'm not afraid," Lihua replied, feigning absolute calm.

As soon as they finished speaking, the emergency alarm and the "buzzing" of enemy planes sounded at the same time, followed by the start of the bombing. A giant bomb seemed to fall nearby, shaking the building and sending shards of glass flying from the windows with a "crashing" sound. Lihua couldn't help but shiver, although she managed not to cover her ears or fall to the ground.

"Boom! Boom!" There were several more explosions.

"Quick, get on the floor!" Liao Dong shouted as he pushed Lihua to the ground, then threw himself on top of Lihua.

After the frenzy of bombing subsided, there was fierce fighting overhead, with machine guns and anti-aircraft guns "cracking and popping" non-stop, as if the heavens and earth were about to be overturned.

Suddenly, the sky was filled with red light, and black smoke billowed into the clouds like dense fog, and several rocket-like objects flew past the window.

"Damn it, an enemy plane has been shot down!" Liao Dong exclaimed excitedly.

Sure enough, the wreckage of an enemy plane bearing the Rising Sun emblem fell into the river, still smoking and burning!

"Great!" Liao Dong cheered enthusiastically.

There was no response to Liao Dong's words. Based on his experience, he had discerned that the enemy plane had been shot down, and now, based on his intuition, he knew that Lihua had fainted from fright! He quickly tried to stand up, but his waist was tightly embraced by two arms. He gently tugged.

"Lihua!" Liao Dong called for the first time like this.

"Mmm!" Lihua responded, as if waking from a dream, opening her sleepy eyes.

"An enemy plane has been shot down. Get up and rest!"

"Oh!"

Only then did Lihua gradually regain her senses, and only then did she realize that there was a man lying on top of her, covering her in a protective posture. At the same time, she was also tightly embracing this man. She glanced at him briefly, then quickly let go, saying with a mixture of shame and gratitude:

"Oh dear, you came down too!"

"The bombing was too intense just now, I was afraid shrapnel would fly in and hurt you, so I threw myself on you!" Liao Dong said as he stood up, supporting himself on the edge of the bed.

Lihua also stood up and quickly helped Liao Dong lie down.

"But, you forgot about yourself!" Lihua said, her voice barely audible.

"Yes, I forgot about myself!" Liao Dong repeated, as if emphasizing and pondering at the same time.

They looked at each other and smiled slightly, thousands of words contained in that one smile! It was also in that moment of shared adversity that their friendship was like pure gold refined by fire, like going through a thousand mountains and ten thousand waters. Their hearts melted together, and their love broke through the tangible boundaries of time and space and solidified!

After the tension passed, Liao Dong realized in the stillness that he was a patient, and he felt the slight pain in his wound again. Lihua saw his mental exhaustion and the look on his face and knew he was uncomfortable, so she poured him a cup of tea and sat quietly to one side until he fell into a tired, perhaps peaceful, slumber.

By this time, the alarm had been lifted. Lihua covered Liao Dong with a blanket and then quietly left the ward. First, she found Liu Ziyun, carrying a bellyful of joy, and it so happened that Dong Shaoling was also there. She reported her experiences of the past two days to them without hesitation, although she was so shy that she almost couldn't say it. But finally, a force encouraged her, a force she had never experienced before, a force she felt was the key to her life and death. If she hoped to one day have her body and soul saved, then it was this force, this force of sacred love, that could save her!

Liu Ziyun and Dong Shaoling unanimously praised Lihua's experience and encouraged her to seize this happy beginning. They both gave her courage, especially Dong Shaoling, who even more excitedly urged her not to miss the opportunity!

"In this world, only the feelings of young people are the purest, the most ardent, and therefore the most precious. A middle-aged person, because life enters a practical stage, even love is calculated. And they don't dare to love!" Dong Shaoling expressed his very rational opinion to Lihua in a didactic tone.

Lihua didn't quite understand Dong Shaoling's words, thinking that the middle-aged person Dong Shaoling was talking about might be herself. But in any case, she had always trusted and admired Dong Shaoling. She admitted that Dong Shaoling had indeed not dared to love her in the past, but she did not hate Dong Shaoling because of it.

"Then, I believe your words, and I will start to love him, and I will love him forever!" Lihua said bravely, like taking an oath, holding back her heartbeat.

"That's right! If you can do that, you will get immortal happiness!" Dong Shaoling said cheerfully, as if relieved of a heavy burden.

"But there are still obstacles ahead, I must first hide it from my mother!"

Lihua's words were true. Mrs. Mo was the obstacle between her and Liao Dong, but she was constantly preparing to defend against this obstacle. She estimated that one day she would also bravely break through this obstacle.

Next, Lihua rushed to the hospital many more times, and also shared many more hardships with Liao Dong, until Liao Dong recovered from his injuries, moved out of the hospital, and lived in her home. They became even closer for a period of time. Except for Mrs. Mo, almost everyone knew about their love. Baoling was naturally one of the sponsors, and Liyun was even more enthusiastic. Even Jin Qilin, in the capacity of an old friend, old colleague, and old brother, was trumpeting loudly on the sidelines, hoping that this drama "The Dragon and the Phoenix Bring Auspiciousness" could be successfully performed, and he could play the role of Zhao Yun as a cameo.

So, Lihua and Liao Dong were conducting friendship, conducting love, and conducting a farther, wider, and more solid path of common life in a chorus of support!

Liao Dong's body had not fully recovered, especially his heart was still a little weak. He used his vacation to recuperate, while also working hard for a happy goal. Therefore, he felt stimulated when he occasionally encountered some difficulties! Only Baoling understood this situation, and Baoling used the words she had used to advise him in Jingzhou more than ten years ago to advise him again.

"Strengthen your will! When you strengthen your will, your body and mind will become stronger!" Baoling said with unwavering certainty.

Sure enough, Liao Dong had the same attitude towards love as he had more than ten years ago towards that rotten family. He was also determined about love! Even though the future was still very bleak! But he had "strengthened" his belief that "where there's a will, there's a way." He trusted himself, and he trusted all the friends who helped him, especially his close friend Baoling.

Lihua accepted a new destiny with the same feeling! She changed her attitude of being silent and rarely smiling over the years. She, Liao Dong, and Baoling, Liyun, played without restraint, talked candidly, like they were childhood sweethearts, restored innocence, and restored vitality!

Good things are often difficult. The Wuhan evacuation order was issued, and Liao Dong had to obey orders and return to his unit ahead of schedule. Lihua also had to buy a boat and go west with Liu Ziyun and everyone else.

Sudden gatherings and sudden departures, they could only say "see you later" to each other. A layer of melancholy shrouded Lihua's heart again!

### Flowers and Birds

### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 319

— Ye Jingfeng

"I am terribly sorry, Mr. Tsurumi..."

This loud voice struck Tsurumi's eardrums, shaking him up and immediately restoring his normal sight and hearing. He saw standing before him a thin old man, a white beard more than a foot long hanging from his chin, dressed in an old-fashioned Korean gentleman's outfit, his eyes appearing very gloomy. At the same time, Tsurumi discovered that his right hand was held by two extremely smooth, soft hands, taking his pulse.

"Everything is normal, Dad." A clear and lovely voice came from beside Tsurumi; before she had finished speaking, the pair of soft hands holding Tsurumi's right hand had already gently withdrawn, and the person had also stood up. In Tsurumi's eyes, she was a beautiful young woman of twenty-one or twenty-two, also dressed in Korean clothes.

"Very good, child, you may retire." The old man spoke in an impure Japanese accent, waving his hand as he spoke, his expression still gloomy.

As Tsurumi watched the woman leave the room, he straightened his sitting posture and took a look at the room's furnishings. Judging by the arrangement, he knew this was a guest room.

"Mr. Tsurumi, I think I should fully explain a few things..." The old man sat down across from Tsurumi.

"No need...!" Tsurumi interrupted the old man's words in a commanding tone, "I will ask a question, and please answer a question; because my time is extremely valuable." Tsurumi glanced at the watch on his wrist.

"As you wish," the old man's tone was very gentle, but his manner of speaking, combined with his bell-like voice, implicitly displayed a noble status.

"Do you have a telephone here?"

"Yes, but..."

"Please call my companion here!"

The old man did not make a sound, but gently clapped his hands twice. Before the applause had stopped, someone had already pushed the door open and entered, a sturdy young man. The old man did not instruct the young man what to do, but first apologized to Tsurumi, "This child does not understand Japanese, please do not take offense." After speaking, he spoke two sentences in his native language, and the young shadow responded and left.

"Is it far from here to the International Grand Hotel?" Tsurumi asked.

"A fifteen-minute car ride."

"Is the anesthetic you use in your car very harmful to human health?"

"Not at all harmful to health; I myself am a medical technician and also a doctor. I can guarantee this."

"I have already expressed my frankness to your subordinates, why do you still have to go through these unnecessary procedures?"

"The children's actions are not free, I am terribly sorry..."

Before the old man had finished speaking, the young man had already led Masa-iwa in.

"Masa-iwa-kun, please first call the Mansei-kan and ask the maid on duty in our room for news of Miss Nakamura; then call the place you reserved and tell them to entertain your friends, in case we are too late to arrive—it's already three o'clock!"

### D'Annunzio is Insatiable

— Shen Si

Called the poet, novelist, playwright, artist, aviator, soldier, lover, dreamer... of contemporary Italy, Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938) was truly a remarkable figure. During World War I, he had helped France somewhat, so later, the French all respected him. Those who wrote to him would only write "To Italy's Greatest Poet." D'Annunzio seemed dissatisfied, saying, "Am I only Italy's greatest poet? You should also call me the world's greatest poet!"

### Shakespeare: Sonnets

— Zhenqin (Translator)

Sonnet XVIII

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm’d;

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;

Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,

When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

Sonnet XXIX

When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,

I all alone beweep my outcast state

And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries

And look upon myself and curse my fate,

Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,

Featured like him, like him with friends possess’d,

Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,

With what I most enjoy contented least;

Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,

Haply I think on thee, and then my state,

Like to the lark at break of day arising

From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;

For thy sweet love remember’d such wealth brings

That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

Sonnet XXXIII

Full many a glorious morning have I seen

Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,

Kissing with golden face the meadows green,

Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;

Anon permit the basest clouds to ride

With ugly rack on his celestial face,

And from the forlorn world steal his sweet view,

And in that time do sluggishly subside

Even so my sun one early morn did shine

With all triumphant splendor on my brow;

But out, alack, he was but one hour mine;

The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now.

Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;

Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.

### City Appearance

— Hua Lin

The construction of a city originates from history, geography, politics, economy, as well as academic culture, creating various different forms. China uses city walls as fortresses, and civilian houses also use high walls and deep courtyards, iron window bars, and railings for leaning. Vermillion doors and gilded characters, light carriages and fat horses – these are all features of feudal life.

Medieval European cities also had narrow stone roads, gloomy houses, and strong, thick-walled castles, revealing traces of war everywhere. When it came to Renaissance cities, it was as if flower buds were unfolding tender petals; palaces and pavilions became increasingly ornate, and fortress forms became decorations. The city and residential areas became integrated, and commerce gradually flourished, so-called city appearance also became prominent.

The greatest buildings in a city are temples and government offices. In modern times, attention is paid to public life and cultural undertakings, such as museums, national theaters, universities, libraries, and academies. These buildings, in the city center, have become a treasure trove commonly owned by the people, not products of the era of emperors and nobles, so the city appearance is also different.

In Chinese cities, apart from temples and government offices, there are no great buildings in civilian houses, and even less attention is paid to color. The use of wood is not sturdy. The wealthy only have a multi-story pavilion, from which they can look out over a scene of flat houses, black and white like tree ear mushrooms cooked with tofu, so the city appearance is plain and unremarkable.

The greatest buildings in a city elevate the spirit of its citizens, like the Gothic cathedrals of Northern Europe. In foggy and rainy weather, one can only see the high tower of the cathedral from afar. We know that the cathedral with the high tower must be the center of the town, and nearby there must be parks, markets, post offices, cafes, as well as schools and city halls, etc. Such towers are products of Northern Europe. Southern Europe, with its bright weather, only emphasizes decorative facades and substantial interiors, which is very different from the situation in Northern Europe.

Near the Swiss Alps in Europe, various city appearances have been formed due to the beautiful mountain and lake scenery. Near the Mediterranean coast of Nice and Monaco, the mountains and fields are full of exotic flowers and fragrant plants. The perfumes and soaps that France supplies to the world all come from here. Ancient Italian cities want to preserve historical sites, so they do not change the entire city. When we walk through the streets, it is as if we are people from the Middle Ages. Although these are products of the feudal era, they have become museums and art pieces. Only the form remains for appreciation, and the spirit is exceptionally pleasant.

The focus of Chinese city appearance is government offices, while temples are mostly in remote places. Buildings everywhere are in the same format, without much change, and there is no special creation due to historical, geographical, cultural, production, or occupational relationships. For example, there is not much difference between cities by the sea and cities in the mountains. Even Hangzhou and Suzhou, although elegant, have not created a special style in terms of city appearance. There are some large buildings in Beiping, but the city is still largely the same.

The city appearance I am talking about is like a person's face, which can be recognized at a glance as a certain type of person. History, locality, must be preserved, as well as the customs and culture of the people, all must form a special spirit of a city. This spirit, integrating and penetrating the history of human culture, has special value! Why doesn't Kunshan have a Kunqu opera research association? Why doesn't Nanjing have Six Dynasties literature and art? Why doesn't Xi'an have an archaeological society? Why doesn't Beiping have a national theater? Shanghai is a major commercial port in the Pacific Ocean, so why doesn't it have a world museum? Why not create an international cultural city?

City appearance is alive, not dead. Even preserving an ancient city, repairing damaged buildings according to ancient formats, is still a living culture! It is still for living people to appreciate, study, and recreate. City appearance is like a person's face, with expressions and cultivation, a lively and spirited face, like a scholar who has been to countries all over the world. This face, of course, has different styles and qualities. City appearance is the same, using history, geography, politics, economy, and all cultural academics to create a beautiful city appearance!

"Have you ever made a serious mistake while treating patients?" a friend asked a famous surgeon.

"Only once," the surgeon replied.

"Was it a fatal mistake?"

"Almost. That time I charged one million yuan for the surgery, but later I found out he actually had three million."

Wanye Bookstore recently published the book "A's Son," written by the Soviet V. Kazayev, translated by Mao Dun, who is about to return to China. It describes the patriotic story of a young Soviet protagonist, Vanya, during World War I, vividly depicting and full of legendary colors. Also, Sun Ling's full-length novel "The Blizzard" will also be published soon.

The Current Situation of Naval Training in England

Brother ××:

I was in the midst of packing my luggage when I suddenly received your letter, which made me extremely happy. I cannot express my joy and happiness with my poor pen. Thank you for your kindness in telling me the news from home and the recent developments of my friends. I am immensely grateful to you. You are probably very concerned about my life, right? Now, let me tell you about our training on British warships. Please also send my regards to those friends whom I miss dearly.

When we first arrived here, we spent our days living on the parade ground. From morning to night, we were in a state of nervous excitement. After six weeks, our basic training ended, and a new life began. We spent our days in the classroom, which was much more comfortable than training on the parade ground. The English are truly down-to-earth in their work, much more thorough than we are. For example, in the morning, we have course A, and in the afternoon, we immediately go to the Cinema to watch movies – the English have made films of all naval operations. The next day, we have to practice it ourselves. This kind of education has a great effect. At the same time, this method is very worthy of adoption by our country. After six weeks of classroom life, we held a final exam. The results were very surprising to the British. According to one of the instructors, Mr. Smith, British soldiers could never accept a course like our six weeks. Little did they know that we are all a group of students. In the education level of British soldiers, they are only primary school graduates. Anyone with a secondary school education is an officer, similar to the situation in our country. The British all believe that the quality of Chinese soldiers is not bad, but only Heaven knows.

In England, being a soldier is welcomed everywhere. One person serving in the military brings glory to the whole family. At the same time, the salary of each soldier can support his family and live in a fairly well-off situation. Every three months, there is a Long Leave (about two weeks). Compared with Chinese soldiers, there is a world of difference. But the British territory consists of only three islands, and resources are still insufficient to be self-sufficient. Everything depends on the supply from the colonies. Why can they manage the country so well? If our country's politics and people were like England, wouldn't we also be a first-class country in the world? British parties are also quite complex and are also competing with each other, but their methods are different from ours. They completely adopt a democratic style, using propaganda to win the hearts of the people.

### On the Ingenuity of Literary Thought

— Mu Tao

Chinese characters are full of mystery. In the past, Mr. Xu Zhushi of my hometown (named Jingcheng, posthumously named Wensu), one of the three loyalists of Zhejiang in the庚子Year (who served as an envoy to foreign countries), when he was at the Jiaxing Guild Hall group worship (Beijing prefectural hall, group worship once a year, but no opera performances), during the banquet, he told a story: There was someone who was good at English, and he often boasted that he could translate Chinese characters, but there were many jokes. For example, "Resolving conflicts at the negotiating table" was translated as "Running around with horses and fighting next to wine glasses and chopsticks;" "Hundreds of birds singing together" was translated as "Two cranes, plus a white bird." Moreover, the six writing principles use pictographs and ideograms, with phonetic loans being the most numerous. In addition, there are so-called fanqie (a method of indicating the pronunciation of a Chinese character), and so-called circle tones. Foreign characters have absolutely no such functions, or allowances. But taking the circle tone as an example, a character circled in four corners can change all four tones: level, rising, departing, and entering. For example, the character "唯" (wéi, only), can be used interchangeably with the character "惟" (wéi, only). Adding a circle in the upper corner means "to answer," the pronunciation and meaning, as well as the tone, all change.

In the past, there was a lantern riddle with the face being a beauty applying rouge to her lips, and the answer was "Zengzi said '唯之唯子'," because the character "唯" has a red circle on its mouth. There was also a riddle with the face being the character "亞" (yà, second) with a red circle in one corner, and the answer was "To push away the heart of evil, to push away the new evil." Only two characters are used, symbolizing 重欄 (chóng lán, double railing). The upper character "亞" has a red circle, symbolizing the corner of the setting sun. The indescribable ingenuity of literary thought is like this.

### Bird Language Poetry

— Sun Yuehan

When I read bird language poetry, I feel that the ancients were all able to incorporate bird language into poetry, making it very enjoyable. I always think of recording it for remembrance, but I have no large enough material to title it. In Qing Dynasty Sun Shiqiao's "Odds and Ends," dozens of kinds of bird language poetry are collected. The sound of the turtledove is vaguely like: "Bugu (cuckoo)," "Take off pants," "Feet but cloth pants," "Take off broken hull," "Cut wheat and plant rice," "Guo's wife beats mother-in-law," "One hundred into one," "Grandpa and grandma," "Fight millet," "Harvest grain," "Winnow grain," "Every household scatters grain," "Quickly cuckoo," "Sister-in-law blames mother-in-law," "Quickly mend pants."

The nightingale's cry sounds like: "Zigui (return home)," "Sister return," "Urge return," "Better to return."

The oriole's cry sounds like: "Mud slippery," "Cha cha cha."

The cuckoo's cry sounds like: "Gu e (father-in-law is evil)," "Shrike," "Bitter bitter."

The crow's voice sounds like: "Jia li (plow)," "Jia jia ge ge."

The mockingbird's voice sounds like: "Wake up wake up."

The mountain bird's voice sounds like: "Ti hu (carry pot)."

's voice sounds like: "Phoenix is not as good as me, get by," "How to get by?"

The phoenix's voice sounds like: "Return to play," "Ti jue (carrying)," "Good."

The peacock's voice sounds like: "Du huo (all harvest)."

The partridge's voice sounds like: "Cannot go, brother!" "Hook and yoke."

The Yichun bird's voice sounds like: "Spring is gone, spring is gone!"

The partridge's voice sounds like: "Guo gong (Duke Guo)," "Buddha appears," "Woodpecker," "Dig bamboo shoots," "Sell tiles," "Press oil," "Sister-in-law," "Wet wet," "Gua gua," "Tell the teacher," "Don't be angry, old man," "Jianzhou ghost," "Evil woman words," "Cart carries boards," "Months pass by," "Road cannot pass," "Yellow frightens children," "Kill aunt," "Strange strange," "Aunt bitter," "Brother bitter," "Gua gua gua," "Water...brother."

The duck's voice sounds like: "Gaba porridge."

The sparrow's voice sounds like: "Zhe zhe zhe."

The pigeon's voice sounds like: "Die...die."

The thrush's voice sounds like: "Ruyi ruyi (as you wish)."

The swallow's voice sounds like: "Who is like this?" "Although similar to this?" "Who dies first?" "Sleeping Xishi (a beauty)," "Better than Xishi."

Others like: "Anxious," "Qingming drunk," "Child returns," "Do not pick flowers and fruits," "Wear the new and take off the old," "Beat wheat and make rice," "Take off cloth shirt," "Yo," "Mountain is on fire," "Bitter ah bitter!" "Wheat ripe forging," "Jiao jiao sang zhi," "Fa ke fa ke (get promoted)," etc. All are bird languages, and poets use similar meanings to enter poetry.

### Chronicle of a City in Crisis

— Qin Shouou

But these people were even worse than ants, they only cared about themselves, and did not care about others. The young and strong, along with countless people wearing uniforms that looked like soldiers but weren't, launched an attack like a melee, scattering all the old, weak, women, and children, and rushed onto the train like wolves and tigers; the railway staff on and off the train retreated far away as if watching a fire from across the river, and did not care no matter what. —— In reality, they really couldn't care!

Old Zhu, Old Huang, Ah Li, and Lan's cousin, four men, with a spirit of desperation, protected Lan, Feifei, Rong'er, and six or seven pieces of luggage, pushing, squeezing, leaning, supporting, struggling, and fighting hard for sixty or seventy minutes in the surging crowd, only managing not to be pushed over by stronger people again, and not to retreat, but that crocodile-like train was still within sight but out of reach.

"Mom! I'm scared! I don't want to go up!" Just when everyone was panting, sweating, and at a loss, Rong'er, held in Lan's arms, cried out loudly again.

"Don't be afraid, child, it'll be fine once we get on the train!" Lan frowned tightly, and tried her best to comfort her beloved son in a very gentle voice.

But the steam of the crowd and the roar of human voices were really too much for this five-year-old child to bear. As if he hadn't heard his mother's words, he burst into tears and shouts, even struggling hard, trying to jump to the ground.

This startled the other four men who were using all their strength to squeeze forward. Old Zhu was the first to turn around to look at them, and his original intention was also to help Lan coax little Rong to calm down; but as soon as his gaze fell on Feifei's face, squeezed between Lan and Old Huang, his heart couldn't help but beat wildly.

"Feifei! Feifei!" He hurriedly lowered his head to shout. (47)

### Love and Confinement

— Ding Ren

According to a report, a Mr. Huang in Xixiang, Chongqing, because his son was still studying in junior high school, only seventeen years old, started to fall in love with a Miss X, his father was furious when he heard the news, and immediately confined this "incorrigible" son at home for three years, recently released by relatives.

From this news, I have understood a serious educational problem, and at the same time I am wondering if we are still living in the 1950s?

In European and American countries, social interaction between men and women is open, which is a well-known fact. In their school curriculum, children of eight or nine years old begin to understand how flowers, plants, insects, and various small animals bloom, bear fruit, conceive, and reproduce, all the way to how humans give birth to children, they all understand very clearly. It is never like Chinese families, where children ask their parents where they came from, and the parents' answer is either to make up a lie to deceive them, or to scold the child. However, such a result not only creates a mysterious veil over these issues for the child, but also forces the child to obtain knowledge from improper places to satisfy their desires.

The seventeen-year-old youth in Chongqing was imprisoned at home for three years for falling in love, which is really a great injustice. Fathers (or teachers) should explain the advantages and disadvantages, and persuade them from the aspects of physiology and academics, rather than deceive them. Lying or even coercion cannot solve the problem. In fact, understanding a matter thoroughly is necessary to convince people; otherwise, no matter how great your ability to fabricate lies, once they are exposed, it is irreparable. Take this Mr. Huang as an example. After being released from three years of confinement, his love for Miss X has not been interrupted since then, but on the contrary, it is very likely to intensify. If such a consequence really occurs, I believe that this is by no means what this father had expected!

### Close Call

— Hua

Three church members from 省 (a province) attended a service one day. After the pastor finished preaching, in order to help the disaster victims, he asked the audience to donate money. The three church members were extremely nervous. Finally, the pastor walked up to them with the plate. One of the church members fainted when he saw it, and the other two carried him up and walked out of the church.

### Watching "The Three Friends of Winter"

— Jie Ding

The drama school's second public performance of "The Three Friends of Winter" has obviously improved compared to the last time. Chen Baichen's script, although a tragedy, often makes people laugh because the characters he writes often have catchphrases and special habits. Especially in this play, there is Dr. Li, a naturally humorous person, who can give people an unbearable burst of laughter even in the most tense moments.

The performance effect was very good, the actors were generally good, and the set design was indeed painstaking. The snow scene outside the window in the third act was quite beautiful, except that the sky was a bit too bright. Wu Tian's direction reached a state of perfection in the complex scene in the first act and in the dialogue between Shen Yong and Li Zhuye in the third act. He did not miss several tense climaxes.

### Arts and Culture Scene

Ma Sihong, Wu Leyi, Huang Yuanyin, Chen Liqing, Ma Sisun, etc., went to Xinjiang last month to perform music for Chairman Zhang. It is said that 25,000 people listened to the performance, and they returned to Shanghai on the 7th of this month. (Ping)

After the Retrocession, he directed several plays in Taiwan, such as "Sin" and "Medical Ethics," which were well-received by Taiwanese people. (Feng Qian)
