### Song Ziwen's Resignation Approved, Chairman Temporarily Concurrently Holds Position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Jia'ao Appointed Governor of the Central Bank

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Supreme National Defense Council held a temporary meeting at the National Government conference room at 4 PM on the 1st. Chairman Jiang personally presided, with over thirty attendees. The following was approved: (1) The resignation of Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, was approved. (2) The position of Premier of the Executive Yuan will be temporarily concurrently held by Chairman Jiang Zhongzheng of the National Government. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] After the news of the Chairman concurrently holding the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan spread, the general reaction was positive. It is believed that past difficulties can now be easily resolved. According to authoritative sources in the government, the Chairman concurrently holding the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan demonstrates the government's determination to reorganize. This is a transitional period. The Chairman values the Executive Yuan and hopes to enter the reorganization phase soon. The current expansion of institutions and establishment of political councils are preliminary steps towards reorganizing the government. The reorganization of the Executive Yuan and the National Government will commence thereafter.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The National Government issued an order on the 1st: (1) Bei Zuyi, Governor of the Central Bank, requested to resign, which was approved. (2) Zhang Jia'ao, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, will be appointed to another position and should be relieved of his current post. (3) Zhang Jia'ao is specially appointed as Governor of the Central Bank.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] When Zhang Jia'ao met with reporters on the 1st, he declined to comment on the current financial situation, only making statements about the industrial and mining situation in the Northeast. It is reported that Mr. Zhang will travel to Shanghai in the next few days. He refused to express his views on the situation. Northeast.

[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] According to senior government officials, Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, and other ministers will continue to hold their respective positions. Political observers predict that Chairman Zhang Qun of Sichuan Province will become the Premier of the Executive Yuan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] When Song Ziwen answered questions from legislators in the Legislative Yuan on the 1st, he refused to defend his past policies. However, he denied the accusation in a certain newspaper that his past policies were entirely comprador-like behavior. Song Ziwen, in a sarcastic tone, stated: "Can my past policies of tariff autonomy and abolition of unequal treaties also be called comprador policies?" He did not deny the failure of policies in the meeting, but said that the situation four months ago made it impossible to completely blame him. He said, regarding the country, his conscience is clear, and he does not seek others' understanding. Song's response today was very moving, but he treated the legislators' inquiries with indifference. However, his every word and action revealed his true feelings. When he left the meeting and got into his car, he walked with difficulty and was helped into the car by those around him, looking exhausted, as if he had just recovered from a major illness.

### Premier Song Reports on the Financial Situation in the Legislative Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Premier Song attended a temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 1st to report on the financial and economic situation. His original speech was as follows:

I originally intended to attend the regular meeting of your esteemed Yuan last week to make a report. However, on February 16th, the National Defense Council passed the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, which had to be implemented on the 17th. I had to go to Shanghai to supervise all implementation measures. Therefore, I discussed it with Premier Sun and agreed to report today. I sincerely apologize.

### Three Requests to Resign as Premier of the Executive Yuan

Today, I can inform you that I have already requested the Chairman to resign from the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan three times since last year. Now the Chairman has granted my request, but I am still happy to take this opportunity to report everything to you.

Currently, the general public expresses doubts about the reasons for the current economic crisis. They understand that the current situation is deteriorating due to the military actions of the Communist Party. However, what they cannot understand is that we have experienced civil wars in the past, but never encountered a crisis as severe as the current one.

I feel that this issue is indeed worth studying. At the same time, I believe that to resolve this doubt, we should grasp the core of the issue and examine it. Now, I will briefly describe the past financial situation.

When I was appointed as the Governor of the Central Bank of Guangzhou by the Father of the Nation in the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), two banks went out of business. These two banks were the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China when Long Jiguang held power, because its reserves were robbed by him, and the Guangdong Provincial Bank during the Chen Jiongming era, which issued banknotes excessively. Therefore, at that time, the people had no confidence in banknotes at all.

The Father of the Nation saw this situation and knew that financial matters must be handled steadily. Therefore, he instructed that no banknotes should be issued unless there was solid preparation. I have never forgotten this instruction. From the internal rebellion and warfare in Guangdong to the Northern Expedition after the death of the Father of the Nation, even though Guangdong Province was dealing with the wars of the entire warlord army, when the military finance was extremely difficult, the colleagues of the Central Bank never dared to forget the Father of the Nation's instructions. Although the pressure from all sides was heavy and the financial situation was extremely precarious, the Central Bank did not issue a single unreliable banknote because of this.

What effect did such measures have? The banknotes of the Central Bank never discounted even slightly, and for a long time, the value of the banknotes exceeded the value of silver. Therefore, although the wars continued, the financial and economic system of the revolutionary government remained sound and substantial. The profound and far-sighted plans of the Father of the Nation were finally realized.

When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and continued to unify the country, there were still many banks issuing banknotes in North China and Central China. They used silver coins as issuing reserves, so each had its own reserves. Some went bankrupt, and some were able to survive, but each bank could manage itself to some extent. Because excessive issuance of banknotes would result in a bank run, because of this natural restraint, no local government or independent army could ignore the safety level of its issuance. Even if there were occasional bank failures, their impact was limited to the local area.

### Stopping Inflation Requires Peace First

In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic (1935), the United States implemented the Silver Purchase Act, and the price of silver rose accordingly. At the same time, China's silver exports also increased dramatically, and the domestic economic situation was very serious. In order to resolve the crisis, the government abolished the silver standard and switched to the legal tender policy. At this time, silver was rushed abroad for sale, and the foreign exchange fund was used as the reserve standard. I remember very clearly that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross of the British Treasury was the advisor for the implementation of the policy. He once said that the legal tender system is undoubtedly the best system that can be adopted, but the government must be able to restrain itself, because since the cash redemption of banknotes was abolished, the natural limitation on inflation has also disappeared at the same time. For many years, I have never forgotten this advice.

The implementation of the legal tender system started very smoothly. Due to the stability of foreign exchange, foreign trade improved year by year, until the start of the Anti-Japanese War in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic (1937). If the legal tender system had not been used, it is feared that the country would have been difficult to support for the eight-year long Anti-Japanese War. This point should be acknowledged by the public.

But at the same time, the legal tender system, which saved China's wartime finances, contained the root of the national disaster today. When the National Government's expenditure exceeded its income, the only way was to rely on the printing press to make up for it. This caused the greatest harm, because there was reliance without knowing thrift. All parties thought, what does it matter if a little more banknotes are issued? Why not take everything one wants? In this way, inflation increased day by day, and prices soared until the end of the war.

Once the war ended, if the country could achieve peace, inflation could naturally be stopped, because military spending could be reduced, tax revenue could be increased, and at the same time, the sale of enemy property and gold could also increase the country's extra income. Banknotes would no longer need to be issued, and prices could be stabilized.

### Communist Party's Provocations Aim to Destroy the Economic System

However, the evolution of events was beyond expectations. Due to the provocations of the Communist Party, the country was once again caught in war. Not only could peaceful construction not be achieved, but the destruction was even more severe than during the Anti-Japanese War. The destruction caused by the enemy was mostly caused by war, but the Communist Party's actions were deliberate and unrestrained. Their goal was to destroy the entire economic system, to make the government collapse, in order to seize power by taking advantage of the opportunity. Therefore, they demolished railways, bombed factories, and destroyed mines. At the same time, they established regimes in the occupied areas, opened banks, and issued their own banknotes. The people had long yearned for peace. Now, not only could they not receive the benefits of peace, but they were once again plunged into a war that consumed more than the Anti-Japanese War. The government's income could not be increased as desired, but the costs of repairing transportation and mines increased day by day and could not be suppressed.

The questions I just mentioned from all parties about the current economic situation are a fundamental answer. All previous domestic wars were small compared to the wars we are witnessing now. In the past, wars were battles between two armies, and no one knew that the Communist Party deliberately destroyed all transportation and production, nor did they know that the Communist Party intended to overthrow the current social system. Moreover, more importantly, at that time, there were natural limits to the increase in banknote issuance, but since the implementation of the legal tender policy, this limitation has no longer existed. Therefore, inflation continued, speculation became widespread, interest rates soared, and all economic ills, which you want to ask about today, also came along with it. When I was in the Ministry of Finance, I had a loyal duty to guard the national treasury from a passive perspective. All unnecessary expenditures were resolutely rejected. Now, although I have changed to the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, due to the actual relationship, I am still a critical point in blocking the continuous requests from all parties to increase expenditures, which is no different from before.

Now that the Anti-Japanese War is in the past, after a long period of pain, everyone hopes to get spiritual and material relief and comfort. This kind of mentality is very sympathetic, but the ruthless facts are all there and cannot be ignored. When the Ministry of Finance cannot raise funds, every huge expenditure that needs to be paid becomes a strong dispute with me. Therefore, in order to raise new sources of income, I focused on strengthening the handling of enemy and puppet property and establishing the China Textile Construction Company and other businesses. When receiving and handling enemy and puppet property, there were indeed irregular actions from all parties, but after the establishment of the Executive Yuan's Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Agency, the order of reception gradually recovered. Afterwards, after the joint investigation by the People's Political Council and the Control Yuan, all the malpractices found were completely unrelated to the persons in charge of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Agency. This can be considered a relief! As for the establishment of the China Textile Company, there was a general criticism at the time, and many advocated that the enemy-owned yarn factories should be sold. If this were implemented, it would in fact be equivalent to sacrificing the interests of the entire country in order to enrich a few upstarts. The national treasury would only receive 200 to 300 billion, while the profit of the China Textile Company last year reached more than 400 billion yuan. This year, it may be possible to get a profit of 1 trillion yuan. If the policy of light industry returning to private ownership is implemented and the China Textile Company is valued and sold now, its assets can be sold for 3 to 4 trillion yuan. Therefore, there is no mistake in the establishment of the China Textile Company.

### The Problem of Foreign Exchange Supply Must Be Fully Addressed

Now the domestic inflation situation is already worrying, and the problem of foreign exchange supply caused by foreign trade must be fully addressed. Exports must be increased and remittances from overseas Chinese must be controlled. Without this, foreign exchange cannot be replenished. Domestic currency and foreign deposits are closely related to each other. If the currency situation deteriorates, it will be even more difficult to obtain foreign exchange. If foreign exchange is not replenished, the impact on domestic currency value and prices will be even more profound. This cause and effect that produces each other is most worthy of our attention.

The government's income is extremely limited, but in order to meet the expenditure requirements of all parties, it has to rely on increasing issuance. I am deeply aware that this approach is enough to cause a possible serious situation. Therefore, my colleagues and I are worried about this issue day and night, but all parties always think that I am simply thwarting their will. To endure the accusations from all parties in this way can almost only be regarded as being dominated by fate.

Until today, I still firmly oppose the unnecessary increase in national treasury expenditures. Therefore, I have become like a public enemy. Whenever prices soar, I am cursed. When I believe that the expenses are too large and ask for reconsideration, there are articles in the newspapers saying that everyone else has already agreed, but only the Premier of the Executive Yuan is hindering it.

The current economic crisis is the result of the accumulation of eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the continuous response to the Communist Party's attacks, which has resulted in the national treasury being unable to balance. At the same time, speculation in Shanghai has deepened the serious situation.

Now the government is taking strict economic emergency measures, on the one hand, cracking down on speculation, and on the other hand, trying to restore the trend of balanced income and expenditure, so as to stop inflation. If there are any questions about these measures, the relevant ministers of the Executive Yuan and I are very willing to explain and answer.

The rapid measures to suppress speculation are practically beneficial and effective. We need these urgent measures in order for other long-term measures to take effect. Only in terms of long-term measures can we find fundamental solutions.

In summary, emergency measures are to try to stop paying any unnecessary or deferrable expenses in order to balance income and expenditure. At the same time, public utilities such as postal and telecommunications should be self-sufficient. Taxes should be actively increased. For example, the Ministry of Finance reports that the income tax alone is expected to have an income of 800 billion yuan in the next few months. Enemy property such as the China Textile Company should be accelerated for sale, and surplus materials should be quickly processed.

### The Goldsmith Industry's Petition Delegation Continues to Appeal to the Government

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The goldsmith industry's petition delegation continued to petition the Control Yuan and the National Defense Council on the 1st, requesting the cancellation of the regulations on the time-limited registration, sale, and mandatory exchange for national currency; allowing the operation of receiving, exchanging, processing, and selling gold jewelry, and allowing the industry to apply to the Central Bank for the allocation and sale of raw gold for their needs. They also claimed that if transactions were made at the official price, there would be only outflows and no inflows. The gold inventory of goldsmiths across the country could be sold out in one day, and millions of employees across the country would lose their jobs from now on. Therefore, they decided to insist on the above-mentioned key points and set up a liaison office in Beijing. If necessary, they will petition again.

### The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Will Send Representatives to China to Help Our Country Solve the Currency Problem

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has requested Mr. Collado, the US representative to the bank, to go to China to assist the country in solving the inflation problem. Once the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development formally appoints a new president, Mr. Collado will set off for China.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Former Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy has been formally elected as the President of the World Bank, and will take over the business of 8 billion US dollars of world reconstruction funds on March 17th, succeeding Mr. Meyer, who resigned last year.

### If Measures Are Effectively Implemented, the Crisis May Be Saved

If these measures can be effectively implemented, I believe the crisis can be saved. In the twenty-first year of the Republic (1932), after the Shanghainese army attacked Songhu, various tax revenues suddenly decreased sharply. At that time, the government took decisive measures to balance income and expenditure. This was because at that time, everyone unanimously believed that even in the face of a violent enemy, the most important task was to try to avoid economic bankruptcy. The income and expenditure that year finally reached a balance.

While we are trying our best to reduce expenses, we must also develop production at any cost. Therefore, at the meeting of the United Agricultural Financing Administration Council the day before yesterday, the Chairman instructed that no matter how difficult it is, the amount of agricultural loans must be increased.

In addition, one more thing must be mentioned. Before the war, China's cotton production was sufficient to be self-sufficient. Due to the war with the enemy and the Communist Party, cotton fields were destroyed. This year, we have to purchase 175 million US dollars worth of cotton from the United States to supply the needs of the people's clothing. Now a large number of American cotton seeds have been obtained, and technicians have also been recruited. Agricultural loans have been prepared. We may be able to produce cotton sufficient for three-quarters of our needs next year, while this year, domestic production can only supply one-quarter of our needs. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and the people are diligent. As long as everyone is determined to do their best, the current difficulties are not difficult to eliminate.

Under the economic crisis, there must be people who do not hesitate to work hard and complain. If it is helpful, then they will not hesitate to be the target of public criticism. My previous actions to curb inflation were purely based on responsibility. I knew it was something that would definitely not be pleasing, but I never intended to be pleasing.

I am also an ordinary person, and naturally I will not be without mistakes. As the saying goes, "To err is human." Therefore, I dare not say that everything I have done is accurate and effective, but it is all for a common and true goal, and there is absolutely no plan for private gain.

Whether this economic crisis can be overcome depends entirely on whether the entire country can have consistent perseverance and support the government's economic emergency measures. Unless the people of the country can truly understand the seriousness of the current situation and can abandon private prejudices and prioritize national interests, I am afraid that no one or any group can achieve the goal of saving the country.

I would like to reiterate the Chairman's recent important reminder, saying, "Now the economic situation in our country has reached a very serious time." The implementation of this Economic Emergency Measures Plan will inevitably cause great pain to our compatriots, but unless we can have firm confidence and strong action, it will be difficult to avoid the Communist Party's plot. The above is a simple report on issues related to finance and economics. If you gentlemen have any questions, please feel free to express them, and I and the responsible officials will answer them separately.

Since I took office as the Premier of the Executive Yuan, I have done my best in everything. There may be mistakes in the policies, but in terms of conscience, when I leave the Executive Yuan, I feel that I am absolutely worthy of the country and the nation. (End)

### The CCP's Nanjing Liaison Office Requests Extension of Withdrawal Period; Shanghai Office Receives Strict Protection

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] After receiving the government's notice on the 28th requesting assistance in withdrawing before March 5th, Wang Bingnan went to the former Marshall House on the morning of the 1st to ask American personnel to convey to the government a request to extend the deadline for withdrawal by half a month. As of late evening, no response had been received.

[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan told United Press reporters today that the CCP delegation has requested the Chinese and American governments to extend the deadline for the CCP to withdraw from government-controlled areas by March 5th by fifteen days, so that 170 CCP personnel in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing can make appropriate arrangements before withdrawing to Yan'an. However, it is heard that the American side is unlikely to agree. This deadline was set a month ago, during which the US side is responsible for sending CCP personnel in the government area back to Yan'an.

[Central News Agency, This City] After the Songhu Garrison Headquarters notified the Communist Party's Shanghai office to withdraw before March 5th, the CCP office at 107 Sinan Road has been under strict protection since yesterday. CCP personnel are maintaining silence. As of late evening, the Garrison Headquarters has not yet received the list of personnel to be withdrawn from the CCP. It is understood that when the CCP personnel withdraw, some will be sent back to Yan'an by US military aircraft, while the remaining personnel will be sent back to CCP-controlled areas by ship.

Another report states that the Shanghai office of Xinhua Daily on Xikou Road was as quiet as ever yesterday. According to an employee of the office, the Shanghai-based Xinhua Daily personnel had all registered their household registrations, so they did not submit a list to the Garrison Headquarters. As for when and how to withdraw, it depends on the instructions of the CCP delegation in Nanjing.

### Gains and Losses of the Gold Standard Policy: Pei Tsu-yi's Report at the Legislative Yuan's Provisional Session

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] When Pei Tsu-yi reviewed the gains and losses of the Central Bank's implementation of the gold standard policy over the past year at the Legislative Yuan at noon on the 1st, he believed that this policy was effective in stabilizing prices last year, but the situation has changed this year, so it is necessary to carefully consider whether to continue its implementation. Pei first gave a general description of the economic situation in the early days of recovery, stating that at that time, the government was busy with recovery and the national economy had no definite policy. Until the beginning of last year, a market turmoil occurred in Shanghai, and the people hoped that the foreign exchange market could be opened. The government then announced three proposals in late February: "Regulations on Opening the Foreign Exchange Market," "Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade," and "Provisional Measures for Central Bank Management of Foreign Exchange," and implemented them on March 4th, deciding to divide imported materials into three categories: non-importable, limited, and unlimited. At that time, in view of the extreme shortage of materials during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the prevention of foreign goods passing through was not strict, but there was absolutely no permission for nylon stockings to be settled in foreign exchange. However, during implementation, there were difficulties due to the excessive number of items on the import list. Therefore, there were thousands of importers and exporters in Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places, with as many as three or four thousand in Shanghai alone, and it was necessary to adopt a method of division of labor and cooperation, designating some merchants to handle the business. In April and May, the general impression was excellent. Foreign exchange losses were not significant, and government revenue increased more than doubled due to the export of raw materials and the entry of foreign goods. From spring to summer, prices were relatively stable, largely due to the success of the Political Consultative Conference. After July, however, speculative capital increased daily, and external pressure was also heavy. Although the Central Bank had the intention of changing the exchange rate, it still did not dare to act rashly. While it was under consideration, the price of rice suddenly fluctuated again. Due to the grain shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai, the price of rice rose sharply. On August 17th, the exchange rate was adjusted to 3350, but merchants were skilled at hoarding and using speculative capital to purchase goods in rural areas. The Central Bank had no choice but to suppress prices with gold. This was the beginning of the government's gold policy. The import of glass handbags and nylon stockings was not due to poor planning, but due to smuggling in Hong Kong. The main reason I (Pei's self-reference) went to Hong Kong last year was to discuss with the Hong Kong authorities how to prevent smuggling. The Governor of Hong Kong had already understood this, but the British government has not yet replied. This was truly unexpected. Foreign exchange also increased daily. In view of this, the authorities revised the import and export regulations a month ago, hoping to reduce foreign exchange losses. After the announcement of the limited quota method, import merchants also began to register. Pei also said that he could reassure everyone present that there was absolutely no favoritism in the import goods approved at that time, and there were no merchants personally known to Tsu-yi among them.

Pei then analyzed the foreign exchange allocation rate last year, pointing out that most of it was the import amount of cotton, with a total of 76 million US dollars. The second was yarn, with 70 million US dollars, followed by tobacco, and then oil, accounting for 52.9 million US dollars. Chemical raw materials were 50.3 million, and metal products were 35 million. Since the implementation of the gold standard policy, prices have inevitably risen, but prices were stable during the three months from March to June, after August, and from September to November last year, which proves that the gold standard policy was not entirely ineffective. However, by the end of the lunar year, due to the New Year's customs, expenditures on all sides were doubled, and the situation suddenly changed drastically. The past effectiveness of the gold standard policy was mainly due to domestic peace. This year, the situation has changed greatly, and whether this policy can continue to be implemented requires detailed consideration. Pei then analyzed the recent gold rush in Shanghai, saying that it was greatly related to the influx of speculative capital from various places into Shanghai, and specifically pointed out that the Shanxi merchants' activities in Shanghai had a very significant impact on the gold rush. Pei answered the questions for half an hour, analyzing them clearly, which moved the listeners. His final conclusion was that after the implementation of the government's new emergency measures, although there was a risk of legal tender being released, China's international trade has not yet reached a balanced state, so there is no reason to be pessimistic about the above phenomenon.

Legislators Raise Questions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Legislative Yuan held its fifth provisional meeting at 9:15 a.m. on the 1st, with President Sun as chairman. Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, and Pei Tsu-yi attended to report on matters. Then, Premier Song began to read the written report on financial and economic measures and explained that he had requested the chairman to resign from the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, which had now been approved. After the report, legislators raised questions one after another. Lou Tongsun pointed out that this was the first time Premier Song had attended the Legislative Yuan since taking office, proving that the connection between the executive and legislative branches in the past was insufficient. The Legislative Yuan had already recognized the crisis last summer, but the Executive Yuan failed to discuss it together. After the Shanghai gold rush occurred, the government announced emergency economic measures, but the content was broad, and we urgently want to know how long the implementation will last and what kind of effects can be expected. This plan is equivalent to a test of the entire national economy. How can we guarantee its considerable success? Premier Song has no central policy since taking office, only treating the symptoms. The emergency economic plan is only a temporary solution. We hope that the policy will return to normal. Zhou Yizhi said that Song was very successful in presiding over finance during the Northern Expedition, but now it has plummeted, analyzing it from the perspective of poor planning and raising the issue of credit. Zhong Fude inquired whether there were any errors in the gold policy, whether there was any corruption, and how to stabilize workers' wages. It is also incomprehensible that state-owned enterprises are not allowed to increase prices and are required to be self-sufficient. Zhang Zhaoyuan said: (1) In the past, the government threw out gold to recall legal tender, but now buying gold will release legal tender. With so much speculative capital, it will inevitably hoard and cause prices to rise. (2) Restrictions on the silver and jewelry industry have caused millions of workers across the country to lose their jobs and have implicitly canceled the people's savings methods. (3) Checking gold causes anxiety. Premier Song replied that to stabilize the economy, political stability is the top priority, and said that he has now resigned and does not want to say more, and then left at 10:46 a.m. Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun and Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu answered the questions raised by the legislators one by one. Then Qian Tianxin inquired about the remaining amount of the 500 million foreign exchange fund, and Chen Guyuan pointed out the resolution of the Second Plenary Session: (1) Increase production, (2) Absorb speculative capital. Today, the government should not compete with the people for profit, but compete with the Communist Party for the hearts of the people. Tradition first, Chen Zifeng and Jian Guansan raised questions about the cost of living for civil servants and educators. Peng Chuntu criticized the Central Bank for making no progress, which Pei Tsu-yi answered in detail. The meeting adjourned at 12:40 p.m.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Legislative Yuan has many cases pending review. President Sun declared at the provisional meeting on the 1st: Six more meetings must be held today.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 1st] The National Army, advancing in a fan shape along the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, recovered Wenshang at 1 p.m. on the 1st on the left flank. After lightly searching the city, all the Communist troops were cleared, and over two hundred Communist troops and their political workers were captured alive. The National Army on the right flank continued to sweep up scattered Communist troops near Qufu today, and the Communist troops in Sishui have become candles in the wind.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 1st] There was no major contact around Jinan on the 28th and 1st, and the situation has gradually become peaceful.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 1st] The situation on the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway is becoming increasingly tense. According to reports, on February 27th, another 20,000 Communist troops fled from Juxian to Xujialouzi, 25 kilometers southwest of Gaomi, and Shiziwei, 20 kilometers south. In addition, the 3rd Police Brigade and the 6th Jiaodong Police Brigade also fled from Xinhe to Sunjiakou, 23 kilometers north of Jiaoxian. Their intention to attack Qingdao, Jiaoxian, and Gaomi is now even more obvious.

### National Army in Northeast Launches Three-Pronged Attack; Sun Liren and Chen Mingren Go to the Front to Command; Fierce Fighting Outside Dehui Repulses Communist Troops

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 1st] Sun Liren, commander of the New First Army, and Chen Mingren, commander of the 71st Army, went to the front to command this afternoon.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 1st] "Exciting good news will be coming in the next three days," a senior commander here told reporters tonight. He declined to explain the nature and extent of this "good news," but it is generally speculated that it refers to the relief of Dehui and the start of a major battle.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 28th] The situation in Changchun was stable yesterday and this morning, and the citizens' outlook on the war situation has changed from tense to optimistic. Many citizens gathered at the station, casually observing the National Army getting on and off the train. Cars and horses on Zhongshan Avenue were bustling, and spirited armed troops marched on the road. Commodity prices have ceased to rise.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 1st] The National Army is currently launching a three-pronged attack on the invading Communist troops. The eastern route is advancing rapidly towards Jiutai, and the National Army in the Nong'an area on the western route is pressing towards the Changchun-Harbin Railway. The diamond-shaped area has been compressed. A major battle between the main forces of both sides is about to unfold near Dehui. The artillery fire in Dehui was incessant last night. According to a telegram from the Dehui garrison, the Communist troops have suffered no less than 10,000 casualties in recent days. According to military observers here, the mobilization of the Communist troops invading from Songbei, and the scale of their momentum, is an unprecedented event in the war history of the Northeast Nationalists and Communists. It is no less than the Southern Battle launched by the Communist troops, which previously shook the whole country. Fortunately, the Jilin-Changchun area is well prepared, the National Army's use of troops is miraculous, and the mobilized force has also exceeded the Siping Battle. A fierce battle is imminent. The National Army's actions in the next 24 hours will be the key to the overall situation. If the situation does not change, the main battle between the two sides will unfold in the triangular area between the Changchun-Harbin and Jilin-Changchun lines, and a considerable-scale battle may also occur between the Changchun-Harbin and Changchun-Tao'an lines.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 1st] After the battle situation around Changchun-Jilin and southern Liaoning stabilized, passenger trains on the Changchun-Harbin Railway resumed on the 1st, departing twice from Shenyang.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 28th] The 359th Brigade, a strong force of the Communist Army that previously fought in Siping, and five divisions, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th, as well as more than 30 heavy artillery pieces and tanks and other heavy weapons, launched a full-scale attack on Dehui (80 kilometers from Changchun). Yesterday, the artillery fire rumbled all night. Pan Yukun, commander of the 50th Division of the New First Army guarding Dehui, and deputy commanders Xie Shuhui and Yang Wen, led more than 8,000 troops and fought bravely, inflicting heavy damage on the invading Communist troops. For five days and nights, Dehui is still firmly defended by the 50th Division.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 1st] The battle outside Dehui is fierce. The Communist troops reinforced with 20,000 men and launched a fierce attack on the National Army in the Longwangshan (southwest of Dehui) area on the 27th. The National Army defended strongly. The Communist troops used many heavy artillery pieces to bombard the city. That night, the Communist troops used dense artillery fire to cover the infantry charge. A melee broke out between the two sides, and on the 28th, they were finally repulsed by the National Army.

### Songhua River Bridgehead: Isolated Army Stands Firm and Unharmed

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 1st] The isolated army at the bridgehead on the other side of the Songhua River, although under artillery attack by the Communist troops, still stands firm and unharmed, which is the most magnificent scene in this battle.

### Military Joint Defense in the Jurisdictions of the Beiping and Northeast Headquarters Achieves Results; Forces Can Be Used Flexibly in the Future

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] Regarding the matter, it was said: Due to the arrival of Minister Bai, Xiong Shihui, and Fu Zuoyi in Beiping, the military joint defense in the jurisdictions of the Northeast and Beiping Headquarters has achieved results. In the future, troops will be used flexibly according to the importance and needs of the region.

Fu Zuoyi Discusses the Current Situation in Chahar and Suiyuan

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] Fu Zuoyi met with reporters at the Office of the 12th War Zone at 6 p.m. today and answered reporters' questions as follows: (1) The local order in Chahar and Suiyuan is good. All counties have been recovered. Now everyone can speak Mandarin in every county, every road can be traveled, and the Pinghuan Road is fully open. (2) The current serious difficulty in Chahar and Suiyuan is the lack of clothing. The people in northern Chahar have not received new clothes for ten years during the Japanese rule. After the recovery, if we start with promoting cotton, it will be too slow to solve the problem. The provincial government decided to adopt a method of exchanging grain for cloth, that is, the provincial government purchased a large batch of cotton cloth from the Tianjin China Textile Company with the price of military grain, and distributed it to the farmers at the original price, which solved the clothing problem for the farmers who paid grain, simplified the procedures, and avoided the drawbacks of price suppression and non-issuance by grain purchasing personnel. (3) Regarding the spring plowing problem, the livestock losses in Chahar Province after the war were very large. The provincial government decided to concentrate more than 1 billion in agricultural loans of various types to purchase some livestock to expand spring plowing. (4) On the issue of developing western Suiyuan, if the corner of western Suiyuan is fully developed, the food supply in the Beiping and Tianjin area can be completely solved. However, improving Yongli is a key element in this matter. Now UNRRA, Relief and Rehabilitation, and Sui Construction should be working together. It is estimated that after repairing each ferry into a new type of reinforced concrete gate, 10 million mu of fertile land can be irrigated. The required funding is only a few billion yuan. As for the labor shortage problem, consideration has been given to recruiting farmers to go. (5) The construction of the Baotou-Ningxia Railway has been included in the first phase of the five-year construction plan. If it is completed, the grain of western Suiyuan can be transported eastward. The Ping-Sui Railway takes the route of Datong, mainly for transporting coal. Datong's coal production reaches a maximum of 8,000 tons per day, which is of great economic value, so there is no need to change the route. However, the gradient of the ditch near the Great Wall is too high, and the train has to use two locomotives, which is obviously problematic. Therefore, it is planned to change the route to Zhicheng and open a new line directly to the Mentougou area. (6) Regarding the Mongolian issue, there are still Communist troops in Xilin Gol League in northern Chahar, which form a force with the Communist troops in Lindong and Linxi in northern Jehol. The National Army has not yet stationed there. The people of the country must be careful and thorough in dealing with the Inner Mongolia issue and seek a proper solution.

They seem to intend to take the opportunity to attack. Since the beginning of spring, many shops in Yulin have announced their closure because they are unable to bear the excessive burden.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 1st] The Suzhou rice market has recently shown an unprecedentedly miserable scene. Rice shops often refuse to retail, causing panic among the common people.

### Ambassador's Extensive Discussion on Our Overall Situation: Bad Political Practices Must Be Eradicated; Current Efforts Should Focus on People's Livelihood

[Special Dispatch from Our Guangzhou Office on the 28th] Before flying to Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 28th, Ambassador Stuart held his second press conference in Guangzhou, answering various questions. He stated: (1) The current economic crisis in China is firstly an inevitable result of the eight-year war of resistance, and secondly, unfortunately, due to the occurrence of civil war, foreign trade and production are on the verge of stagnation. Therefore, in areas not affected by the civil war, the government and the people must strive for production and construction in order to save this crisis. (2) Regarding the sudden cessation of the withdrawal of American troops from Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places, and the continued arrival of materials to supply the American troops, the Ambassador elaborated on the American position, stating: The cessation of the withdrawal of American troops is due to technical problems such as transportation vessels. The personnel of the Peiping Executive Headquarters will be completely withdrawn in about a month, and the U.S. Marines will be withdrawn as soon as possible, because before the withdrawal, they still have the task of protecting the lives and property of Americans; as for the newly arrived materials, they were actually shipped earlier and only recently arrived. (3) The surplus American materials shipped to China do not include military supplies such as guns and ammunition. As for when the shipment will be completed, it is a technical issue, as there are ships coming from more than seventeen islands in the Pacific. (4) The rumor that he will resign from his position as Ambassador is not true. (5) The trip to Hong Kong and Hainan Island is only to inspect the local American僑 and meet with people in the education and cultural circles; there are also fifteen Americans in Hainan Island. (6) Chinese students' patriotic enthusiasm is no less than that of other countries, but they must recognize that China can no longer afford destruction. The nationalism and democracy aspects of the Three Principles of the People have gradually been realized, and current efforts should focus on the livelihood aspect. China's greatest enemies at present are the differences in opinions among parties, the inability to achieve unity and peace, and the existence of bad political practices. Therefore, there must be a reform to eradicate these stains with the spirit of resisting foreign forces in the past, but this task is the most arduous. (7) Whether the U.S. policy toward China will change depends on how the environment changes. However, from the American standpoint, helping all Chinese people is a policy that will never change. (8) Regarding the reorganization of the government, the United States has obtained assurances from the Chinese government that it will expand democracy and improve political weaknesses. As for the participation of various parties, this is an internal Chinese matter and is not convenient to criticize. However, the U.S. government and people all wish China to have a government supported by the people. Therefore, he believes that the people and the media should assist the government to become the most ideal government for the people. (9) He has not heard of the $500 million loan, or the United States may have made this preparation. (10) U.S.-Soviet relations certainly affect China and are also the most important issue in the world, but he believes that the American and Soviet people both love peace, and the United States will do its best to achieve the desire for peace. (11) The Chinese Constitution is certainly legal, but the degree of its implementation depends on whether the people can fulfill their civic obligations, as democratic politics has its advantages and disadvantages. China is now embarking on the initial stage of democratic politics with this new Constitution, giving the people an opportunity unprecedented in history. Therefore, it is hoped that the Chinese people can make contributions to the country and the world.

### A Page of Blood Debt from the Enemy in Zhangzhu, Yixing: A Pit Full of Corpses Unearthed; A Tragic Sight

[Special Dispatch from Our Wujin Office] In Zhangzhu, Yixing, there is an open space in the Zhangzhu Middle School, originally the school's back playground. The land is near the highway, and has been unused for many years, resulting in much wilderness. Recently, someone passing by saw wild dogs fighting over food in the field. Upon closer inspection, it was found that the loose soil revealed numerous decaying corpses, causing alarm. They rushed to inform the neighborhood, and people like Ru Gen organized workers to go to the site. Upon removing the loose soil, they were horrified to find a large pit filled with corpses. The clothing was intact, but the bodies were dismembered, scattered, and stained with blood, a tragic sight. Among them were those wearing Western suits and overcoats, and one female corpse that was not completely decomposed, with gold teeth. It was then realized that this was actually a place where the enemy Kou Sugawa unit killed people during their occupation in 1943. When the enemy Kou Sugawa entered Zhangzhu, they stationed enemy soldiers at the Guoshan Academy and the City God Temple (i.e., Zhangzhu Middle School). They built bunkers around the perimeter and strung barbed wire, treating it as a forbidden zone. The people regarded it as a ghostly realm and dared not approach it. It was often heard that they arrested, killed, and tortured our patriotic youths and innocent civilians, but because of the isolation between the inside and outside, and the enemy's secretive actions, it was impossible to find out the details. After the defeat of the Japanese, no one knew that this playground was a slaughter ground, except for the demolition of the fortifications. The excavated remains are estimated to be more than thirty, and they cannot be identified. Local philanthropists have provided coffins and moved the bodies for burial. However, there are still many remains in the pit, and excavation and reburial are continuing.

### Civil Aviation Administration Promotes Flight Safety; Plans to Establish "Air Routes" and Strengthen Communication and Sound Meteorological Reporting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Since the Ministry of Communications officially established the Civil Aviation Administration, all sectors have placed great hopes on this new institution. According to reporter inquiries, the Bureau is currently busy planning to promote flight safety, carrying out two aspects: First, expedite the construction of navigation aid equipment. What is being planned is the establishment of air routes, and it is intended to first build 14,000 miles of air routes. The so-called air route is an air line with ground trial assistance equipment. The main equipment is radio navigation instruments, various radio signals, and light signals, so that the driver can hear and see during flight, as if walking on the road. Its determination is to expand and repair airports, and it is planned to first improve international airports and other important domestic airports. The Shanghai airport project has already started, and the Guangzhou airport project has also been planned. In addition, implement air traffic control. Air route traffic control is like traffic police on land. Its role is to limit aircraft from colliding, getting lost, and reducing unnecessary delays, and helping drivers complete safe and orderly flights. The Bureau plans to set up three types of air traffic control agencies: one is the air route traffic control station to assist in controlling and directing flights on the air route; one is the airport traffic control station to control and direct aircraft takeoffs, landings, and taxiing in the airport area, usually within a radius of three miles around the airport.

The Bureau is currently setting up aviation communication stations in airports in various places to handle communication for air traffic control, the transmission of meteorological reports, and the dissemination of flight-related information to pilots, and is closely cooperating with the Central Meteorological Bureau to universally set up meteorological stations to improve meteorological reporting.

On the other hand, the Bureau is strengthening safety management. Aviation safety management, unlike meteorological management, can be divided into three aspects: (1) Personnel management, (2) Equipment management, (3) Management of aircraft work. The Bureau is now expediting the formulation of standards for aviation technicians and aviation equipment, as well as detailed laws and regulations for the certification of aviation technicians and the inspection of aviation equipment. In terms of aircraft work management, inspectors will be dispatched regularly to inspect the aircraft work and repair equipment of various airlines.

Editorial

### New Trends in the Political Situation

Since the close of the National Assembly last year, the attention of people at home and abroad has focused on the reorganization of the government. However, due to the failure to restore peace talks and the hesitation of various parties, the matter has been delayed again and again. It was not until recently that it gradually became concrete. The lists of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party participating in the four institutions (Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, National Political Council, and Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association) have been submitted. Moreover, the lists of various parties participating in the three institutions of the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, and National Political Council have also been approved by the National Defense Supreme Committee. As for the list of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, it is only waiting for the National Government to issue a clear order for its announcement. At the same time, Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, when reporting and explaining the government's economic policies to the Legislative Yuan yesterday morning, also announced that he had submitted his resignation and that Chairman Chiang had approved it. Yesterday afternoon, the National Defense Supreme Committee held a temporary meeting and formally approved the decision that Chairman Chiang would temporarily concurrently hold the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan. All of this is sufficient to symbolize that the current political situation has undergone new changes.

After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the primary desire of the entire nation, from top to bottom, was the democratization of politics and the improvement of people's livelihoods. In order to realize political democratization, the government, despite the blatant opposition of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely convened the National Assembly, formulated a practical and feasible democratic constitution, and decided to implement it on December 25th of this year to fulfill its long-standing promise. Now is the transitional period from political tutelage to constitutionalism, and all necessary preparations for the implementation of constitutionalism must be completed during this short transitional period. Therefore, the government is eager to broaden its foundation, recruit representatives from various parties and social elites, participate in various administrative institutions, and actively carry out preparations for the implementation of constitutionalism. Now that the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have submitted their lists to participate in the four institutions, it will not be long before they further participate in the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan. Apart from the Communist Party, which is disrupting the country with its military forces, the willingness of all political parties to jointly promote democracy with the Kuomintang through legitimate means is indeed the most gratifying trend in the current political situation. We firmly believe that there will be a bright day for its realization.

The resignation of Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan this time, although a common occurrence on the political stage, we still feel a variety of emotions regardless. Recalling when Song returned from overseas and took office, the entire nation placed endless hopes on him. But today, Zhu resigned due to the gold note turmoil, which aroused criticism from all sides. On the surface, it seems to have become the "target of public criticism." This stark contrast is unfortunate for Song and also unfortunate for the country. In all fairness, Song is a very confident person, and his administration is quite resolute. In the Chinese officialdom, where perfunctory behavior has become commonplace, he is still considered to have a unique style. Unfortunately, he is too confident and unwilling to listen to different opinions. He is resolute and therefore often stubborn. In addition, the scope of his usual contact is limited to certain people in the economic and financial circles, and he has failed to silently observe the trends of public opinion and the psychology of the people. As a result, the policies he adopted may not be able to address the root causes of the problems. We do not want to judge Song's economic policies based on success or failure today, but his lack of a deep understanding of the most important political maxim, "A state cannot stand without credibility," and his easy destruction of the people's confidence in the government is the root of the problem. Song also frankly admitted that there may have been errors in the past year when he attended the Legislative Yuan to report on economic policies, and he still showed a responsible attitude. What we should pay attention to is not so much Song's resignation, but rather the future style of the government. We believe that the only way out for the political situation in the future is for the government and the people to truly become one. The government must first regard the people as those who can be treated with kindness, as the source of national construction power in the future, and not regard them all as criminals. If those in power can constantly seek advice widely, deeply understand the people's concerns, and formulate any policy with the people in mind, they will naturally gain the trust of the people. Those who are close to the people will be close to them, and those who love the people will be loved by them. Only by gaining the cooperation of the people can the government and the people become one. Then, why worry about any policy being difficult to implement? This is the "world for all" ideal of the Founding Father and the true meaning of democratic politics. No matter how the government is reorganized, or who will actually be in charge of the Executive Yuan, the first priority of the government should be to restore the people's confidence in the government's policies.

### The Balkan Situation Will Have a New Change; Britain Asks the US to Provide Economic Assistance to Greece; Both Sides Are Compromising in Washington

[United Press, London, 1st] A foreign office spokesman announced today that Britain and the United States are discussing in Washington the issue of Britain's extended economic assistance and military obligations to Greece. One of the proposals is to provide further loans so that Greece can purchase arms and military equipment. This discussion stems from the British military's need to fulfill its previous statement to withdraw from Greece on March 31. After the withdrawal of British troops, the United States will not send troops to replace them, and there is unrest in Greece, so precautions must be taken. According to other government sources, Foreign Secretary Bevin intends to postpone the withdrawal date and withdraw the remaining 10,000 British troops from Greece within three months, that is, until the end of May.

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] British sources here confirmed that Britain and the United States are exchanging views on the issue of US economic assistance to Greece. British Ambassador Inverchapel submitted a note to Secretary of State Marshall last Monday, explaining the various reasons why Britain cannot continue to bear financial responsibility for Greece after March 31. Although the note did not explicitly state the British military's intention to withdraw from Greece, it pointed out that the British military's presence in the country is a major burden for Britain and cannot be supported indefinitely. The report submitted to the State Department by the US Economic Mission in Greece also matched the British Ambassador's note. The State Department decided that this situation must be explained to congressional leaders, so it invited congressional leaders, including the chairmen of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Appropriations Committee, to the White House yesterday to explain the importance of this matter.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Today, it is rumored that if President Truman decides to take over Britain's economic obligations in Greece and Turkey, congressional leaders will provide assistance, but at the same time, the impact of this move on world stability and the subtle relationship with the Soviet Union must be weighed. Diplomatic and congressional sources said that according to telegrams from London, Britain's domestic economic distress has reached the point of collapse, and it can no longer maintain troops in Greece and provide economic and military assistance to Turkey. When meeting with reporters, President Truman refused to comment on the possibility that the United States would assume all of Britain's obligations in Greece, four times in a row. However, it is heard that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall told leaders of both Democratic and Republican parties in Congress at the White House on the 27th that if the United States does not take this action, Greece may eventually be controlled by the Communists. The two parties' members of Congress listened to the report on the crisis in Greece and reportedly expressed that they would be willing to follow President Truman if he decided that the United States should stand up to maintain the European settlement. However, some Republican members believe that the government should first explain its plan in detail to Congress and the people before making a final decision.

Greece Dissolves Communist Party Organizations

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 1st] The "Epon" organization, organized by Communist youth, has been ordered by the authorities to dissolve. The organization has protested to the United Nations Fact-Finding Commission on Greece and the World Federation of Democratic Youth. According to well-informed sources, the government has changed its strategy and is focusing on launching an offensive against the Greek guerrillas. For example, unconfirmed news from the government side has shown that the number of guerrilla deaths and injuries has increased sharply in recent days. The intention may be to undermine the morale of the guerrillas. It is heard that the government's special forces are not yet ready, so they have not attacked the guerrillas, and it is feared that there will be no action before March 15.

### Bevin and Bidault Announce the Conclusion of a Fifty-Year Anglo-French Alliance; The Purpose Is to Prevent Germany from Rising Again to Invade

[United Press, London, 28th] The foreign ministers of Britain and France announced in parliament today that the two countries had concluded a fifty-year alliance treaty, which is scheduled to be signed next Tuesday in the historic French port of Dunkirk, where the British army retreated during the early stages of the last war. Britain and France have both concluded mutual assistance agreements with the Soviet Union, which, although specifically focused on Germany, also express agreement on joint cooperation to maintain European security and improve its economic situation. The announcement of a third type of agreement now completes one ring around Germany. When announced in the British House of Commons and the French National Assembly, members of parliament cheered. According to Foreign Secretary Bevin, this treaty is a clear demonstration of the friendship between Britain and France. French Foreign Minister Bidault's statement ended by mentioning the Anglo-French alliance treaty, but neither Bevin nor Bidault announced the contents of the treaty. The agreement was principally agreed upon a month ago when Blum visited London and spoke with Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin.

[Reuters, London, 28th] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons that the Anglo-French alliance will be signed in Dunkirk on Tuesday, March 4. He will meet with French Foreign Minister Bidault in that location while en route to Moscow to sign the alliance treaty. After the two foreign ministers arrive in Moscow, they are expected to guarantee that the alliance is not aimed at any second party. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent expects that the first reaction from the Soviet Union will be an expression of suspicion. Misunderstandings can only be dispelled when it can be concretely proven that the alliance is not the first step in organizing a Western European group.

### Key Points of the Anglo-French Alliance

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] Regarding the contents of the Anglo-French alliance, it is now known that the key points are as follows: (1) If Germany adopts an aggressive policy, or adopts an attitude that threatens the security of both countries, the nature of the measures to be taken by Britain and France should be negotiated and discussed by both countries; (2) If one of the two countries, Britain or France, goes to war with Germany, the other country should immediately provide all military assistance, regardless of whether the conflict is the result of German armed invasion; (3) If Germany is unable to fulfill its obligations, Britain and France should consult with each other to take all necessary steps; (4) In economic terms, Britain and France should also consult with each other on issues concerning the interests of both parties; (5) The actions to be taken by Britain and France in accordance with the provisions of this alliance must take into account the obligations of both countries to the United Nations Charter in all respects.

### Another Friend of China Weakened: Powell Passes Away in the United States; Collapses Suddenly After Speech Due to Heart Failure

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Former editor of the China Weekly Review, Powell, passed away suddenly today after giving a speech at a reunion of his classmates at the University of Missouri. In his speech, he predicted that Asia would become increasingly important in international affairs. Powell joked with his friends beforehand, claiming to be an escapee from Walter Reed Hospital, where he had been practicing walking with a prosthetic leg. Powell was arrested by the Japanese army in Shanghai in 1941 and imprisoned for several months, which led to gangrene in both legs, eventually requiring amputation. Powell's death was due to heart disease. Powell collapsed and lost consciousness suddenly after sitting down after his speech. He is survived by his widow and one child each. His son followed in his father's footsteps and is the current editor of the China Weekly Review in Shanghai. Powell said in his final speech: "If the United States has a dispute with the Soviet Union, the war will be in Siberia, not in Europe, because the shortcut is from Alaska across the strait to Siberia."

President Song and Ambassador Koo Send Condolences

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Premier of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen telegraphed condolences to Mrs. Powell, saying, "The news of Mr. Powell's passing has caused great sorrow to me and my colleagues. We will never forget Mr. Powell's presence in China and his excellent work for China."

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wellington Koo telegraphed condolences to Mrs. Powell today, saying that Mr. Powell was not only a good friend of the Chinese people but also strongly supported China during the period of resistance against aggression with unparalleled loyalty and courage. At a time when Sino-American friendship and understanding between the two peoples are becoming increasingly important, the sudden loss of this great friend is deeply mourned by the entire country. Please accept our sincerest condolences.

### Powell's Brief Biography

— Our Newspaper Data Room

Powell was born in 1886 and graduated from the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri in the United States. He came to China in 1917 and served as the editor and publisher of the China Weekly Review, as well as a special correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, the Manchester Guardian, and other newspapers, reporting on the situation in China, which was highly valued by the international public opinion. The Chinese government awarded him a medal in 1923. Powell ran the China Weekly Review for a long time. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he repeatedly exposed and criticized the Japanese military's aggression and barbaric behavior, causing hatred from the Japanese side. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he was detained in a concentration camp and suffered abuse. After being released after the victory, he returned to the United States for recuperation, but his health had been destroyed, and his legs were half paralyzed, making it difficult for him to walk. Last year, at the Tokyo International Military Tribunal's trial of Japanese war criminals, Powell went to Tokyo despite his illness to testify. Afterward, he originally planned to come to Shanghai for a visit to meet old friends, but due to physical discomfort, he followed his doctor's advice and returned to the United States for treatment, and both feet were amputated. Recently, Powell's health had greatly recovered, and he had repeatedly expressed his strong desire to come to China again, but unexpectedly passed away suddenly the day before yesterday after giving a speech at a reunion of his classmates at the University of Missouri.

### During the Allied Council for Japan, Zhu Shimin Will Raise Questions

Chinese representative Zhu Shimin is prepared to raise twelve questions for discussion, all related to the repatriation and demobilization of Japanese troops, and request MacArthur to answer them. Observers believe that Zhu's questions seem to imply that MacArthur has paid little attention to the various proposals of the Allied Council in the past. Other representatives of the Allied Council have also repeatedly made this accusation, but it is of an informal nature.

### Conservative Forces Strong in Japanese Local Elections

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 1st] The number of candidates applying for qualification as governors of Japanese prefectures and municipalities has reached ten times the quota of forty-six. Looking at the overall situation, conservative forces are still strong in local elections. In the Tokyo mayoral election, Tagawa Daikichiro, the incumbent member of the House of Representatives recommended by the Socialist Party, and Yasui, the incumbent mayor jointly recommended by the Liberal and Progressive parties, are the most promising. At present, the Socialist and Communist parties are quite united and can threaten the conservative camp. The question is how the Liberal and Progressive parties will cooperate in the future.

The International Monetary Fund, which opened on March 1, "The International Monetary Fund" is now receiving funds from member countries, so that countries that need the fund to help pay for imports in the future can draw on it. This international exchange work, which was originally a major part of the fund's plan to stabilize world currencies, is scheduled to begin on March 1.

By then, at least thirty-two of the fund's thirty-nine members will have paid their assigned gold and national currencies, and from then on, they will be able to purchase foreign currencies when needed to avoid temporary foreign exchange difficulties.

The first step in the implementation of the plan was for the Fund's Managing Director, Camille Gutt, to set the initial prices of the currencies of thirty-two countries, and after that, the initial exchange rates could not be changed unless adjustments were necessary due to major difficulties in their foreign trade situation. All initial parities are based on current exchange rates.

The other seven countries and two colonies—Brazil, China, the Dominican Republic, Greece, Poland, Uruguay, Yugoslavia, French Indochina, and the Dutch East Indies—were given time for the fund's management to deliberate at length before determining the initial parity of their currencies because currency or reconstruction problems remained to be resolved.

Countries whose parities have not yet been determined will be allowed to delay payment of their assigned funds. Therefore, the fund will only have $6.525 billion in funds at the beginning. When all thirty-nine countries participate, the capital will increase to $7.57 billion. In addition, four new member countries have been allowed to join, namely Italy, Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. After their payments are added, the total will reach $7.7 billion.

The fund is a new experiment in international exchange. It and the World Bank are sister institutions that originated from the monetary conference held in Bretton Woods in 1944. The bank's task is to provide member countries with long-term credit loans; the fund is to meet short-term needs in exchange, namely to maintain the stability of currency values and to provide countries with the currencies needed for foreign trade, and to assume responsibility for the mutual free exchange of currencies. Currency planners believe this is a necessary condition for the reconstruction of world trade. Now that the fund is about to start working, it is important to understand the details of how this institution works.

Supporting the fund is gold and the currencies of member countries. The amount of each country's subscription was determined at the Bretton Woods Conference. Each member country agreed to pay a portion in gold, with the remainder paid in its own currency. It is estimated that after the original thirty-nine countries deliver their subscriptions, the total amount of gold and US dollars supporting the fund will be $3.6 billion. The US portion is $687.5 million in gold and $2.625 billion in US dollars. The US subscription totals $2.75 billion, accounting for 37% of the fund's capital. The other thirty-eight countries should pay $850 million in gold and their currencies worth $3.87 billion in US dollars.

The countries with the next largest subscriptions are the United Kingdom, with $1.3 billion in gold and British pounds; China, with $550 million in gold and legal tender; France, with $525 million in gold and francs; and India, with $400 million in gold and rupees. France's original subscription was $450 million, but the Fund's Board of Directors increased it to the current amount at France's request. It made this request to increase its power to withdraw from the fund in the future.

Currency values will be gradually adjusted over a long period of time. At the beginning, the fund will use current exchange rates as the standard, but it is stated that the parities of some currencies will be adjusted later. This is so that the US dollar can make the values of the currencies of various countries match each other, so that no country will be able to take advantage of the trade by artificially inflating or deflating its currency.

Member countries agree to maintain the initial statutory parity before changing the value in accordance with the terms of the Fund's agreement. The fund has established this barrier in order to prevent currency wars. Competing to gain export benefits through devaluation is a reason that caused extreme currency fluctuations in the past, and it has now been agreed by all countries to eliminate it.

Many currency controls that protect their foreign currency reserves will also be gradually eliminated. The fund recognizes that countries weakened by the war, such as France, need to impose some controls on citizens who use US dollars to purchase goods in the future. At the same time, France and other member countries agree to ease these restrictions to the extent possible. The time limit given to France to lift controls is five years. If it fails, it will lose the right to withdraw funds from the fund, and in this case, it may eventually lose its membership.

At the beginning, the currency sold by the fund may all be US dollars. This currency is most needed by member countries, because the United States is the main supplier in the world. The following situation can be used as an example: France needs more US dollars to buy American goods than it has in its possession. It can apply to the fund for $131.25 million, which is one-quarter of France's allotment and the maximum amount it can purchase in one year. The fund determines that it has the ability to repay and that the use of the US dollars is appropriate, and approves the application.

France must pay in the same amount of francs for the US dollars it receives. The exchange rate is based on the statutory parity of the two currencies set by the fund. France agrees to repay quickly to the extent possible and will take back the francs after repayment. At the same time, France needs to pay the fund a handling fee and interest. A handling fee of 0.75% is paid immediately. Interest is then paid at 0.5% starting after three months, gradually increasing to 4% after four years and 5% after ten years. Therefore, France needs to quickly offer French goods to the United States in order to repay the loan as soon as possible.

The Fund's agreement strictly limits changes in currency values. However, it recognizes that some initial rates do not represent true values, and the value of some currencies can fluctuate several times before a suitable benchmark is found. Adjustments will go through the following process: Suppose France later finds that the initial statutory parity of the franc—119 to one US dollar—is too high, which is not conducive to it selling goods at French prices to foreign countries. French prices can be reduced, but this may cause a domestic recession. Therefore, France depreciates the franc by 10% and notifies the fund. A 10% devaluation does not require the consent of the fund.

But suppose the price of the franc is still too high. Then, another devaluation must obtain the consent of the fund, and the fund will only approve it if a cheap franc is necessary to maintain the country's foreign trade position.

Therefore, changes exceeding 10% are within the scope of international control, and it is generally believed that this can prevent any unnecessary changes. The opposite of this situation is the unrestricted fluctuations in the past. The French franc went from 3.92 cents per US dollar in 1929 to 5.3 cents in 1933, then to 6.6 cents in 1935, and then fell to 4.5 cents in 1937, 2.88 cents in 1938, 2.08 cents in 1940, 1.97 cents in 1945, and finally 0.839 cents in 1946.

Stabilizing world trade is the ultimate goal of the currency plan. Suppose, taking France as an example, it has a bad wine harvest one year. If it cannot sell wine to the United States, it will temporarily lack the funds to buy the American goods it needs. This will affect the trade situation between France and the United States. Therefore, in order to overcome this difficulty, France can go to the fund to obtain the US dollars it needs.

The danger of US dollars flowing out of the fund in a constant stream is what it will encounter from the beginning. Therefore, it must refuse member countries' arbitrary extensions of borrowing power and insist on carefully reviewing the applicant's purpose and ability to repay. The task that the fund shoulders is extremely large. Its success depends not only on the fund's own efforts, but also on whether member countries can solve domestic monetary and production difficulties. A stable world currency system is not achieved overnight. (US Information Service)

### Korea Commemorates Independence Day; Domestic and Foreign Opposition to Trusteeship Demands Independence

[Reuters, Seoul, 1st] Today is Korean Independence Day, and a curfew will be implemented throughout the country. Judging from past experience, today is often a day for riots and even revolutions. US intelligence personnel have discovered plans for Koreans to riot around March 1, so unrest may still be unavoidable today. The commander of US forces in South Korea has ordered increased vigilance and issued a warning, pointing out that malicious riots would only harm the good intentions of those who care about Korea and would make the latter believe that Korea may not yet be suitable for independence since the Korean people are unwilling to cooperate with the institutions preparing for Korean independence. At the same time, propaganda against trusteeship is still emerging endlessly both inside and outside Korea. Right-wing leaders still insist on implementing the three-point plan they passed on January 14, namely: (1) Oppose the provisions of the Moscow Declaration on trusteeship of Korea; (2) Organize a national Korean independence movement; (3) Send a delegation to the United States and the Soviet Union to demand immediate independence. The right-wing group also launched a request for General MacArthur to review the Korean situation, and several parties have expressed support for this request. However, both the left and right wings have great hope for the Moscow Conference, hoping that the Korean issue will at least be partially resolved.

### Doubts Cleared Regarding Differential Subsidies for Social Affairs Bureau
Many Disputes Arise with Manufacturers Regarding Salary Payments
Details to be Discussed Tomorrow
[Report from Our Newspaper] After the February cost of living index was frozen and a subsidy of 73,000 yuan was introduced, many manufacturers encountered disputes when paying salaries yesterday and sent telegrams to the Social Affairs Bureau for clarification. The bureau provided answers to each, categorized as follows:
(1) Is the subsidy of 73,000 yuan also applicable to child laborers? Answer: The types and quantities of daily necessities supplied to employees are calculated based on a family of three. Child laborers do not have wives, children, or family burdens, so the calculation is based on one-third. If meals are provided, the difference in the subsidy for rice, coal briquettes, oil, salt, and sugar must be deducted, and only the cotton cloth item is provided.
(2) Is there also a subsidy for overtime wages in addition to the regular wages? Answer: No.
(3) How is the differential subsidy calculated and paid for those who take leave? Answer: If the leave is approved by the factory, the subsidy will be paid as usual. If it is absenteeism, there will be no subsidy.
(4) How is the differential subsidy paid to employees who are paid by piecework? Answer: Calculated proportionally.
(5) How is the differential subsidy paid to those who are paid on a daily basis? Answer: Calculated and allocated proportionally.
(6) In this differential subsidy, rice is calculated at eight dou. How will this be handled for those who already have a rice subsidy? Answer: If there is already a rice subsidy equivalent to five dou of rice outside of the salary, then in February, in addition to the original subsidy, the difference for the eight dou of rice will be converted into cash, calculated as three dou. The differential subsidies for other items such as oil, coal briquettes, sugar, cloth, and salt will be paid as usual.
In summary, the Social Affairs Bureau has stipulated one principle: all salaries calculated on a monthly basis will be paid according to 73,000 yuan. The details will be discussed at the labor-management adjudication meeting to be held tomorrow.

### General Labor Union Discusses Index Issues, Hopes for Adjustment Every Three Months
[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal General Labor Union held a board meeting yesterday afternoon, chaired by Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the union. The meeting discussed the issue of workers in various districts and industries demanding the unfreezing of the cost of living index. There was enthusiastic participation and heated discussion. It was generally believed that the government's freezing of the cost of living index, while failing to effectively curb prices, has severely impacted the lives of workers. This is due to the government's failure to fully understand the actual living conditions of workers in Shanghai, and it is regrettable that the labor community was not consulted beforehand. However, considering the serious economic difficulties currently facing the government, the emergency economic measures of the government are reluctantly accepted for the time being. However, it is hoped that the cost of living index will be adjusted every three months in the future (for example, April salaries will be paid according to the March cost of living index) in order to alleviate the long-term suffering of workers.

[Another News Item] Regarding the employment problem of unemployed workers who have come to Shanghai from the rear, the union has decided to organize a committee to discuss solutions.

Following reports on a brief history of the March 1st Movement by various revolutionary martyrs, Chairman Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Council and Councilor Wang, representing the municipal government, delivered speeches in response. Mr. Pan stated: "I am very pleased to participate in the Korean Revolution Commemoration Meeting in my dual capacity as a representative of the Municipal Council and Secretary-General of the Sino-Korean Cultural Association. During the Cairo Conference, China strongly advocated that Korea should be granted independence. Although this proposal was supported by the Allied countries, it has not been realized to this day, which is regrettable. Although China has won victory, the people are still in dire straits due to the instigation of a few ambitious elements. We should work closely together, strive for survival, and continuously strive for democracy and freedom."

### Retrial of Li Ze Case
Reopening of the Investigation Hearing
Claimed to Have Received Approval from the Military Intelligence Bureau for Serving as Director of the Puppet Association for Business Coordination
[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Li Ze, General Manager of the New World Company, accused of being a traitor, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the High Court on June 8th last year. Li appealed the verdict, and the Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial. Yesterday was the reopening of the investigation after the retrial of the Li case, and witness Huang Naotang was summoned. Li Ze wore glasses, a dark gray silk floss robe, and black Zhigong Ni Hankou shoes, with a plump complexion and calm demeanor. Many employees of the New World Company were present in the audience, but the original informants, Shu Yueqiao and Han Wucheng, were not seen. Yesterday's High Court hearing was quite simple, focusing on the following two matters: (1) Why was the Japanese national Kinoshita Yutaka hired as a consultant to the New World Company? (2) Why did he participate in the Puppet Association for Business Coordination and serve as a director? Li Ze stated: (1) Because after the Japanese army occupied the concession, the environment was harsh, and Japanese ruffians often harassed the New World Company. The Japanese even planned to invest in and buy the New World Company. In order to avoid this crisis, with the approval of the company's board of directors, Kinoshita Yutaka, a Japanese national who had just arrived in Shanghai, was hired as a consultant to deal with various troubles from the Japanese army. This point has been proven by the chairman of the board, Jin Zongcheng, in court. (2) Regarding serving as a director of the Puppet Association for Business Coordination, he consulted with Huang Ruitang, a liaison officer of the Military Intelligence Bureau, who requested instructions from the Military Intelligence Bureau to allow him to join the puppet organization in order to provide cover for conducting underground work. After participating in the association, he never made any speeches or proposals, which can be verified by consulting the records of the Puppet Association for Business Coordination. The Military Intelligence Bureau has records of my contact with the bureau before the victory. Witness Huang Ruitang, an employee of the Military Intelligence Bureau, was unable to appear in court to testify due to going to Hong Kong. The court adjourned the case for further hearing, and the defendant was allowed to see his family before being returned to the Zhongjian Prison.

On November 2nd of last year, he was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Command, transferred to Shanghai Prison, and detained in Zhongjian Prison. After the High Procuratorate completed its investigation, he was prosecuted on suspicion of treason.

Wang Boyong, Tang Weijun, Pan Guangshan, Shi Hua (also known as Shi Binliang), Weng Yongqing, Zhang Hexiang, Sun Boping, Song Zhen, and others have also been prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of treason.

### Zhong Zhiying Suspected of Aiding the Enemy, Chen Songyao Accused of Colluding with the Enemy
[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhong Zhiying's case, accused of treason, was heard in the High Court yesterday. Zhong once opened the China Building Materials Company. During the fall of Shanghai, he sold a large amount of galvanized iron to the Central China Real Estate Department of the Japanese Revival Corporation and colluded with the Japanese army to purchase materials on their behalf. He was reported by his cousin Huang Shaotang, who testified in court yesterday about the defendant's actions in aiding the enemy in great detail. After questioning, the court adjourned the hearing for further investigation. Chen Songyao, accused of serving as a major staff officer in the Puppet General Staff Headquarters, director of the Puppet 13th Division's Beijing Office, chief of the document section of the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, and chief of the first section of the Puppet Chuansha County Government, was interrogated by the High Court yesterday and adjourned for further hearing.

### Trial of the Fabric Sale Bribery Case Yesterday: Defendants and Witnesses Questioned
[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Court held its third hearing yesterday afternoon for the fabric sale bribery case involving the Municipal Property Management Office. Defendants Pan Shufan, Xu Jingbo, and Liao Gongshao, as well as witnesses Zheng Jing and Zhuo Qingbao, were summoned to court. According to the first defendant, Pan Shufan, he served as the deputy director of the Municipal Property Management Office and resigned in May last year, succeeded by Xie Haoling. Although the municipal government did not send personnel to supervise the bidding for cotton fabric, police personnel were present. According to the second defendant, Xu Jingbo, he served as the director of the Police Welfare Committee. His motive for purchasing 1,000 bolts of cotton fabric from the winning fabric merchant after the Municipal Property Management Office sold the cotton fabric was that the General Affairs Office used public funds to purchase them. First, a promissory note was paid to Rongmao Fabric Shop, and then a check was exchanged. The price of the purchased fabric later fell, resulting in a total loss of six million yuan, which was recorded in the public accounts. The third defendant, Liao Gongshao, testified that he served as the director of the General Affairs Office of the Police Bureau. The purchase of cotton fabric was indeed advocated by the General Affairs Office, but the purpose was to seek welfare for all and was approved by the director. Judge Huang Guangyu questioned the three defendants and then questioned witness Zheng Jing, who was the accounting director of the Police Bureau. He claimed that he did not know whether there were any difficulties in Rongmao's extraction of the fabric after winning the bid. Because someone objected after the fabric payment was made, it was not reimbursed. Another witness, Zhuo Qingbao, the former director of the Xincheng Branch Bureau and welfare committee member, testified that he did not know about the purchase of fabric in advance. According to the market situation at the time, the price of fabric might have risen, but it later fell, so this batch of cotton fabric suffered a significant loss. In conclusion, the court stated that witnesses Li Jia Zhou and Chen Shao Ying were not present and would be re-summoned at a later date.

### Enemy Yasuda Terutada's Trial Concluded, Admits Unreservedly to Receiving Military Rice
[Report from Our Newspaper] Yasuda Terutada, a military officer of the Japanese Gendarmerie stationed in Songjiang during the period of the occupation, led puppet military police units to Huangqiao Township in the county to forcibly collect military rice during his tenure. When he failed to get what he wanted, he set fire to civilian houses in retaliation. Although the villagers of the township knelt on the ground to beg for mercy, Yasuda Terutada not only ignored them but even kicked and drove them away. Dozens of civilian houses were burned down at the time. After the victory, the perpetrator was arrested and sent to the First Pacification District Military Court for investigation, and the prosecution was initiated after the facts were verified. At 3:00 PM yesterday, a collegiate panel trial was specially held. The presiding judge was Li Liang, judges were Lu Qi and Zhang Shijie, the prosecutor was Tu Guangqi, and the clerk was Wang Shuliang. According to the perpetrator's confession, he did go to Huangqiao Township to collect military rice, but he denied setting fire to civilian houses, claiming that it was done by the puppet army. The court stated that the facts of the case were clear and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody. The sentence is scheduled to be pronounced at 2:00 PM on the 8th of this month.

### Investigation Report on the Major Fire Case
District Prosecutor's Office Has Not Yet Received It
Another Telegram Sent to the Municipal Government Yesterday to Urge Inquiry
[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the sensational Ximolu major fire case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, except for the arsonist Shen Qiulin, who has been prosecuted by the prosecutor, the part of the case involving the dereliction of duty by firefighters has not been investigated because the municipal government has not yet sent the investigation report to the prosecutor's office. The prosecuting attorney, Shen Zushou, believes that the suspected firefighters have been detained for a long time, and all sectors of society are paying close attention to the case. Although two official letters have been sent to the municipal government to urge inquiry, no reply has been received. Therefore, he sent another telegram to the municipal government yesterday, requesting that the investigation process be sent to the office as soon as possible for investigation.

### Land Administration Fees in This City to be Collected According to the New Standard

### Mayor Discusses Feelings After President Song's Resignation
China Has Three Difficult Positions, Resigning is a Blessing
Strongly Denies Being Transferred to the Position of Minister of Foreign Affairs
[Report from Our Newspaper] After the news of President Song's resignation reached Shanghai, the reporter paid a special visit to Mayor Wu last night to inquire about his feelings. According to Mayor Wu, he received the news only a few hours earlier than the general public. When he asked President Song for instructions on adjusting the price of flour yesterday afternoon, President Song told him, "I have resigned." Mayor Wu believes that President Song's resignation being approved is "a blessing" because the position of President of the Executive Yuan is not easy to hold these days. Mayor Wu also stated that he had visited Zhang Qun in Nanjing, and Zhang mentioned whether there were rumors in Shanghai about him taking over the position of President of the Executive Yuan. Mayor Wu replied, "I hope these are just rumors, as it would be a blessing for you."
The reporter then asked if there might be any changes in the municipal government after President Song's resignation. The Mayor replied, "I don't know." He added, "Personally, being able to leave Shanghai a day earlier is fortunate." Before the Lunar New Year last year, he had submitted his resignation to the central government, but it was not approved. He then took a step back and requested a one-month leave of absence for rest, but because the environment in Shanghai is complex and unexpected events are difficult to prevent, it was difficult to take leave. Mayor Wu repeatedly showed the reporter his white hair, stating that the Nanjing authorities unanimously recognize that China has three difficult positions: Chairman of the National Government, President of the Executive Yuan, and Mayor of Shanghai. The reporter further asked whether the widespread rumors that Mayor Wu would take over as Minister of Foreign Affairs were true. Mayor Wu strongly denied this, stating that he was least interested in diplomatic work. He believed that Chairman Chiang understood this and would definitely not assign him to do it. He added that he is usually straightforward and frank, with a bold nature. A Minister of Foreign Affairs must be scheming in every word and action, considering everything before and after, which he could not possibly handle.

### China Merchants Electric Company Demands Return of Confiscated Generators
[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to demand the return of the complete set of its power generation equipment, which was forcibly moved by the enemy to the North China Iron and Steel Company in Beiping and the Shentou Power Plant in Boshan, Shandong, during the war, in order to alleviate the power shortage in Nanshi, the China Merchants Electric Company hosted the press at 3:00 PM yesterday at the site of the factory on Chezhan Road. Huang Bingquan, the manager of the company, reported on the situation and led a tour of the site where the generators had been dismantled, requesting that the press uphold justice and appeal on their behalf so that the company's generators could be returned and used for power generation in Shanghai as soon as possible.
According to Mr. Huang, the company sent personnel to investigate the dismantled equipment and learned that it is still in good condition. Two sets of generators with a capacity of 6,400 kilowatts and 3,200 kilowatts, respectively, were moved by the enemy to Shijingshan in Beiping and are now in the custody of the North China Iron and Steel Company, which is managed by the Resources Committee, and have not been used. Another set of 6,400-kilowatt power generation equipment was moved to the Shentou Power Plant in Boshan, Shandong, and is managed by the Zibo Iron and Steel Company of the Resources Committee. The company has been negotiating with the Resources Committee, and official documents have been exchanged for half a year, but it has not yet been returned.
Mr. Huang also stated that the 4,000-kilowatt generator of the British-owned Lunchang Yarn Factory was moved by the enemy to Anshan in Anshan, and President Song has approved its return. Why is the privately-owned China Merchants Electric Company being treated differently? He couldn't help but feel emotional.

His uncle accompanied him to the hospital for treatment. However, it is still difficult to ascertain whether what he said is true. The matter was immediately reported to the branch bureau and then reported to the General Bureau. He was also ordered to continue the diagnosis and consultation for further verification.

Waking from a Nightmare: Chahar Enters a New Direction
Zhangjiakou, 16th – Quick Report from Our Chahar Correspondent, Jie Zhong

Devastation from the war has left the province severely wounded, disordered and broken. Everywhere one looks there are things to heal. Like a spiderweb after a storm, there are countless loose ends and flaws everywhere. Society needs to recover in stability, and the people need to breathe in stability. The desire for politics exceeds the weight of military matters. Only good politics can guarantee the achievements of the military and solve the people’s livelihood. Since the National Army entered Zhangyuan four months ago, they have been busy with military suppression and restoring order. Although administrative institutions at all levels have been established, staffing and funding have not yet been fully implemented. Today, Chahar’s politics is just beginning, and it is also undergoing its first test. Faced with a reality stained with blood and tears, there is a special need for decisiveness, resolve, and grasping key points in politics. It is said that General Fu Zuoyi is not only an outstanding general but also possesses excellent political talent. He has methods for governing the army and managing politics. He left behind great achievements during his eighteen years in Suiyuan. His military achievements have formed a stabilizing force on the frontier. Now, with firm steps, magnificent courage, and full of optimistic confidence, he takes on the arduous and difficult task of repairing a broken land, aiming to make Chahar a solid national defense and a paradise for the people.

Democracy First, People First

I remember at a tea party, reporters praised General Fu's achievements. General Fu humbly said, "I am a simple person from the countryside and do not have any special abilities. Everything I do is according to the will of the people." He pointed out that the victories in Sui, Bao, Ji, Ning, and Zhangyuan were victories of the people's will. "In the era of democracy, the people come first." Everything is for the people and for the soldiers. Perhaps this is the main condition for his success. He understands the hardships of the people, the lives of the soldiers, and knows all the cadres as well as he knows his own family. He knows what the people hope for and, even more, knows how to satisfy the people’s hopes. He has proposed that the central task of Chahar Province's politics at present is "Stability First, Production Paramount," starting with "Clean and Competent Politics."

Talent to the Countryside, Funds to the Countryside

Stability is the guarantee of production and the prerequisite for all political implementation. Stability is not just military suppression, and pacification work is only an important part. In particular, it is necessary to implement democratic politics. General Fu always puts the interests of the people first. In a democratic era, sovereignty belongs to the people, and benefits belong to the people. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the people be aroused, and politics will have strength. The people respect and trust him in the same way because he loves the people so much.

Organizing such a complex and difficult environment requires leadership and concentration of power. During the eight years of the War of Resistance in western Suiyuan, General Fu utilized the unified leadership of the Party, government, military, and youth corps, which had a great effect. The integration of military affairs, government, officials, and the people is the source of strength. Today, Chahar Province is still benefiting from this in its recovery. The administrative lineup of Chahar Province is quite strong, and cadres at all levels are full of youthful vigor, tense, active, and willing to take risks and overcome difficulties. They have struggled in adversity and grown in hardship. Work and struggle are closely linked. Jia Zizun, the magistrate of Longguan County, died in office; Xu Shuren, the magistrate of Kangbao County, cleverly repelled the enemy; both stories have become exemplary tales. Currently, to improve the county and township organizations, they are mobilizing "Talent to the Countryside, Funds to the Countryside" to strengthen the foundation.

Excellent Tradition, Hardworking Style

General Fu often instructed his subordinates, "It is not easy to be a nation-building cadre. During nation-building, the people expect future results from officials, not rewards for the past. The people already believe that the Three Principles of the People are the guiding principles for nation-building, but the people have the right to choose those who implement these principles. Churchill and de Gaulle were both figures with outstanding achievements for Britain and France, but they both failed in the elections after the war. Whether we can get the support of the people depends on whether we can show something for the welfare of the people." "The greatest enemy of politics during nation-building is corruption. Therefore, we must especially implement 'Clean and Competent Politics.' The manifestation of cleanliness is hard work, and the manifestation of competence is active work. We must use hard work and struggle to create a good environment and improve the people's lives." His actions provide strong guarantees for his words. A hardworking style is an excellent tradition in this region. The consistent lifestyle of officers and soldiers, officials and the people has saved the country countless materials and rescued countless cadres. The production of the eighteenth century should never be used for the enjoyment of the twentieth century. Therefore, he strictly requires cadres, "The standard of living cannot exceed the salary. The salary and living standards do not have to be completely consistent. We want to generally improve the living standards of the masses, rather than just seeing the affluent lives of a few individuals." All of this starts from oneself and is consistent internally and externally. Here, cadres can work with peace of mind and strive actively, which is probably due to the success of the leaders.

Government Confidence, People's Expectations

Pacification work is the first lesson of politics. To stabilize a place, it is necessary to have strict household registration and a thorough investigation of the population. "This year, we must ensure that every person is registered under a household, and every household is registered under a district, so that no bad person can hide, and no rumor can spread. After strict investigation and statistics, the whole province has formed 3,303 districts and 28,732 neighborhoods within the areas controlled by the National Army, with a population of 1,937,394, including 1,046,456 men and 234,443 able-bodied men. We also utilize the people's enthusiasm for self-defense, exerting self-defense capabilities through self-defense organizations to achieve the completion of self-defense." Yes, consolidating security needs to be built on the foundation of the people's strength.

The people's representative institutions in each county will be established soon. The elections for the county councils will be held in mid-April. We hope that "Democracy" is not just a signboard or a slogan. Give civil rights to the people, and let democracy become action. "Under truly representative people's institutions, government orders will be implemented more effectively from top to bottom with the assistance of the people's institutions, and public opinion will be reflected from the bottom up for the government to adopt and implement, so that the government serves the people, and the people are the government's support." This is the government's confidence and the people's expectations.

Focus on Spring Planting, Draft Plans

The issue of spring planting is both critical and pressing. The authorities are paying great attention to it. There are detailed plans for lending seeds, plowing cattle, and farm tools to meet the needs of the people. In fact, the government's past relief to the people has been small and slow. The people have always been able to find solutions to their lives in the face of helplessness. What the people hope from the government is stability and less disturbance. We especially emphasize the principle that "Removing abuses is more important than promoting benefits." We coordinate with the military to eliminate the harassment of the Communist troops, so that the people can be guaranteed to engage in production. In addition, we reduce the people's corvée labor, resolve land disputes, and either incorporate or disband the "miscellaneous" troops scattered in the countryside, so as to prevent them from disturbing the local area and hindering cultivation. These are all obstacles that should be eliminated before spring planting. The authorities encouraging production are also paying attention to these issues. As for building water conservancy and well irrigation, the authorities are also actively preparing, but it is easier said than done. We don’t need to write this check just yet.

Relief efforts are quite active. Materials from the Good Rescue Work Team are constantly arriving. Personnel to handle emergency relief always arrive with the army whenever a region is recovered. However, there are too many people in need of relief. There is a feeling that “there are too many monks and not enough gruel.” Sometimes, people receive Western suits, women’s scarves, and children’s shoes, which are laughable and tearful when worn. Or they receive a few cans of milk, how can that save the people from famine?

Improve Education, Cultivate Teachers

The enemy's eight years of enslavement education and the CCP's one year of red education have injected poison and planted hidden dangers into this generation of pure seedlings, making their awareness of the country and nation very vague, and their concepts of human ethics weak. "In Chongli County, an old lady over seventy years old was tied up by the Eighth Route Army. Her grandson, a village cadre, shot her when she begged for mercy!" This is the masterpiece of CCP education. "Strengthening the awareness of struggle" is the heroic behavior praised by the CCP! Therefore, today, education in the recovered areas not only needs to be restored but also needs to be thoroughly reformed. Chahar Province is starting with cultivating teachers. Each county should have at least one simple normal school, emphasizing both quality and quantity, gradually reaching the point of one primary school per district. Currently, there are only 2,000 middle school students in the whole province, which is pitifully few. No schools above the specialized level have opened yet.

Power Plant Destroyed, Light Awaits

The destruction of the power plant in Xiahuayuan is truly a pity. The Japanese invaders had not completed it even after four years of construction. Once completed, the 60,000-kilowatt electricity could make the towns along the Pinghuan line bright. The Communist troops "excellently" destroyed it. Now, it needs to be supplied with light itself. Factories powered by electricity have all stopped. The Communist troops had already transported machines that do not require electricity to the "base area." The Resources Committee plans to repair this project, but funds, technology, and equipment are still nowhere to be found. There is still a long way to go before we can have light.

Although the people of Chahar Province are still groping in tears and sighs, they already have new enlightenment. The storm has passed. Like waking from a nightmare, new hopes are breeding new beliefs. The demands of "survival" and "life" will converge into a magnificent force, advancing in a new direction.

Civilian Firefighting Can Be Learned From

The fire on Wuding Road last month prompted citizens to call for civilian-run firefighting due to dissatisfaction with the municipal fire brigade. The investigation committee, led by Chairman Ge and Director Zhang, specifically inspected the civilian-run fire brigade in the Shanghai South District and listened to the reports of Chairman Mao and Director Hua. It was reported that the association was founded during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, over seventy years ago. Its ability to maintain such a long and glorious history is not due to abundant economic conditions but is supported by a spirit of volunteer service. I believe Chairman Mao's statement that "anyone can do well with money, no one can do well without money" is not entirely true for civilian firefighting. It should be known that for all public welfare undertakings, as long as the public treats it as their own business, the future will definitely be bright. Therefore, I have deep expectations for the Shanghai South District Fire Brigade.

Since the major fire on Wuding Road in this city, the whole city has been in turmoil, with discussions on the streets, in teahouses, and in taverns. The rights and wrongs have been publicly disclosed in the newspapers. All the facts are gradually becoming clear. In short, economics is an important issue, but spirit is also an important issue. Therefore, economic equipment and volunteer spirit are both essential basic factors. Furthermore, if it is supplemented by moral behavior, satisfactory results can be achieved. On the 9th of this month, the Wuding Road fire investigation committee, led by Chairman Ge and Director Zhang, along with Director Wang Yeyu and more than a dozen reporters, came to inspect the civilian fire brigade in the Shanghai South District due to the sensational call for civilian-run firefighting. After Chairman Mao and Director Hua gave detailed reports, it was felt that the association has such a long history without being eliminated or declining. The reputation of volunteer civilian firefighting and the glory of national commendation have not been obtained by chance but are truly created by spirit and volunteerism. Chairman Mao’s statement, "Anyone can do well with money, no one can do well without money," only refers to economic aspects. It is presumed that he did not have sufficient time to mention volunteer spirit and morality. Chairman Ge then asked the director of the South District, Zhu Kuangshi (a current member of the City Council), what his thoughts were on the Wuding Road fire. Director Zhu replied without hesitation: "It is unacceptable for the fire brigade to take so long to put out the fire." His statement only concerned the lack of effective firefighting and did not mention volunteer spirit and morality. Although seizing other people's belongings at the fire scene damages moral reputation and violates the law, as well as concerns the entire fire brigade organization, it cannot be ignored and should be investigated and reviewed. Even though the legal and criminal aspects have been handed over to the court for handling, it is also necessary to be vigilant to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future. If it is believed that the past is over, then future misfortunes may continue to arise. Director Zhu's brief remarks aroused endless concerns about the future of civilian firefighting. It is imperative not to cause fires lasting more than thirteen hours or situations like the one on Wuding Road, or else a stronger reaction will be encountered. You can’t eat a mouthful of rice, but you can’t say a mouthful of words. Now that Director Zhu has spoken, it is hoped that all the volunteer firefighters will muster their spirits and provide practical service to make up for what Director Zhu said. The final evaluation of the inspection results was that the government-run firefighting "only thinks and sighs," while the civilian-run fire brigade in the Shanghai South District appears calm and well-organized. The conclusion drawn is that for any public undertaking to succeed, the people must treat it as their own business. This accurate conclusion shows the intelligence of the leaders and the wonderful publicity of the reporters. It is also hoped that they will continue to provide assistance, so that civilian public undertakings can blossom and bear good fruit. Since the lesson and stimulus of the Wuding Road fire, whenever a fire occurs, the speed of water output, the agility of actions, the bravery of everyone, and the priority of everything are vastly different from before. The proverb "Knowing shame is akin to courage" is hoped to be remembered forever! (Liu Meiyi)

The Roads in Caojing Town Need to Be Repaired Urgently

Editor: Since the suburban buses of the Public Works Bureau and the Shanghai-Caojing special buses of Xiang Sheng Transportation Company began operating in Caohe Town in western Shanghai last year, transportation has become much more convenient. The only regret is that the roads are in poor condition. The section from the city to Longhua is still acceptable, but the section from Longhua to Caohe Town, especially the Zhongshan West Road, is simply too poor! This section of the road is full of potholes of varying sizes and depths. Vehicles travel on it, and the bumps and jolts are beyond description. Even small cars are in danger of overturning. It is hoped that the Public Works Bureau will send workers to repair it as soon as possible. If there is a shortage of funds, a few tons of gravel can be used to fill the holes one by one, and then some coal ash can be used to pave it flat. Fortunately, the route is not long, only about 1,500 meters. The weather is gradually warming up, and the number of military vehicles traveling on this road is gradually increasing. Therefore, I urge you to repair it as soon as possible to avoid accidents. (Xue Linsheng, Joint Office of the 345th District of the 26th District of Shanghai)

Reply to Mr. Chen Jinsu and Xing Sheng: Regarding your letter describing the situation in Fushan Township, we have received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating: "The Jiangyin County Government has been ordered to investigate." Pray to initiate water conservancy projects in the canal basin. Survey of Huaiyin Dams

The Huaiyin Ship Lock, built by the Huai River Water Conservancy Commission in 1926, is located six kilometers northwest of the city and is one of the water conservancy projects in northern Jiangsu. The year-round navigation of the canal (which can accommodate ships of up to 600 tons) and the irrigation of farmland on both sides benefit from it. The Yangzhuang Movable Dam, a control project for the Huai River's channel to the sea, is located eight kilometers northwest of Huaiyin City and was completed in 1937. During the occupation, it was wantonly destroyed by the enemy and puppets and is now unrecognizable. Everything that could be destroyed by human force, such as steel gates, wooden materials, and opening and closing mechanisms, has been dismantled. Even the steel sheet piles buried deep underground and the expansion and contraction steel bars in the concrete have not been spared. The management office buildings are reduced to rubble, which is a major loss for water conservancy construction in northern Jiangsu. In order to restore the above projects, the commission has sent engineering personnel to the dams to conduct surveys and plans for separate repairs. The figures show the current state of the Huaiyin Dam:

(Top) Huaiyin Ship Lock: The gate and opening/closing mechanisms were all dismantled. (Middle) Damage to the Yangzhuang Movable Dam. (Bottom) Expansion/contraction steel bars damaged. (Photo by Zhou Yushan) Fourth Trial of Tani Hisao:

Yesterday's Slaughtering Knives Sounded Fiercely, Now He Must Rely on Previous Accounts
Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua

Tani Hisao caused too much injustice and hatred to the people of Nanjing. He condoned his subordinates in slaughtering 400,000 people in Nanjing. It is pain, hate, blood, and tears. The fate of the butcher, judged by the court, of course, deserves to be torn to pieces.

In three consecutive major trials, there were accusations from the victims' families, testimonies from those who personally experienced the danger, and righteous statements from international friends. The sound of "kill," "rape," "adultery," and "capture" from the Lishi Society was heart-wrenching. The heartless butcher, with a ferocious appearance, still quibbled in court and shirked responsibility, truly "deserving to be killed," "deserving to be killed."

Today (the 25th) is the fourth public trial of the butcher, still presided over by Major General Shi Meiyu. Tani Hisao was escorted in by six military policemen at nine o'clock. He looked old and dejected and was no longer as comfortable as before, probably driven by the conscience of "bone" and "blood"!

After Judge Shi announced the opening of the court, he first questioned Ogasawara Kiyoshi, who testified for Tani Hisao. According to his testimony, "The troops that entered Nanjing were after noon on the 12th, entering the city through Zhongshan Gate. Tani Hisao's troops entered the city through Zhonghua Gate on the morning of the 13th. At that time, the authority was with Yanagawa, and Tani Hisao was only a troop commanded to attack Nanjing." Naturally, everyone has a national concept. Ogasawara Kiyoshi's rebuttal is naturally to defend his own people and is not worth our attention.

Tani Hisao’s guilty conscience in killing people Shi Meiyu severely refuted him

The devil Tani then made a rogue quibble: "The attacking troops included parts of the 114th and 18th Divisions, directly subordinate troops, and special forces. How can it be specifically said that the defendant's troops committed criminal acts? At the same time, the victims summoned by the court all vented their resentment towards the Japanese on the defendant. It is neither credible nor can it be used as strong evidence of guilt. The numbers and names of the perpetrators are also not specifically stated. In terms of location, it is not under the jurisdiction of the defendant's troops. In terms of time, it was also mostly after the defendant's troops were transferred or during fierce battles. In terms of the actual situation, the battlefield at that time was in a no-man's land. Therefore, this kind of witness is actually a kind of imagination and is also a forgery. It is unfair to make a judgment based on this kind of statement. Please, the court, handle it fairly based on the facts." Judge Shi refuted him with stern words before the translator finished translating, "Since the defendant's superior commander or subordinates cannot appear in court to testify, this court still needs to make a fair judgment. The hundreds of thousands of people who were brutally killed cannot be used as evidence of the defendant's guilt, of course, an investigation is needed and not an immediate judgment. Why can the defendant know in advance that it is unfair? This can prove that the killer has a guilty conscience. From the newly discovered evidence, the troops under the defendant's command slaughtered about 7,000 people in the Zhonghua Gate area. The Lonely Soul Stele written by Gao Guanwu, the pseudo-governor of Nanjing in January 1939, can be used as proof. The printed version of the Lonely Soul Stele was presented to the devil Tani by the court, and the photographers were busy taking pictures of this trace of slaughter at this time, actually speaking for thousands of people."

A Book of "Blood and Tears of the Fallen Capital" Settles the Accounts for the Citizens

Director Wu of the Naval Headquarters testified in court, detailing the various brutal acts of the Japanese army after capturing Nanjing. However, after Director Wu was questioned, Tani cunningly replied, "I don't know what relationship the witness's statement has with the defendant!" Because the defendant was the passive one, and the protagonist was General Yanagawa, wanting to push his bloody responsibility completely clean with one sentence. At this time, Judge Shi presented the "Blood and Tears Record of the Fallen Capital" in court and summoned Major General Guo Qi, the author of this book, who is currently receiving training in the Army University, to testify. He said that the atrocities committed by the Japanese army when they invaded Nanjing were countless. What is listed here is just a drop in the ocean. What I wrote was all eyewitnessed facts, and I am absolutely responsible. The purpose of writing this article was originally to commemorate the compatriots who died. Unexpectedly, today, it would be placed in court to testify for the 400,000 souls. It is also an unexpected gain. Major General Guo then presented various atrocities committed by the Japanese army: (1) Japanese soldiers ordered more than 30 farmers to catch fish in a pond outside Zhonghua Gate. It was cold and the water was freezing. Those who entered the water were not allowed to come up and froze to death. Those who did not enter the water were killed. (2) Japanese soldiers raped women outside Zhonghua Gate and then ordered their sons to rape their mothers again. (3) A woman changed into men's clothing and passed through Zhonghua Gate. She was recognized by Japanese soldiers and was gang-raped by five men passing by at the same time. The men refused. Coincidentally, a monk passed by. The Japanese soldiers let go of the five men and ordered the monk to have intercourse with the woman. The monk refused and died from being shot. (4) Japanese soldiers hung an old man high on a tree at Zhonghua Gate and aimed at him to shoot and break the rope. The old man fell to his death, and they laughed at it. (5) Women who took refuge in the International Committee were snuck in by Japanese soldiers every night and raped one by one, called "fishing." (6) Japanese soldiers used relief as a pretext to lure women in, learned their addresses, and then went to rape them at night, called "fishing."... All of the above atrocities occurred from the 12th to the 17th.

After the translator translated, Tani Hisao widened his eyes and cunningly asked, "Please tell me the unit, number of the perpetrating troops. If the unit number cannot be pointed out, these facts are not sufficient to be evidence." At this time, everyone glared at this damn thing.

The "Asahi Shimbun" Boasted About Military Achievements and Served as "Self-Confessed" Ironclad Evidence

At this time, Judge Shi Meiyu told him another powerful piece of evidence, that is, the International Committee, which was formed by the United Kingdom and France at that time, had detailed records of the crimes committed by the Japanese army at that time. There were as many as 425 cases of murder and rape alone, and there were also cruel acts of killing as a competition. It is said that the one who killed the most people at that time was a Japanese soldier, who had killed 705 people. However, later, another Japanese soldier broke the record and killed 706 people! These facts were also published in the "Asahi Shimbun." In addition, he took out a photo album for Tani to see, which was all taken by the Japanese army themselves. The photos were full of true records of the Japanese army's savage and inhuman killing for pleasure!

After Tani Hisao looked at those photos, he was first speechless. He stroked his little beard and said, "I also saw similar photos at the prosecutor's office. At that time, I was very surprised and ashamed to see such cruel situations. However, I only stayed in Zhonghua Gate for a very short period of time. The troops were in a hurry, so it was difficult to do those things. The facts in the photos cannot explain that they happened in Zhonghua Gate."

Two Hours of Quibbling: The Butcher Denies the Crime of Murder

The court continued at 2 p.m. Tani gave a lengthy defense, lasting two hours, and all of its content consisted of denials and non-acknowledgments. Tani first stated that the defendant was not the highest commander of Zhonghua Gate. Those who participated in the attack on Zhonghua Gate also included parts of the 114th Division and the 18th Division. He had always been strict in governing the army, and the atrocities occurred mostly outside the area where the defendant's troops were stationed or after the defendant led the troops away from Nanjing. Many of the crimes lack concrete facts to prove the time and place. It is unreasonable and unjust to make the defendant the main culprit of the atrocities. Then, he quibbled on the three aspects of the crime investigation table, witnesses, and indictment, emphasizing that his subordinates had not committed acts of rape, murder, or destruction of property. Finally, he said that according to the American witnesses, movies, photos, and other witnesses and physical evidence, most of the atrocities occurred in the safety zone and Xiaguan area. It is unfair and wrong to say that these were committed by the defendant's troops. Moreover, the defendant: (1) As a soldier, coming to China to fight was on orders and cannot be held responsible for war crimes or crimes of aggression. (2) He had never heard of the massacre. Moreover, the military discipline was very strict. Since it was neither witnessed nor heard from residents, it can prove that no massacre occurred. (3) The evidence presented above is all false evidence. This is because the Chinese people are seeking revenge. Moreover, the victims were all in the garrison of other armies. Even if there were any, he cannot be held responsible. (4) When attacking Zhonghua Gate, the battle situation was fierce. Local residents could not have a mixed residence of soldiers and civilians. It could not have been rape and murder. The massacre mentioned by the witnesses was the most from the 12th to the 14th, which does not match the facts.

Defense lawyer Mei Zufang also presented two reasons to defend him. This trial was just a routine "performance" and just passed the time!

At this point, prosecutor Chen Guangyu stood up and spoke, sternly refuting him. Chen said: How can a murderer like this, a butcher of mankind, be allowed to live? He should be sentenced to death by the court. Chen’s words were loud and powerful, and everyone responded with warm applause.

Spring and Autumn: The Style of Huang Gongwang and the Landscapes of the Four Wangs.
Shi Chongpeng

Dong Siweng in his essays on literati painting, strongly divided landscape painting into Northern and Southern schools, promoting Wang Wei as the founder of the Southern school. He said: "Literati painting began with Wang Youcheng. Later, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Li Cheng, and Fan Kuan were the direct descendants. Li Longmian, Wang Jinqing, Mi Nan Gong, and his son were all derived from Dong and Ju, until the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, Huang Zijiu, Wang Shuming, Ni Yuanzhen, and Wu Zhonggui, all followed the authentic tradition. Wu Wen and Shen of our Wu then received the mantle from afar. Ma Xia, Li Tang, and Liu Songnian are of the Li General school." This emotional view of promoting the South and suppressing the North is very unreliable. Looking at the landscapes of Wang Wei and the masters above him, they are all meticulous and realistic. Although they are better than Li Sixun's outlining and depiction, the detached and unrestrained atmosphere is, after all, rare and exceptional. Especially Wang Wei's landscapes, I have seen a piece of "Snowy Sky Picture" in the Palace Museum collection. The texture strokes are like iron wires, and the colors are as heavy as the green and blue of General Li, just as Mi Youren said: "Wang Wei's paintings are seen very often, all like carvings, not worth learning." And Zhang Yanyuan said: "Wang Wei was good at painting landscapes, incorporating both ancient and modern styles." However, we have never seen his "modern style" ink landscapes, and there is no way to guess. Su Dongpo praised Wang Wei's landscapes as having a "detached and ethereal posture," which may be an imaginary feeling.

Secondly, Dong Beiyuan of the Northern Song Dynasty liked to write about the landscapes of Jiangnan. The peaks of the mountains are often surrounded by clouds. Historians call him "Ink is like Wang Wei, color is like Li Sixun." When we look at his famous works such as "Dragon's Stay in the Suburbs" and "Cave Heaven Mountain Hall," they all tend to be heavy and have not escaped the meaning of outlining. As for the landscapes of Li Cheng and Fan Kuan, ink paintings are rarely found. Works such as "Stream Mountain Journey" and "Yao Peak Qishu Tu" are majestic and steep but lack detachment and tranquility. Dong Siweng insisted on categorizing them into the Southern school of ink rendering, which is somewhat biased.

In my personal opinion, only Mi Nan Gong and his son are pure ink landscape painters. Gao Fangshan is the direct descendant of the Mi family. However, Mi Gao emphasized the rendering of "dots" and ignored the elegance of "lines." It was not until Huang Zijiu rose up and integrated the brushwork, texture strokes, and rubbing of Dong, Ju, Mi, and Gao that he opened a broad road of "dots, lines, and surfaces" in landscape painting, successfully becoming a groundbreaking painter who inherited the past and opened up the future. Ni, Wang, and Wu, who were contemporaries of Zijiu but younger in age, were the first to be influenced by him. Because landscapes before Zijiu either had surfaces without lines, or had dots without lines, or had lines without dots. After Zijiu, there were perfect landscape painting methods with "dots, lines, and surfaces" complete. Yun Nantian once said that Zijiu's paintings are: "Majestic and elegant, with vast changes, shedding the traces of complexity and simplicity, going beyond the confines of conventional paths, using the movement of the spirit, and revealing the secrets of nature." The Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains scroll in the Palace Museum that we saw, although many connoisseurs pointed out that it was a forgery, is consistent with Nantian's criticism. We have also seen the authentic fragment of Huang Gongwang's Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains, collected by Qian An, with fluent and easy brushwork, varied ink, neither simple nor complex, sweeping away the rough and fierce faces of the Northern Song Dynasty people, and revealing an atmosphere of innocence, wonder, detachment, and tranquility among the hills and treetops. This is not to say that the landscapes of Dong, Ju, Li, and Fan before Zijiu were not as good as Zijiu, but to explain that the style of landscape painting underwent a tremendous change with Zijiu.

After Zijiu, painters such as Ni Yunlin, Wang Shuming, Wu Zhonggui, Wen Zhengming, Shen Shitian, Dong Qichang, and even the Qing Dynasty masters were all greatly influenced by Huang Gongwang's style, dominating landscape painting for five hundred years. Especially the Four Wangs - Yanke, Lianzhou, Shiggu, and Lutai.

The landscapes of the Four Wangs all drew from Jing, Guan, Dong, and Ju, but their brushwork, ink, composition, and layout always jumped over Huang Gongwang's patterns and could not escape his style. Huang Gongwang's landscapes take the "lines" of Dong and Ju - hemp texture strokes, the "dots" of Mi Gao - Mi dots, and the surfaces of Jing and Guan - Jing Hao's combination of Daozi's brush and Xiang Rong's ink, which is the rendering of the "surface," put together and integrated. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, the landscape style of scholars who regarded Huang Gongwang as a model was as prosperous as ten thousand streams converging on a sect and hundreds of rivers returning to the sea. Dong Qichang was in the transition period between the Ming and Qing dynasties. Wang Shimin and Wang Jian of the Four Wangs had interactions with Siweng. Siweng started with Huang Gongwang and ascended to become a master of Mi Gao's landscapes, directly and indirectly strengthening the influence of Huang Gongwang's style, making the Four Wangs faithfully and silently uphold the Huang Gongwang tradition, creating an unbreakable and uniform situation. Therefore, the landscapes of the Four Wangs often aroused criticism from contemporaries, even criticizing the landscapes of the Four Wangs as equivalent to the Eight-legged essay of the imperial examination era.

Since the landscapes of the Four Wangs are all loyal to Huang Gongwang, narrowness and fragility are naturally inevitable phenomena. However, the Four Wangs also have unique and successful works. At the same time, the Four Wangs are not far from us, and many genuine copies have been handed down. In addition to the Four Wangs collected in the Palace Museum, there are also many private collections. Recently, I saw four ink landscape paintings of the same size and all imitating Huang Gongwang at Meijing House. Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Hui, and Wang Yuanqi, all four paintings were like coming from the same hand. Among them, Wang Yuanqi's brushwork was the most vigorous, Wang Jian's ink was the most heavy, and Wang Hui's painting was more unique in terms of hills and brushwork compared to other works by Wang Hui. Yanke inscribed "Imitating Huang Gongwang's brushwork in the long summer of Wuzi." Wang Jian inscribed: "Many modern scholars learn from Huang Gongwang, but only Dong Siweng has the wonderful ability to surpass his master. I am afraid that this painting will be like Dong Jia imitating Shi Er. Throw the pen in dismay! Appreciated in May of Guiyi." Wang Hui inscribed: "I once saw Dong Huating's copy of Huang Gongwang's Autumn Mountain Mist and Rain Picture. The elegance overflows from the wrist. This is an attempt to imitate it, but I am afraid that I have not obtained its essence. Wang Hui, the Geng Yan Sanren, in the winter of Xinmao." Wang Yuanqi inscribed: "This painting is based on the Great Ridge of Fuchun, and the dense forest of steep valleys is used as Zifang's work. The brushwork is from light to dark. It is almost close to it. I have recently made two paintings, one for Mei Daoren and one for this painting. I intend to seek elegance but cannot be independent. I know that elegance lies between heaven and man. Scholars may not seek its samadhi in the corresponding place of the heart. Written at will. Wang Yuanqi, the Nongtai, wrote in the Shuangteng Study in the capital on the first day of October."

After looking at these four landscape paintings of the Four Wangs and referring to their inscriptions, I am more convinced that Huang Gongwang's style, in the painting circles of the Ming and Qing dynasties, almost had the feeling that "There is no beauty in the world that is different from Huang Gongwang!"

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Caohéjing Refugee and Orphaned Children's Shelter in this city specializes in taking in homeless children from the streets, providing them with proper education, so that they can become good citizens and serve society. Due to limited funding, many of the shelter's operations cannot proceed. In order to initiate fundraising, Mayor Wu specially invited celebrities from all walks of life in the city to visit at 3:00 PM yesterday. Gu Qianlin, Rong Hongyuan, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Wei, Fang Zhichao, Zhang Bide, and others attended, and Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang also participated, and addressed all the orphaned children. Dr. Mei said: "The people of Shanghai have not done their best for you and should feel ashamed." Zhou Xinfang encouraged them with the words "sense of shame." Madam Chiang was originally planning to visit in person yesterday as well, but it was cancelled due to a last-minute matter.

When Mayor Wu and his party entered the shelter, all the children were standing in the square to welcome them. Mayor Wu, Gu Qianlin, and Wu Kaixian then gave speeches in succession. Gu Qianlin, Rong Hongyuan, Luo Youxiang, Hartung George, Wang Jinjie, Wang Tongyuan, and others made donations on the spot, with the total amount of donations reaching 170 million [currency unit omitted]. It is said that Mayor Wu's goal for this fundraising effort for the shelter is 1 billion [currency unit omitted], so that the shelter can add a small printing press, school, textile factory, automobile training class, telephone switchboard class, music class, etc., in order to cultivate their ability to be self-reliant.
