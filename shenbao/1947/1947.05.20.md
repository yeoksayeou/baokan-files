### The People's Political Council Assembly Opens Today; Chairman Chiang Will Personally Deliver a Speech; Zhang Qun Will Attend the Afternoon Report

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] The Fourth National Political Council, Third Plenary Session, will open in Nanjing on the 20th. The opening ceremony will be held at 10:00 am, with Zhang Boling as Chairman, and Yu Bin representing all council members to deliver a response. The ceremony will be simple and solemn, singing the national anthem, paying three bows to the national flag and the portrait of the founding father of the nation.

This assembly is the second assembly after the victory, the first assembly after the return to the capital, and the first assembly held in Nanjing. The Second Assembly of the Fourth Session was held in Chongqing on March 20, 1946, one year and two months ago. In the meantime, due to the convocation of the National Assembly and the reorganization of the National Government, it has been repeatedly delayed until now. Some say that this assembly is the last assembly, but according to the bi-annual meeting regulations, there may be a final assembly before the convening of the constitutional National Assembly.

The Assembly Schedule is Scheduled for Two Weeks

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] The assembly schedule of the Political Council is scheduled for fourteen days (including the week).

As of the eve of the opening of the assembly, no proposals have been submitted by the council members. The deadline for proposals is noon on the 23rd. It is reported that there are many proposals this time, because the council members believe that this assembly is the last assembly, and they all want to express something, but the focus of the proposals is to hope for stability in national affairs, that is, to call for peace and economic stability.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Fifty-six council members registered on the 19th, for a total of 246 people. Qian Yongming, Hu Lin, Wu Yuchu, and Wang Xiaolai from Shanghai all registered on the 19th. In addition, there are Huang Yanpei, Zheng Kuiyi, Zhou Qianchong, Jiang Hengyuan, Duanmu Kai, Fu Sinian, Wu Yifang, Hu Jianzhong, Ma Chengfeng, and Lu Guangsheng, etc.

[Our Newspaper Guilin, 19th] Gui Province Council Member Lei Peihong and others flew to Beijing today to attend the Political Council meeting.

[Our Newspaper] Yang Yuzi, Wan Renqian, Feng Jinbai and other council members of the Democratic Socialist Party took a car to Beijing last night to prepare to participate in the conference of the government. Zhang Junmai has registered with the assembly in his own handwriting, but he stayed in Shanghai due to business and could not go within a day or two. Reliable sources say that the Democratic Socialist Party has decided to propose a proposal in this Political Council meeting to request the government to take the initiative to resume peace talks. The reason is that the civil war has lasted for a long time and the people are struggling to survive. At this time, they hope that the government will be generous and not care about the reaction of the Chinese Communist Party, and first propose to resume peace talks. In this way, the restoration of peace may have a glimmer of hope.

### Seeking Peace Politically, Seeking Stability Economically: Qian Yongming and Others Talk About Current Urgent Matters

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Council Member Qian Yongming recently told reporters about the peace issue, believing that after eight years of war, China is like a long-term sick person, and the restoration of peace is a matter of urgency. From the common people to the government, everyone has the same feeling and the same reason, and deeply hopes to see peace again as soon as possible. He hopes that the Communist Party can be open and honest and engage in negotiations. When the reporter asked what would happen if the Communist Party insisted on the previous two conditions, Qian said that if the Communist Party does not recognize the constitution, the situation will be difficult. On the other hand, the government's credibility must also be taken into account. Qian's view on the current economic problem is that the current economic crisis is caused by psychological panic. Therefore, the most important thing at present is how to make everything "stable." Qian believes that if we want to bring legal currency back into circulation, issuing public bonds is indeed a way, but the main thing is still how to increase production, and the prerequisite for increasing production is "stability." Therefore, seeking peace politically and seeking stability economically are the most urgent tasks.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Council Member Wang Xiaolai met with our reporter on the 19th and talked about the current peace and economic issues. He deeply hoped that the government and the public could act in good conscience and work hard for the future of the country. Wang solemnly pointed out that they had made peace appeals as early as last year, but unfortunately they did not attract widespread attention at that time. Today, peace is still a matter of urgency, and efforts should be made to promote its early realization. The most important condition for realizing peace is that "everyone can bring out their conscience." Regarding the current economic problem, Wang believes that the problem is that the disease is serious and the medicine is weak. From the government's point of view, the most important thing is to maintain its credibility. The story of losing faith in the people in the past should not be seen today. Foreign exchange must be controlled back and forth, and the list of foreign exchange applicants should be made public to avoid manipulation by a few people.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Huang Yanpei, a council member of the China Democratic League, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 19th and went to the Political Council to register. When the reporter asked him about his views on national affairs, Huang said: "I am here in Beijing this time to exchange opinions with all parties on the issue of peace, because peace is what everyone hopes for. As for the results, it depends on various factors. I intend to propose a plan to call for peace, but now I am looking at the opinions of all the council members and studying ways to seek peace, and it will depend on the government's attitude." In addition, Council Member Xu Deheng spent the whole day of the 19th in contact with various parties, studying ways to call for peace. When there is any achievement, he will submit a specific plan to the Political Council.

[Our Newspaper] Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, said when he met with reporters yesterday: "The China Democratic League has decided to propose a truce and resumption of peace talks at the Political Council, but the detailed methods are still to be studied and decided." Since 1940, the China Democratic League has advocated that the only way to resolve our domestic disputes is to adopt the path of "nationalization of the army and democratization of politics." When the Anti-Japanese War was won, it also advocated convening a party meeting to seek the unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and to coordinate and supervise by various parties. The above two proposals have remained consistent to this day.

### Unified Interpretation of the Constitution

Constitutional Government Research Committee Passed

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] The Research Committee of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association held its second meeting at 9:00 am on the 19th, chaired by Liu Zhendong, and passed: (1) Regarding the Wen Yang Constitution Unified Explanation Case; (2) The government should inform the association in writing at any time about the handling of various elections (such as the election peak survey), the establishment of election agencies at all levels, and the progress of implementation, so as to facilitate research and resolution of the case; (3) Please have the government appoint fair local people to fill the positions in the election offices in various places; (4) Local governments should not apportion the election expenses to the people.

### Central Party Headquarters Commemorates the Premier; Li Jingqi Reports on Land Administration

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 19th] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held a weekly memorial service for the Premier on the morning of the 19th, chaired by Sun Ke. Minister of Land Administration Li Jingqi reported on land administration work, making a brief explanation on the two aspects of land registration and land policy. He believes that China's land registration is very chaotic. The land that has been cleared throughout the country is only 27 percent, and the land reports are not perfect. In the future, it is planned to divide the country into several surveying areas according to longitude and latitude, and then send personnel to each area for clearance, and at the same time adopt aerial surveying methods in order to complete the land registration work as soon as possible. As for China's land policy, it should be owned, governed, and shared by the people to achieve the governance of Datong.

### President Zhang Counsels Students: Freedom and the Rule of Law Should Complement Each Other; Seeking Peace Should Not Be One-Sided Propaganda

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 19th] The National Government announced measures to maintain social order on the 18th. In order to ensure its faithful and effective implementation, President Zhang of the Executive Yuan issued the following statement:

The reorganization of the government is mainly aimed at ending the period of political tutelage and preparing for the implementation of constitutional government. In order to ensure the smooth completion of this task and to guarantee the effective implementation of constitutional government, not only should the legal preparations for the implementation of constitutional government be completed at this time, but also the spiritual preparations should be completed, and constitutional spirit should be cultivated as much as possible to create a social atmosphere that respects the law and discipline. On the government's side, all guarantees of the people's freedom and other legitimate rights and interests that can be implemented earlier will be implemented as early as possible and as thoroughly as possible. At the same time, it also requires the people of the whole country to improve their sense of law and their sense of responsibility to the country, so that freedom and the rule of law can complement each other and jointly complete the spiritual preparations for the implementation of constitutional government. Therefore, the success or failure of future constitutional government cannot rely solely on the unilateral efforts of the government. The people also bear the greatest responsibility.

### Obey the Law Before the Implementation of Constitutional Government; Even More So After the Implementation of Constitutional Government

The actions of students in various places recently have exceeded the scope permitted by national morality and national law. In particular, a small number of bad elements have wantonly slandered and insulted the government and officials. These kinds of outrageous behaviors cannot be tolerated not only in today's time when the government urgently needs stability, but also after the implementation of constitutional government. The measures to maintain social order announced by the government yesterday were taken to maintain social order and avoid emergencies. Article 23 of the Constitution has clear provisions on this. This will also be the case after the implementation of constitutional government, and it cannot be regarded as an expedient measure today. The government must faithfully implement this measure, and the people must also strictly abide by it.

The country has suffered significant losses in life, property, materials, and resources during the long-term war of resistance, and the losses in morality and culture are especially incalculable. These kinds of non-material losses should be compensated for through education. I participated in education work in my early years, and I still maintain many relationships with education undertakings in recent years. I have a deep understanding and sympathy for the psychology and demands of young people. Since taking over the Executive Yuan, I have been extremely concerned about the difficulties in education. At the beginning of my tenure, I gathered the presidents, deans, and professors of various colleges and universities in Nanjing for a tea party to ask about the difficulties they encountered and to listen to various opinions for reference in governance. All kinds of practical problems related to improving education and improving student life that can be solved will be solved as much as possible, and those that are difficult to solve immediately are being carefully studied.

### The Government Will Never Ignore Students' Legitimate Demands

If students have legitimate demands, they can submit them to the government through the school authorities in accordance with legal and reasonable procedures, and the government will never ignore them. Now, students in various schools are taking direct action, and even including school administrative issues such as professor salaries and education funding in the requirements they have put forward, and even obstructing traffic, coercing the government, damaging public property, and hindering official duties. These kinds of outrageous behaviors have no precedent in any advanced democratic country.

Furthermore, apart from individual issues, the slogans against the war that have been touted in this student movement are based on the government's consistent policy of resolving domestic disputes through political means. Since Chairman Chiang invited the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to discuss peace plans in August of last year, I have always participated. The government has been very tolerant and has tried its best to seek peace, but the Chinese Communist Party has never had the sincerity to resolve the issue, and finally openly closed the door to peace talks. However, even under this situation, the government has not abandoned its original intention. As long as the Chinese Communist Party is willing to make peace, the government is still willing to engage in political means to resolve the issue. This purpose is clearly expressed in the new government's policy guidelines, and the people of the country have witnessed it. Students should know that instead of exploring the crux of the peace issue now, they are making a fuss against the government and making one-sided and unreasonable demands.

### What is the "Eating-Up Movement"? Where is the Personality?

This is obviously being instigated and used. What is the "Eating-Up Movement" placing the personality of young people? What will be the impression in the minds of ordinary people?

In short, the government's original intention to cherish young people and attach importance to education will not change because of this student unrest, but the responsibility to faithfully implement orders to maintain order and stability cannot be shirked. It is hoped that the teachers and principals of various schools will do their best to persuade and influence them, and those who are fathers and brothers should take more responsibility for restraining and disciplining them, so that the studies and peaceful lives of the majority of students can be guaranteed under rational guidance and not be threatened by a few. As for how to overcome the existing difficulties in education, I am still willing to cooperate with the teachers and staff of various schools and the education administrative authorities at any time to discuss and study, in order to seek solutions through multi-faceted cooperation and efforts. Finally, I sincerely appeal to the young people of all schools to promote reason, restrain emotions, and concentrate their pure strength to stabilize their own schools and enrich their own knowledge and abilities, so as to build the country and seek a bright way out of difficulties.

### Xu Shiying Arrives in Shanghai Today

It is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th. Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun sent a special commissioner to welcome him. In addition, since the Executive Yuan announced Xu's appointment as Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, all parties have hoped that Xu will be highly respected and relied upon.

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 19th] Since the government promulgated temporary measures to maintain social order, the reporter made a special visit to Zhang Zhen, Acting Commander of the Capital Garrison Command. The following is a record of his conversation:

Question: Since the government promulgated temporary measures to maintain social order, in your observation, is it possible that student parades and petitions will continue to occur?

Answer: It is possible, but they should abide by the measures promulgated by the government, and no outrageous or lawless actions will be allowed.

Question: The temporary measures to maintain social order stipulate that petitions should not exceed ten people. If the number of petitioners exceeds the stipulated number, what will happen?

Answer: It will not be allowed by law.

Question: The measures have provisions for taking emergency measures. Can you tell us the principles of emergency measures?

Answer: This Command has detailed plans for the preparations for emergency measures. In short, this Command is responsible for maintaining social security, and it is its unshirkable responsibility to enforce the laws and regulations, and it has the greatest determination to not allow any further actions that disrupt order. I hope that the public will provide more guidance so that students and people's groups can follow the President's earnest advice and give full play to the spirit of automatically obeying the law and respecting discipline.

Question: If there is a situation where these measures are not followed, will you consider declaring martial law?

Answer: Yes, we have received orders and can declare it at any time.

### Council Members Exchange Opinions; Hold a Pre-Meeting Tea Party; Secretary Shao Says the Assembly Strives for Economy

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] The Political Council held a pre-meeting tea party at 3:00 pm on the 19th, chaired by Jiang Yong. More than 200 council members attended. First, Secretary Shao Lizi reported: (1) This assembly was originally scheduled to be held on November 12 of last year, but later the government decided to convene the National Assembly on that day, and the two meetings could not be held at the same time. After the National Assembly, it was repeatedly delayed due to the reorganization of the government until now; (2) Due to the replacement of more than 10 people and the addition of 72 people, the number of council members in this assembly is more than in previous assemblies; (3) The preparations made by the secretariat are in accordance with established practice and comply with the principle of economy. Although it is now after the war, prices have risen even more than during the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, we still prepare economically. If there are any omissions in the reception and accommodation, please notify the secretariat. Then, Deputy Secretary Lei Zhen reported on the agenda of the assembly and the procedures for the opening ceremony. After that, the council members successively expressed their opinions:

Check How Past Proposals Have Been Handled

(1) Regarding the council members' proposals, Wang Yaming proposed that there should not be too many proposals, but it should be checked how the government has handled past proposals. Wu Wangji said that the resident committee or the secretariat should be responsible for checking, and he believes that checking is more important than proposing. Xu Deheng believes that this proposal should focus on the issue of peace and study how to stop the war. Xu believes that as long as the war is stopped, all economic and political issues can be resolved. (2) Regarding the government's policy report, Wu Zhaoxu proposed that the National Resources Commission should have a report, because the factories are all under the National Resources Commission, and the Ministry of Water Resources should also be included in the report. Someone also proposed that the government's report should adopt a symposium approach, because the council members are not executive members. Wu Wangji said that the symposium should be more important than the report.

The Government's Replies to Inquiries Should Be Submitted to the Review First

(3) Regarding the government's replies to inquiries, Wang Yaming believes that the government's replies to inquiries in the past were too negligent and very casual. Huang Yuren believes that the government's replies should have the demeanor of a statesman and be responsible. Someone else proposed that the government's replies should be submitted to the review committee for review. (4) Regarding the issue of the presidium, it was proposed that many of the members of the presidium have become officials and should be re-elected. Zhang Bangzhen was the first to respond.

Many Officials in the Presidium; Someone Proposed a Re-Election

Then, one after another, they spoke up, all believing that officials should withdraw from the presidium and that the presidium should be re-elected. Secretary Shao Lizi said that according to the organization regulations, the presidium is not limited to council members, so there is no need to re-elect, but council members who serve as officials should be immediately disqualified. However, the secretariat and the council have no right to deal with the re-election of the presidium. (5) Regarding expanding the powers of the council, Wang Puhan believes that before the implementation of constitutional government, the only agency that can express public opinion is the council. The so-called Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, but it is responsible to the elected Legislative Yuan. At present, the Legislative Yuan is still composed of officials, so it is the responsibility of officials to officials, and there is no democracy to speak of. If it is said that it is democracy, the Executive Yuan must be responsible to the council, the only highest agency of public opinion. If this council does not expand its powers, it is meaningless to hold meetings. Zhu Huiqing followed up in response, believing that it is necessary to expand its powers. (6) Da Pusheng proposed that the issues that should be discussed in this meeting include: (A) resolving the Chinese Communist Party issue as soon as possible; (B) implementing the Sino-Soviet Treaty as soon as possible and taking over Lushun and Dalian as soon as possible; (C) the United States and the Soviet Union should develop their relations in parallel; (D) prices are like wild horses that have broken free, and we should immediately find ways to solve them for the welfare of the people. Xu Deheng also proposed that agriculture and forestry are bankrupt, factories are closed, prices are soaring, and people have no way to make a living, etc.

Zhang Qun's Political Report Emphasizes the Issue of the Chinese Communist Party

(7) Xu Deheng said that the handling of the student unrest and the actions of the students may repeatedly lead to bloody tragedies, and attention should be paid to them. Finally, Shao Lizi said that in the political report on the 20th, President Zhang will focus on the issue of the Chinese Communist Party. It was not dismissed until 7:00 pm.

### The Administrative Yuan Meeting Decided to Set Up Two Cities, Tangshan and Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province; Ministries and Committees Added Recurring Expenses; the Research Subsidy for Teachers in National Universities Was Adjusted

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 19th] Because the Fourth Assembly of the Fourth Session of the Political Council opened on the 20th, the fourth meeting of the Executive Yuan was advanced to 3:00 pm on the 19th, chaired by Zhang Qun.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 19th] Changchun had spring rain last night, and sporadic artillery fire could be heard, but the fighting was not intense.

The weather cleared after the rain on the morning of the 19th, and people's hearts were as calm as usual.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 19th] The situation in Changchun City is stable, but the prices of grain, rice, and vegetables have soared. Chives have jumped from 400 National Currency per catty to 1,750 yuan. The sound of gunfire can be clearly heard in the city.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 19th] Communist troops are densely concentrated 20 li outside of Changchun, and a major battle may break out, the severity of which is greater than the previous five.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 19th] Communist troops are attacking Gongzhuling. Northbound trains on the China Changchun Railway are only going as far as Siping, and wire telegraph communication between Changchun and Shenyang has been interrupted.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 19th] Gongzhuling is tense. Northbound trains from Shenyang on the China Changchun Railway did not depart on the afternoon of the 19th. It is reported that Zheng Dongguo will fly to Changchun to oversee the situation. Furthermore, Wulajie and Shuangshan have successively fallen.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 19th] Communist prisoners captured in Changchun claim that the Communist army's all-out offensive in the Northeast this time is a desperate plan to first seize Huaide, Gongzhuling, and Dehui, and finally Changchun and Jilin.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 19th] After the fall of Huaide, Chen Mingren personally went to the front line to command the National Army's counterattack. Xiang, the deputy army commander, is commanding the army in the Gongzhuling area. Fanjiatun Station, south of Changchun, was slightly damaged but quickly recovered.

[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 19th] The main force of the Communist troops advancing south along the Pingqi Railway from Siping to Qiqihar is now moving from the outskirts of Huaide towards the Changchun-Shenyang section of the China Changchun Railway. Their goal seems to be to disrupt transportation between Changchun and Shenyang, directly threatening Changchun. Seven divisions of Communist troops, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, totaling over 30,000 men, have been detected in the area west of the railway between Changchun and Gongzhuling, advancing in three columns towards Taojiatun, Fanjiatun, and Gongzhuling.

[Central News Agency Jilin Dispatch, 19th] The National Army, firmly holding Lao Ye Ridge behind the Communist lines, launched an attack last night, heavily damaging the Communist troops in the area of Wojikou, Sunjiatun, and Hutouzigou, northeast of Tiangang, before returning to their original defense.

[Another Dispatch] There has been continuous fighting north of Jilin from the evening of the 17th, especially last night. The fighting took place in the area of Luanchaishi, Houshijinggou, and Mengjiagou, on the opposite bank 15 to 20 li from the city. Although the Communist troops' offensive was fierce, the National Army's firepower was even fiercer.

### The Chairman's Speech Has Had a Good Effect; Five Universities May Stop Marches and Petitions; Zhongda Students Petition the President, Requesting an Immediate Resumption of Classes

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] President Chiang's speech to rectify the academic atmosphere and maintain law and order has had a positive impact on the surging student movement in Nanjing. The strike, march, and petition movements of the five universities in the capital showed signs of turning around on the 19th, and may return to normal. Wu Youxun, President of Zhongda University, and more than 20 professors convened a meeting with all students of the university on the evening of the 19th, attended by over 3,000 people. Wu and others delivered impassioned speeches on the spot, which moved the students. Wu also issued a lengthy letter to the students, urging them to resume classes. Therefore, Zhongda is scheduled to resume classes on the 20th, and the joint march and petition movement of the five universities, scheduled for the 20th, may only be attended by a few students. If the professors' persuasion is effective, the march and petition may be stopped altogether.

[Another Dispatch] Representatives of the student unions of Zhongda, Jinda, and other universities, as well as representatives of the eight universities in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area who came to Nanjing to petition, held a joint meeting at 9:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th. They resolved to hold a march on the morning of the 20th and petition the Senate and the Executive Yuan. It was also decided not to mention the issue of a ceasefire in the joint declaration.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Over 1,000 students of Zhongda University submitted a letter to President Wu, requesting an immediate resumption of classes and opposing the entanglement of the university in political whirlpools. The original text is as follows:

To President Wu: Since the strike began a week ago, public sentiment has been boiling, and society has been critical. It is generally believed that Zhongda is leading the marches, and its stance has always been based on the nation and the people. The good order has been praised by people in society. However, this strike is very different. Not only has Zhongda's reputation plummeted, but the pure meaning of the movement has also been completely lost. Since last Friday, all resolutions of the various department and college representative meetings have tended to expand this movement. Representatives have gone out to contact various places, and the demand for public funds has changed to opposition to the civil war. The strong political overtones are unprecedented. This not only deeply entangles Zhongda in a political whirlpool but also makes it impossible for Zhongda to seek progress in stability. We believe that students should strive to explore the truth and increase their knowledge to contribute to humankind and the nation. Furthermore, a university that cultivates talents should not be turned into a venue for political parties to compete or a source of disturbing social tranquility. The last parade not only smashed the windows of the Ministry of Education but also insulted foreign reporters. There has been a lot of criticism of roadside propaganda. Moreover, the department and college representative meetings approved that all expenses during the movement should be paid from the students' welfare fund. Just look at the number of days of hospitality for representatives from other schools, the paper and printing of announcements, the rental of loudspeakers, the travel expenses of liaison representatives, and all expenses during the parade. It is not difficult to imagine the number of expenses. The 125 parade cost millions, and the 222 parade cost 3 million. If prices are multiplied by ten, this time it will cost 20,000 to 30,000. How much can the increased public funds benefit? Using the spear of the child to attack the shield of the child, the sinister intentions of these people are no longer concerned with the future of the school or the welfare of the students. Since they do not protect the school, why should the school spare them? Since the restoration of the school, it has undergone several setbacks before achieving today's progress. Furthermore, it has been heard that our teacher has vigorously fought for funding issues in the Ministry of Education and the Executive Yuan, and there have been some results, but the strike has stopped it. We are saddened by the school's reputation and earnestly request our teacher to display a spirit of great benevolence and courage and immediately resume classes to bring the school into a state of stability. Then the students will be fortunate, and the future of the school will be fortunate.

[Another Dispatch] Wang Shuyu, a representative of the fourth grade of the Department of Political Science at Zhongda, He Anmin, a representative of the Department of Sociology, and Huang Zhong, a representative of the fourth grade of the Department of Economics, issued a letter to all students of the university on the 19th, expressing their grief and exposing the change in the nature of this movement, analyzing the causes of this student unrest, and the truth about someone manipulating the representatives of the various departments. Finally, they also expressed several wishes to the government. The book is titled "For Ourselves, for Zhongda, for the Nation, We Weep." Students from all over the school have responded enthusiastically. As of 9:00 PM, more than 2,000 people have signed their names.

[Another Dispatch] More than 30 principals of public and private secondary schools in Nanjing, including Wang Huishan, issued a "Letter to the Public" and a "Letter to the Parents of Students" regarding the recent student unrest in various places, requesting joint efforts to guide young people onto the right track and guide society towards stability.

### The Strike Wave Spreads in Universities in Beiping and Tianjin

[Central News Agency Tianjin Dispatch, 19th] The student unions of Nankai University and Beiyang University in Tianjin held temporary meetings on the evening of the 17th. Nankai decided to strike for three days starting on the 18th, and Beiyang decided to strike for three days starting on the 19th, in response to the "anti-civil war and anti-hunger" movement in Beiping, Tsinghua, and Peking University. The reporter visited Nankai and Beiyang universities. No wall posters or slogans were found in Beiyang, while there were several wall posters with personal signatures "anti-hunger" on the Nankai wall poster area. Chen, Dean of Studies at Nanda, said that if students strike for political reasons, it is beyond the scope of education. If they strike to adjust their treatment, the topic is not too big. The result of the Nanda Student Union meeting was to organize an "Anti-Civil War and Anti-Hunger Action Committee" to coordinate actions with schools in Pingjin and across the country, and to demand: (1) Restore education funding to 15% of the national budget. (2) Reasonably increase the salaries of public education personnel. (3) Adjust public funding and increase the number of public funding places. (4) Increase the non-staple food allowance to 110,000 yuan and adjust it monthly according to the price index. (5) The first-term class should have public funding. (6) Before the end of the civil war in China, please ask the United States to stop its 500 million loan to China. (7) Reduce agricultural taxes. (8) Postpone military service. (9) Exempt the conscription of military grain, and decided to accept the suggestions of the 11 department-level associations, 21 bulletin boards, and social groups of Tsinghua and Peking University, and set June 2 as "Anti-Civil War Day", linking the nationwide strike, stop teaching, strike, stop market, and organize the Pingjin Student Union. The meeting did not end until midnight. The situation in Beiyang was roughly the same.

[Another Dispatch] After Beiyang and Nankai in Tianjin decided to strike, other universities and secondary schools have begun to suffer. On the 18th, they were all preparing to hold meetings and brewing a response. Students from Beiyang University decided to go out of the school this week to give street speeches. The Student Union of the school had a telegram on the 18th, addressed to the Senate. The content was purely to oppose the civil war, and there was no demand for adjusting treatment. There were three specific conditions: (1) Invite the CCP to attend the Senate. (2) Postpone the meeting until the CCP attends. (3) Abandon partisan opinions and jointly seek peace.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 19th] The student unrest in Tianjin is spreading even further. On the 19th, Hebei Institute of Technology, National Physical Education College, and Aquatic Products College followed suit and went on strike. Although the authorities of the schools tried their best to prevent the planned parade on the 20th, it is still difficult to hope that it will be stopped. The municipal government convened a meeting of responsible persons from various universities and colleges on the 19th to discuss appropriate measures. The municipal authorities stated that they were determined to sincerely love and guide the youth so as not to be used by traitors.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Universities and colleges above the junior college level in Beiping have responded to the anti-civil war movement. The schools on strike include Yenching, Chaoyang, Sino-French, and the National First Midwifery Teachers College. However, the main reason for the teachers college strike is the "Fuda Movement."

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 19th] A group of students at the National College of Social Education decided to go on strike from the 19th to respond to the Zhongda University student movement, and sent representatives to Nanjing to petition and other actions. Now, another group of students at the college believes that the above actions are too radical, so they have formed a separate faction, organized a Social Education Students' Request for Reasonable Increase in Tuition Fees Conference, using telegram declarations as the main advocacy tool, and opposed the strike action. The school authorities also believe that the strike wastes academic studies, and are currently persuading students to resume classes.

### Conflict Incident at Xidan Archway in Beiping; Chief of Staff of the Youth Army Talks About the Facts of What Happened

[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch, 18th] A group of students gave street speeches in Xidan in the afternoon of the 18th and had a conflict with soldiers of the 208th Division of the Youth Army from an argument to a mutual fight. After this unfortunate incident occurred, the reporter visited officers of the 208th Division to ask for their opinions on this incident. According to Chief of Staff Sun of the division, "Our division is an organization that trains unemployed and out-of-school youth. The soldiers of our division are all young students who have received secondary education or above, and their nature is different from that of ordinary army soldiers. Today happened to be Sunday, and the soldiers were on leave and entered the city. They encountered the lecturing students in Xidan. The students stopped the car our division soldiers were riding in, wrote slogans, and gave many satirical speeches. The soldiers saw the slogans written by the students in the city and on our division's cars, which contained a lot of inflammatory and stimulating meanings. They heard the students' speeches, which contained words that insulted the head of state and disrupted social order. The soldiers themselves are also young students, and their feelings of loving the country and respecting the head of state are particularly strong. Their opinions differed from those of the lecturing students, which led to arguments and then mutual fighting. Both the students and the soldiers of our division were injured. Two soldiers of our division encountered a large number of students in Houjie, Jingshan, and were surrounded and beaten, suffering serious injuries. They are now being sent to the hospital for treatment. We deeply regret this unfortunate incident. In addition to ordering an investigation to identify the soldiers who caused the incident and punish them, we also hope that the relevant school authorities will sincerely guide the students, taking the country as the standard, and considering social order and students' studies as important, and not make too many stimulating remarks and slogans to avoid expanding the situation and affecting social order." Chief of Staff Sun finally analyzed to the reporter the reasons for the argument conflict between the Youth Army soldiers and the students, saying: "The soldiers of our division are students who have received considerable training, and their understanding of the current situation is also more profound. Previously, when the soldiers of our division were conducting exercises in Weishi Shanzhuang, they were attacked by the Communist army, resulting in many deaths and injuries. They also saw many slogans in that area, which were roughly the same as those seen on the streets today. In addition, soldiers of our city were insulted by students in the Summer Palace, who said that our division soldiers were Kuomintang cattle. Today, in Xidan, some students insulted the soldiers with the same words, such as 'The Youth Army is a Kuomintang running dog!' 'You should put down your guns!' and so on. The soldiers were stimulated and argued with the students, which led to arguments and ultimately to mutual fighting. As for the nature of this unfortunate incident, it should be regarded as an accidental event caused by differences of opinion between students and cannot be regarded as a conflict between students and the army. We hope that a reasonable solution can be obtained as soon as possible.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] The Support Association formed by students from Peking University and other schools hosted reporters at 2:00 PM today to explain the incident, saying that they had protested to the Xingyuan regarding the conflict between students and the military yesterday. It was also said that there were a total of eight people injured and hospitalized, and the three seriously injured were no longer in life-threatening danger. The classmates donated money to express their condolences, but they did not accept it and transferred it to the Support Association. The rumors of missing students yesterday have not yet been confirmed.

[Another Dispatch] The Support Association, composed of Peking University, Tsinghua, Yenching, Sino-French, Chaoyang, Beiyang, Pingbu Teachers College, Tieyuan, and Nankai, Beiyang, Tangshan, and Teachers College in Tianjin, has decided to hold a parade in the three places at the same time tomorrow.

### The Chairman Orders Famous General Porcelain to Be Presented to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Other Countries

### Siam Levies Huge Entry Taxes on Overseas Chinese Transiting Through the Country.

More than 70 people were unable to pay and were detained.

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 19th] Many of the overseas Chinese who returned to Burma after the war passed through Siam. The local government harassed overseas Chinese transiting through the country quite a bit. According to a telegram from Bangkok, the Siamese government recently suddenly increased the entry tax for overseas Chinese to 1,500 baht per person, worth more than 20 million National Currency. More than 70 of our overseas Chinese have been detained because they were unable to pay. It is hoped that our overseas Chinese will not transit through Siam again when returning to Burma.

### Hu Shih Talks About the Student Unrest; Hopes that Students Will Not Use Strikes as a Means

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Hu Shih, reversing his past silence, made some remarks today on President Chiang's address to students and the provisional measures decided by the State Council, as well as the student strike. He said: The announcement of President Chiang's address and provisional measures, at 8:00 AM on the 18th, was not aimed at the Peking University incident. Hu Shih pointed out that students were making trouble because they were emotional, and also explained that the government's address said that the students' actions were directly or indirectly instigated by the Communist Party. He said: Students are young people, and they do feel depressed in this difficult environment. He also said: Emergency measures are temporary measures to maintain order, aimed at petitions. At the meeting with Li Zongren of the Xingyuan and various universities and colleges yesterday, I reiterated what I have been saying for the past 20 years, that young people's interest in politics is a natural phenomenon and a common rule throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. The responsibility for advocating political reform often falls on young people. Speaking of student strikes, Hu Shih pointed out that it is not a solution. Studying politics, expressing opinions, and even going outside the school to engage in political activities, whether aboveground or underground, are all permissible. However, the current political problems are too complicated, and the Political Consultative Conference has not achieved results for more than ten months, let alone student strikes. I sympathize with young people's demands for improving the current situation, but I hope they will not sacrifice their studies or interfere in politics. The ability of workers' strikes to achieve results is limited to fighting for salary or working hours, and it is difficult to achieve results by interfering in politics. Reforming political and social systems, without using revolutionary means, must go through legal public opinion institutions to promote their realization. I sincerely hope that students will not use strikes as a means.

### The Philippine Government Announces That It Refuses Overseas Chinese Repatriation; Sino-Philippine Commercial and Navigation Treaty Negotiations May Begin This Week

[Reuters Manila Dispatch, 19th] The Philippine government recently announced that it opposes the return of 7,600 overseas Chinese to the Philippines. Most of them were sent back to China last year and in 1945 by UNRRA as displaced persons. They were originally overseas Chinese in the Philippines before the war, and UNRRA has already certified that there are no mistakes. The content of the Philippine government's reply to UNRRA has not yet been announced.

[Associated Press Manila Dispatch, 19th] Philippine Foreign Ministry officials stated today that negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Commercial and Navigation Treaty will begin this week, as the Philippine Senate passed the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty last week, clearing the obstacles. Philippine officials said: Overseas Chinese are more concerned about the terms of the new treaty than their compatriots in their home country. This treaty will stipulate trade methods, sea and air navigation rights, tariffs, and other donations, as well as the scope of overseas Chinese trade in the Philippines.

### The Ministry of Finance Revises the Income Tax Law and Promulgates Regulations on Tax-Exempt Amounts and Tax Brackets

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] In view of the soaring prices, the Ministry of Finance believes that the tax-exempt amounts and tax rates originally set in the Income Tax Law promulgated last year are no longer suitable for the current situation. In order to cope with the economic situation and adapt to price fluctuations, the Regulations on Adjusting Tax-Exempt Amounts and Tax Brackets of the Income Tax Law have been formulated, and adjustments have been made based on various price indices and the cost of living allowance index for civil servants. The tax-exempt amounts and tax brackets stipulated in the original tax law have been reduced to reduce the burden on taxpayers. It is learned that the tax-exempt amounts and tax rates for the first category of profit-seeking enterprise income tax, the second category of income from business or artistic performance, the fourth category of property rental income tax, the fifth category of temporary income tax, and the comprehensive income tax for the 36th year, as well as the tax-exempt amounts and tax rates for the second category of salary and remuneration income tax in various regions from June 1 to December 1, 35, have been separately adjusted and announced. In the future, the tax-exempt amounts will be generally increased and the tax rates will be reduced accordingly. Taking the first category of profit-seeking enterprise income tax as an example, the original tax-exempt amount was set at less than 5% of the total amount of capital for the annual income. Now it has been changed to less than 12%. As for the higher tax rate, the original regulation stipulated that those with an income equal to or greater than 50% of the total amount of capital would be taxed at 30%. The new standard has been changed to only those with an income equal to or greater than 115% of the total amount of capital will be taxed at 30%.

### The Ministry of National Defense Issues a Circular to All Troops to Effectively Maintain Freedom of the Press; Corrections Can Be Sought for Inaccurate Records

In order to effectively maintain and prevent future troubles, a circular has been issued to all troops across the country. If there are rumors or inaccuracies in newspapers or speeches that involve the military's reputation, the responsible authorities may weigh the severity of the situation and report it for correction, or resort to legal means and await a ruling, in order to comply with the government's policy intentions. 74 rifles were found in the search of the school.

Editorial

### The Political Consultative Council Opens Again! – How Can Councilors Fulfill Their Duties?

The Third Session of the Fourth National Political Consultative Council opened in Nanjing this morning at 9:00 AM. In today's turbulent and uneasy nation, we cannot help but have some expectations for the convening of this National Political Consultative Council.

The National Political Consultative Council was originally established during the War of Resistance. It was first established in Wuhan in July 1938. Although there was not enough time to use democratic elections due to the urgency of the war, the selection of its councilors included representatives from all provinces, cities, border regions, overseas Chinese, and all non-governmental organizations, including leaders from all parties and factions and national social elites. Therefore, the Political Consultative Council itself symbolized national unity. During the eight-year War of Resistance, it represented the people, supervised the government's implementation of national policies for the war, and made immeasurable contributions to winning the war. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the National Assembly has been held, and the new constitution will soon be implemented, the nation is not far from entering a truly constitutional era, and the significance of the Political Consultative Council's existence is bound to be greatly reduced. However, with the domestic situation developing to its current state, the door to peace talks has long been closed by the Chinese Communist Party, the political stalemate has not yet been resolved, and the constitutional National Assembly is still awaiting elections. During this transitional period, there is still an urgent need for an organization that symbolizes national unity to build a strong foundation for democratic unification and to break the current political deadlock. Therefore, the convening of this Political Consultative Council should be extraordinary. We should indeed pay attention to how the councilors fulfill their duties.

First, almost everyone in the country longs for peace and stability, and some councilors intend to propose motions expressing their hope for the resumption of peace talks. Our country has suffered greatly from this eight-year war. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the government wanted to let the people rest, and the people wanted to restore their vitality, so peace was what everyone yearned for. Today's issue is not whether or not to have peace, but rather to distinguish who wants to destroy peace and how to curb the spread of this evil force that destroys peace. After much painful reflection, we feel that the only way to save the current crisis is to use the power of the people to awaken the thorough awareness of the Chinese Communist Party so that they can put the country and the people first, immediately lay down their weapons, and leave a glimmer of hope for the people of the country. Although councilors Zhou Binglin, Qian Duansheng, and Xu Deheng have suggested that the government invite CCP councilors to attend, the CCP councilors have not accepted their good intentions, continue to be hostile to the government, and refuse to attend the Political Consultative Council. Our people cannot help but express disappointment. To be honest, the key to peace or war in the country today is entirely in the hands of the CCP: whether or not peace talks can be restored depends entirely on the CCP's will. If the Political Consultative Council wants to discuss the issue of restoring peace talks, we hope that all councilors from all over the country can face reality and first have the courage to go to the CCP's occupied areas and "seek skins from a tiger." Everyone must know that the National Government issued a clear ceasefire order long before the National Assembly convened last year. However, the CCP ignored it and even pointed out that the unilateral ceasefire was invalid. This clearly shows that it is the CCP, not the government, that wants to fight to the end. Councilors and others who shout "anti-civil war" will only make naive people happy if they only talk big in Beijing and Shanghai and do not go to the CCP areas to stop the fighting desperately. Experts will instead say that they are helping the CCP to slow down the military.

Second, what troubles the majority of the people in the country the most is the economic and financial crisis, which has not yet escaped its dangerous situation, and the people are suffering so much that they can barely survive. In the past month, the social unrest and the fluctuation of people's minds have been caused by some hidden instigating forces, but it is undeniable that the government has not been able to decisively deal with the situation and stabilize the financial economy. The Political Consultative Council is convened at this time, whether for the fate of the nation or for the suffering of the people, the councilors must be calm, realistic, and seek truth from facts, and jointly discuss a practical and concrete method so that the people in deep water and fire can breathe a sigh of relief. We do not want the councilors to simply chase shadows, criticize and scold, just to be happy; we sincerely hope that they will carefully plan in the cracks between the people's suffering and the government's difficulties, and save money for the government, and find a more feasible and practical way to save the economic crisis.

In short, although we dare not have endless extravagant hopes for the Political Consultative Council that opened today, we at least earnestly hope that the councilors will have great wisdom and courage. Standing on the people's side, think of a positive way to solve the economic crisis and supervise the government's implementation. This is great wisdom. With the determination of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" uniting the majority of the councilors, everyone runs to the CCP's occupied areas, and uses the voice of the people to urge them to lay down their weapons, thereby eliminating the root of the destruction of peace. This is great courage. If the councilors have this kind of great wisdom, courage, and spirit, then the convening of this Political Consultative Council can be expected to be fruitful. Otherwise, we cannot help but feel sorry for the country's large waste of public funds!

### Laws and Prestige

The six articles of the temporary measures for maintaining social order were passed by the Executive Yuan Council a few days ago, and then the National Government issued an order, and the relevant legal provisions such as the criminal law were also announced as necessary. This order and these laws are a measure that the government has had to take to prevent public safety from being harmed and order from being disrupted. All good and law-abiding citizens will definitely respect these laws. Only by strictly implementing these laws can the government fulfill its duty of eradicating violence and maintaining peace.

However, the value of laws lies in the effectiveness of their "implementation." Mencius said it well: "Mere laws cannot enforce themselves." Therefore, with laws, there must be upright and selfless law enforcement officials. The reason why "justice" should be valued is here, and the reason why "justice" should maintain its dignity is also here. Only by valuing justice, so that the judicial organs can truly have their independent and detached dignity, can the government have prestige. Only when the government has prestige can the country be expected to move from chaos to order.

Therefore, when we recall the many social unrest events in recent times, the reason for their development is that, although there may be some conspiracies involved, the government's failure to respond properly and its self-defeating prestige are also irreplaceable losses. Some things could have been done later, but they were decided hastily and insisted on doing them; but when they were opposed, protested, boycotted, and petitioned, they changed to accept everything. Even things that are clearly illegal and disciplinary should be punished according to the law, but they are often threatened by the masses and do not hesitate to make concessions outside the law in order to calm things down. The intention may not be reprehensible, but the fact is that although things are calmed down, people are not at peace. Because this kind of way to calm things down does not seek it in the law, but seeks it outside the law, how can it prevent future illegal actions? For example, yesterday, there was a clear order prohibiting students from striking and marching, but thousands of students still went on strike and marched, and the military and police failed to dissuade them and still allowed the march to happen. Is this kind of law enforcement not a satire of the law? On the first day the law was promulgated, the authorities gave such a counter-evidence to the effectiveness of the law in fact, and we cannot help but feel deeply saddened for the government's prestige!

### The Yoshida Cabinet Resigns En Masse Today; Agreement Reached on Katayama Becoming Prime Minister; Speakers of the House of Representatives to be from the Conservative Parties

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The Yoshida Cabinet will resign en masse tomorrow (20th). The procedure from the Cabinet's resignation to the formation of the new Cabinet is as follows: First, Yoshida will take the resignation to the palace to present to the Emperor. Then, the resignation will be reported to both houses of the Diet. After receiving the report, both houses will immediately elect a new Prime Minister. Then, the appointment ceremony for the new Prime Minister will be held in the palace. After the new Prime Minister is appointed, he will begin the work of forming a Cabinet. After the Cabinet is formed, he will go to the palace again to request the Emperor's approval, and then the appointment ceremony for the cabinet ministers will be held.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Today, Socialist Party Chairman Katayama individually visited Liberal Party President Yoshida and Democratic Party President Ashida, as well as National Cooperative Party Secretary-General Miki, to discuss the Prime Minister issue. Yoshida and Ashida both expressed their parties' support for Katayama's appointment as Prime Minister. At the same time, Yoshida stated that he would reserve his decision on whether to join the cabinet. Ashida also said: My attitude will be considered after Yoshida makes his decision. Therefore, another meeting of representatives from the four parties will be held again tomorrow to discuss and decide. It is rumored that Yoshida's reason for reserving his decision to join the cabinet is that the relationship between the left wing of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party has not been clearly severed. The Socialist Party originally planned to ask Yoshida to serve as Minister of Home Affairs or Minister of State in the Katayama Cabinet. National Cooperative Party Secretary-General Miki stated during Katayama's visit that he fully supported the Socialist Party's Prime Minister's Cabinet. After Katayama's individual visits to the parties today, in the first Diet meeting to be held tomorrow, the issue of Socialist Party Chairman Katayama's appointment as Prime Minister is absolutely certain.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The candidates for Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives are related to the Prime Minister issue because there is a provision that they are nominated by the Prime Minister. The heads of the parties have already reached an agreement on this. Under a Socialist Party Prime Minister, Yamazaki of the Liberal Party as Speaker and Inejiro Asanuma of the Socialist Party as Vice-Speaker are the most promising.

### Soviet Delegation to Arrive in Seoul Today or Tomorrow; U.S. Delegation Advisor Visits Hodge

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] The Soviet delegation attending the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission is still staying in Moscow and has not yet flown to Pyongyang due to bad weather. It is understood that they will have to fly from the Soviet Union to Pyongyang in one or two days and then transfer to Seoul.

[United Press, Seoul, 8th] The 75-member Soviet delegation did not arrive here as scheduled today. At the same time, the Korean people have canceled the planned anti-trusteeship demonstration. The reason for the Soviet delegation's delay is unknown. It is hoped that they will take the train from the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea on the 19th to meet with the U.S. representatives on the 20th to resume negotiations. Korean political leaders all said that the cancellation of the demonstration was in accordance with the police's advice. U.S. officials also said that participants in the demonstration would affect their qualifications to consult with the U.S. and Soviet representatives.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] James, an advisor to the U.S. delegation to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, arrived in Seoul on the 17th. James is a personal envoy of Secretary of State Marshall and served in the U.S. Embassy in China from 1943 to 1944. He has now established an office in Seoul.

### U.S.-Soviet Commission Meeting Postponed

### British Ready to Hand Over Middle East and Mediterranean Defense to the U.S.; Imperial Military Bases to be Withdrawn to East Africa

[United Press, London, 19th] Well-informed British sources said today that Britain is preparing to hand over military responsibility for the Mediterranean and the Middle East to the United States and withdraw British Imperial defenses to East Africa. According to qualified military sources close to the British War Office, this move means that the defense of the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal will be the responsibility of the United States, but Britain will not abandon its economic and political interests in the Middle East as a result. British Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons last Friday that Britain intends to continue to be concerned about the Middle East and the Mediterranean. The withdrawal of British military and supply bases to East Africa is scheduled to be completed in two or three years, changing the British Empire's defense plans for the past fifty years. The United States already has concrete interests in the Mediterranean and has sufficient strength, so it can take on this major responsibility. As for Britain's decision to strengthen defenses in areas such as Kenya and Rhodesia in East Africa, it is because Britain has decided to withdraw from India before June next year, the situation in Palestine is unstable, and the status of Sudan is uncertain. British officials admit that the draft of the African defense strategy must be actively cooperated with by the local residents, and must be coordinated with France and Belgium, which are Britain's most important and reliable neighbors in Africa. Colonial administrators from Britain, France, and Belgium will meet in Paris tomorrow to discuss a wide range of issues in Africa, such as transportation, public health, and food supply. The three countries will also establish a joint committee to implement the decisions made in Paris.

### Japan Denies Military Building Request

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] The Japanese Foreign Ministry today denied reports by some news agencies that Japan plans to build a 100,000-strong army after the end of the occupation.

### Banque de l'Indochine Opens Tokyo Branch

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 19th] The Tokyo branch of the Banque de l'Indochine of Vietnam opened today, making it the second foreign bank to be allowed to open in Tokyo. The first was Citibank, which reopened here last summer. According to current regulations, Banque de l'Indochine can only handle deposit business for private individuals of the occupation forces. It is still not allowed to handle commercial and remittance business, and its business will not be restored until Japan and foreign countries resume trade relations. It is said that the branches of British and French banks in Japan will also reopen in the near future.

### Britain Approves Plan to Build Nuclear Power Plant

[United Press, London, 19th] The Daily Express reported today that Britain's first nuclear power plant will be built in Trawsfynydd, Cumberland. The plant will be large in scale and will use uranium to generate electricity. It will be equipped with several uranium-powered engines. The Atomic Energy Commission has drafted a plan to start the first engine within five years, which has been approved by the cabinet. It is estimated that the construction of the plant will cost £7 million (US$28 million). The maximum power generation of its main engine will be 75,000 kilowatts, which is enough to supply the electricity and power needed for a city of the size of Liverpool. The city has a population of 855,000 and is the fourth largest city in Britain. Depending on the performance of the engine, other engines will be added to the site. The second nuclear power plant will be located somewhere in Scotland. The total power generation of the two plants should eventually reach more than 1 million kilowatts, supplying a quarter of Britain's electricity needs and saving 5 million tons of coal per year. The Daily Express is run by Beaverbrook, leans towards the Conservative Party, and has a daily circulation of 3.45 million copies, making it the largest in the world.

### U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Royal Discusses the World Situation

Says the U.S. and Soviet Union Must Resolve Their Disputes

[United Press, Atlanta, Georgia, 18th] Under Secretary of the Army Royal said here recently that the world's two major political and military powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, must find ways to resolve their disputes and should not appease each other. In the current international situation, Italy and Japan have become defeated countries, Germany has also been conquered, and China is moving towards unification, developing its vast potential, but progress is slow and often interrupted. India is still far from realizing its strength. Small countries in Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, South America, and Africa are still not worthy of attention from a military point of view. Although our country's relationship with Britain is close, Britain has lost its military strength since World War II and is no longer the master of the oceans. Its imperial system has also loosened and is not as strong as it was hundreds of years ago. Therefore, only the United States and the Soviet Union are the world's two major military and political powers, and this situation is unlikely to change in the next few decades. Therefore, armaments and diplomacy are now tied to the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

### Benton Stresses the Need to Maintain U.S. External Broadcasting

[United Press, Washington, 19th] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Benton declared that if Congress cuts off the State Department's "throat" for broadcasting the Voice of America to Europe, it would be a national disaster. According to his statement to radio listeners, he will fight to at least restore his news and cultural programs in this area so that the world can understand the truth about American democracy in order to counter the false propaganda conducted by the Soviet Union. Critics in Congress, despite repeated appeals from Benton, Secretary of State Marshall, and retired Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, decided to cancel the entire program, including shortwave radio broadcasts of the U.S.'s "purely untruthful truth" to foreign countries. Benton refused the advisory committee's suggestion to transfer the broadcasting to private enterprise management. He still insisted that the broadcasting must be sponsored by the State Department.

### Marshall and Clayton to Discuss Economic Policy; The Primary Issue is the Implementation of the Truman Doctrine

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to begin a general review of U.S. international economic policy on the 19th with Under Secretary of State Clayton, who is responsible for economic affairs. The primary issue on the agenda will be the steps to implement the Truman Doctrine, which is how to provide economic assistance to countries willing to resist communist forces. Clayton is currently attending the preparatory meeting of the International Trade Organization organized by eighteen countries in Geneva and is expected to fly back to Washington on the evening of the 18th. After Acheson resigns in mid-June, Clayton will be the only remaining senior official in the State Department. During the coming years of economic crisis, Clayton will be Marshall's trusted right-hand man. The reason for the Marshall-Clayton meeting is that senior U.S. officials believe that there is a possibility of a world economic crisis before the end of this year. It is estimated that in order to implement Truman's policy, the United States will need to lend approximately US$5 billion per year in loans to various countries in need, especially Western European countries, in recent years. Congressional leaders in the U.S. predict that Congress - especially the current Congress - will not be able to pass any global economic relief plan. Although the amount of $5 billion per year has been mentioned in many quarters, no government official has publicly estimated it. A large part of this amount may come from peacetime lend-lease. Some Democrats from various states in the western United States have said that if the United States had spent $1 billion to fight for peace after World War I, World War II could have been avoided.

### Anglo-Soviet Treaty Revision Negotiations Underway in Moscow

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Regarding the revision of the 1942 Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance, it is reported that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Patrick Petrie, is currently in negotiations with the Soviet government on this matter, according to political figures here. It is said that when the Foreign Ministers of the four powers began their meeting in Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov presented the British government with a new draft, prohibiting either signatory from concluding treaties of friendship with any country deemed unfriendly by the other signatory. The British government did not accept this draft at the time and only submitted its counter-proposal to the Soviet government a few days ago. The Soviet authorities now appear to have verbally notified Ambassador Petrie of their views, and Foreign Minister Molotov will soon notify Foreign Secretary Bevin whether the British counter-proposal is accepted as the basis for future negotiations.

### Vandenberg Strongly Opposes Appointment of New Deal Personnel

### Economic Administrative Agreement Established for British and American Zones in Germany; Three Key Points Included

[Reuters, Hamburg, 18th] The German News Agency today issued an official statement that the economic administrative agreement established by the commander of the British zone in Germany, [Name], and the commander of the American zone, [Name], includes three key points: (1) An agreement on the allocation and joint use of British and American funds to revive German industry and promote Germany's import and export plans. (2) Strict regulations on the administrative and legislative powers of the five administrative agencies in the two zones. (3) A principle agreement to establish an Economic Committee. The powers of the Economic Committee are still under consideration. Its members will be elected by the German states in proportion to their population. Once established, it will have the powers of a legislative body within certain restrictions. In addition, a central administration is planned, composed of one representative from each state, which will be able to issue directives to the authorities of the two zones based on the decisions of the Economic Committee and obtain their reports.

### Christian Socialists Take Lead in French Zone Referendum

[Agence France-Presse, Baden, Germany, 19th] Legislative elections and a referendum were held yesterday in three districts of the French-occupied zone of Germany. The results show that the constitution drafted by the provisional government of the districts has been passed, and the Christian Social Party has achieved an unprecedented victory. However, the majority was very narrow, especially in the Rhineland-Palatinate district, where the majority was only 52.8%. Many voters in the Palatinate district even opposed the draft constitution, and it was only saved by the support of the Rhineland district. In the elections, the Christian Social Party received a total of 984,531 votes, followed by the Social Democratic Party with 572,667 votes, the Liberal Party with 240,262 votes, and the Communist Party with 159,690 votes. The Rhineland-Palatinate district had the highest number of voters, accounting for 71% of the electorate, followed by the Baden and Württemberg districts. The situation was worse than the previous election. The left-wing parties performed as follows: the Communist Party was slightly weaker, and the Social Democratic Party had a concrete victory. The Liberal Party almost doubled the number of votes it received in the last election. Although the Christian Social Party still dominated, it also suffered some setbacks. It is believed here that the victory of the Social Democratic Party is due to the fact that its leader, [Name], advocated a policy of German unification.

### US Advocates Prompt Discussion of International Gendarmerie Issue

[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] The United States delegation today said that the United States will urge the Security Council to immediately discuss the establishment of an international gendarmerie, which was recently put aside due to the United Nations agency's discussion of the Palestine and Greece issues. The Military Staff Committee's initial report on the organization of the international army shows that the Soviet Union has not yet agreed on fundamental principles. This report has been on the Security Council's table since May 1. The US delegation had requested that it be included on the agenda of the early Security Council meetings in May, but it was abandoned because the Soviet Union insisted on discussing the Greek issue first. The discussion of the Palestine issue then further delayed it.

### Egyptian Prime Minister Responds to Bevin's Remarks: British Troops Should Withdraw from Egypt; Sudan and Egypt Have a Real Need to Unite

[Reuters, Cairo, 18th] In response to British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement on Egypt in the House of Commons foreign policy debate, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy issued a statement today demanding the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and stating that Egypt cannot accept the continuation of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. He said that the continued presence of British troops in Egypt violates the sovereignty of a free and independent country. The British government knows that the presence of British troops in Egypt violates the wishes of the Egyptian people. We unanimously demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of these troops, and this cannot be conditional on amending the old treaty or concluding a new treaty. The British side has said that if Egypt can agree to the treaty that the British side wants, British troops will be prepared to withdraw, and that unless a new treaty is signed, the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty will continue to be valid, in other words, British troops will continue to be stationed in Egypt. The 1936 treaty was concluded under special circumstances. These conditions no longer exist. The war dangers that existed at that time have long since ended, so the 1936 treaty has achieved its purpose. This treaty violates the United Nations Charter, and we will never allow it to continue. I believe that no member of the United Nations can agree to force us to accept the presence of foreign troops. Britain is also inciting Sudan to secede from Egypt. The unification of Sudan and Egypt is the wish of all the people in the Nile Valley. The freedom of the Sudanese people will not be harmed by this unification. In order to ensure the safety of Sudan and to develop the interests of the Sudanese people, unification is necessary. The presence of British troops in Sudan is the result of the occupation of Egypt, so British troops no longer have the right to be stationed in Sudan. We will now appeal to the United Nations agencies regarding the dispute with Britain. The principle of equal rights of all member states of the United Nations will surely protect our country's rights. Bevin stated in the House of Commons that Egypt is of great importance to the British Empire, so the restoration of the British Empire's peacetime military position is closely linked to this center. It would be unfair to close this center without opening other avenues. Bevin also said that former Egyptian Prime Minister [Name] has already acknowledged this point, but the conditions for British withdrawal are now being rejected by the Egyptian side, and Britain is still basing its position on the 1936 treaty.

### Mountbatten Arrives in London; Important Figures Gather in the British Capital for an Important Meeting

In addition, British Commander-in-Chief in India, Marshal Auchinleck, came to England to attend the Imperial Staff Conference and has not yet returned to India. [Name] has met with the Secretary of State for India, Lord Listowel, in London.

Britain can only provide India with its experience.

British Reaction

[Our Correspondent] London, 19th Broadcast: The Egyptian Prime Minister issued a statement the other day saying that regardless of whether Britain and Egypt re-sign a new treaty or amend the 1936 treaty, British troops must immediately withdraw from Egypt. The British Foreign Office has issued a response to this matter, saying that although the British side has agreed to withdraw British troops stationed in Egypt before 1949, it still insists that Egypt must immediately negotiate with the British side on the re-signing of the 1936 treaty, and that the treaty will not be terminated due to Egypt's unilateral statement that the mission has been completed.

### Dispute Between Britain and Egypt

Egypt Plans to Appeal to the Security Council

### US "Prevention Magazine" Publishes Report on Bacterial Warfare: This Type of Warfare Cannot Be Subjected to International Control

[United Press, New York, 18th] "Prevention" magazine, with the permission of the Department of the Army, today published a report by three members of the American Association of Scientists on bacterial warfare, stating that thirty-three types of human and animal diseases are suitable for bacterial warfare, and another thirty-seven types are not suitable. The report, like Smith's report on atomic warfare, lists various possibilities, but retains military secrets. It is said that bacterial warfare does not necessarily have to be used to attack large areas, but can be used to attack special targets, destroying naval and air bases, cities, and factories. The report also discusses various possible attacks and defenses in detail so that the general public can understand the truth about bacterial warfare. It is said that bacterial warfare cannot be subjected to international control for the time being like atomic bombs. Even the smallest countries and obscure medical laboratories can become the source of bacterial weapons. In fact, even before World War II, any bacteriologist in the world could have discovered methods for applying bacteria as long as they had time to do prevention research. Aircraft are almost the best tool for spreading bacteria. The airborne spread of bacteria through inhalation into the human body is the greatest threat. Bacteria in water and food are also mentioned, but they are not considered to be successful. The most useful war bacteria are "Tularemia bacteria," also known as "rabbit fever." This type of bacteria, spread in the air, can cause pneumonia, respiratory plague, and diseases similar to glanders. As for plague bacteria spread by rats and fleas, they are not suitable for warfare because the disease can be eradicated simply by eliminating the rats.

### The French Government Faces Numerous Difficulties; Dockworkers Begin Strike Yesterday

[Our Correspondent] London, 19th Broadcast: Dockworkers in Paris began a twenty-four-hour strike today, demanding a guarantee of a minimum wage. Since this morning, all cargo in major ports in France and North Africa, such as Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne, has come to a standstill, and the food on two large cargo ships cannot be unloaded.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] Although the French political situation has appeared calm on the surface for the past week, behind the scenes, the difficulties facing the reorganized [Name] cabinet are just beginning.

President [Name] and Prime Minister [Name] have both made every effort to urge farmers to sell their grain and not hoard it for speculation. The bread supply situation in Paris is particularly serious. The scarcity of grain is not the only crisis facing France, as the possibility of a nationwide general strike is also becoming increasingly imminent. Prime Minister [Name] recently took advantage of the temporary lull on the political front to inspect the [Name] wine region, where he gave a speech praising the region's reconstruction work, and said that the [Name] region's Burgundy wine is a famous French export that must be sold abroad to buy grain. It is necessary to balance France's import and export trade. We can no longer buy goods from abroad as we did before, because our gold reserves are gradually decreasing.

### Chinese People Growing Up in the United States Change Development with the Environment

Dr. Lasker's View

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th Special Dispatch] Dr. Lasker said in the "American Journal of Anatomy" that the standard Chinese people who grow up in the United States are taller than newly arrived immigrants from China, with longer arms and legs, thinner hands and feet, flatter chests, wider heads, and sharper noses.

House Appropriations Committee Chairman [Name] said that although the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey has been approved, the payment of funds for this plan may be postponed indefinitely or must wait until President Truman submits a report on how this item will be used.

### Welles Advocates Delaying Approval of Italian Peace Treaty

Says the Italian Communist Party May Control the Country

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Former US Undersecretary of State [Name] broadcast on the 18th, accusing the Italian Communist Party of possessing large quantities of weapons and ammunition, and said that the party directly receives financial assistance from Moscow. [Name] said that it is highly possible that the communist regime will control everything in Italy in the coming months, so he has asked the US Senate to delay the approval of the Italian Peace Treaty. He knows that the highest officials of the current Italian government have evidence that Italian Communist leader [Name] is directly receiving funds from Moscow. In fact, the most dangerous thing is that the local communist organizations in every major city in Italy, especially in the larger industrial cities in northern Italy, already possess large quantities of weapons and ammunition, including tanks and machine guns. [Name] concluded by saying that if the Italian Peace Treaty is approved now, it would mean that the troops of the US and British would withdraw from Italy, and that the US and British troops in Italy have so far been the greatest obstacle to armed rebellion within Italy and to Yugoslavia's oppression of Italy.

The content will be exactly the same as those signed by Poland and Yugoslavia, that is, it stipulates that if one of the signatories is attacked by another country, the other signatory should immediately provide assistance, but signing a mutual assistance treaty does not mean organizing a group, because organizing a group contradicts Czech foreign policy.

### Commander Xuan Returns to Shanghai After Seeking Instructions, Talks About Complying with the National Government's Promulgated Methods for Maintaining Social Order, Determined to Vigorously Prevent Parades and Demonstrations, Will Detain and Prosecute Those Who Violate Laws and Resist Orders

Commander Xuan Tiewu of the Preparatory Department traveled to Beijing by car on the morning of the 18th to seek instructions from Chairman Chiang, and returned to Shanghai by car that evening.

The reporter also asked about the students' parade yesterday. Xuan said that because the temporary measures to maintain social order were published in the newspapers yesterday, most students had not yet seen them, so the parade yesterday was dealt with leniently. In the future, if any parades or other incidents occur, they will be vigorously prevented in accordance with the law. If there is any behavior that violates the law, the leaders will be arrested and prosecuted.

### Flying Star Returns to the Motherland, Carrying Our Captured Officers

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Chinese warship "Flying Star," looted by the Japanese army during the war, was recently returned to China. It arrived at Wusongkou on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. This morning, Yao Gengsheng, director of the Shanghai office of the delegation stationed in Japan, will, together with the customs authorities, handle the handover procedures. The Flying Star was originally a customs anti-smuggling ship built by the Jiangnan Shipyard. After being looted by the Japanese army, it was refitted as a warship. This time, it sailed from Japan back to the motherland. Due to the great wind and waves en route, the voyage lasted as long as twelve days. The ship carried eleven of our officers captured by the enemy in North China and Qingdao during the war, as well as iron anchors, artillery shells, etc., seized by Japan during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. The captured officers have been sent to the port headquarters to await dispatch, while the iron anchors, artillery shells, etc., are being kept by the First Naval Base Command.

[Another Report] A person named Lei Hongming, pretending to be a soldier in Japan and acting lawlessly, was arrested by our representative in Japan.

### Commander Kagezu Was Not Escorted; Two War Criminals Extradited; Only Tanaka Arrived; Taiwan Fugitive Huang Zairong Came Along

[Our Newspaper's Report] Lieutenant General Tanaka Gunkichi, an important Japanese war criminal who, together with the famous female spy Kawashima Yoshiko, was in charge of espionage work in North China, and Huang Zairong, a major criminal who fled to Japan after the Taiwan Incident, were escorted from Tokyo yesterday and arrived in this city by Jian Guo aircraft at 6 p.m. Tanaka was immediately escorted to the Jiangwan War Criminals Management Office for detention, while Huang Zairong was detained at the Songhu Garrison Command awaiting transfer to Taiwan. As for Major General Kagezu Tadaki, another important Japanese war criminal who single-handedly supported the puppet regime and served as an advisor to the puppet National Government, he was not escorted this time.

When a reporter inquired of Tanaka at the airport, he said that he was from Tokyo, a graduate of the Officer Candidate School. When Japan launched its war of aggression against China, he was active in North China. At that time, his military rank was Army Captain (previously mistakenly reported as Lieutenant General) and belonged to the Takeyama unit. He was in North China for a total of nine years, jointly engaging in espionage work with Kawashima Yoshiko. Before Japan surrendered, Tanaka had been to Nanjing, and by that time he had been promoted to Major. After the surrender, he returned to his country and retired, working at the Tokyo Industrial Patriotic Corporation. On April 28 of this year, he was arrested by the Allied forces stationed in Japan. This was the first time he had been escorted to Shanghai. Huang Zairong also stated that he was from Taipei and had been doing business in Tokyo. He was arrested by the Allied forces last month and did not know the reason. Regarding the "February 28th Incident" in Taipei, he claimed "ignorance." However, according to the reporter's investigation, he had supplied the "rebellious elements" with weapons during the "February 28th Incident," so the Taiwan Garrison Command sent a letter to our delegation stationed in Japan requesting his arrest and repatriation.

### Beer in Season, Workers Strike, Jardine Factory Suffers Great Losses

[Our Newspaper's Report] Now that summer has arrived, it is the peak season for beer sales. More than 180 workers at the British-owned Jardine Brewery in Yangshupu in this city went on strike suddenly on the 18th because their demands for improved treatment were not met. The factory has suffered great losses and the Bureau of Social Affairs is currently mediating.

According to the labor union, the main cause of the strike was that when the index had not yet been unfrozen, the company secretly increased the base salary of employees by six to seventy yuan. The workers, believing that increasing the base salary violated government regulations, requested that the factory issue a production subsidy based on their work performance. The factory's response to this request was: (1) If the cost of living is not enough to maintain, extra work can be given to increase income. (2) Adults are allowed to pre-draw 200,000 yuan each, and child laborers 150,000 yuan, but it must be deducted in full at the end of the month when salaries are paid. The workers believed that this response did not provide practical help, so they insisted on demanding the supplementary payment of living and production subsidies for the months of February, March, and April when the index was frozen. Starting from May, wages will be paid monthly according to the unfrozen index, and subsidies will be based on the rice price in January of this year, with monthly subsidies thereafter until the rice price and index are equalized. Otherwise, if the base salary of the employees is increased, the workers must also be increased in the same way. In addition, they also demanded that the factory provide worker welfare facilities.

(Another Report) Jinhua Tobacco Factory, commissioned by Delong, specializes in manufacturing cigarettes and employs 335 workers. Recently, due to the rise in tobacco prices, it could not maintain operations and was forced to suspend work on the 13th. All employees are worried about the threat of unemployment and are very concerned about when work can resume. Yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened both parties to mediate, and it was decided that in addition to paying the wages for the first half of May on the 20th, the resumption of work would be discussed further.

### Representatives of Employees from Two Railways Petition Director Lu

Difficulty in Life Due to Unadjusted Treatment

Employees of the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway requested adjustments to fares and treatment. In addition to appealing for support by asking passengers to sign their names, they also held an expanded publicity campaign yesterday and today. On the employee side, because the railway authorities have not yet given a definite answer to the issue of adjusting treatment, they could not wait and sent two representatives, Gao Qifu and Pan Bingqing, standing directors of the labor union, to visit Lu Jingshi, director of the Department of Social Affairs, to ask for mediation. According to the two representatives, the current treatment of employees in the Jinghu area is based on the standard for civil servants, plus 20%. However, the base salary of railway employees is very low, generally around 30 to 40 yuan. According to the new treatment for civil servants, the average income of each employee is only 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. In the past, there was a rice subsidy calculated according to market prices. Recently, the price of rice has soared, but the rice subsidy received by employees is still 30,000 yuan, so it is really not enough to cover expenses. Director Lu expressed great sympathy for their demands and immediately contacted Director Chen of the Railway Bureau to discuss the matter. It is said that he will ask the Ministries of Transportation and Social Affairs to each send senior officials to Shanghai to discuss a solution together with the Railway Bureau and employee representatives.

### Shen Wanqian Was Secretly Reported for Corruption; The District Attorney's Office Conducted Its First Interrogation Yesterday; Lin Xingji and Jiang Weibin Were Released on Bail After Interrogation

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 10 a.m. yesterday, Prosecutor Chen of the District Attorney's Office investigated a very important corruption and opium case. Shen Wanqian, former commander of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, is suspected of being heavily involved. It is said that Lin Xingji, a native of Fuqing, Fujian, who is already sixty years old, was suspected of colluding with thugs during the Anti-Japanese War. Because the enemy Lin Wu opened a Lin Ai store at 395 Wusong Road, Hongkou, after the victory, Lin Xingji renamed the store Fuyong Store. In September of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), someone secretly reported to the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, and Shen Wanqian ordered his subordinates to arrest Lin Xingji and found a large number of opium paraphernalia and three catties of opium. Three days later, Jiang Weibin, a native of Fujian, through the introduction of Jiang Gongmei, negotiated with Shen Wanqian to have Lin released on bail. Afterwards, someone secretly reported to the military authorities that Shen Wanqian was corrupt. The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense sent a letter to the capital's judicial organs to investigate. Because the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District Attorney's Office, it was transferred to Shanghai for handling. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the District Attorney's Office ordered Lin Xingji and Jiang Weibin to appear in court and opened the first interrogation hearing. After the interrogation, Lin Xingji and Jiang Xiaoyan were allowed to be released on bail, and a new date was set for further interrogation.

### Wusong Seawall Collapsed and Awaiting Repair; Fields Have Been Barren for a Long Time, Eagerly Awaiting Relief Grain; Speaker Visited Wusong and Jiangwan, District Residents Made Several Requests

[Our Newspaper's Report] City Council Speaker Pan visited the Wusong and Jiangwan districts yesterday afternoon, accompanied by the district chiefs, chairmen of the district residents' representative assembly, and city councilors. The places visited included Wusong Middle School, the original site of the Pao Taiwan Workers' Public School (now the 101st Rear Hospital for Wounded Soldiers), the Wusong Seawall, the two district government offices, the streets of the two districts, and remote areas.

The results of the Speaker's inspection, and the construction or improvements that the district chiefs hoped for, mainly included the following points: (1) The residents of the Jiangwan and Wusong districts recently heard that the government authorities were distributing food rice to shantytowns, but not to the two districts, causing great panic. Because the government authorities believe that farmers in suburban areas cultivate and eat their own food and do not need to be distributed rice, but the fact is not the case. Because the area was a military zone during the war, the farmland was all used by the Japanese army, and has not been cultivated for many years. It is now impossible to grow rice, resulting in a great shortage of food. Rice stores have not had rice for sale for several days. Therefore, it is hoped that the government authorities can understand this point and consider the distribution method. (2) The Wusong seawall stone embankment has gradually collapsed, and it is hoped that the public works authorities will expedite repairs.

Hoping to Restore Ferries and Railways

(3) Before the war, the city's ferry service had a wharf in Wusong, with as many as twelve trips per day. Now, only the bottom piles of the wharf remain, and the ferry only makes one trip per day, docking in the middle of the river, causing great inconvenience to passengers and cargo sellers. It is hoped that the service can be restored and the number of trips increased. (4) The Songhu Railway had part of its tracks removed by the enemy during the war, so currently it can only run from Shanghai to Gaojingmiao, which has a major impact on transportation. Moreover, the railway line is one of the earliest railways in our country and has historical value. It is also hoped that it can be restored. (5) The civilian land in Wusong and Jiangwan that was enclosed by the Japanese before has not been returned or purchased at price since the government took over, but farmers are still paying land taxes, which is unfair. It is hoped that the government authorities can quickly decide on a method: return what should be returned, and purchase what should not be confiscated, so that land taxes are no longer paid. (6) The dredging funds for the Zoumatang in Jiangwan are not enough, so it could not be completed. In addition to hoping that the authorities will increase the allocation of materials and expenses, a comprehensive plan should be developed, that is, the Shajing Port, which must be passed by the outlet of the canal, should also be dredged, so that it can be connected to the Huangpu River. Otherwise, even if the Zoumatang can be dredged, it will be futile.

### Tangshan Ship Sails to Pukou, Runs Aground Near Nantong

[Our Newspaper's Report] The new Tangshan ship of the China Shipping Company loaded more than 3,000 tons of edible salt in Tianjin, passed through Shanghai, and was transported to Pukou for unloading. At 3 p.m. yesterday, it ran aground on the river surface near Nantong. After the ship had an accident, it immediately telegraphed the Shanghai office to report. After receiving the telegram, the company rented the Guoqiang steamboat from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and rushed to the scene of the accident overnight to tow and rescue it, and sent personnel to accompany the ship.

No Middle School Established, Difficulty in Continuing Studies

(7) The Jiangwan district is formed by the merger of Jiangwan and Yinhang before the war and covers a large area, but there are only primary schools, making it difficult for children graduating from primary school to continue their studies. It is hoped that the education authorities can add a middle school. (8) There should be public buses running on the Wusong Yixian Road. If the Public Utilities Bureau does not have the funds to do so, it is hoped that the people of Wusong and Jiangwan districts can be allowed to jointly organize a public bus company to operate it. If there is a surplus, it will be used as a fund for public welfare undertakings. (9) The Jiangwan Fire Brigade currently has only one fire truck and the equipment is simple. It is hoped that the city government authorities can further replenish the equipment. Improvements are also hoped for in terms of hygiene and cleaning. There are only three to five cleaners in each of the two districts, so the results of their cleaning can be imagined.

Also, today the Speaker will visit the Dachang and Zhenru districts.

### Sino-American Cultural Association General Assembly Confirms Seven Items of Association Affairs

### 120,000 Tons of Garbage Citywide, Phased Removal to Begin Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a survey by the Sanitation Corps of the Health Bureau, there are 2.4 million stacks of accumulated garbage in various districts of the city, totaling approximately 120,000 tons. Previously, the health authorities requested and obtained the approval of the city government to allocate a special fund of 453.2 million yuan for removal. Now that the height of summer is approaching, the removal work cannot be delayed.

The first phase includes five districts: Changning, Penglai, Yimiao, Jing'an, and Xuhui. The second phase includes six districts: Yulin, Songshan, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Hongkou, and Xinshijie. The third phase includes the remaining districts. Each phase must be completed within 20 days. Removal tools will be purchased or borrowed by the district government. The funds will be issued according to the number of garbage loads, with 1,200 yuan temporarily issued per load in urban areas and 1,000 yuan per load in suburban areas. Dumping locations will be negotiated with the Sanitation Corps by the district government in the vicinity, or found by themselves, or the district government will negotiate with barge operators to transport to Sanlintang for filling depressions. Vehicles will be hired by the district government themselves. From today until the end of June, the districts in the first and second phases must complete the removal on schedule.

### Public Works Bureau Fire Prevention Plan

Fire Lanes and Walls Must Be Set Up for Shantytowns

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the fire in the shantytowns in the Nanxing Road, Xinmin Road, and Wuzhen Road area of Zhabei, Zhao Zukang, director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, has paid attention to this. He sent Wang, director of the Construction Division of the bureau, and others to conduct on-site inspections. The fire prevention equipment in the area is really lacking. It is now heard that in order to prevent fires and effectively manage shantytowns, the bureau has designated new road lines and plans to set up fire lanes and firewalls for future shantytown construction. It is stipulated that firewalls must be built at both ends of every 100 feet of shantytowns. The width of the main alley must be at least 16 feet, and the front and back alleys must be 10 feet each. The width of the shantytown bay must be 10 to 11 feet, with a depth of 18 feet along the road and 16 feet inside the alley. The person in charge of the bureau also stated that this expedient measure will not only benefit the residents themselves, but also be conducive to public safety. It is hoped that all citizens will pay attention to and assist in the handling of this matter.

### Kong Lingkan Not Guilty

Determined Not to Be the Owner of the Dawan Evening News

Wang Leshan Should Be Responsible for Repaying Debts

[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang Xingdao, Lin Shicun, Zhuo Qizhong, Rong Junli, Shen Rongchu, and others, fifteen creditors of the Dawan Evening News, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the District Court, accusing Kong Lingkan, the owner of the Dawan Evening News, and Wang Leshan, the manager, of owing creditors a debt of 17.7 million yuan in national currency, and requesting the court to order the defendants to repay the debt. Yesterday, Judge Ling Yuanqing announced the verdict in the District Court: "Kong Lingkan is not guilty, and Wang Leshan should be responsible for repaying the debt." The reason is that it is insufficient to prove that Kong Lingkan is the owner of the Dawan Evening News. The handwritten order of Kong Lingkan submitted by the plaintiff is purely a private transaction. Therefore, Wang Leshan should repay the debt with the property of the Dawan Evening News, and Wang Leshan should be responsible for repaying the insufficient part.

### Patient's Mouth and Nose Spurted Blood, Died with a Miserable Scream, Surgery Performed at Zhongshan Hospital, Family Members Believed the Cause of Death Was Suspicious, Corpse Was Dissected and Examined Yesterday

Gu Kanglong, an 18-year-old student from the Guiyang Aviation School, from Nanhui, Pudong, came to Shanghai last month and temporarily resided at the home of his uncle, Gu Xiang, at No. 4, Lane 93, Ximen Road. Unexpectedly, Gu suddenly suffered from nosebleeds. His uncle hired a doctor to diagnose and treat him, but it was ineffective. On April 14, he was sent to Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge for treatment, but it was still ineffective. Until the 16th of this month, the hospital obtained the consent of Gu's family to perform surgery. Due to excessive bleeding, he died in the afternoon of that day. The family members suspected that the hospital was negligent and had caused his death, so they reported the incident to the Changshu Police Branch and sent police officers to summon the hospital doctor, Li Zhaoting, for questioning. They also sent the corpse by car to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy site. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Fang Zheng and forensic doctor Shen Dajun arrived at the scene. Gu Xianglin, the uncle of the deceased, first complained about the incident, saying that the case was divided into three points: (1) Whether there was a need to

Remove the Spleen

The doctor should pay attention to (2) After the operation, the patient was placed in ward No. 4 without a doctor taking care of him, causing a large amount of fresh blood to spurt out of the patient's mouth and nose, and he died with a miserable scream (3) The painful person died at 1:20, and the hospital only notified the family at 2:30. When the family arrived at the scene, the hospital still claimed to dissect the corpse for research into the cause of death. All of the above is enough to prove that the hospital doctor has

Negligent Homicide

The request is to investigate and handle according to law. Doctor Li Zhaoting, 26 years old, from Yin County, assistant doctor at Zhongshan Hospital, said, "The patient was my responsibility for diagnosis and treatment. At about 9 am on the 16th, after obtaining the consent of the patient's family and signing, the chief doctor Li Jiazhong performed the surgery, assisted by doctors such as Min Renyu, Ji Suhua, Qiu Chuanlu, Huang Tianru, and Zhu Minqiang. After the operation, the patient was sent to room No. 4, where I accompanied and nursed him. However, due to the severity of the illness, he died at 1 pm. However, the patient had lost too much blood before his death

He had been transfused with blood

Twelve times, with no effect. The chief doctor determined that the problem could not be fundamentally solved without surgery, so the operation was performed." Prosecutor Fang ordered Li Zhaoting to be released on bail and scheduled the autopsy for 2 p.m. Wei Ligong, chief forensic doctor, and assistant forensic doctors will arrive at the scene at that time to perform the dissection and examination. As a result, the heart, lungs, etc. will be taken out and brought back to wait for detailed research before reporting.

Yan said: "Dr. Shi and others in the United States constantly raise donations and medical equipment to China, and recently X-ray equipment worth 10,000 US dollars will be shipped to Shanghai." In addition, Yan expressed his gratitude to the Executive Yuan and the Red Cross Societies of the United States and Britain for their assistance to the association in the past year, to Dr. Wu Shaoqing for presiding over the Second Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital of the association, and to other responsible persons for their enthusiasm for public welfare.

In the future, not only will the management be able to concentrate its efforts, but the environment will also be more beautiful.

### Students from Universities in Nanjing and Shanghai Scheduled to Resume Classes Automatically Today; Five Universities Including National Central University Issued Declarations to Protect Their Institutions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The wave of strikes at five universities, including National Central University, subsided last night. Most students, feeling that the student movement had deteriorated and that the strikes were hindering their studies, launched a signature campaign to initiate a "Movement to Protect the University and Resume Classes" and organized a committee for the movement. Responders were very enthusiastic. The committee also issued a declaration stating, in part, "We deeply feel that the spirit of broad democracy has been severely threatened. National Central University's bastion of freedom has been transformed into a sea of suffering without freedom, and they are preparing to turn the pure voices of our 4,600 students into shouts of political struggle. We believe that more students than just us feel that this form of petition is a waste. This despotic behavior has tainted the honor of our academic institutions. Out of love for the country and the free will of the entire Chinese nation, we must loudly proclaim and even cry out loud: (1) The government must show its determination to rescue education in its suffering. (2) We want to eat, we want to study. (3) All parties must show conscience and let us go. (4) We firmly oppose petitioning by means of strikes and demonstrations. (5) We especially oppose the purpose of the petition changing midway. (6) We advocate for an immediate resumption of classes."

Jinling University to Resume Classes Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] All faculty members of Jinling University, to persuade students to resume classes as soon as possible and stop participating in demonstrations, convened an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 19th. They resolved that all classes would resume on the 20th and passed a letter to all students, stipulating that all faculty members, regardless of whether they have classes or not, must arrive at the school at the designated time on the morning of the 20th. The faculty members are also willing to stay at the school all day to supervise. In addition, a class resumption organization has been formed by the students. Therefore, the issue of strikes by some students at the university is expected to come to an end.

National Pharmacy College Withdraws from Petition

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The "National Central University, Jinling University, National Pharmacy College, National Drama College, and National Music Academy" in Nanjing originally planned to petition the Executive Yuan and the Political Council on the 20th, demanding increased education funding and supplementary food expenses. All students of the National Pharmacy College were deeply moved after reading Chairman Chiang's speech to the youth on maintaining social order. The student self-government association convened a general student meeting at 11:30 AM on the 19th and resolved to withdraw from the Nanjing Five Universities' demonstration and petition organization with immediate effect.

Shanghai University Presidents Resolved to Order Immediate Resumption of Classes

[Central News Agency Report] The presidents of universities and colleges in Shanghai held a joint meeting yesterday. After the meeting, they issued a statement stating that, in view of the central government's strict order to prohibit strikes and demonstrations, and for the sake of protecting the students and their studies, the presidents unanimously resolved to order the immediate resumption of classes. They also requested professors to persuade the students, and if the students remain unrepentant, they will take strict measures in accordance with the Ministry of Education's orders.

Fudan University to Resume Classes Today

[Central News Agency Report] The majority of students at Fudan University opposed the "Eat Up" and "Just Eat" movement and launched a signature campaign yesterday to demand the resumption of classes. The campaign was launched by students Jiang Yingsheng, Wu Jiaxiang, and dozens of others, who issued a declaration stating that strikes are a loss for all students and demanding the immediate resumption of classes. After the declaration was issued, students responded and signed their names. By last night, the number of signatures had reached 1,487. These students also invited President Zhang Yi of the university to speak to all students at 2:00 PM yesterday. According to the original plan, classes were to resume yesterday morning, but many professors were unable to arrive in time due to receiving late notice. Only one class in the Department of Civil Engineering held class as usual. In the afternoon, the university announced a suspension of classes due to the president's speech, but the university announced that all classes would resume today.

Zhang Yi's Sincere Speech

At 2:15 PM, President Zhang delivered a speech to over 800 students in the university's auditorium. His speech generally stated that the student unrest at the university was initiated last Friday afternoon by students from outside the university who requested to participate. As for the strike, it was decided by the joint council of department representatives. The organization of the joint council of department representatives is illegal and therefore invalid. Furthermore, the demand for increased funding and improved staff and student benefits is very reasonable, but it must be done through proper channels by submitting requests to the authorities. As for opposing the civil war, not only students but also the entire nation hopes for this, but the civil war involves both sides, and petitions should be submitted to both sides. The name "Eat Up" movement seems inappropriate. Currently, there may be insufficient nutrition, but there is no evidence of starvation. Furthermore, there is a so-called "Rescue Education Movement," which I find very distressing. To rescue education, stability is necessary first, and strikes create instability. Truth cannot be obtained by means of propaganda and shouting slogans. Furthermore, students' demand to attend classes is a basic demand and a responsibility of the school. The university will not allow students to use force to prevent other students from attending classes. Finally, he announced that classes would resume at 8:00 AM tomorrow (i.e., today). He concluded his speech at 2:45 PM amidst applause. In addition, students Jiang Yingsheng and Wu Jiaxiang, along with 1,487 others, requested the Fudan University authorities yesterday to: (1) Immediately publicly dissolve the so-called Joint Council of Department Representatives and pursue the responsibility of those responsible for the illegal leadership of the strike. (2) Order the Rescue Education Movement Assembly to cease activities immediately. (3) Request the school to immediately send a telegram to the Ministry of Education denying the university's petition representatives. (4) Propose that the school's school affairs committee establish a supervisory mechanism for the student self-government association.

Datong University Preparing to Resume Classes

[Central News Agency Report] Since the majority of students at Datong University organized the University Administration Reform Committee, they have held several informal negotiations with the school and proposed a reform plan. It is heard that the school believes that it will refer to and improve the plan after classes resume and will not be perfunctory. The majority of students have expressed their agreement. It is expected that Datong University will resume classes soon.

### All Students of National Chung Cheng University Plan to Petition in Nanjing Tomorrow; Wang Lingji Discusses Emergency Measures

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 19th] The student unrest at National Chung Cheng University has begun. The Student University Protection Association has strengthened its activities and resumed strikes yesterday. They also colluded with acting President Luo Rongzi to sign checks to raise funds and planned to travel to Nanjing on the 21st to petition. They also took control of the school's transportation and telephone and monitored Luo's movements. The Student University Protection Association will submit the following petition to the Ministry of Education: (1) Remove President Xiao. (2) Rebuild the new campus at Lushan. (3) Improve campus facilities. (4) Increase student public expenses. Governor Wang Lingji of Jiangxi Province stated that the provincial government will support the school and prevent Luo from signing checks for payment. According to Department Director Zhou Bangdao of the Department of Education, the situation of the student unrest has been reported to the Ministry and a telegram has been sent to President Xiao to postpone his return to Jiangxi and a telegram has been sent to Leping urging Inspector Wu Zhaotang of the Ministry to return quickly. Wang Lingji has received a telegram from Chairman Chiang instructing him to assist in the handling of the situation. If the students act out of line, the government will follow orders and will not tolerate it. Acting President Luo Rongzi was released from the siege by a reporter's car today and went to the city to discuss the handling measures with Wang Lingji.

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 19th] The situation at Chung Cheng University is chaotic. Jiangxi Governor Wang Lingji convened leaders of the party and the group this afternoon to discuss emergency measures.

### Six Thousand University Students in Shanghai Marching to See off the Representatives Going to Nanjing for Petitioning

[Central News Agency Report] The National Government's clearly stated "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order" and Chairman Chiang's speech on rectifying academic style and safeguarding the rule of law were only disclosed in yesterday's newspapers, but students from national universities and colleges in Shanghai still held a large-scale march yesterday. The "Eat Up" and "Just Eat" movement, originally promoted, was opposed by the majority of students and was renamed the "Save Education Crisis Movement." However, the slogans shouted and posters displayed during the march by the students yesterday still had a very strong political color, exceeding the scope of the original demands of the students. The following is a record of the march yesterday: Students from national universities and colleges in Shanghai, in response to the student unrest at National Central University and Jinling University in Nanjing, sent representatives to Nanjing for petitioning, departing by train at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. The representatives included six from Jiaotong University, five from Fudan University, five from Tongji University, five from Jinan University, three from Shanghai Medical College, two from Shanghai Conservatory of Music, two from Shanghai Kindergarten Teachers College, two from Shanghai Merchant Marine College, totaling 30. Together with six representatives from Zhejiang University who came to Shanghai from Hangzhou, there were a total of 36 people. They gathered at 9:00 AM at the Second Campus of Jinan University on Baoshan Road and then went to the railway station. Approximately 6,000 students from various universities participated in the send-off. After the train departed, the students who saw them off departed from the North Railway Station to hold a hunger march. Responsible persons of the security agencies sincerely advised them not to disturb public order and obstruct traffic, but the chairman of the marching student delegation refused. At 11:30 AM, the delegation, led by a car, departed and marched along North Henan Road, through Nanjing Road, turned west to West Tibet Road, south into East Zhongzheng Road, east to East Zhongshan Road (the Bund), and then north. At 1:45 PM, they arrived at the Bund Park, covering a full circle of the central urban area. Along the way, the police cavalry and police officers tried to dissuade them, but to no effect. The marching students began to disperse at 2:10 PM. The marching students posted slogans, sang songs, and shouted slogans along the way, including: (1) Oppose the civil war, (2) Down with warmongers, (3) Increase education funding, (4) Increase supplementary food expenses, (5) Ask for food at the mouths of cannons, (6) Unity is strength, (7) Full public funding for university students, (8) Increase the salaries of teachers and staff, (9) Minister Zhu, show some conscience! Premier of the Executive Yuan, show some conscience!

### British University Students in Nanjing Petition the Ministry of Education Yesterday – Stalemate All Day Resolved by Lei Zhen as Mediator

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Students from British universities in Nanjing petitioned the Ministry of Education on the 19th, resulting in a stalemate from morning until evening. The Ministry of Education did not provide a response, and Lei Zhen stepped in as a mediator. Lei’s response to the students was met with approval by the majority of the students. Over two hundred British university students participated in the petition. They gathered at Central University at 10:00 AM on the 19th, marched in formation, and chanted slogans along the way. Upon hearing the news, the police authorities, in accordance with temporary measures for maintaining public order, dispatched a team to the front of the Ministry of Education to maintain order. When the students arrived at the ministry, the main gate was tightly secured. The police and students remained in a standoff for a long time. In the afternoon, the students managed to enter the gate, sat on the ground, and requested to see Zhu Jiahua. The Ministry of Education refused to meet with them because the students did not send ten representatives. After persuasion from Yang Gongda, former president of the British University, the students nominated ten representatives and requested Lei Zhen, who had attended the Ying Shi Memorial Meeting on the 18th, to assist in the negotiations. On the 18th, Lei addressed the students, responding to three points: (1) The Ministry of Education is currently searching for a university president and will resolve the issue soon. (2) The medical school has not been restored due to insufficient talent and equipment, and several other schools have not been restored for the same reason. The Ministry of Education has no intention to suppress it and will strive to promote its restoration in the future. (3) The location of the school was determined by the Education Conference, and the Ministry of Education cannot resolve it and must wait for the National Education Conference to be held this autumn to discuss it. Lei also advised the students to return, leaving only ten representatives. Most of the students expressed satisfaction with Lei’s response and applauded, departing together. A small number who did not leave were sternly persuaded by the police and also quickly returned to Central University.

The Shanghai Alumni Association of Peiping Normal University, citing that the school has a fifty-year history, currently has more than 1,300 students, and has four affiliated schools, the Ministry of Education changed the school's name to Peiping Normal College after the restoration, resulting in much less funding than other universities, making it unsustainable. They organized a Reinstatement Committee a few days ago, electing nine people including Liu Fanchi, Meng Xianzhang, and Lin Duxin as members. In addition to sending representatives to Beijing to join the Nanjing alumni in requesting the Ministry of Education to restore the original name of the alma mater, they also telegraphed classmates at Peiping alma mater and alumni associations in various places yesterday to strive together.

### Stock Exchange Resumed Trading Yesterday – Chinese Stocks Fell Across the Board – All Parties Quietly Awaiting New Ministry Order

[Our Report] The stock exchange opened yesterday amidst wavering sentiments. Both buyers and sellers engaged in an unprecedented battle, causing fluctuations in the prices of various stocks. Cantonese and Northern syndicates, as well as the yarn factory syndicate, were very active in buying. Prices rose after falling, but the cancellation of forward delivery, the yarn factory strike, huge adverse balances in national banks, and frequent telegrams reporting rising prices in Hong Kong and Shanghai finally led to a forced decline. The suggestions made by the Green Brokers Association were met with much speculation before the Ministry order arrived, giving speculators the opportunity to create rumors. It is reported that after the market closed lower yesterday, off-market trading disappeared. The stock exchange authorities were particularly strict with market access yesterday. Each broker was limited to a maximum of three people entering the market with credentials. According to the stock exchange spokesperson, this measure aims to prevent non-professionals from entering the market and disrupting prices. According to yesterday's situation, neither the stock exchange authorities, the financial and economic ministry supervisors, nor the brokers had any new measures, as they were all waiting for the new ministry order to be issued.

Early Morning

Very few spot transactions were opened, with Tongyi slightly declining, An rising to the limit, Jinglun falling to the limit, and Rongfeng remaining unchanged. When forward delivery Yongshen opened with a limit down, people panicked. Tongyi, Xinguang, Xinhua, Jingfu, Jinglun, Match, Meiya, China Silk, Xinya, Xinhe, and Qinxing all fell to the limit. Forward delivery Yongshen had a large number of transactions at the limit down, and off-market prices were reported higher. After 10:00 AM, Rongshen first rose to the limit. Numbers 14, 162, 85, 121, 65, 28, 105, 89, 106, and 153 all advanced, rising to 6,400 yuan. Numbers 142, 185, 143, 30, 231, and 152 were closed out at high prices and fell to the limit again. Numbers 162, 172, 173, 94, 129, and 155 took advantage of the low prices to advance to 6,200 yuan, and Yonggong also fell to the limit. Numbers 185, 85, 223, 224, and 65 were sold off, forcing forward delivery Yongshen down to around 6,050 yuan. Number 1622 kept buying, as did numbers 143 and 94. Later, because off-market prices were reported higher again, and there were rumors of yarn factories increasing capital, at 10:40 AM, numbers 171, 232, 35, 153, 89, 224, 149, and 105 all advanced. After 10:40 AM, forward delivery Yongshen rose to 7,080 yuan, and numbers 61, 77, 95, 107, 85, and 32 were sold at high prices and then saw downstream. Numbers 89, 180, 160, 152, 77, and 78 were more willing to move. Hong Kong telegrams rose, falling back to 6,350 yuan. Numbers 4, 35, 143, and 119 took advantage of the low prices to advance to 6,700 yuan, while number 180 and others were still closing out, struggling to close at around 6,550 yuan at noon, and slightly declining after the close. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yongshen and Xinhe slightly rose, Meiya rose to the limit, and Qinxing and Xinhua fell to the limit. Yonggong, Xinguang, and Jingfu each fell by more than 10%. Forward delivery Yongshen and Meiya slightly declined, Xinhe, Xinguang, and Yonggong fell by more than 10%, and Jingfu and Qinxing fell to the limit. Cold stocks Rongjue and Lian rose to the limit, Datong, China Silk, Match, Jinglun, and Xinya fell to the limit, and Commerce, Tongyi, and Cement fell to the limit and then recovered, each falling by more than 10%.

Afternoon

The market was still stable in the morning, with Lian and Rongfeng rising to the limit. Numbers 83, 224, 160, 222, and 155 all advanced, and forward delivery Yongshen rose to 6,710 yuan. Later, there were sudden rumors of a yarn factory strike, and numbers 154, 213, 224, 190, 65, 109, 94, 105, 185, and 180 were all sold off, causing a sudden decline. Datong, Yonggong, Cement, China Silk, Jingfu, Qinxing, Xinguang, China Textile, Tongyi, Xinhua, and Jinglun all fell to the limit, and forward delivery Yongshen even fell to 6,050 yuan. Numbers 91, 31, 14, 23, and 89 came in to advance, rising to 6,300, and number 89 also advanced, with Meiya showing a slight improvement. Unfortunately, the four banks and two bureaus had an adverse balance of 40 billion, and Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams rose again to 18 yuan. Match was suspended from trading by number 17, and numbers 199, 94, 153, 154, 36, 157, 223, 224, 4, and 183 were closed out. Ten minutes before the close, forward delivery Yongshen was also forced down to the limit. Except for Rongfeng and Lian, the whole market was black. As a result, compared to last Saturday, spot transactions, except for Yongshen, which did not have any transactions in the afternoon, and Rongfeng and Lian, which rose to the limit, all fell to the limit. Forward delivery all fell to the limit. Off-market old stocks, Zhabei Dasheng and China saw gains, Huashang Wuzhou remained unchanged, and the rest saw slight declines.

### Foreign Stocks Decline

Foreign stocks followed Chinese stocks yesterday, either rising or falling. Yisha opened at 76,000 yuan in the morning, rose to 83,000 yuan in the middle of the day, and fell back to 77,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, Hong Kong's telegraph rose again to 18 yuan, and the supply exceeded the demand, causing it to fall again to 70,000 yuan at the closing price. As a result, compared to last Friday, the steel industry slightly declined, Hanglai and Jardine Matheson fell by half a percent, British Union and Ya Beer fell by 10%, and Yisha and Ya Paper each fell by half a percent.

### Unified Prices Decline

Government bonds were only flat and weak yesterday. Unified C opened at 15,000 yuan, rose from 14,600 yuan to 15,300 yuan, and finally remained within 15,000 yuan. Number 360 had sales, and numbers 503 and 552 advanced, with transactions of about 5 million. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A and B fell by 600 yuan, C fell by 500 yuan, D fell by 300 yuan, and E fell by 800 yuan.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Cables the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus to Thoroughly Investigate Black Market Yarn Prices

The China Textile Construction Company in this city has had cotton yarn allocation prices that are far lower than market prices in previous years, and not even sufficient to cover the cost of raw cotton. Recently, yarn prices have skyrocketed and the black market is rampant. The total difference between the allocated prices and the black market prices in previous years has reached 6.7 billion yuan. However, the common people have not benefited, only enriching merchants and damaging the national treasury. Even the products of other yarn factories should be sold at negotiated prices, but most are sold on the black market and entered into the accounts at negotiated prices, further reducing government tax revenue. According to the national budget for this year, the company was assessed to pay a surplus of 400 billion yuan. Unexpectedly, it must request the national treasury to subsidize it, and it had no choice but to submit a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs a few days ago to quickly eliminate the black market. It is now known that the Ministry has cabled the city police bureau and social affairs bureau to jointly investigate the allocation status of the Textile Construction Company and the Textile Management Committee, and to thoroughly investigate the actual situation of black market yarn prices, in order to normalize yarn and cloth transactions.

### Yarn and Cloth Transport to Hankou: Manufacturer Registration Reaches 36 Companies with Over 300 Items

Since the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee (紡管會) began registering manufacturers transporting yarn and cloth to or through Hankou last week, registration has been quite active, reaching over 300 items as of yesterday. Yesterday, 36 companies registered. The committee has set this Friday as the registration deadline. Furthermore, the registration of manufacturers transporting yarn and cloth to the North will be reviewed and completed by the committee soon, and notices will be issued shortly. Qualified manufacturers will be issued certificates to present when reporting for transport, it is said.

Yesterday in the yarn market, dyeing and weaving factories showed strong demand for 20-count yarn. 42-count and 40-count fine yarns saw reduced demand because poplin manufacturing has ceased. 42-count Blue Phoenix sold for 1,240,000 yuan, only increasing by 50,000 yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse sold for 7,300,000 yuan, rising by 150,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn sold for 7,100,000 yuan, increasing by 300,000 yuan. Blue Phoenix sold for 7,200,000 yuan, rising by 400,000 yuan. 16-count coarse yarn sales were slow, and the price remained stable. The Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) opened yarn sales as usual, with prices similar to the previous period.

### Cotton Cloth Prices Soar

In the cotton cloth market, all types of cloth showed positive trends in off-exchange trading after Saturday afternoon, and industry insiders made considerable purchases. At the opening, it was heard that the Textile Construction Company's 3A Colorful Ball fine cloth and second-grade Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge, sold the previous day, were distributed by number, further exciting the market. Merchants from other provinces stationed in Shanghai rushed to buy, and speculative capital from securities firms also entered the market, causing extreme tightness and soaring prices. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth once rose to 330,000 yuan, but profit-taking caused it to fall back to 300,800 yuan in the end, a sharp increase of 23,000 yuan compared to Saturday. Various brands such as Five Blessings Colorful Ball also rose by 14,000-15,000 to 21,000-22,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, twill serge, dyed cloth, and shirting all rose sharply, from 10,000 to over 30,000 yuan.

### National Bank and Bureau Checks Show a Deficit of 18.8 Billion

[Our Newspaper] In recent days, national banks and bureaus have frequently shown deficits in check clearing. Yesterday, the deficit was 18.8 billion yuan. According to an analysis by a certain expert, this deficit is mostly due to foreign exchange remittances, government sales of materials (such as the yarn and cloth of the China Textile Corporation), and tax payments. The expert stated that as a result of recent price fluctuations, the amount of currency in circulation in the market is once again insufficient, causing deposits in banks to flow into the market. Deposits of various banks and firms in the Central Bank have recently been withdrawn, amounting to two-thirds of the total. This capital has entered the market but has not yet returned. However, the expert observed that the market's money supply is unlikely to loosen in the near future. The quota for the second period of imports has already been announced, and rumors of an adjustment to the foreign exchange rate are rampant. Therefore, many importers are rushing to settle foreign exchange early, and a large amount of legal tender is expected to return to the market successively, it is said.

### Export Promotion Committee Discusses Remedial Measures for Export Trade: Principles Established, Central Trust Bureau to Draft Implementation Measures

[Our Newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a meeting at the Central Bank yesterday morning from 10:30 AM, attended by Chen Guangfu, Liu Gongyun, Shen Xirui, Ren Sida, Chen Junren, and advisors Ma Ge and Bai Yien. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. The committee spent a long time discussing remedial measures for export trade, but no definitive conclusion was reached. The meeting will continue today. It is reported that due to domestic market prices being higher than international prices, exports of major commodities such as tung oil and bristles have stagnated recently. Merchants in various regions are requesting the authorities to purchase and remedy the situation to facilitate unified export sales. It is understood that the Export Promotion Committee has drafted several major principles for remedial measures, which have been submitted to the Central Trust Bureau to draft implementation measures. The Central Trust Bureau is currently drafting these measures, which may be submitted to the Executive Committee meeting of the Export Promotion Committee for discussion and approval today, it is said.

### Production Area Prices Soar: Rice Prices Track Upward: Flour Rationing to Resume Tomorrow

Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving in the northern and southern markets was about 10,000 dan (石). Market conditions were characterized by sharp increases in inland areas, tracking upward. Japonica and Indica rice prices rose uniformly by over 10,000 yuan. However, the flour market, after weakening, recovered and rose by 4,000-5,000 yuan. Bran factories continued operations, with goods arriving from Hankou. Actual sales continued, maintaining a stable position.

Soybean cake prices initially rose and then stabilized, increasing by 1,000 yuan. Soybeans remained sluggish.

Mung beans remained scarce and trading was slow, remaining stagnant. Red beans saw active trading, rising by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Red sorghum sales to distilleries were brisk, continuing to rise by 5,000-6,000 yuan. Corn from Qingdao continued to rise, soaring by 20,000 yuan, but eased at the close. Raw peanuts were widely sold, continuing to rise sharply by over 10,000 yuan. Sesame followed, rising by 3,000-5,000 yuan.

Furthermore, rationing of flour in this city has been suspended since last Friday, as the five flour mills, including Fuxin, have run out of their own flour. The Ministry of Food has decided that from now until the new wheat season, all flour rationing in this city will be the responsibility of the Central Trust Bureau. According to Chief Ji of the Social Affairs Bureau, the official document arrived at the city government on the 13th, and the Social Affairs Bureau only received it yesterday. Therefore, flour rationing will remain suspended today but will resume tomorrow, with a quantity of 20,000 bags, of which 10,000 bags will make up for today's suspension, it is said.

Flour and Bran Market Planned

The Shanghai Flour and Bran Commercial Guild held a meeting of member representatives at 2:00 PM yesterday. Relevant authorities from the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to attend and provide guidance, and alternate directors and supervisors were re-elected. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) A proposal to establish a flour and bran market was resolved to appoint Zhang Chao, Lu Yuanxiang, Zhou Yanchao, Li Binyuan, and 12 others to form a preparatory committee. (2) A proposal to establish a guild hall was approved in principle, and specific measures will be planned in consultation with the Retailers' Association and representatives of wholesalers and all directors and supervisors.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Tighten

Yesterday in the sugar market, white sugar saw considerable demand, and prices continued to tighten. Green and red sugars also showed positive signs. The guild set prices for Peruvian sand sugar at 426,000 to 428,000 yuan, an increase of nearly 20,000 yuan. Taichung sand sugar was at 400,000 yuan, Shantou green sugar at 270,000 yuan, and Huanggang green sugar at 265,000 yuan. Ordinary cotton red sugar was at 275,000 yuan, and Xinghua white high-grade sugar was at 385,000 to 390,000 yuan, with lower grades at 370,000 yuan. Xinghua red sugar was at 190,000 to 285,000 yuan, with lower grades at 280,000 yuan, all rising by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Hainan sugar was also quoted at 270,000 yuan, but no transactions were made.

Taiwan Sugar Corporation Considers Eliminating Negotiated Pricing System

Since the Taiwan Sugar Corporation began rationing sugar, the rationed price has been lower than the market price. However, last month, black market prices soared, exceeding the rationed price by more than double. As a result, general users did not benefit, so the company suspended rationing. Rationing to sugar merchants was resumed the week before last after adjusting the rationed price. However, the market price still far exceeds the legal profit margin, so the company is considering eliminating the negotiated pricing system and adopting a flexible policy of selling at market prices. Detailed measures are being submitted to the authorities for review.

### Auction of Old Tea for Export: Approximately 4,000 Cases Sold

[Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau previously held a public auction for over 10,000 cases of old tea for export. Amidst the current slump in exports, interest was not strong. It is now understood that Jardine Matheson, Wu Chang, and Dada Chang Tea Companies have purchased approximately 4,000 cases, while the remainder remains unsold. The foreign-owned tea market, which has been sluggish for a long time, continues to trend towards gloom, as buyers, mindful of the meager prices offered from abroad, are hesitant, and there is a sense of apprehension. On the other hand, sales of domestic tea by local shops and merchants remain stable.

### Oil Market Opens Yesterday: Red Trading Plate Stable: Oil Pressing Industry Reaches Satisfactory Agreement on Purchasing Rapeseed

The Shanghai Oil Industry Market officially opened at 10:00 AM yesterday, with a grand opening ceremony. Over a hundred people attended, including government officials, with Mayor Wu represented by Wang Guanqing, the Social Affairs Bureau represented by Ji Mingzhai, and other guests. Chairman Zhang Chao reported on the preparations for the market. Mayor Wu's representative, Wang Guanqing, then delivered a speech, urging the industry to prioritize benefiting itself, the people, and the country. Oil is a major food for the people, and it is hoped that the market will develop normally and suppress market prices. Guests then delivered speeches, and the ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM. Members of the industry entered the market and began trading on the red trading plate. Buying and selling were quite balanced, and market conditions were very stable.

Yesterday, the oil market showed little activity. Raw oil sales continued from merchants, with prices rising by another 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Soybean oil supply was still adequate, and market conditions were flat. Vegetable oil demand was sluggish, with prices falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil remained unchanged, and sesame oil saw little fluctuation.

[Our Newspaper] To request assistance from the Central Trust Bureau in purchasing rapeseed to replenish oil pressing raw materials, representatives from China Vegetable Oil Factory Zhang Decheng, Dade Xin Zhou Weibao, and Dayou Yu Xie Yuxiang, Tongsheng Tai Yu Liangji, and others visited the Central Trust Bureau yesterday to discuss implementation measures with Deputy Director Shen Xirui. The discussions were very satisfactory, and it has been decided to follow the original plan for the Central Trust Bureau to assist the oil pressing industry in promoting purchasing in rapeseed production areas such as Suzhou, Pinghu, and Wuhu to prevent the opportunity from passing and the rapeseed from falling into the hands of hoarders, forming hoarded commodities and causing raw material prices to soar. It is reported that the purchasing operation will be jointly managed by the accounting department of the Central Trust Bureau, branch directors and office directors in various regions, responsible persons from the audit department's offices in various regions, and one representative dispatched by the oil pressing industry.

Orchid and Bamboo Branch Flower Seedling Production Areas Show Signs of Shortage

According to information from merchants, this year's new orchid and bamboo branch flower seedlings have recently shown signs of shortage, so goods stored in Shanghai are not being sold cheaply and remain in conservative hands. However, actual sales are relatively rare, and there is no immediate hope for expansion.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate Expected to Rise: Raw Material Market Conditions Firm

The black market Hong Kong exchange rate is rising frequently. The only source of raw materials is Hong Kong, so sentiment is positive. Yesterday afternoon, trading was even more active, and prices of various goods were firm. Popular items such as caustic soda, N rosin, and Vaseline mostly rose, and there were no signs of weakness in the market.

### Importers and Exporters Request Cancellation of Time Limit for Settling Consignment Sales

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Importers and Exporters Guild and the Hide, Fur, Oil, and Bone Commercial Guild jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Finance yesterday regarding the national banks' time limit for settling sales of consigned goods, requesting the cancellation of the time limit. The telegram stated that Chinese merchants promote exports by using consignment sales methods, where goods are first shipped abroad and entrusted to designated domestic banks, which in turn entrust them to foreign banks for storage and safekeeping, allowing foreign buyers to inspect samples and sell at a price. Exporters and foreign buyers communicate prices by telegram, and once agreed, the domestic designated bank informs the foreign entrusted bank to collect payment and deliver the goods. This practice has been established for a long time and is convenient for both parties. Unexpectedly, in March of this year, the Central Bank suddenly stipulated that all existing export goods must be sold and settled by May 24, otherwise, the foreign designated bank would be instructed to carry out "unlimited price" sales. The news spread, and domestic exporters were at a loss. The foreign market took the opportunity to suppress prices. It is believed that if exports increase by one point and the selling price increases by one point, our exporters can settle more foreign exchange with the government. Conversely, a time limit for settlement is equivalent to ordering a cheap sale. If there is a temporary lack of buyers due to seasonal or needs-related reasons, it is tantamount to handing someone a knife, allowing exporters to be slaughtered. Our government may obtain a small amount of foreign exchange temporarily, but the impact will directly force exporters into bankruptcy and indirectly cause domestic products to stagnate.

### Artificial Silk Rationing Price Unchanged: Additional Security Deposit of 4 Million Yuan Per Case

[Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau resumed rationing artificial silk yesterday, based on one-quarter of the application volume from silk weaving and ribbon weaving companies in December of last year (including the portion of silk weaving companies' subcontracted products), totaling approximately 500 cases. This rationing is nominally a temporary loan. The price of Tianqiao brand is 5.5 million yuan per case, Jin San Ma and Dongyang brands are 5.3 million yuan per case, and Zao Ri and Gaoshan brands are 5.2 million yuan per case. In addition to paying with an immediate check, a security deposit of 4 million yuan is also required, which can be paid with a time draft. After the Executive Yuan approves the new selling price, any overpayment will be refunded, and any underpayment will be supplemented. It is reported that payment for this batch of rationed goods is due this Thursday, and delivery can be made this Saturday, it is said.

### Artificial Silk Market Weak

Yesterday, the artificial silk market was stable but weak. 120-count Gaoshan bright silk opened at 17 million yuan, and short sellers absorbed some, but the asking price gradually increased, reaching 17.7 million yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the highest asking price was 17.3 million yuan, but it finally fell back to 16.9 million yuan, down 300,000 yuan from the end of last week.

Trading in the market was still rare yesterday. 10 bales of grade C were traded in the morning, priced at 20.07 million yuan. Several bales were also traded in the afternoon, priced at 20.09 million yuan with a five-day time draft. Asking prices for other grades were similar to those of last Saturday, and there was little trading.

Yesterday, the asking price for Meiya bedding silk was 18.8 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan from the end of last week. Dachen checkered crepe fluctuated around 32,000 yuan. Someone wanted it on a deferred payment basis at 2,300 yuan. The ex-factory price of Chongdian power spun silk was 260,000 yuan, so the market price has increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Prices for other goods did not fluctuate.

### Palecas Sells Well

The circulation of feather yarn tweed in the market is quite scarce, and the selling price is extremely high, with a rather brisk trend. Striped, checkered, and solid colors are in greater demand than supply, and most are "available but not for sale." The limited inventory among merchants is only enough to meet the needs of their own retail stores. Demand for Palecas is more widespread. Number one is selling briskly at 260,000-270,000 yuan per yard, number two at 230,000-240,000 yuan, and number three at around 200,000 yuan. Xie Xin, Zhang Hua, Yin Feng, and Run Feng Xian have issued current orders. In terms of actual sales, local Chinese clothing shops have been the main buyers recently, while merchants from other provinces mostly purchased everything earlier. For Western suits, Fan Er Ding is the most popular, with light gray solid colors being the most active, and beige colors being lower in price, it is said.

### City Chamber of Commerce Schedules Meeting with Industrial Guilds

[Our Newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a meeting with various industrial guilds at 3:00 PM this Thursday to discuss: (1) Guarantee measures for importers selling key raw materials to manufacturers. (2) Revision of import and export trade measures, and how to provide revision opinions.

### Bristles Attract Interest

Rumors about foreign exchange continue unabated, and the market is speculating that the upcoming National Political Council may make suggestions for changes. Large, sensitive investors were buying bristles in the market yesterday, causing the bristle market to rise by one to two tenths. Other export commodities were also being targeted for acquisition.

### Fresh Meat Prices Rise Sharply for Days

Fresh meat prices have risen sharply, with retail prices already exceeding 620,000 yuan. The reason is the increase in taxes and production area prices. However, the city's "Lei Qi Su," a month-long vegetarian period, is approaching, so sales have decreased sharply, and weakness is on the horizon.

### Four Banks to Appropriately Increase Loan Amount

[Our Newspaper] It is reported that the planned loan for this year's spring cocoons was 120 billion yuan, as the estimated price of fresh cocoons was 400,000 yuan per dan (祖) when the plan was decided. However, due to the sharp rise in rice prices, reaching 1 million yuan per dan, the originally planned loan amount is insufficient. As a result, the responsible person of the China Sericulture Corporation consulted with the headquarters of the Four Banks in Nanjing. The Four Banks headquarters has agreed to appropriately increase the loan amount based on actual needs. Furthermore, the Silk Production and Sales Guidance Association will be urging manufacturers to pay the 10% down payment for the loan in the coming days, it is said.

### Public Burial of Martyr Zhang Xinfu

— Shenyang, 12th (Air Patrol, Northeast Press)

The burial ceremony of Martyr Zhang Xinfu, held in Shenyang on May 11, was unprecedented in its grandeur. Over 40,000 people from all walks of life participated. Women emptied the streets, and roads were blocked. Wreaths piled up like mountains, and the solemn atmosphere was difficult to describe. Recalling that on July 1st two years ago, Mr. Zhang Xinfu was appointed to take over the Fushun Coal Mine and was subsequently stabbed to death by Communist soldiers, suffering as many as eleven knife wounds. The news was shocking, and the entire country mourned his loss. In addition to his wife, Martyr Zhang also left behind three sons. The Martyr's memorial hall was set up in the Guandi Temple in Shenyang. Family memorial services were held from the 9th, public memorial services on the 10th, and the burial took place on the side of Beiling on the 11th. The tomb construction is magnificent, with towering pines and cypresses. Alas! From now on, the loyal soul will be admired by all, and will forever be mourned by future generations!

### Ten Days in Southern Yunnan

— Kunming Ten-Day Airmail Report by Special Correspondent Xu Jilian

The tin industry in Gejiu is indeed declining. Tin merchants and local gentry often yearn for the past prosperity, when there were 200,000 workers and annual production was nearly 10,000 tons. These things seem to shine only in memories. In the most depressed period, there were only a hundred or so miners left, and the total annual output was less than 200 tons. Comparing the two, it is no wonder that the tin merchants are filled with sighs, as if they were seeing the plight of a young master.

It wasn't until 1945 when several American mining experts suddenly came to Gejiu and conducted a field survey. They believed that the Gejiu tin mine had abundant reserves and great potential. Only then did they reawaken people's attention. In that year, the "gold-for-tin" method was established. In 1946, the tin industry situation slightly improved, but this was not a long-term plan. The revival of the mining industry cannot be achieved by a few experts' empty designs or temporary interests. What is important is a comprehensive and meticulous plan, massive capital, endless labor, and blood and sweat. Only in this way can the Gejiu tin industry be revived!

Gejiu Tin Industry: In Revival

Gejiu's tin production ranks only fourth in the world. Compared with Nanyang's annual production of more than 60,000 tons, it is like a small wizard meeting a great one. However, the Nanyang area is all "placer tin," while Gejiu is "vein tin." The costs are too far apart, making competition difficult. Currently, we can only try to reduce costs as much as possible and use scientific methods for mining and smelting. Otherwise, the future of China's tin industry cannot be optimistic.

Under the explanations of Chief Engineer Ni Xiangcai (a graduate of Beiyang University, a classmate of Mr. Chen Lifu, and recently attended the London Tin Conference) and Associate Manager Lü Lansheng, we began to have a strong interest in the actual engineering situation of the Gejiu tin mining area. Both of them are dedicated practitioners. Under the Yunnan Tin Industry Company, they have contributed all their energy, which is much more practical than those theorists who "talk on paper." There are two types of mine owners in Gejiu: private and public. Of course, there is a considerable distance between the two in terms of capital and methods. Private mine owners are already facing a serious crisis, with a shortage of funds and difficulty in obtaining labor. However, some people are still struggling, waiting for better days to come. The only public mine owner at the moment is the Yunnan Tin Industry Company. The conditions are certainly much better, but there are still many difficulties. The Tin Industry Company was formed in 1940 by merging the Yunnan Tin Affairs Company, the Tin Affairs Office of the Resources Committee, and the Gejiu Tin Smelting Company. It is now funded by the Yunnan Provincial Government with 40% of the shares, and the Resources Committee and the Bank of China each with 30% of the shares. The operating cost is 1 billion yuan. It currently has the Laochang, Malage New Factory, Ore Dressing Plant, Tin Smelting Plant, and Mechanical Plant. To introduce the mining and smelting of tin, in Gejiu, the traditional method occupies a very important place. It accounts for almost 90% or more of the output. This time, we also made a "cursory inspection" and are willing to provide a superficial introduction. The first task of the traditional method is drilling holes. After the mine owner finds the ore vein, they follow the route and first drill out the groove door (commonly known as the entrance). The depth of each hole tip is different, ranging from hundreds of steps to four or five thousand steps. Then, the work of exploring the mine begins inside the cave. The foremen lead the sand miners to find the ore seedlings. After discovering the ore seedlings, they start digging the waste, deciding whether to take or discard it based on the amount of mineral content. The sand miners carry packs of waste weighing 50 to over 100 pounds out of the cave. This work is extremely difficult because the passages in the mine are rugged, narrow, and winding. One has to use a cane to support themselves, walk stooped over with a coal lamp on their head, and the cave does not have ventilation and is often flooded with rainwater. Although there are ventilation and drainage facilities, the traditional method is often not sophisticated, so the sand miners often faint when climbing out of the cave, which is a miserable sight.

After the tin ore is mined, it is commonly referred to as "waste." The waste contains a lot of mud and impurities, and the composition of the pure ore is inconsistent. The second step is washing. A sluice is set up where the waste is rubbed and the ore is processed. The main equipment is the ore washing tank, the waste crushing tool, and the guard room. Most of the crushed waste is coarse, and the ore is mixed with soil and stones. Before washing, it must be crushed. The traditional method uses a stone mill pulled by horses, pouring in clear water to grind it into a mud slurry to separate the ore from the sand and soil, and then put it into the tank for rinsing.

Tin Needs to be Washed After Mining

After the crushed waste enters the tank, workers use a water scoop to rinse the ore waste, and also use a long bamboo pole to rub and rake it. In this way, the mud slurry flows out from the tank opening and into the water ditch. The heavier waste, which contains more minerals, settles in the tank. At this point, the brick tank washing work is completed. Then comes the work of leveling and washing the tank. Mud slurry and fine mineral sand are flushed into the sedimentation tank with water, and the coarser minerals are left in the tank. After separating the coarse and fine, they are placed in a dustpan and shaken on the water surface. The fine sand falls into the pond, and the coarse slag is piled up separately. When the "ore head" containing 80-90% minerals is obtained, it is put back into the leveling tank, stirred with water, and washed. If there are still coarse mineral particles, they must be ground with a horse mill. The mud slurry obtained from grinding is poured into the board tank, and scooped and washed several times to obtain 80-90% pure ore. The pure ore obtained from rubbing and washing is fine tin sand, which must be smelted in a furnace to become a whole piece of large tin. Therefore, smelting is the last step in the production of large tin.

Final Process: Tin Smelting

Smelting ore sand is calculated at 24 hours per furnace. Each furnace can smelt three shi of ore sand, requiring 3,000 jin of chestnut charcoal. After the furnace charcoal is burned, workers use iron shovels to shovel the ore sand into the soil furnace vat, which is called loading ore. Charcoal must be added each time the ore is loaded. When loading the ore, another worker pulls the bellows to blow air into the vat, making the charcoal fire burn fiercely. When the ore sand is smelting, the fire door must be opened at any time to avoid being blocked by carbon slag. The tin liquid that has already melted in the vat easily flows out from the fire door and settles in the窩子 (wozi, a depression). In this way, the chemical process of smelting tin is that after the pure ore enters the furnace, it encounters a reducing flame. The tin oxide ore is reduced by charcoal to become pure tin and carbon dioxide, which can be expressed by a chemical formula:

SnO2+C——CO2+Sn The tin liquid flowing into the 窩子 (wozi) from the fire door separates from the carbon slag. Mineral sand that is light and fine often rises with the flame and accumulates on the roof and floor, which must be cleaned and mixed with water for smelting again.

The tin liquid in the 窩子 (wozi) is scooped into the提齲 (ti ju, a ladle) and cooled to a certain degree, then transferred to the pool with an iron spoon. A small 　　 (spatula) is used to scrape the tin surface to make it smooth and glossy. After it cools and solidifies, it becomes a tin sheet, commonly known as large tin. Each sheet is one chi and two cun long, five cun wide, and two and a half cun thick, weighing about 50 kilograms.

Our visit to the traditional method of tin production in Jianjiu is roughly like this. Most private mine owners are still sticking to the old methods, working hard silently. The Yunnan Tin Industry Company is vigorously advocating new methods, trying to use scientific methods and machines as much as possible to avoid wasting labor and to achieve large-scale production. The detailed explanations of Chief Engineer Ni and Engineer Xiong Bingxin gave us a clearer concept.

Aerial Cableway: Saves Time and Effort

First, at the Malage Mine, which belongs to the Tin Industry Company, we visited the shaft they had dug, which was designed by an American engineer named Chaper. It is more than 300 meters deep. From the shaft, they open flat tunnels. Both excavation and mining use mechanical and scientific equipment.

The new method is naturally much more advanced. We entered the shaft and then turned to the flat tunnel. Although the water was gurgling in the tunnel, making it cold, electric lights have been used inside, and light railways have been laid. 　 horses are responsible for transporting the waste. Human labor is already a secondary position, and the shaft is equipped with sturdy elevators, which is very convenient for going up and down. It is not as difficult and inhumane as exploring and mining with the traditional method. The most convenient and time-saving and labor-saving thing is the aerial cableway for transporting waste. It runs from the Malage Mine along Laoyin Mountain to the sand washing plant. The total horizontal distance is 22,264 chi, and the length is 22,800 chi. On that day, the reporter traveled four and a half kilometers in the air with some novelty and fear. According to the chief engineer, besides the Gejiu Tin Mine, only the Longyang Coal Mine in the Northeast uses aerial cableways for mining in China. Unexpectedly, this trend gave the reporters a rare adventure. The washing of tin ore is particularly thorough with the new method. There are ore grinding machines, classifiers, ore washing beds, return ore belts, and centrifugal pumps. The smelting furnace is built with French firebricks, which are strong and durable. In addition, there are melting pools, soda furnaces, soda pools, ore crushers, and melting furnaces. The staff of the Tin Industry Company have highly developed their abilities. Their work efficiency and research spirit are worth praising.

However, those sand miners who are always following the difficult road on the mine, those unsung heroes, are even more worthy of being described. The reporter has contacted many sand miners and will make a special introduction.

### Inside Overseas Paradise

— Airmail Report from Leiden on the 7th

Standing in China and looking out at the ocean, one feels that the West is full of paradises. However, if one carefully considers the basic necessities of life, such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation, one will find that the internal situations vary from country to country. It is better to be content with one's current situation than to constantly compare oneself to others. We Chinese people can find both comfort and motivation in this.

The European countries that can truly satisfy people's needs are the Scandinavian Peninsula countries of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, where there is no difficulty in food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Among them, Norway is the best.

The Netherlands has no shortage of daily necessities, but tropical products from the South Seas are mostly no longer available. The restrictions on clothing textiles have been slightly relaxed since April. Due to foreign exchange restrictions, it is still difficult to travel freely. Housing is difficult to obtain and very cramped, and there is a shortage of coal in winter. France has enough food and clothing, and everything can be obtained if one takes the back door, but the cost of living is therefore very high. The coal shortage in the UK is unprecedented. The amount of food rations available in the market has been reduced compared to the war period. Housing is extremely scarce, taxes are very high, and prices are also high. Recently, the government has also tightened restrictions on the import of cigarettes in order to curb non-essential foreign exchange. It is rumored that in the Soviet Union, once the harvest season arrives this autumn, the bread rationing will be lifted. Housing is still extremely scarce, but the supply of coal and electricity is more abundant.

In Poland, the daily wage earned by each worker is only 200 波幣 (Polish currency), while a meal in a restaurant costs five times that amount.

In Italy, prices are 40 times higher than before the war in 1938, while the salary that the people can get is only 13 times higher.

In Germany, there are fewer and fewer people who work diligently because there is nothing to buy in the country. People have money but nowhere to spend it.

### 48th International Annual Fair Tour

— Airmail Report from Holland on the 8th by Hong Fu

Life's contradictions reveal magnificence, Heaven's intention is to turn worry into prosperity, Understanding the principles of fullness and emptiness and cause and effect, Spring rewards the exhaustion of winter.

Spring is like a beautiful woman looking at her face, Called upon a thousand times, it finally comes, Ice and frost have the taste of ambrosia, Clear dreams can endure bitter thoughts.

The above two poems were written by the reporter specifically for the 48th International Annual Fair (Jaarbeurs) in Utrecht, Holland. The "spring prosperity" in the poem reflects the bitterness of the winter cold. The annual fair reopens, and spring comes to the world. However, this year's exhibition was delayed by more than a month compared to the past. The length and severity of the ice season in 1947 were rare in a century. In late March, there was still snow and frost. The difficulties in the construction of the 48th annual fair's special expansion plan are all shown on the screen. The most impressive things are the pile-driving machine that automatically levels the venue and repairs the roads without manpower, the new construction method of completing the upper part before the lower part, the entire roof that was erected at the top of the column and then blown down by a strong wind, and the roof signs showing the completion of the construction of the venue sheds, either raising a small flag or inserting a large tree. Two weeks before the opening, people were working day and night to rush the construction, either bustling workers or brightly lit furnaces. The annual fair organizers invited domestic and foreign reporters to give a preview, showing that the more difficulties one encounters in life, the greater the achievements one will make. This beautiful analogy can be used to strengthen the spirit of self-reliance and struggle by borrowing the idea of "man can conquer nature," which is what those who are diligently engaged in business revival should take as a timely lesson.

Milius' Speech: Recounting the Dutch Economy

Before the opening, the general manager of the annual fair, Mr. J. Milius, gave a speech recounting the recent economic situation of the Netherlands. Summarizing its main points, there are five points that are worth studying for our country: (1) After the war, the number of workers in the Netherlands who help with production has decreased compared to before, while the number of people who do not contribute to production has suddenly increased. Among them, most of the girls married soldiers who were expeditioning to the South Seas and could receive alimony and did not need to work hard anymore. Some Dutch women married Canadian soldiers and have left the Dutch territory and cannot be forced to work. As a result, the number of female workers has been reduced by a large number. Of the men who could work hard, 130,000 have gone to the army, and 200,000 have been transferred to clerical jobs such as clerks and officials in new institutions such as the Daily Distribution Bureau, which were gradually added after the war due to more complicated laws. In total, the number of people who have lost their production capacity due to serving in the military and civil service has reached as many as 330,000, which has caused the number of male and female workers in the Netherlands who are beneficial to increasing production to be reduced by one-third compared to before the war. At the same time, the population of the eleven provinces of the Netherlands has suddenly increased to 9.5 trillion after the war, an increase of 8% compared to before the war. The things in the Netherlands were destroyed too much during the war, and these people's daily needs are lacking. However, the current production capacity of the Netherlands is only equal to 80% of the original production volume in 1938 before the war, and the number of people has suddenly increased sharply. The shortfall of 20% is equal to a shortage of 30%. (2) It is a very difficult problem to seek fixed wages without a sudden increase. Indeed, when prices rise, wages have to be increased, and if wages are increased at will, prices will rise with them. To prevent this malpractice, the Dutch government immediately came up with a solution, which is to have each factory rush to produce cost-effective and ordinary-quality products that are not exquisite but are specially designed for daily household needs, such as glassware or pottery, or wooden 槃榼 (pan ke, trays and boxes), and to promote mass production so that those who are poor can afford to buy them. This is a way to secretly prevent prices from rising by drawing firewood from under the cauldron.

Rapidly Increase Production, Hoping to Occupy Overseas Markets

(3) For the sake of exporting Dutch products, it is necessary to carefully measure the country's labor cost with that of foreign counterparts and seek the most favorable sector for promotion. However, Dutch businesses have been absent from the international market for five years during and after the war, and their original position has been seized by other countries. For example, the world has not seen Dutch cheese for a long time. Producers in Australia often rise up to replace them. It is not easy for Dutch products to return to their original state. Fortunately, neighboring Germany has not been able to export goods recently. Dutch businesses know the opportunity and take advantage of the time. They must catch up quickly and seize the position that Germany has in the international market. According to them, Europeans often compare the Chinese, who are good at doing business, to the Dutch from the East. If the Chinese want to gain a position in the world market, they should also take advantage of the fact that Japanese goods are not yet able to be exported in large quantities and take the lead. If they miss this opportunity, it will be too late. (4) Those who are engaged in commerce should have a fast and flexible production capacity in order to occupy more overseas markets. The Netherlands has recently been drawn into the vortex of the European war. The machines that it has always relied on for production have been damaged or lost during the war, or those that remain have become obsolete. It is not easy to compete with others in production. If a workman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools. Foreign exchange cannot be obtained in large quantities, and new and profitable machines cannot be purchased at will. Production based on simple and crude methods is slow. How easy is it to seek to increase exports and exchange foreign exchange to purchase new machines? (5) The new strategy for overseas trade is like the wool of England, the linen of Ireland, the perfumes (transliterated as Darfum) and fashions of France, the silver ornaments of Denmark, and the glass industry of Sweden. Most of them unite the national industries together and work together in the Americas. In this way, communication and publicity consume less and achieve greater results. Many 　 are easy to lift. The Netherlands is delighted and still wants to follow suit. China's financial resources are even weaker, and it cannot afford to fight alone in the siege of the crowd.

More Than 2,500 Participating Units

At the same time, visiting the venue, it is estimated that 2,514 companies from the industrial and commercial circles of foreign countries competed to participate in this year's annual fair. The area occupied has increased to 33,815 square meters, which is the grandest spectacle that has never been seen in the past 47 sessions. There are 500 companies that were missed due to late registration and full quota. In addition to the 1,380 companies in the Netherlands itself, there are also 19 countries from abroad participating in the pre-competition at the venue. Specifically, there are 268 companies from the UK, 201 from the US, 148 from Switzerland, 147 from Belgium, 137 from France, 118 from the Czech Republic, 32 from Sweden, 29 from Denmark, 20 from Italy, and the remaining from Germany, Australia, Hungary, Canada, Luxembourg, Norway, Egypt, Australia, Poland (i.e. Jewish), and Portugal, each with a few companies.

In the venue, the textile venue and the toy exhibition, both of which are bright and magnificent, are the best examples of the greatness of the annual fair.

The annual fair's "reporter" banquet was held in the Hotel Noord-Brabant, a 360-year-old store in the Northern Wilderness. The hotel is magnificent, built in the 光緒乙巳 (Guangxu Yisi) year 42 years ago. It has been well decorated and looks new. There were many witty remarks during the conversation. Mr. A. Schilp, chairman of the Dutch National Journalists Association, said that like the new Grand Theater in Luotang, which has risen to promote the prosperity of the entire city, and like the annual fair banquet, which brings together famous figures from the business community, 　 there are excellent poems from our colleagues in the press, reflecting each other's brilliance, both of which show the commonality and convergence of economy and culture. The next day, my poem and Mr. Bei's words were published in the 大應鄉 Groop Arobem Daily.

Visiting the Annual Fair: Like Reading a Book

In my opinion, visiting the annual fair is like reading an encyclopedia. The newer and more unusual of the textile 呂 (lü, textiles) is nylon, which is still woven from glass silk. It has a wide range of uses. Glass silk women's stockings have been seen in the market. The product is better than ordinary silk stockings. The sound of running is slightly excessive, and it is not easy to break through. However, you must choose to buy the one with a good brand. It is a pity that the quality of glass silk is very brittle. If you accidentally touch the corner of the suitcase near your leg when you go out, it is very easy to be scratched. Do not wear these glass silk stockings too close to the fire. For example, if you are standing by the stove in winter and suddenly stand up and go outdoors, the sudden change of hot and cold air is very likely to break the stockings. Stockings that are not worn at night should be soaked in water and dried in the morning. They will be completely dry in one hour. The newer one is Plastic, a formed substance invented in the United States. One type of formed substance that can be thinned into silk for weaving is called Cogon in English. It is dyed in different colors and is not afraid of extreme heat or cold. It is quite suitable for the subtropical China. Cogon is smooth and not subject to water or oil contamination. If it is stained with floating dust 　, it can be removed by wiping it with a damp cloth. There is also a type of formed substance called Polythene (i.e. glass ancestor). The texture is very light, as thin as paper, as soft as silk, as bright as glass, not stiff, windproof, waterproof, oil and water resistant, easy to wipe, and not subject to damage from high heat or extreme cold. It is made into raincoats or rain hats, worn over ordinary clothes and hats, without obscuring the patterns and brilliance of the clothes. Used as a tablecloth surface guard, it is like a beautiful brocade lining under a glass table, with dazzling brilliance.

Colorful: Expressing International Trade

The International Textiles monthly magazine published by 涵塘市 (Hantang City) is 36 centimeters high and 26 centimeters wide. A large row of holes is drilled at the binding on the left side, and "formed substance" spring wires, which are thick like iron wires and dyed in various colors, are passed into the holes like quick rings to form a loose-leaf book. In English, it is called Spiral binding. In Chinese, it can be called 蔦蘿本 (Niao Luo Ben, a vine book) to beautify its name. In the monthly magazine, the United Tie Manufacturers' "彩鳳自天來 (Cai Feng Zi Tian Lai, the colorful phoenix comes from heaven)" advertisement is a symbol of today's new world trade. It not only has colorful colors, expressing the ideal wonder, but also cleverly combines the legends of the gods and phoenixes in Eastern and Western civilizations. The Holland Shipong and Trading semi-monthly magazine, which promotes the beauty of the water town landscape, promotes the export business, and its charts are detailed and comparable. The women's shoe section of the annual fair is next to the textile door. Some people say that this corner is a paradise for women. Women always look at people from head to toe, and they like to beautify their shoes, which is roughly the same in China and abroad. The more beautiful Dutch women's shoes always use Swedish leather peau de 　　　 de, which is as light as silk and as fine as wool, dyed in light blue, dark blue, olive green, red, gray, and cyclamen red, which is a red with a slight blue undertone, seizing the latest colors in fashion. In Western society, women's clothing values the harmonious combination with shoes, so it is not too much for a woman to have ten pairs of new shoes. This will make the poor scholars in the countryside wonder, and as the trend progresses, a country's productivity and ideological vision must also keep up. If you know how to retreat but not how to advance, it is like seeking to be isolated from the world. There are types of 　 (suffocation due to overeating). In addition, what can be seen in the chemicals and West Leaf doors, such as the Roxane pharmaceutical factory named after a beautiful woman, makes Agre-Tonicum, a happy tonic wine, which is mostly extracted from liver essence. However, tropical plants, which have always been used to improve health and hygiene, cannot be obtained in large quantities for a while. This is truly a unique regret in the Netherlands today. The Groningen-based Pacto-pharm makes small boxed mouth fresheners to moisturize the lips and help with clear conversation, which is helpful for socializing, and its brand name is the Chinese word "崑崙 (Kunlun)," with a simple mountain in the picture, and fine dots of snow covering it. I lingered in front of their room, reluctant to leave. Someone asked me about the Chinese meaning of Kunlun, and I replied with "Groote mysterie (great mystery)." A tour of the international event is sometimes questioned, so I touch on it. (Photos by Hong Fu)

Spring and Autumn

### American News Agency Record Concert

— Liang Youyan

Phonograph record concerts have long been popular in the West and Japan, but in China, they are still a very new thing.

This concert is convenient to hold and can introduce the works and performances of world-renowned masters, both deceased and currently active. Its significance is more cultural and educational than purely entertaining. The concert prepares a program for you and explains it to you one by one. Closing your eyes and listening quietly, it feels as if you are in a grand concert. Although the sound is reproduced by machine, it still makes you feel that it is living art.

On the evening of the 16th, I participated in the record concert of the American News Agency. It allowed me to hear the performance of the world-famous orchestra (NBC Symphony Orchestra) and famous pieces conducted by the contemporary master Toscanini.

That day, pieces by three great masters, Mozart, Schubert, and others, were played, with explanations provided by Mr. Spielman of the American Embassy. Before the playing, the room was filled with Chinese and foreign music fans, but it was so quiet that even people's breathing could be heard, which demonstrated their musical understanding and passion for art.

What I loved most was the second part—Mozart's Concerto for Flute and Harp. I haven't been able to hear this piece for a long time. The flute is like a violin, but its sound is softer and brighter than the violin; the harp is like a piano, but it is crisper and livelier than the piano, with long-lasting reverberations. This may be because there are not many pieces for flute and harp concerto, and there are not many melodies as magnificent and brilliant as Mozart's, and it is not easy to hear harp performances in Shanghai.

The harp is the most primitive instrument, and due to repeated reforms, although its use is not as wide as the piano, its "status" is obviously no lower than the piano. Currently, it is not easy to find harp masters in Shanghai.

Therefore, in my country's musical "responsiveness," I cannot express how impressed I was with this program. During the intermission, I made a distorted criticism: "This piece is better than the one just now!" Unexpectedly, a foreign friend sitting next to me immediately corrected me seriously: "At most, you can only say that you like this one more. As for which of these famous pieces is better, it is impossible to make a light judgment."

But I was indeed fascinated by this flute and harp concerto.

Returning from the record concert, I only feel that we music lovers are too hungry! We are eager to have more opportunities to hear the music of famous masters and orchestras. "A fleeting moment departs this earthly realm, this regret remains long in the Huangpu River;

### Xuan in the Spring River

— Yuan Yuan

"A fleeting moment departs this celebration of life, this regret remains long in the Huangpu River; tears are shed repeatedly, future generations will pay respects at the Fuchun River."

This is a couplet I wrote in memory of Mr. Yu Mantuo. Mr. Yu was ambushed and killed by enemy agents in Shanghai in November of the 28th year of the Republic of China. At that time, I was in Hong Kong, and the bad news arrived during a typhoon, with violent winds and rain, and the sky as dark as night. Later, at the public memorial service in Shanghai, I sent this couplet. It wasn't until the late spring of the 36th year of the Republic of China, eight years later, that I had the opportunity to pay my respects at the Fuchun River. The scenery of the Fuchun River is still so beautiful, but the Songjun Villa by the Fuchun River no longer has the splendor of the pavilions of the past. Broken walls and tiles depict the scars of war. The owner of this Songjun Villa was Mr. Yu Mantuo. His younger brother, Dafu, also died in a foreign country in this war. Returning to the old place, how could I not repeatedly shed tears?

Originally, my so-called repeatedly shedding tears was just a saying. At that time, Guangfu had already died in Kunming, and then I received the news of Mantuo's death. To repeatedly shed tears was nothing more than for my old father and for Mantuo. Unexpectedly, on this trip back to Zhejiang, I would also have to shed tears for Dafu. The green mountains remain, the clear waters flow forever, but the people we knew so well are no longer here. Looking at the clear river water, looking at the quiet Crane Mountain, how can I not be moved to tears?

The people of Fuyang, to commemorate these two Mr. Yus, built a cenotaph for Mantuo at the foot of Mount Yu on the 16th of last month, and also built a memorial碑 for Dafu. Originally, Dafu had his own reasons to be commemorated. The establishment of this monument only expresses the people of Fuyang's remembrance and respect for Dafu. As for Mr. Mantuo's noble character and dedication to the country, his sacrifice in this national war is indeed a heroic story that will be passed down for thousands of years. Now that the people of Dangyang have held a public funeral for Mantuo, the traitors who murdered Mr. Yu have not yet been brought to justice. Looking at the new tomb at the foot of Mount Yu, how can we not be filled with emotion again?

Before his death, Baotuo had a close friendship with Mr. Zhang Xingyan. At that time, Mr. Xingyan planned a trip to Liaoshen, and Baotuo wrote a poem to send him off. I can't remember the whole poem, but the first few sentences are still deeply imprinted in my mind: "In old age, relying on others, striving to be strong, expecting to recognize the charred tong wood after leaving; knowing that the elders can discuss state affairs," Since the people publicly buried Mantuo on Crane Mountain, Mr. Xingyan deeply remembered their old friendship and wrote the inscription for the cenotaph. With words of boat-like wisdom, and mountains and rivers as long-lasting as life, I imagine that when Mr. Xingyan put pen to paper, he must have been filled with emotions and shed tears, weeping together for the country and the nation.

### "The Past"—A Sad Reflection

— Xu Jin

Although it is still spring chill, peach blossoms still bloom all over the branches. After a spring rain, the garden is as refreshing as if it has been showered. The red flowers and green leaves are even more charming. Sparrows and birds have all perked up their tongues. With the spring breeze, the peach blossoms are listening attentively, but cannot help but shed a few pink tears, as if regretting that this rich and colorful spring scenery will be quietly buried along with the cold air!

On Weideman Road, a group of young men and women are strolling and enjoying the spring scenery, with a wisp of annoying spring feeling in their hearts.

Ten years of deep impressions stirred up sad reflections in her mind again: short, ten-year-old shadows!

She and Xin were happily touring a private cemetery. They walked over the small stone bridge in the garden. The stream flowed slowly, and roses and lilacs exuded a intoxicating fragrance. Winding around a small stone mountain, they saw the standing stone tablet in front of them. A beautiful girl's portrait was embedded on the tablet. Two long braids hung down from her shoulders to her chest. Her affectionate eyes showed the melancholy she was forced into by her environment from between her delicate eyebrows. Her name was engraved on the stone tablet, along with her life story. Qiu Li, who entered a convent at the young age of ten, recited the Bible with the nuns every day or prayed. After a short half-year, she died of acute meningitis. After reading the epitaph, she couldn't help but feel a surge of sadness in her heart. She didn't understand why this little child was sent to a monastery.

She pondered silently, unable to find an answer. Xin挽ed Miao's arm, left the stone tablet, and walked over the small stone bridge. The roses and lilacs still exuded a strange fragrance, and the water in the stream still flowed slowly and quietly. The little birds in the flowers flapped their feathers and flew back into the lush forest.

The old man guarding the cemetery came towards the garden with a long bamboo pipe in his mouth. She asked him to tell the story of Qiu Li. The old man thought for a while, and then murmured:

"Qiu Li's mother was a famous and talented woman, but she fell in love with a young man and gave birth to Qiu Li. Because she was not tolerated by her family, she was driven out. Her love with the young man was somehow cut off, and later she drifted to a bird island and finally committed suicide by jumping into the sea. The abandoned Qiu Li was led by a nun, so she became a saint in the convent..."

Ah! Child! It turned out that she was bearing the cross for her parents, imprisoning her innocent and lively heart, and imprisoning her in a quiet and deep courtyard.

After listening to the old man's narration, she leaned sadly against Xin, as if sobbing.

However, after ten years of trauma and torture to that sensitive and sentimental heart, she 重游 old place today, and one grass and one of the cemetery is no longer looking for traces of the past. Beside the rubble trampled by the enemy,缘茵 and wildflowers have covered the surroundings. She gazed at the blue sky after the rain and took a long breath: "The Past" is just a deep dream!

### Madonna and Child

The Madonna and Child is a representative ivory carving work from the late 13th century. Most carvings of mothers and children are seated, but this work makes use of the shape of the ivory to create a standing statue. The carving is delicate, and the expression is particularly good. The crown, hair, and lace of the cloak are all covered with gold, and the crown is inlaid with colorful gemstones and pearls. Except for the muscular parts, which are ivory in color, the rest are dyed in light colors, which is calm, elegant, and very unique. It is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. The French regard it as a "national treasure." (Liu Shi)

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 513

— Ye Jingfeng

"Hello!" He hoped that this call was from Li Ming or Shouyi, he could use the conversation to create an objective condition. But unfortunately, the call was in Japanese, from Zheng Yan, and the tone was very nervous and anxious. As a result, He Jian's existing feelings were immediately transferred to another front.

This phone call took a considerable amount of time. Under the questions and answers, He Jian hurriedly grabbed paper and pen and carefully wrote down some notes. The content of the phone call was also quite complicated. Zheng Yan used various hidden words and various everyday topics to explain the complicated news in detail; and told He Jian that he still had to wait for other news and could not get away for a while.

Based on the key points recorded by He Jian, there are three main points:

First, according to the news received by "〇十二" in Tokyo, as decided by the General Staff Headquarters military conference, Hasegawa Kiyoshi has been officially promoted to Commander of the Navy for the invasion of the mainland. His two major fleets, the 10th and 11th, including the 5th Torpedo Squadron, and the frontline 10th Seaplane Squadron, etc., have all been fired up and prepared, waiting only for Konoe to sign the departure order. It is expected that before dawn the next day, they will march mightily to the economic heart of China, with the final goal of a "treaty under the city" in Nanjing!

Second, Matsui Iwane has been appointed Commander of the Expeditionary Force. His first instruction is based on the "Secret of Eight" plan, ordering the "latent" and "overt" military offensives in the Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Wuhan areas to be launched simultaneously at the auspicious time of "dawn" on August 1st (mainland time), limiting the occupation range of the predetermined plan within two weeks, forcing the "current Central Government of China" to yield!

Third, Kenji Doihara, who calls himself "Lawrence of Arabia," the spy mastermind of the orchid organization, is dissatisfied with the current Japanese spy network organization, so he contacted Isogu Kensuke, one of the military brain trust, and Torataro Kisaka, the head of the Oriental Executive Department of the Black Dragon Society, to jointly petition the General Staff Headquarters and Konoe, intending to reorganize the spy agency. He said that as long as the General Staff Headquarters approves this proposal, he has the ability to carry out a general liquidation in the entire spy organization; using intimidation and assassination as weapons to achieve his goal of unifying the organization.

The first two pieces of news clearly indicate that the flames of war between China and Japan are imminent. He Jian has always been responsible for eliminating this war. Now, this great disaster has become a reality with a 99% certainty. It goes without saying that he feels extremely guilty that all his efforts have been in vain. The third item, in particular, is a personal terror; if Doihara really achieves the goal of reorganization, the first to be crushed will naturally be He Jian himself and his secret organization. In other words, from now on, it will be impossible for him to continue to operate as before, using the communication mechanism for various counter-espionage activities. Not only that, Doihara may have some awareness of his activities, at least, He Jian is a thorn in his side; this "liquidation" move may not be a fatal bomb aimed at He Jian. In this way, not only will He Jian's career be wiped out, but even his life will be in Doihara's hands. Even Pingzi's unexplained disappearance in Shanghai this time may not be a warning issued by the enemy.

### Water Shadow

— Youqin

When you lower your head and see your reflection in the clear stream, what thoughts do you have? The clear sky, white clouds, and the inverted images of mountains and tree branches set off your clear face. Do you feel lonely? Mysterious? A leisurely poetic flavor? A serene philosophical meaning? Please tell me!

"People do not look at themselves in flowing water, but in still water." Of course, water cannot show you a clear face when it is flowing, and at the same time, your heart cannot be still, so you naturally cannot see yourself and all the things that set off your appearance.

Poets are accustomed to using phrases such as autumn water eyes. The eyes observe the water, the water observes the heart. If the water is clear, the eyes are clear, and the heart is clear, then everything is clear. Conversely, if there is turbidity, then everything is turbid; if there is an obstacle, then everything is obstructed.

When I was a child, I read Aesop's Fables: A dog walked across a bridge with a piece of meat in its mouth. Seeing another dog in the water also holding a piece of meat in its mouth, it became greedy and barked loudly. Unfortunately, the meat in its own mouth was also lost because of this. This dog's eyes were not obstructed, and the water under the bridge was also clear, but unfortunately the dog's heart was turbid. As a result, both the eyes and the water lost their function. The real became an illusion, and the illusion became a fork in the road. What does the dog know? How could it not feel regret after barking?

When people choose horses, they often say, "You need to keep your eyes open!" In fact, what's the use of just having bright eyes! The sharper the eyes, the more one cannot help but be one's own master. There seem to be very few people in this world who can be described as "the door of the minister is like a market, the heart of the minister is like water." The so-called "like water" is of course like clear water. Only when it is truly "as clear as water" can one see things and see the heart. Otherwise, one will inevitably be like the dog in Aesop's fable seeing the reflection of meat.

The Shurangama Sutra says, "The Moonlight Child said, I remember in the past, there was a Buddha named Water Heaven, who taught the Bodhisattvas to practice water contemplation and enter samadhi. At that time, I first achieved this contemplation, but only saw the water and did not see my body. I once practiced meditation in a Bhikkhu's room. My disciple peeked into the room through the window and only saw clear water everywhere in the room, and saw nothing else. The child was ignorant and took a tile and threw it into the water, making a splashing sound, looked around, and left. After I came out of meditation, I suddenly felt a pain in my heart. At that time, the child came forward and said the above thing. I then said, if you see the water again, you can immediately remove the tile. The child obeyed the teaching. Later, when he entered meditation, he opened the door and removed it. I came out of meditation again, and my body was as before."

We are not meditating monks and have not practiced "water contemplation," but we cannot put any pebbles in the heart water, just as we cannot put any dust in the eyes. Throwing tiles into the water is like throwing them into the heart. We must ask the child who threw the stone pebbles to immediately open the door and remove the pebbles. "The one who tied the bell must untie it." Only in this way can we make "the body as before."

I don't understand any Buddhist principles, nor do I have any intention of studying Buddhism, but when I see water, I observe my heart through water. I hope that when I look at my reflection, no child will throw tiles into the water, disrupting my clear face, as well as the clear sky, white clouds, mountain peaks, tree branches, and other signs that set it off, so that I can clearly see myself.

"Where is not me when I lower my head? All four directions share this sky in the water." Su Zizhan's line of poetry is worth savoring after all.

### Woodpecker Chapter

— Mengnong

"Sharp claws and strong beak, busy pecking under the setting sun. Though the forest is nearly exhausted, what harm is it to have an empty belly? Small in shape passing the locust alley, loud voice near the thatched hall, how can it be like swallows and sparrows, only knowing how to occupy the sorghum." - "Compendium of Materia Medica".

April is here, and you, the doctor of the forest, are here too, bringing the sound of pecking!

Listen! The whole forest is filled with the sound of pecking! Although I don't know where you are, I do know that wherever the trees are, that is where the footsteps of you, the lovely doctor of the forest, have reached.

By the sound of pecking, I can trace your figure: the red hair on your majestic head, the dark green tail feathers, the peach-colored face, the hooked long claws, the needle-like tip of your tongue. Most vivid and moving is that you often reveal your bright red crotch, or spread your dark green wings, constantly and repeatedly making the sound of pecking, like a monotonous drumbeat, but in fact it is heavy, clear, and refreshing!

Tell me, you mysterious doctor of the forest! How are you endowed with the power of music, pecking, pecking, in the middle of the dense forest, in the middle of the dead wood, so monotonous, but so heavy, clear and refreshing? Did you fly down from the top of "Mount Buzhou"? Did you fly down from the "Country of Suiming"? Did you drift out from the "City of the Sun and Moon"?

These imaginations are not hanging in the air. I see the ancient historical records, which have already written a reliable biography for you thousands of years ago. "Lushi" says: "At the top of Buzhou, there is Yicheng, where the sun and moon fire do not reach, and there is no distinction between day and night. There was a sage who traveled to the City of the Sun and Moon and arrived in Nan锤. There is a base, and the bird pecks its branches, then it spontaneously ignites. The sage was inspired by this, so he looked up at the star-shaped heart and took it to make fire, making drills and changing fire with five kinds of wood." In this way, I imagine that you may be the guide of Suiren; no, you may be the incarnation of Suiren? Although I saw in an old ancient myth called "Shi Yi Ji" the "Country of Suiming" that "does not know day and night," it is said that there is Suimu there, and birds peck its branches, and fire flashes out from the branches. It is also said that a sage, inspired by the bird, began to imitate it and discovered the method of making fire from hammer wood, which became the origin of the historically famous Suiren. But this is, after all, a myth. How can I regard myths as credible history? Although you are not a god, you are a concrete existence. I have personally seen your reality, heard your pecking sound, and appreciated your work!

Your monotonous yet clear and refreshing pecking sound evokes my yearning for another god in Greek mythology. Perhaps he is your dear foreign brother, his name is Prometheus. It is said that for the survival of mankind, he did not hesitate to challenge the heavenly emperor and boldly became a fire thief, bringing fire from heaven to the earth, to the poor human world, and thus suffered a harsh sentence that was both unprecedented in heaven and rare on earth. He was finally struck on a desolate rock, and his precious flesh and blood were fed to greedy, numb, insidious, and vile livestock! These magnificent and tragic pictures are all transformed into their original forms by your clear pecking sound.

Your pecking sound may be a cry full of compassion and kindness. Are you afraid of hurting the good trees in the world! Are you not afraid of fatigue as you fly around the forest? Oh! Are you looking for the trees that are already or easily infested with insects? In the blink of an eye, those trees that are already or easily infested are detected by your keen vision, hearing, and smell. Only then do you use your long tongue, strong claws, and sharp beak to hook out the insects, not even letting go of the stubborn larvae. In the sound of pecking, no pests can hide. From this, we can see your true kindness and see the sacred action you are performing like Prometheus!

At the same time, you also possess the same magnificent spirit as Prometheus. When you have pecked out all the insects in one place, you flap your wings and fly away—flying outside the mountains, or flying to the other side of the sea. In order to peck out all the insects in the world, you have no fixed abode and no time to warm your seat. You just wander everywhere, wander, wander. Therefore, your pecking sound keeps buzzing and echoing everywhere!

The pecking sound echoes at the edge of the sky, echoes at the corner of the sea, echoes on the mountain peaks, echoes on the treetops, and at the same time, echoes in my heart and echoes at the tip of my pen.

"Peck, peck"... "Peck, peck"...

Monotonous yet clear and refreshing sound!

### Starting from the Prosecutor's Extortion

— Xuzhou

Luo, a prosecutor of the Yongjia Local Court, recently colluded with his wife's younger brother to extort a set of wooden furniture, a watch, a congratulatory banner, and more than three million yuan in cash from the criminal Qu Yushu, before approving bail and release. The title of the news report was "Knowing the Law and Breaking the Law." In fact, how could a court prosecutor be merely a law-knower? A judicial officer who breaks the law is customarily subject to a higher penalty.

There are many stories about corruption in history. It is said that the late Yuan Dynasty was the era when the wind of corruption prevailed. According to Mr. Wu Han's research, this was because the Mongolian Semu people were muddled and did not understand what "honesty" meant at all. Therefore, at that time, there were particularly many reasons for demanding money; when high officials took office, the lower-level officials had to pay "greeting money" when they met them, and "flower money" was demanded for no reason at all, "festival money" was given on festivals, "birthday money" was given on birthdays, "routine money" was given for managing affairs, "human relationship money" was given for sending off and welcoming, "departure money" was given for servants to arrest people, and "official business money" was given for going to the government to file a lawsuit. With so many reasons for demanding money, the common people all became the fishy smell on the mouths of corrupt officials. It is said that in the past, palace maids in the imperial palace inevitably stole men. A stout man would often be made skinny and eventually be driven out. The weak man who was driven out was seen by ordinary people as "medicine residue"—the medicine was eaten by the ladies, and the medicine residue was also dumped out. Similarly, the common people in the eyes of corrupt officials are by no means human beings with all five sense organs and four limbs, but only purses. If you squeeze them, you may be able to dig out a few big coins. Although there are many reasons for demanding money in hell, I wonder if you must pay "bail money" when a criminal is released on bail? If so, then the extortion by Yongjia Prosecutor Luo is imitating the story of the Mongolian Semu people at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, alas!

Free Talk

### How Many Women Are Losing Their Chance to Marry

— Ye Run

Recently, I attended an alumni association meeting and we talked about many old times. Principal Guang Sheng asked the alumni to fill out a form, which included a section for marital status. As a result, it was discovered that among our graduating class, only two-fifths were married. We have been out of school for ten years, and our average age is over thirty.

Why are there so many women losing their chance to marry? Having received higher education is certainly one reason. Among our group of middle school classmates, some went on to receive university or specialized education. These people have a narrower range when choosing a spouse, and because the period of higher education is longer, they also delay some time. However, most classmates returned home after graduating from middle school, or entered the business world. The marriage prospects for these people should be broader, but the result is the same difficulty.

The responsibility for losing the chance to marry certainly does not lie with the women themselves. They do not have overly high standards. At the same time, in terms of their talent, appearance, character, they do not have to worry about not being pursued. The problem seems to lie with the men. In the ten years since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the life of displacement and turmoil has made men afraid to marry. In the midst of war and chaos, even those already married are inevitably separated, let alone adding the burden of a family. This is in terms of the environment.

As for the economic aspect, the impact is even greater. From the mid-stage of the Anti-Japanese War until now, prices have continued to rise, making life increasingly difficult. If a young man does not have a particularly good income, he can only take care of himself and does not have the capital to start a family. This situation is particularly obvious in Shanghai. Not to mention anything else, just the issue of housing is enough to make a young man lose the courage to marry. If he wants to marry, he must live separately from his parents and find (at least) one room. Finding a room now is so difficult, not to mention decoration and furniture.

"With the Japanese devils not yet defeated, how can we have a home?" This kind of mentality was unavoidable during the Anti-Japanese War, and should have disappeared after the victory, but some young people hold to the principle that "with a career yet to be established, how can we have a home?" Still others lost their education during the Anti-Japanese War and now need to make it up, which also makes them reluctant to marry. These mentalities, combined with the above-mentioned economic and environmental reasons, have caused young men to delay marriage, delaying the best years of many sisters. Is this loss borne only by the sisters? I'm afraid not. Furthermore, should modern young people succumb to the above-mentioned reasons and just put marriage on hold? What are the advantages and disadvantages of putting it on hold like this? The author hopes that people who care about social issues will pay attention to this.

### The Origin of Various Cold Drinks

— Zhong Li

Iced coffee was first created by the Abyssinians. They roasted coffee beans, coarsely ground them into powder, brewed them into a drink, and added ice that was stored for half a year, thus creating the first iced coffee. It was not until the 12th century that the Arabs learned this method, and it took the English another three hundred years.

According to Marco Polo's "Book of Marvels", written in 1275 during the Yuan Dynasty, he ate frozen cakes in China.

Iced chocolate was first invented by the Mexicans, several centuries before the Spanish forcibly invaded Mexico in the 16th century.

Iced water became a cooling product for wealthy Romans in the middle of the 1st century, but they did not know how to make ice. They only built huge ice cellars to store it.

### Looking at Society from Suicides

— Tang Shan

The Municipal Police Department announced the suicide cases for April, among which the vast majority were due to financial difficulties, accounting for 26%. If we expand the two reasons for suicide, family disputes and illness, to include the item of financial difficulties (because many families do indeed have disputes due to financial difficulties, and illness is undoubtedly mostly caused by economic poverty), then the proportion of suicides also expands to 67% (see the local news column of various newspapers on the 17th). What a terrible social phenomenon this is!

This statistic tells us a second point to note, which is that most suicides are young people, with those aged 19 to 29 accounting for 46%. The third noteworthy point is that most suicides are educated. Combining secondary education and elementary education, suicides among the educated account for 56%.

What does this statistic illustrate? In a word: it is the current unemployment problem of educated youth, and it is a rather serious problem. This is also confirmed by the results of the Shanghai Employment Agency of the Ministry of Social Affairs regarding the registration and introduction of unemployed youth.

Life is the only value in life. Everything else arises from the value of life, so suicide is by no means what people want. But when life is impossible to struggle, life not only loses its meaning, but also loses its motivation. Even if you don't commit suicide, you will be killed. The difference is only a short distance in time. Strictly speaking, those who die of hunger and cold, and those who die prematurely due to malnutrition, are also a kind of suicide, only chronic, invisible, and bloodless.

We have said that life is the most precious; and the life of young people, especially the life of educated young people, is even more precious. Today, young people are destroying their most precious lives, and the pain is naturally incomparable, and the sadness is unimaginable. This is not only the loss of Zhang San and Li Si's lives, but also a disaster for society and the nation. Because for a young educated person in their twenties or thirties, society has invisibly shouldered a considerable burden for their education. Now that they are dead, from the perspective of society, it is equivalent to a completely losing business deal. If this business deal continues to lose money, then the merchant will have to go bankrupt completely!

The large number of suicides among educated youth shows on the one hand that the society is in a slump, leaving young people with no way to make a living; on the other hand, it shows that Chinese education is bankrupt, and young students cannot stand on their own feet in society. To tell the truth, the current educated youth, they can neither pull a cart nor carry a load on their shoulders. Speaking of technology, they have no special skills. In this way, to avoid unemployment, they must have special personal connections.

Today, the path of educated youth is very narrow. Our demand for struggle and opening up a path cannot be achieved by empty words of insisting on struggle. Society should be stable, and education should be improved. Most importantly, we must not become unproductive vagrants, but must be hard-working bees. With work, there will be a livelihood, and it is hoped to improve the livelihood, so that suicide can be reduced.

### Remembering Sheng Xuanhuai

— Ban Shuai

Sheng Xuanhuai was the most corrupt official of the late Qing Dynasty. He spent lavishly during his lifetime, and after his death, he left tens of millions to his descendants, which was shocking at the time. It is said that Sheng was promoted by Li Hongzhang, which is true, but the reason why Sheng was able to be in such a lucrative position and supervise the national railways was not so much due to Li's power, but to Zhang Zhidong's power. (Wang Yanglu details the matter.) After the Sino-Japanese War, the prestige of Li Hongzhang was greatly diminished, and it was fashionable for the court and the public to attack the Li faction. Sheng, as Li's confidant, was attacked even more vigorously. Therefore, there was an imperial decree to remove him from Tianjin Railway and order the ministers of the Northern and Southern Oceans to investigate and report. At that time, Wang Wenshao was the minister of the Northern Ocean and secretly shielded Sheng, wanting to exonerate him, so he ordered Sheng to visit Zhang Zhidong to plead for mercy. At that time, Zhang was the minister of the Southern Ocean. When Sheng arrived in Hubei, he was just about to stammer out his request when Zhang stopped him. The next day, he showed Sheng two draft memorials, one impeaching him and the other recommending him. Sheng asked what he meant. Zhang replied, "If you can take over the Hubei Railway Bureau for me, I will protect you." After Zhang urged Sheng to take over the Railway Administration Bureau, he spent six million taels of silver but achieved nothing. The capital severely blamed him, and Zhang was quite hesitant. Knowing that Sheng was good at planning and was rich in capital, he intended to let him advance funds to take over. Sheng immediately agreed, but asked Zhang to guarantee that he would also be in charge of the railway, so that he could control it nearby, so that the iron produced by the bureau could have a market. Zhang had no choice but to agree. In a month, Zhang and Wang Wenshao jointly submitted a memorial, not only clearing him of the past, but also guaranteeing him to be the superintendent of national railways and also the director of the factory. The Qing court was indeed ignorant, and Rong Lu and others accepted huge bribes, which is why Sheng later dared to act arbitrarily and unscrupulously.

### Introduction to Famous Songs

— Ke Di

The Last Tears (Last Tears)

"The Last Tears" is an excellent and very famous lyrical song. It has not only become a popular folk song in Bohemia (now called the Czech Republic), but it is also a famous song that is often sung by vocalists. The composer is a famous "dramatic soprano", Madame Destinn.

The content of this song tells the story of a pair of lovers: they foresee that their love is about to end, so in a dim dawn, when he bids farewell in front of his lover's door, he tells her that this tragic day is about to come, and then silently leaves with tears in his eyes. This last tear is forever remembered in her heart.

At the beginning of the song, a melody similar to a chorus is used, showing the fear of a pair of lovers when the sad day comes, which is very touching. He relives many sweet past events in song: the joy of dancing together, the first words of love, and the beloved daughter they have born and all the happiness. At the end, an sad and moving melody is used, slowly and suppressively to end, which makes people can't help but feel sad.

Toreador Song (Toreador Song)

The great French opera composer Bizet has a world-famous and beloved opera, which is the magnificent "Carmen", and the "Toreador Song" that I am introducing here is the most famous aria sung by the male baritone in the second act of "Carmen" when Dureidor is in the inn. At that time, the heroine Carmen was singing and dancing wildly with her Gypsy friends in the inn. Dureidor came, and in their cheers, he used this particularly famous aria to tell them about the emotions and state of surprise and danger during bullfighting.

### Art and Literary Scene

The famous cartoonist "Ox Nose" creator Huang Yao, during the Anti-Japanese War, moved to the inland and traveled all over the southwest. After the victory, he lived in Vietnam. Last autumn, he took his collection of art treasures to Paris for exhibition. On his return to Haiphong, he encountered the French-Vietnamese War. His works over the years were all burned. Recently, he escaped and returned to China. He completed his first five-color comic "Collection of Contradictions" and "Vietnamese Scenery" in Kunming, which were publicly exhibited locally. In late April, Mr. Huang was invited by friends to arrive in Guangzhou, intending to stay for a short time and publicly exhibit his works. (Huang Tangqing)

### Hu Shi's Salary

— Liu Meng

When Guang Sheng Hu Shi talked about the problem of professor treatment (this newspaper's Beiping telegram on the 7th), he said that his salary was "recently adjusted and increased to more than one million, but converted into US dollars, it is only more than thirty dollars;" and jokingly said, "I might as well teach in the United States." For a famous scholar to say such a ridiculous thing, it shows the plight of the lives of professors today.

In fact, from professors to elementary school teachers, the life difficulties encountered by everyone are the same. Those with "ways" are changing careers one after another. Those who can go abroad are of course a small minority. Most of them are just making a circle in their own country. The work efficiency of these people in other positions is not difficult to imagine; but how can we prevent those people from changing careers?

### Solitary Wanderings

— Wang Cong

Someone said, "Life is bird song, flowers, flowing water, and floating clouds, just eight words." If asked again, he would say, "Flowing water and floating clouds, should be bird song and flowers, just eight words."

These few words are thought-provoking.

Life is desolate.

Lao Tzu said, "Heaven and earth are unkind, treating all things as straw dogs."

Tolstoy said, "Life itself is a tragedy."

Legend has it that Lao Tzu went west out of Hangu Pass and his whereabouts are unknown. This ending, like flowing water and floating clouds, seems to unfold a picture of the twilight spirit of Jiangtian for us, its beauty is like poetry.

Tolstoy regarded the honors of his own world, the so-called warm family, as just memories that brought him incomparable pain. Therefore, this white-bearded old man ran away from home. He probably wanted to find something he had not gotten in eighty years, but what exactly was that? Perhaps this great thinker of the century also found it difficult to say. Finally, this giant died lonely in a hotel.

Banqiao said, it is rare to be confused in life. Those who are mired in deep thinking cannot be content with fate.

Integrity and happiness are often two enemies that refuse to coexist. I envy happiness for being able to lie safely on the sofa of worldliness; soft bone disease does not affect its comfort.

Integrity, on the other hand, has sharp edges and corners, and because it cannot conform, it cannot be tolerated.

According to the current situation, "evolution" continues, I think integrity will inevitably be defeated by happiness, one by one, the heart is solid and the body is fat. The society and the world are all fat people, and there is no need to have the trouble of organizing a fat people's association.

At that time, foreign houses and foreign houses will inevitably increase in price, because there is no considerable thickness, and there is no appearance of anger to enter.
