After the meeting began, the results of the morning's election of resident committee members were announced, followed by the reading of Wang Zaoshi's written inquiry regarding the arrest of students and reporters. After reporting on the matters, discussions began, starting with the peace plan, which was passed without objection. Suddenly, Kong Geng stood up and said: "I heard that the CCP broadcasted a rejection of peace talks," implying that the door to peace was still closed. The chairman replied: "They close their door, we open ours." Following this, Wang Lizai made a temporary motion requesting that the councilors participating in the inspection team report on the inspection situation, which was passed by a majority.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The National Political Council's resolution on the peace proposal was passed during the nineteenth session on the afternoon of the 2nd.

After the chairman read the full text of the review opinions, it was passed without objection in less than half a minute. Applause lasted for about a minute in the hall. Although Kong Geng spoke, he did not affect the passage of the resolution.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Fourth Session, Third Plenary of the National Political Council successfully concluded on the afternoon of the 2nd. The conference was convened at a time when the domestic situation was turbulent and the people of the country were eager for peace. The conference represented national public opinion and formulated a peace plan, which was the greatest achievement of this session. More than four hundred proposals were passed during the conference, with the most relating to finance and economy, which sufficiently reflected that stabilizing the people's livelihood was currently the most urgent task. However, all councilors believed that peace must be achieved before the economy could be stabilized and the people's livelihood could be improved. Therefore, their desire for peace was very urgent. More than twenty proposals were submitted calling for peace. After convening a plenary review meeting once and special review meetings twice, and drafting review opinions to be submitted to the conference, it finally won the enthusiastic support of the entire body and was passed. The conference was declared closed, but no separate closing ceremony was held. Only Lin Hu, representing the presidium, delivered closing remarks, and Zou Shuwen, representing all councilors, delivered a speech. Both emphasized that the central task of this conference was to seek peace in order to pursue construction in peace and to guarantee peace through construction.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Councilor Wang Zaoshi submitted a written inquiry to the conference on the morning of the 2nd, co-signed by Huang Yanpei, Han Fu'e, Yang Boping, and others. It stated that news reports indicated that students in Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, and Tianjin had stopped marching and demonstrating. Was the government considering no longer continuing to arrest students and reporters? Would the arrested students and reporters be released immediately? Furthermore, the conditions for the government to resume peace talks were not very clear, and it was proposed to ask Director Zhang to explain. During the afternoon meeting, the inquiry was read out, and the chairman announced that the inquiry would be forwarded to Director Zhang.

### Closing Remarks by Lin Hu, Representative of the Conference Presidium; Speech by Zou Shuwen on Behalf of the Entire Body

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Fourth Session, Third Plenary of the National Political Council closed on the evening of the 2nd. The presidium nominated Representative Lin Hu to deliver closing remarks, the main points of which are as follows:

Today, the Fourth Session, Third Plenary of the conference has been successfully completed. The presidium instructed me to deliver a speech on its behalf. The mission of this council is to gather wisdom and unite the strength of the nation. During the War of Resistance, it was to assist the government in carrying out the war. After victory, and before the implementation of the constitution, it was to assist the government in national construction. Obstacles have arisen on the current road to national construction. If these obstacles are not removed, national construction cannot proceed. Therefore, resolving disputes and seeking peace is the most important task.

Only with peace can we stabilize the economy, improve the people's livelihood, develop education, and establish constitutional government. The central task of this conference was to seek peace. All colleagues submitted twenty proposals, and the conference spent an entire day convening a plenary review meeting, followed by two meetings of the special committee. The proposed plan has now been passed. This plan is truly the key to peace, and it is expected that all parties will have a positive response. In its third item, the conference has entrusted its responsibility to the presidium and the resident committee. The presidium and the resident committee will act in accordance with the spirit of this conference and strive diligently to fulfill the mission of the conference in order to achieve peace.

The proposals submitted by all colleagues at this conference totaled more than four hundred, fully reflecting the demands and intentions of the national populace. The resolutions made by the conference have weighed the priorities and requested the government to handle them separately. We are confident that they will all benefit the government's administration. If the government humbly considers them, adopts them separately, and implements them one by one, the presidium and the resident committee will also, in accordance with the authority of this council, do their utmost to supervise and review them at any time.

After the conference adjourns, all colleagues will return to their respective regions. It is hoped that they will uphold the spirit of the conference and strive to fulfill their responsibilities as colleagues of this council at all times and in all places. All measures of the central government that affect the local areas, whether for good or bad, or for benefit or harm, should be carefully noted. Regarding local malpractices and the suffering of the people, it is especially hoped that they will be carefully investigated, and that efforts will be made to resolve them in conjunction with local public opinion organs. If there is a need to convey information to the central government, please send detailed letters to the resident committee at any time for consideration and suggestions to the government.

This council was established in July of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938] and has been nearly nine years. Its past contributions to the country are evident to all. Now, although there are only six months left until the National Assembly convenes on December 25th, all of you bear the trust of society and have an eternal responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. It is hoped that you will continue to work hard to bring our country to a strong and prosperous realm. I wish you all good health.

Following this, Councilor Zou Shuwen delivered a speech on behalf of the entire body, explaining that the council has been established for nearly a decade, and its main purpose has been to promote democracy and convene the National Assembly as soon as possible. Now that the National Assembly has been convened last year, and the constitution will be implemented at the end of the year, those who have achieved success should retire. The council, which represents public opinion, should transfer its responsibilities to the public opinion organs that will be established in the future. Zou continued to point out that due to the instability of politics, economy, education, etc., China's international status is declining and the people's lives are deteriorating. The plan for today should be to seek progress in stability. Economic, financial, and educational matters should be handled with caution. At this conference, he offered his humble opinions on the above issues, hoping that the authorities will adopt and implement them, and that the handling of the student movement issue should be especially cautious. The work of the War of Resistance was difficult, and the construction of peace is also not easy. It is hoped that the entire country will practice thrift and strive for construction in order to consolidate the foundation of peace. We should seek construction in peace and guarantee peace in construction. In the shortest possible time, we should promote the realization of peace. Zou concluded by saying: Those who seek benevolence will attain benevolence, those who seek peace will ultimately attain peace, and those who seek construction will ultimately attain construction. By relying on our own efforts and striving forward, the above goals will not be difficult to achieve, and the country and nation will not be difficult to achieve prosperity and happiness.

### The Case of Controlling Commercial Banks Passed According to Review Opinions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The issue of controlling commercial banks sparked heated debate during the seventeenth session of the conference yesterday. At that time, it was quickly decided to hand it over to the Fourth Review Committee for further review. It was discussed again at the eighteenth session on the morning of the 2nd. First, convener Deng Feihuang explained, stating that the authorities had not completely ignored commercial banks in the past, but the degree of control had not achieved the expected purpose. The review committee believed that stricter controls should be implemented in the future. Subsequently, Yang Boping and others spoke, believing that the attitude towards controlling provincial banks in the conference should be consistent and that there should be no contradictions. Finally, a vote was taken and it was passed according to the review opinions and sent to the government for handling. The review opinions are recorded below:

(1) Existing commercial banks and money shops should be strictly controlled to ensure that their funds are sufficient and their business is normal. The methods are as follows: (A) Strictly order the competent authorities in various places to conduct regular and irregular inspections of banking operations; (B) Encourage the people to secretly report illegal banking operations and strictly crack down on them; (C) Authorize local public opinion organs to accept secret reports and supervise the implementation of management orders by the competent authorities.

(2) Under the current economic conditions, commercial banks and money shops should strictly implement Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan on Strengthening the Control of Financial Operations: "Depending on the distribution of banks and money shops in various places, designate areas to suspend the resumption of business and the establishment of branch institutions of commercial banks and money shops."

(3) Regarding the matters that national banks should pay attention to improve: (A) Strictly implement the specialization of national banks. National banks must not engage in illegal speculation and should limit their business scope; (B) The loan system of national banks should be improved to fulfill their responsibility of assisting production; (C) The acceptance system should be abolished immediately so that small and medium-sized industrial and commercial production enterprises can directly enjoy the right to low-interest loans.

(4) The scope of business of provincial banks should be limited to the respective provinces.

### The Ministry of Finance Responds to Inquiries from the National Political Council: Exchange Rate Not Considered for Adjustment; U.S. Loans Limited to Construction

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] In its written response to Councilor Zou Shuwen's inquiry regarding foreign exchange, the Ministry of Finance stated that the government has not yet considered adjusting the exchange rate, stating: "The government has always been very cautious about changing the exchange rate. However, due to the continued rise in domestic prices, the exchange rate is far from the natural level. In order to encourage exports and consider the interests of overseas Chinese remittances, it is necessary to make appropriate adjustments at appropriate times. Since the last exchange rate adjustment, export trade has shown obvious progress, and overseas Chinese remittances in February and March of this year have also increased by nearly double compared to the end of last year. We are currently paying attention to stabilizing prices and have not yet considered adjusting the exchange rate." Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance responded to Councilor Wu Jiantao's inquiry regarding stabilizing the currency as follows: "Stabilizing the currency is indeed a crucial task at present. Before the new year, the government, on the one hand, improved the tax system and increased normal revenue to meet the needs of national economic development; on the other hand, it strengthened financial controls and supervised the use of funds to assist production as much as possible. At the same time, in addition to taxes, it used public debt and material policies to absorb idle social capital. All these measures are aimed at balancing revenue and expenditure and contracting the currency. We are confident that these measures are correct and will spare no effort in promoting them. If domestic order is stable and production proceeds in an orderly manner, the value of the currency will naturally be stabilized."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] In its written response to the councilors' inquiries, the Ministry of Finance made the following report on the situation of foreign debt raised by our country in the past and the situation of currently borrowing foreign debt: "The professional time raised 870 million U.S. dollars and 58 million British pounds. This is the highest agreed amount, and the actual amount used should be calculated. According to this, the British gold foreign debt during the war was only £14,844,773, and the U.S. dollar was $786,343,580.85. The foreign debt borrowed after the war was $121.45 million and 60 million Canadian dollars. These debts are being used successively. The only debts currently used are $5,122,241.82 and 19,496,491.99 Canadian dollars (excluding the remaining materials of the U.S. military in the Pacific, because the price of these materials is uncertain and related to the liquidation of the Sino-U.S. wartime mutual lease agreement, the figures have not yet been determined.) The task currently underway, in terms of foreign debt, is a $500 million loan. According to the initial negotiations between China and the United States, both parties agreed to limit the use of this loan to economic construction. Internal international trade relations of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and the post-war recovery of the world economy, all require the use of loans for international loans, which is not a unique condition for loans to our country and does not seem to affect our national character. As for the determination of self-sufficiency, it may be difficult to achieve in the current situation, but we must have this ambition. If the whole country can abide by this purpose, the project can also be gradually achieved."

### A Strange Encounter for a Kaohsiung Fish Merchant: Dissecting a Fish and Finding a Human Corpse

Possibly Officers and Soldiers from the Fubo Warship Who Met with Disaster

[Our Taipei Dispatch] A strange incident of a human corpse appearing in the belly of a fish recently occurred in this province. It happened that Lin Tianshuang, a fish merchant from Kaohsiung, purchased a large shark at the Zhuli fish market one day. When he took it back home and dissected it, he was shocked to find a corpse lying in the fish's belly. It looked like a Japanese person, about 30 or 40 years old, and his face was fairly recognizable. Half of a grass-yellow sleeve remained on his left forearm. For a time, it stirred up the surrounding residents, who rushed to watch. It was speculated that he was one of those who capsized in a boat and was swallowed by a shark, or it was guessed that he was one of the officers and soldiers who met with disaster on the Fubo warship. Because his identity could not be determined, he has been buried in the Zhuli Township Office cemetery.

### Xu Fulin to Go to Guangdong at the End of the Month

Will Go to Beijing After the Provincial Committee Appointment is Announced

[Our Dispatch] Xu Fulin told reporters yesterday: He plans to go to Guangdong at the end of this month because the work of the Guangdong branch needs to be developed urgently. He plans to stay for about ten days before bringing his family back to Shanghai. Although he accepted the position of provincial committee member due to the persuasion of the party, he will go to Beijing after the government officially announces the appointment. The expulsion of party members was a last resort. However, expulsion is not permanent. Both sides have a history of more than ten years. As long as the other party can abolish the Reform Committee and not bear old grudges, they can still restore their party membership after legal procedures.

[Our Dispatch] Wu Xianzi, vice chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, has adopted a detached attitude towards internal disputes and has not decided whether to accept the position of provincial committee member. On the 30th of last month, the party's organizing committee specially sent Ji Yiqiao, Hong Shaozhi, and Li Shengce as representatives to persuade him. Wu expressed that he plans to return to Hong Kong in the short term and did not give a definitive answer to the provincial committee matter. Furthermore, Li Daming recently sent a telegram to Shanghai stating that he is as detached and neutral as Wu Xianzi regarding the party's internal disputes.

### Opening Up Sources of Revenue and Reducing Expenditure to Balance the Budget: The Economic Commission Studies Methods; Dredging Grain Sources to Stabilize Rice Prices in Various Regions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Economic Commission, since its official establishment on May 26th, has held three meetings in the week ending on the 2nd of this month. Zhang Qun, the concurrently serving chairman, personally presided over each meeting. The main points of the scope of discussion and resolutions of the three meetings are listed below:

(A) Regarding the items stipulated in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan for balancing the budget, the committee has appointed committee members to form five small groups to study in detail the plans for opening up sources of revenue and reducing expenditure. The classification of the five small groups is: (1) military expenses, (2) food, (3) finance, (4) state-owned enterprises and the sale of enemy and puppet property, and (5) reduction of general agency expenditures. Each small group will hold meetings with the competent authorities separately this week, submit reports, and integrate opinions in the meeting to determine concrete measures and implement them quickly.

(B) The government has made sufficient preparations for the supply of food. In addition to actively dredging domestic sources of food, a large amount of food can be obtained from relief supplies, and it has been decided to purchase a sufficient amount of food from foreign countries. A rationing system will be implemented first in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Fuzhou, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other places, and gradually expanded, increasing the area of rationing and increasing the distribution of daily necessities. When food prices are stable, other prices will naturally be stabilized.

(C) While the government is vigorously practicing thrift and reducing expenditures, it also plans to promote a widespread thrift movement and promote a national goods movement to create a climate of thrift. The meeting appointed a full-time committee member to study concrete measures in conjunction with relevant agencies.

### Freight Train Between Pingjin Hits a Landmine and is Destroyed by Fire

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 2nd] A series of the 107th joint transport freight train between Pingjin was bombed and caught fire near Yangcun on the evening of the 1st. The train was heading from Tianjin to Zhangjiakou on the evening of the 1st. When it arrived near Yangcun at 11:50 p.m., it hit a landmine. At that time, a total of six or seven landmines exploded.

The relief problem in the Yellow River flood area is particularly serious. Reclamation work is currently being intensified, otherwise the entire flood area is in danger of becoming a desert.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] The Lvda Inspection Team departed from Shenyang North Station at 8:15 a.m. on the 2nd by special military train to Jinxi, then to Huludao, and departed by the Changzhi gunboat.

### Renewed Calls for Investigation of Corruption by Re-examination Groups; Delegates at the Senate Meeting Resolve to Urge the Government to Expedite Action on Corruption Cases Discovered During Inspections

[Our Beijing Correspondent, 2nd] The issue of investigations was brought up again at the Senate meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd, with the sound of "tiger-beating" filling the hall. Several senators who participated in the inspection teams recounted their work in various regions last year, stating that while they may not have caught any "big tigers," those they did catch were not merely "flies." They asserted that they had done their utmost and were not "putting up a sheep's head and selling dog meat." This matter was raised by Wang Lizai in a temporary motion. He pointed out that the investigation teams had departed in succession in July and August of last year, and to this day, not only is the public unable to understand the truth, but even Senate colleagues are still in the dark, which greatly defeats the purpose of the Assembly's resolution to organize the investigation teams. Moreover, the public has many improper speculations about the Senate. In order to dispel doubts and allow colleagues to understand the truth, it is proposed that senators who participated in the teams report to the Assembly on the investigation situation and the list of corrupt officials. After the motion was proposed, Wu Chunwu and others agreed that, to dispel public doubts, it was necessary to report the results of the investigation to the Assembly. Wu Cangzhou reported on the investigation process in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, pointing out that the investigation teams were not judicial bodies. If cases are brought up but not followed through, the responsibility cannot be entirely attributed to the investigation teams. Zheng Kuiyi reported on the investigation of the takeover work in Taiwan, saying that the team worked in Taiwan for forty days and caught at least three "tigers." They may have been limited in their capabilities, but they would not admit to not having tried their best. The staff was never subjected to any external pressure and would never change their original intentions due to external forces. Liang Shangdong reported on the work in Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, pointing out that the takeover personnel in Tianjin and other places "robbed" materials, giving the people a bad impression. At the same time, they completely destroyed the construction work done by the Japanese in North China, which is regrettable! The team did not handle many major cases due to time and manpower constraints, but they were not "putting up a sheep's head and selling dog meat." Zhao Gonglu reported on the work in Qingdao, Shandong, saying that when the team arrived, local officials immediately said that the investigation team would not achieve any results. However, the team had uncovered the "Four Great Kongs" in Shandong and Zhang Legu in Qingdao. All of the above cases involved local influential figures and have been submitted to the court, but have not yet been decided. The judicial authorities should bear the responsibility. Finally, Wu Wangji reported on the investigation in Shanghai, pointing out that Shanghai had the most enemy and puppet property, but unfortunately, there were many strange fires and a lot of materials rotted, which was a great pity! The team was not unprepared to beat tigers, but unfortunately, there was too little time. Wu also cited examples of major cases handled, hoping that the government could quickly and thoroughly sort out the past cases. After the report, the meeting resolved to urge the government to expedite the handling of investigation cases.

(1) The nature and size of factories and the number of machines received were not detailed in the reports, and attention should be paid to this; (2) The handling agencies vary from place to place, and attention should be paid to this; (3) Poor management of received materials, negligence in preservation, or self-consumption should have detailed comparative statistics. The report failed to show the truth and seems to be a flaw; (4) There are many abuses in the receipt and handling of enemy and puppet property. The investigation team discovered various illegal corruption and embezzlement, but the government report did not mention the handling of such incidents at all, which is a regrettable omission.

### After the Opening of the Puyang-Yanzhou Section of the Jinpu Railway, Shandong Will Enter a New Phase; One of Our Correspondent's Reports on a Tour of Southern Shandong

Taking advantage of the opening ceremony of the Puyang-Yanzhou section of the Jinpu Railway, I, as a reporter, made a tour of the points and lines in southern Shandong. Everywhere I went, I deeply felt a sense of desolation across this vast land.

Along the railway line, only piles of broken walls and ruins remain at the stations, and the only modern buildings are工事堡壘 and defensive structures resembling the "Great Wall." The situation appeared desolate, and I deeply felt that the further north I went, the closer I got to the "front line."

Yanzhou, a major town in southern Shandong, has been a strategic location for military strategists since ancient times. Currently, due to the military advancements, Yanzhou has become the advanced command headquarters and the main supply base for the National Army's forward base.

Therefore, the opening of the Puyang-Yanzhou section is more for military purposes than for the convenience of travelers. In the future, the National Army in the battles in southern and central Shandong will have another major artery, which may lead to another new phase in the near future.

Speaking of the current military situation between the National and Communist forces, after the National Army recovered Jining, Qufu, Ningyang, Zou County, and other areas, Yanzhou and neighboring counties have gradually restored normal contact. The main force of the Communist army in this area is in danger of being annihilated at any time, so most of them have been split up and scattered into the mountainous areas, with only some scattered small groups harassing everywhere like bandits. In reality, they can no longer play a role. However, the future of southern Shandong will mainly depend on the active strengthening of the pacification work and the political work in various counties so that everything can get back on track. We should know that the people in a vast land are still in a state of hunger and poverty.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew from Nanjing to Yanzhou on the 20th of last month and stayed for more than three hours. He gave detailed instructions on the future war situation in southern Shandong. It is believed that when the Jinpu Railway reaches Jinan this winter, the situation in Shandong may turn from a gloomy atmosphere to a sunny situation.

### Communist Forces in Shandong Cross the River and Flee Westward; They Are Surrounded and Severely Attacked by the National Army

The National Army surrounded and severely attacked them near Dongping. The Communist forces could not withstand the attack and fled back to the north bank of the Yellow River on the night of the 1st.

[Central News Agency, Xinxiang, 31st] (1) The defending troops in Anyang are sweeping and attacking. The main force of the Communist army has withdrawn to more than ten miles away. (2) The Communist forces outside Anyang transferred most of their troops south to meet the enemy, and looted civilian materials to transport them to the Luhe River.

### Our Representative Will Depart for the United States in a Few Days to Attend the Final Meeting of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration

[Local News] The final conference before the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will be held this month. All United Nations will send representatives to Washington to participate and discuss matters before the end.

### "June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Commemoration; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issued a Special Instruction; The Government Has Made a Decision to Eradicate Drugs

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The "June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Commemoration Day will be held on the 3rd. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued the following special instruction:

This year's June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration is held before the Constitution has been promulgated, the constitutional government is about to be implemented, and after the successful conclusion of the United Nations Anti-Smoking Conference. This is of extraordinary significance. Since the government resolved to ban drugs in the 23rd year of the Republic, I, personally, have drafted a two-year drug prohibition and a six-year anti-smoking plan, supervising the implementation with all my efforts. Although there was a difficult eight-year war of resistance and the enemy and puppet's rampant毒化, the execution of my anti-smoking policy has never been abandoned. Resisting the war and banning drugs are both important measures to eliminate the obstacles to unification and lay the foundation for the constitutional government. The two cannot be neglected. We must completely eliminate the domestic烟毒 and eradicate the smoking and trafficking of烟毒 by overseas Chinese, so that the country has no unhealthy citizens and the international community has no room to指責 and誹議 us. Only then can the implementation of the constitutional government proceed smoothly. However, after the end of the war, the 毒化 of the enemy has yet to be eliminated, and the Communist army has intensified,破壤禁政. If my people do not make up their minds to strengthen themselves with all their strength, the success of my existing禁政 will be destroyed in one day, and its impact on international status and the　政 will be no less than that of foreign invasions and civil strife. I hope that my compatriots at home and abroad will continue to assist the government, publicize and advise, report and accuse, based on their glorious history of advocating anti-smoking for decades. The organs, auxiliary groups, and overseas领馆,僑領僑團, at all levels of the禁政 must strictly implement the promulgated laws and regulations, and go all out with one heart and one mind. With the spirit of annihilating the enemy and repaying the country, they should fight the last battle with the remaining烟毒. The people at home and abroad who have addicted to烟毒 and種售烟毒 are also encouraged to always consider their personal lives and the status of the country, quickly wash away their old habits, strive to reform themselves, and jointly complete the禁政. In short, the government has made a decision to eradicate the毒. After the start of the constitutional government, if there is still one person or one place in violation, it means that my duties today have not been fulfilled, and it is also a shame for my entire nation that has not been washed away. I hope that on the occasion of the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration, we will exhort each other and encourage each other, and strive to launch a more active and thorough anti-smoking campaign immediately after the closing of the Commemoration Conference. The day when the constitutional government is implemented will also be the day when禁政 succeeds. There is great hope for除萬佈新,強民建國.

[Another dispatch] Wang Depu, Chairman of the Anti-Smoking Committee of the Ministry of Interior, gave a radio address on the eve of the "June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Day, reviewing the禁政.

Editorial

### The Choice of the Indian People: Partition or Unification?

British Governor-General of India, Mountbatten, convened a round table conference yesterday with the leaders of various Indian political parties and announced the solution to the Indian problem proposed by the British government, which he had just brought from London. He allowed the Indian people to choose between unification and partition. Thus, the turbulent Indian political situation, which has been plagued for 150 years, has now reached a final decision point. Unification or partition? The answer will be known within a day or two. The British authorities have taken strict military precautions in case of emergencies. People all over the world are also expressing great concern about the future fate of India. According to general observations and predictions, the partition of India is inevitable; however, after this round table conference decides on the partition of India, a civil war in India will be unavoidable. It would be a great tragedy in post-war international politics if India were forced to embark on this tragic fate.

Under British rule, India has always sought independence and autonomy. On February 22nd of this year, British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Britain would withdraw from India on June 1, 1948, and completely transfer power to the Indian government. This important statement was not only warmly welcomed by the Indian people, but people in other countries also praised the wise measures taken by the British Labour Party government. Logically, the shared national aspirations of the Indian people could soon be fully realized, as long as everyone is willing to work together in harmony, is not affected by sectarian differences, and can work together wholeheartedly for a democratic, unified, and autonomous India. Then, by June 1st of next year, a bright and emerging India could appear before our eyes. However, looking at the situation in India, sectarian differences and complex circumstances have created many hidden reefs for the future of Indian unification. The most important of these reefs is the conflict between Hindus and Muslims. The Muslim League insists on the separation of "Pakistan" and "Hindustan" and has reached an irreconcilable point. In addition, the princely states within India still maintain the monarchical traditions since the Middle Ages. It is really not an easy task to overcome all difficulties and achieve national unification. Therefore, the bright prospects of India are still shrouded in haze, and the outlook for the future is not optimistic. The world cannot help but regret that India can achieve independence but not unification and will eventually be divided; especially we Chinese, who are in East Asia and neighbors with India.

Since the British government announced the return of power to the Indian people, the conflict between Hindus and Muslims in India has not only not been reduced or eased, but has intensified, causing unrest in various parts of India. Since taking office, Governor-General Mountbatten has also exhausted his wisdom to reconcile the views of the major political parties in India, hoping that they can work together in harmony and sacrifice their prejudices for the new India. However, the results of three months of efforts have not yielded any results. Therefore, he had to accommodate the views of the Muslim League and advocate allowing the Indian people to choose between the two options of unification and partition. On May 17th, Governor-General Mountbatten was summoned back to the country to report the views of the major Indian political parties to the government in detail and put forward his own proposals. The British Cabinet had no choice but to reluctantly agree. The main points are five: (1) Dissolve the existing Constituent Assembly in New Delhi; (2) Hindu and Muslim groups should each establish a Constituent Assembly to draft a constitution for the partition of India; (3) The two major provinces of Bengal and Punjab should also be divided internally; (4) A referendum should be held in the Northwest Frontier Province to decide whether to become autonomous or merge into Hindustan or Pakistan; (5) The powers of the current coalition interim government will be transferred to the comprehensive new interim government, which will be organized by representatives from each Constituent Assembly; (6) Britain should transfer power to the Hindu Constituent Assembly and the Muslim Constituent Assembly.

When the British Cabinet discussed this plan, it also caused disagreements at one time. At the same time, Muslim League Chairman Jinnah put forward new demands and analyzed the meaning of Pakistan into six points: (1) The Muslim League requires Hindustan to provide a corridor to connect Northwest Pakistan and Northeast Pakistan; (2) The Muslim League will not give up an inch of land in its demand for the partition of Bengal and Punjab provinces; (3) A truly beneficial relationship can be established between Pakistan and Britain; (4) Pakistan and Hindustan should establish friendly and mutually beneficial relations; (5) The Pakistani government should be a representative government of the people; (6) Pakistan will apply to join the United Nations organization. Jinnah's demands were not only opposed by the Indian National Congress, but also could not be agreed to by the British Cabinet. Therefore, the British Cabinet discussed repeatedly and, in a state of helplessness, approved Governor-General Mountbatten's plan and had him take it back to India to allow the Indian people to choose freely.

Although the British have reached an agreement on a solution to the Indian problem and have agreed in principle to the Muslim League's demand for partition, the attitude of the National Congress, which firmly advocates Indian unification, is most worthy of our attention. Nehru, Vice President of the Indian Interim Government, refuted Jinnah's demands on the 24th, saying: "We only hope for the unity of India. We have no intention of forcing others, but we cannot tolerate being forced by others. If there are no other demands and a just solution can be obtained on this basis, we can proceed to promote the unity of India." The National Congress has also formally notified the British government that, under no circumstances, will it approve of dividing India into Pakistan and Hindustan. Mahatma Gandhi's attitude is even more intense: Gandhi made a very painful statement: "Britain must first kill me, Gandhi, before it can divide India." He also said, "If the Muslim League says: 'If you don't give me Pakistan, we will use the sword,' we should answer, 'We will never give you Pakistan. You can cut me or the country into pieces.'" Based on this, the round table conference that opened yesterday in New Delhi is bound to be disputed and may not be able to reach an agreement immediately.

In short, the Indian political situation is on the verge of civil war. If the Hindu and Muslim leaders cannot use political wisdom to eliminate sectarian discrimination and find a middle ground between unification and partition, then it is feared that India may embark on the path of self-destruction. It is hoped that the British Governor-General, who is in the position of mediator, will remain impartial and adopt a moderate and appropriate approach, and promote the harmonious cooperation between Hindus and Muslims so as to transform hostility into peace and enable India to truly be reborn.

### Seven Indian Leaders Convened for Meeting, Governor of India Proposes Partition Plan, Gandhi Received After Meeting for Long Talk

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 2nd Broadcast: Mountbatten held a round table conference today for two hours with seven Indian leaders. The original plan for a unified Indian administration drafted by the British cabinet was rejected and unable to be discussed. At the time, Governor Mountbatten proposed an opposite suggestion, which included the partition of India and the assignment of an international committee to determine new boundaries, etc., and limited the Indian leaders to reply within 24 hours.

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 1st Broadcast: New Delhi issued a public announcement today: It is said that the British plan to return power to the Indian people will be announced tomorrow, showing that the major Indian political parties have accepted the British suggestions. The public announcement further states that Mountbatten will broadcast tomorrow night and announce the contents of the British plan.

[United Press, New Delhi, 2nd] An official public announcement said: The British-Indian round table conference convened this morning for two hours. During the session, Mountbatten made a detailed report of the meetings in India and Britain on how the British government adopted the current plan, and distributed a copy of the declaration to each leader. The meeting was extended to 10:00 AM tomorrow, giving each committee time to study. After the meeting, Jinnah and Mountbatten had a brief conversation. At 12:30 in the afternoon, the Governor had a talk with Gandhi again until 1:15. The Governor has scheduled to meet fourteen representatives of the Senate and various provinces at 4:00 PM tomorrow. At 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, the Governor will make a broadcast speech, and all Indian radio stations will broadcast the declaration of the British government. Subsequently, Nehru, Jinnah, Singh, and others will also speak. The Governor will hold a press conference at 10:00 AM on the 4th.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] The meeting between the Governor of India and the seven Indian leaders convened this morning for two hours and then extended. At 10:00 AM this morning, the Indian leaders who were to attend the meeting arrived at the venue to listen to the plan that the Governor of India had returned with from London. The first to arrive was the Chairman of the Muslim League, Jinnah, with a cigar in his mouth and a smile on his face. Next to arrive was the Vice President of the Indian Interim Government, Nehru, with a serious expression. Accompanying him were Interior Minister Patel and Chairman of the National Congress, Kripalani, and the Sikh leader, Singh. Finally, the last to arrive were the two other leaders of the Muslim League, Minister of Transportation of the Interim Government, Nishtar, and Minister of Finance, Ali Khan. When the representatives arrived at the Governor's Office, there were no large crowds gathered, nor were there any demonstrations. After the meeting, the Indian leaders left the Governor's Office with smiles on their faces. Jinnah left twenty minutes later than the other Indian leaders. When reporters asked, "Got it?" (meaning, were the demands of Pakistan fulfilled?), Jinnah did not answer.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] The Governor of India, Mountbatten, will recommend to the Indian leaders at 10:00 AM this morning that dominion status be granted to Hindustan and Pakistan, that Bengal and Punjab be divided into districts, and that new elections be held in the Northwest Frontier Province to determine whether the province should belong to Pakistan. According to extremely reliable sources, the British government will ask the Indian leaders to accept dominion status under the Statute of Westminster. Britain will not interfere with or control Hindustan and Pakistan, but the latter must pledge allegiance to the British King. This plan will allow the Indian Army to continue to be governed by one staff department without division, and the phenomenon of the army being divided into two in June 1948 can be avoided. It is said that several National Congress leaders have already accepted this suggestion. If both the National Congress and the Muslim League accept dominion status, the Governor, who has the status of a representative of the British King, will automatically withdraw and be replaced by a Governor stationed in the dominion. The current Indian Interim Government will also disappear with it and be replaced by a dominion government. The Governor will be able to inform London by telegram at the latest tonight after learning of the Indian leaders' reaction to the plan this morning. On Tuesday afternoon, the Governor will meet with representatives of the various native states.

### Strict Precautions Throughout India, Governor Inspects Turbulent Areas on Eve of Meeting

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] The entire territory of India, from Karachi in the west to Calcutta in the east, from Peshawar in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, is under strict precautions. Calcutta has been under military control since last night in seven of the city's twenty-four police districts. Since 2:00 AM this morning, military troops have been deployed in large numbers. Residents throughout the city are hoarding food for one week to more than ten days in anticipation of unrest.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Riots broke out again in Amritsar, the holy city of the Sikh tribe in Punjab province, over the weekend. The military and police fired many shots. On Saturday night, fires broke out in many places in the city, and three churches were not spared.

[United Press, New Delhi, 1st] Accompanied by Governor Jenkins of Punjab, the Governor of India, Mountbatten, flew to inspect the turbulent rural areas of Gurgaon. The details of Mountbatten's trip are unknown, but it can be seen that before he holds an important meeting with the Indian leaders tomorrow and submits a program plan to the conference, he wants to see the peaceful state of India.

### British Press Comments on Indian Issue

Recognizing that the Future of Partition is Not Optimistic

[French News Agency, London, 2nd] "News Chronicle" commented today: The implementation of partition in India may be the only way to solve the Indian problem, but it is not a good policy, and we regret this. Regarding the round table conference of Indian leaders held in New Delhi, the world's attention will be focused on this. Governor Mountbatten is meeting with them and is using all his strength to promote coordination among Indian leaders. This is the key to determining the fate of India and an important moment for the world. The task of this conference is to deal with the future of one-fifth of the world's population, that is, 400 million people. At this moment, Indian leaders can no longer harbor the thought that Britain will use bayonets to force their powerful opponents to yield. As far as the current situation is concerned, partition seems inevitable, but few people who love India are optimistic about its future. For example, dividing the provinces of Bengal and Punjab is enough to make India's unstable economy even more tense. Millions of lives in India are now in danger. If the New Delhi Conference has to adopt a partition decision, then we deeply hope that it will be done peacefully and that economic realities should be taken into account.

### US-Soviet Committee to Discuss Specific Korean Issues

### Dutch Army Accuses Indonesia of Violating Armistice Agreement

[Our Dispatch] London, 2nd (Broadcast): The Dutch Army issued a communique today stating that the Indonesian Republican Army has been continuously violating the armistice agreement over the past week.

The communique also stated that Indonesian troops have constructed new positions outside the Dutch defense lines in Medan, Semarang, and Bandung, preventing food from being transported into Dutch-occupied cities. More than a dozen Europeans have been kidnapped by Indonesian troops, and many women and children are being held in detention camps. The situation is becoming increasingly serious everywhere.

### Rumor that Siamese Authorities Arrested Cambodian Revolutionaries

[Agence France-Presse, Phnom Penh, Vietnam, 1st] Well-informed sources here have revealed that many leaders of the Free Cambodia Movement, residing in Siam, have expressed their intention to surrender, as other leaders have recently obtained privileges from the Cambodian authorities. However, they have been arrested by the Siamese authorities and charged as "state criminals." Since they are all citizens of the French Union, the French Commissioner in Cambodia has issued a statement confirming that many Free Movement leaders willing to surrender have been detained by "foreign authorities." This movement is most active in Battambang Province and the provinces annexed with Japanese assistance.

### Japan Plans to Build One Hundred Additional Power Plants

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 2nd] According to experts from the Economic and Industrial Reconstruction Association, Japan plans to build approximately one hundred additional hydroelectric power plants to increase electricity production to two million kilowatts, supplying half of Tokyo's electricity consumption. However, some of Japan's hydroelectric power facilities may be used as reparations to the Allied nations, so the construction plan has not yet been finalized.

Katayama said, "I have fought for the improvement of labor's position for thirty years, so I deeply regret making this request. But every Japanese should make sacrifices to cope with the long struggle ahead." He also stated that these sacrifices should be appropriately distributed so that those who became wealthy during the war bear more of the burden. He also called for economizing government expenditures. Katayama expressed deep confidence in Japan, saying that after signing a peace treaty, Japan can become a member of the democratic world and begin a new life. At the same time, Katayama emphasized that Japan needs spiritual revival and to become a democratic nation.

### Japan's Two Major Labor Unions Express Support for the New Cabinet

### Pope's Speech

[Associated Press, Vatican City, 2nd] Pope Pius XII, on the feast day of Saint Eugenia, delivered a broadcast to the world today, warning world leaders not to let the opportunity to restore proper relations between nations slip away. He said, "This may be the last chance, but let us hope it is not. Security, which should have been the fruit of victory, has not been achieved. Humanity longs for this security." The Pope also spoke of "the great dangers, the dire situations, and the dangerous threats facing the world." He said that history's judgment of 1947 will depend on developments in the coming months.

### Major Italian Cities Held Mass Rallies Yesterday; Left-Wing Parties Demonstrate Against New Cabinet

[Reuters, Rome, 2nd] Major Italian cities will hold mass rallies today to celebrate the first anniversary of the referendum decision declaring Italy a republic.

The Italian Socialist Party issued a statement today calling for the unity of all "genuine democrats" to oppose the cabinet formed by the Christian Democrats and non-partisans. The new cabinet is scheduled to hold its first cabinet meeting tomorrow, so today's mass rallies are clearly a protest demonstration.

[Reuters, Rome, 1st] The Italian Ministry of the Interior confirmed today that police have established road blocks in the Novara mountains, 100 kilometers northeast of Turin, to prevent the escape of guerrillas.

### Japanese Minister of Commerce Discusses Economic Crisis, Says Foreign Debt Will Be Raised If Necessary

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Minister of Commerce Mizutani announced his ambitions on the 1st: (1) Although there are various views on inflation and contraction, the current economic crisis must be recognized. Now that the Socialist Party is in charge of the commerce, industry, agriculture, and forestry sectors, the currency issue will be resolved from the production side.

Regarding the Dardanelles Strait, the Suez Canal, and the Panama Canal, they should be under international control.

Only after returning to Ankara will it be possible to begin discussing public works and economic issues. Well-informed sources say that another U.S. mission will arrive here within days to coordinate with the military mission's work.

### Italian-French International Brigade Arrives in Yugoslavia

[Our Dispatch] London, 2nd (Broadcast): According to Greek authorities, an international brigade formed in Italy and France has arrived in Yugoslavia, preparing to assist Greek left-wing guerrillas in fighting.

[Reuters, Athens, 2nd] A Greek government spokesman told our agency that Greek military authorities have been closely monitoring the tense military movements near the Greek border in Yugoslavia for some time. Detailed reports are lacking, but it is known that the Southern Army has not concentrated its forces and has strengthened its defenses in the areas of Menas, Asia, and Skopje, near the Greek border.

### Paris Horse Racing Championship

### Military Training Advisory Committee Recommends that the United States Implement Compulsory Military Training; Truman to Submit to Congress Soon

[United Press, Washington, 1st] President Truman's Military Training Advisory Committee today submitted a recommendation that all male high school graduates or dropouts between the ages of 18 and 20 be required to undergo six months of compulsory basic training in the Army or Air Force.

In brief: This plan is a necessary factor for implementing the national security plan, especially in this age of atomic warfare. It is an important measure for training young people and strengthening national defense. It is estimated that the implementation of this plan will cost approximately two billion U.S. dollars annually. This report was drafted by the Committee after five months of research. It is expected that President Truman will submit it to Congress for discussion based on this proposal. According to the Committee's estimates, approximately 1.1 million people can receive this training each year. The report then predicted the alarming situation of future wars as follows: (1) Long-range aircraft can cross oceans to carry out attacks; (2) Weapons of mass destruction, such as atomic energy, germs, and chemicals, will be used; (3) Events similar to the Pearl Harbor sneak attack will occur frequently; (4) Every city, factory, and farmland will become a battlefield in modern warfare; (5) The activities of the Fifth Column will become more important than Hitler's Fifth Column.

### Soviet Government Endeavors to Cultivate Young Military Cadres

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] President Truman's Military Training Advisory Committee today released a report on the study of Soviet military strength as a reference for the United States to implement universal military training. It is said that the Soviet military strength is based on the Red Army's compulsory military service and military training in schools. All healthy adult males in the Soviet Union between the ages of 19 and 50 are obligated to serve in the military. The Soviet Union also encourages paramilitary organizations such as shooting clubs, sports groups, and youth groups. This year, a special organization called the "Association for the Prevention of Air Raids and Chemical Warfare" was established, with 16 million male and female members. Although officials claim that the association is a people's voluntary organization, it is in fact a government agency dedicated to providing various military trainings to the people. In order to cultivate long-term military officer talents, the Suvorov Military Academies are training children as young as ten years old to become professional officers. There are a total of 4,500 student slots. The course lasts for seven years, and graduates can be promoted to military universities. Graduates of universities become officers. Universal youth military service in the Soviet Union begins at the age of 19, and for high school graduates, it begins at the age of 18. Those who are suitable for combat are assigned to active duty troops for two to five years or immediately transferred to the "First-Line Reserve." Those who must support elderly and frail parents and those who exceed the annual conscription quota are directly transferred to the "Second-Line Reserve" after completing active duty. All reservists can be called up to active duty at any time and must periodically undergo training in training camps for one to three months. Women may also be conscripted, and the Minister of Military Affairs may assign women with medical, veterinary, and other special training to join the army and navy. These women may be called up to training camps during peacetime and may be conscripted to serve in auxiliary teams and special teams during wartime.

### Taft Argues for Ratification of Four-Nation Treaty

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Senator Taft, Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, declared today that he supports Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in advocating the ratification of the four-nation treaty with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. Some opposition opinions have been carefully considered, with the opposition believing that the approval of the Italian treaty will lead to the withdrawal of American troops or create an opportunity for the Italian Communist Party to seize power. Taft also stated that he did not know what the situation would be after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, nor did he think anyone could speculate on it at this time. The Italian Communist Party may inevitably seize power. If so, what about our plan to aid Greece and Turkey to prevent communism? The issue is indeed significant. But I believe that weighing the pros and cons, it is best to ratify the treaty. This treaty may be the only one that the Soviet Union agrees to.

### Renowned German Aircraft Designer Messerschmitt Plans to Go to the United States; Rumored to Research Atomic-Powered Aircraft

[Associated Press, Nuremberg, 1st] Germany's top aircraft designer, Messerschmitt, hopes to go to the United States in the near future to study atomic-powered aircraft. He said, "He received a plan from the U.S. side two months ago and is currently waiting for a more detailed plan. If the U.S. allows him to work independently, he will undoubtedly accept." He believes that it is entirely possible to use atomic energy contained in batteries to power aircraft. Germany has already studied this, and he is willing to help realize this theory. Messerschmitt is currently awaiting release from the Nazi court because he is accused of joining the Nazis in 1939 before he can go to the United States. Messerschmitt designed jet aircraft for the German Air Force.

### Holy Land Investigation Committee Holds Organizational Meeting

Swedish Representative Likely to be Elected Chairman

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 1st] The United Nations Palestine Investigation Committee has reached a quorum on the 1st, and will hold an organizational meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd. Due to the absence of representatives from five countries, the Committee had been postponed for a week. On the 2nd, it will discuss six organizational and implementation issues, which must be resolved before the Committee goes to Palestine for on-site investigation. The Swedish representative, Mr. Setesku, is most likely to be elected chairman, as he has extensive legal experience and Sweden is known as a neutral country. The Dutch representative also has a chance of being elected chairman. After deciding on the various personnel selections, the Committee will first discuss the route issue, and then discuss whether to allow Jewish, Arab, and British observers to participate in the meetings. As for whether the Committee will visit European displaced persons camps, it will be decided after arriving in Palestine.

### Philippine Vice President Goes to Europe

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 1st] Philippine Vice President Quirino took a plane from here today to Europe and will travel to various European capitals to establish Philippine embassies.

### The United States Will Soon Invite Relevant Countries to Discuss the Japanese Peace Treaty Issue to Convene the Japanese Peace Conference as Soon as Possible

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] According to well-informed officials today, the State Department is now speeding up the planning for the Japanese peace treaty. As a result of this progress, it is expected that the United States will soon propose to other countries involved in reparations to convene a peace conference. Secretary of State Marshall has not revealed which countries the United States will propose should participate in the actual drafting of the treaty. However, officials said that the United States' position is that when it makes a clear statement, it will not dedicate this task solely to the four powers, as was the case with the European treaties. Marshall and other officials acknowledge that Australia, the Philippines, and other countries, due to their contributions to the war against Japan, should have the right to participate in drafting the treaty. There are now indications that the United States will propose that most or all of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should participate in drafting the treaty. As for the date of convening the conference, the official said that the current goal is to do it as quickly as possible, as Marshall has decided to handle this matter as soon as possible. The assumption of Bernas, when he was Secretary of State, that the Japanese peace treaty should wait until the conclusion of the German and Austrian peace treaties, has now been completely abandoned. Although there have been repeated rumors that the United States is currently consulting with Britain or other countries on drafting plans for the Japanese treaty, no formal action has been taken so far. However, this action is expected to be implemented within the next month. Australian officials have demanded that the peace conference be convened as soon as possible and that Australia be given full participation rights, which has long been recognized here. Marshall declined to comment on Hoover's proposal that the United States sign a separate treaty with Japan if the United States cannot obtain the Soviet Union's consent. Well-informed officials said that the reason why the United States has adopted this attitude may be that the United States does not anticipate that there are any major differences between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the Japanese treaty, as was the case with the European treaties.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Hitoshi Ashida today hinted that the Katayama Cabinet, which was established only one day ago, has the ambition to conclude a peace treaty with the Allied nations as soon as possible. Ashida declared that he is planning to expand the current Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Central Liaison Office in order to prepare to convene a peace conference with the Allied nations as soon as possible. However, political observers believe that the Ministry's statement is hinting that the Katayama Cabinet hopes to meet with the Allied nations at the peace conference.

### The Soviet Union Provides Guarantees to Austria and Endeavors to Resolve the Issue of Austrian Prisoners of War; Soviet Newspaper Criticizes France for Violating Agreement on Repatriation of Nationals

[Associated Press, Vienna, 1st] An Austrian women's delegation, led by Prime Minister Jiffle, petitioned the Soviet occupation authorities today to repatriate Austrian prisoners of war held in the Soviet Union before this winter. According to Austrian officials, there are currently more than 100,000 Austrian prisoners of war being held in the Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia.

[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 1st] Soviet Deputy High Commissioner to Austria Seltov today provided assurances to a delegation of wives of Austrian prisoners of war that the Soviet authorities will continue to make efforts to resolve the issue of Austrian prisoners of war held in the Soviet Union. General Seltov expressed regret that some Austrian individuals are using the issue of prisoners of war to launch political movements.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 1st] Soviet commentator Korilov published an article in "Pravda" today, criticizing the French occupation authorities, especially the French occupation authorities in Austria, for violating the French-Soviet agreement on the repatriation of nationals signed on June 29, 1945. The article stated that the Soviet Union has repatriated French nationals in the Soviet Union or Soviet-occupied areas to their home country. The French Minister of Veterans Affairs and War Victims also told the National Assembly that there are no longer any French prisoners of war in the Soviet-controlled areas. On the other hand, some newspapers in the French occupation zone are urging Soviet nationals not to return to their home country but to move to France, Canada, the United States, or other countries. France's attitude violates the French-Soviet agreement on the repatriation of nationals.

### Addresses from Various Leaders

Mayor Wu said in his address, in brief: We must first thank the patriotic youth who abandoned their pens to join the fight when the Japanese invaders were rampant and the motherland was in peril, for their spirit of sacrifice. Now, the country is in disarray and needs unification; the people suffer and need stability. All passionate youth should, with a spirit of national interest above all else, unify the country, stabilize society, and engage in nation-building.

Commander Xuan stated: We have been demobilized for a year, but the demobilization work is not yet complete. The Communist Party is rebelling with force, undermining unification, and the Democratic League is also inciting people everywhere, creating social unrest. But we must also humbly examine our own shortcomings and strive to correct them. Only those who are sound themselves are worthy of talking about revolution. I hope our youth will work hard to invigorate themselves and engage in the revolutionary work of nation-building.

Speaker Pan stated in his address: We must emphasize unified construction. Shanghai is an international city, so every move affects the whole country. We are willing to assist the government in organizing a group similar to the "House Un-American Activities Committee" in the United States to investigate and eliminate elements disloyal to the motherland.

Committee Chairman Fang said briefly: The Communist Party and the Democratic League plan to instigate a "three strikes and one tragedy" movement today. Fortunately, thanks to the unity of our youth and the wise measures of Mayor Xuan and other leaders, their attempts have been suppressed. We need true democracy and true freedom, and we oppose "bandit democracy" and "bandit freedom." To oppose hunger, we must increase production; to oppose internal strife, we must suppress the rebellion to achieve peaceful unification and stable people's livelihoods.

Secretary-General Wu said: The most righteous youth once recalled the leader's call for "100,000 youth and 100,000 soldiers," at which time the Communist Party opposed the division most vigorously. However, this kind of conspiracy was ultimately defeated by justice. Today, after victory, China needs stability, unity, and study. Therefore, we oppose rebellion, division, and strikes. The youth present should be the main force for stability, unity, and anti-strike.

Subsequently, Brigadier General Gu Rongjun, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Youth Army's 202nd Division, accompanied the leaders from all walks of life and guests to inspect the ranks of the troops in military jeeps. The inspected youth were all full of energy and vitality, and the situation was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. After the meeting, they took trucks through North Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, and to Hardoon Road to disperse. Along the way, youth members dressed up to perform the crimes of the Communist Party. The conference also passed proposals such as a telegram to Chairman Chiang, a telegram to the National Political Council, a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the organization of the Shanghai Youth United Nation-Building Alliance.

### Telegram to Chairman Chiang

The telegram to Chairman Chiang from the conference is recorded as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, greetings. Since [the end of the war], two years have passed. We should have worked together, wholeheartedly, to elevate the nation to prosperity. However, the Communist bandits are rampant, engaging in secession and rebellion, selling out the motherland, harming our compatriots, and plunging the people into misery, causing our international standing to decline daily. Recently, in their desperation, they have incited student and worker unrest everywhere, creating social unrest. Thinking of this, I am extremely indignant. Therefore, we, the 50,000 patriotic youth of Shanghai, jointly declare righteous indignation, vowing to uphold the spirit of loyalty, courage, and patriotism, and under Your Excellency's wise leadership, to support the government's policy of unified nation-building and fully stabilize social order. We hope for clear instructions to guide the people towards a path of democracy. The nation will be fortunate, and all the people will be fortunate. The Shanghai Youth United Celebration of the Youth Army's Anniversary of Demobilization, respectfully submitted in winter."

[Another report] The presidium of the conference received reporters at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge at 4:00 PM, reporting the attitude of demobilized youth towards student unrest and the general situation, hoping for social stability and national unity. Therefore, the Shanghai Youth United Nation-Building Alliance was organized, welcoming youth and students from all walks of life to participate and work together.

### Police Officer Chases Suspicious Man, is Shot, Falls to the Ground, and Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment

[Our report] Yang Hanxing, a patrol officer from the Wujin Road Police Station of the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau, went out on patrol alone in a "free military vehicle" at around 12:15 AM yesterday morning. When he reached No. 41 Wujin Road, a man suddenly appeared facing him near the wall, wearing a dark old suit, walking from west to east, looking flustered. He immediately ordered him to stop and raise his hands for a search. Unexpectedly, the man ran away and fired two shots at the same time. Fortunately, Officer Yang was alert and dodged, quickly returning two shots, but missed. The man fled in chaos towards Wusong Road, heading to Hayer Road and walking east. Coincidentally, security guards No. 11633, 11944, and 12646 were patrolling and saw the situation, realizing it was not a good person. No. 12646 fired a rifle but also missed. At that time, the man had already fled to the front of No. 45, when Officer Yang aimed at his lower body and fired two shots, one of which hit him in the buttocks, causing him to collapse. At that moment, the man, fearing punishment, shot himself in the forehead and fell to the ground, dying instantly. After death, his right hand was still tightly holding a revolver, a bullet belt was tied around his waist, and his left hand held a black leather holster. The dead man appeared to be about thirty years old and had no identification, so his name is unknown. The body has been sent to the coroner's office for examination.

### Council Meeting Discusses Proposals, Elementary School Extending School Hours Problem Raises A Heated Debate, Passes Motion Asking The City Government to Instruct the Education Bureau to Deliberate and Handle

[Our report] The Municipal Council held its fourth meeting yesterday afternoon. Discussing proposals related to education, public works, public utilities, land administration, police, etc. The fifth meeting will continue to discuss proposals this afternoon. The originally scheduled closing ceremony will be postponed for one or two days.

Yesterday's meeting hotly debated the "Elementary School Extending School Hours by One Hour" proposal among the education proposals. The rationale for the original proposal was: "Elementary school students usually finish school between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM every day. At this time, most parents have not yet returned home from work, and there is no one to supervise them, which is very dangerous. Moreover, during this summer time, when the sunshine is good, schools can keep them at school for self-study or other work, to avoid wasting time."

Being Stuck in an Attic is Worse Than Staying at School

Council members offered various opinions. The original review opinion was "Please ask the City Government to forward this matter to the Education Bureau for consideration and handling." However, Councilor Wu Zhengkuo expressed opposition to this proposal. He believed that most elementary schools are not equipped ideally, and that elementary school students staying longer in such a school environment would have a significant impact on their health. Lu Yinchu believed that most elementary school students' homes are very small, and staying in an attic after returning home would be worse than staying at school. Tong Daoyun suggested delaying the afternoon class time by one hour, and also delaying the dismissal time by one hour (changing the current class time from 1:00 to 3:00 PM to 2:00 to 4:00 PM). Some other council members agreed with this proposal, but some councilors indicated that the Education Bureau should be consulted and that the Education Bureau should decide.

Eating and Walking Quickly Hurts Children's Health

Pang Jingzhou and Zhang Zhongyuan also stated that children often eat too quickly or walk too quickly to catch the class, which is harmful to their health, and should be delayed. However, Fu Xiaofeng stated: This method is not very good, because after the hard rules are implemented, it will be almost dark at four or five o'clock in winter, and the light in the classroom will be too dark. It will also be inconvenient for children to walk on the road after school. Therefore, the Education Bureau should decide in winter. Wang Xianzheng expressed agreement with the meaning of Councilor Chuan, and said that elementary school students can have more time to rest earlier. At the same time, many teachers still have other work or private affairs after teaching, which will be greatly affected after the dismissal is delayed. Finally, after a vote, most people passed the original review opinion, "Please ask the City Government to instruct the Education Bureau to deliberate and handle."

Councilors Question Zhu Ping About Renting the Site of the Zhongzheng Camp

Regarding the proposal to "transform the old site of the Zhongzheng Camp in Huacao Town into a secondary education area of ​​the city", the old site of the Zhongzheng Camp has more than 200 acres of land, which was rented by the Land Administration Bureau with a ten-year lease, causing councilors to question Director Zhu. Speaker Pan then stated: Article 2 of the Shanghai Municipal Council Organization Regulations, "The Functions of the Municipal Council", Clause 5 states "To resolve matters concerning the operation and disposal of municipal property." However, this was not mentioned in the Land Administration Bureau's report. Therefore, the city government is requested to report the land lease contract, area, rent, and leasing process at tomorrow's (ie, today's) meeting, and ask the council to discuss or ratify it. After the land issue is resolved, the proposal to transform it into a secondary education area of ​​the city will be discussed. The entire audience immediately agreed with this proposal.

Strictly Prohibit Exporting Antiques, Send to the City Government for Reference

In addition, the education proposals passed by the conference include: (1) "New regulations should be announced and explained so that everyone knows them and can implement them," it was resolved to ask the City Government to transfer the matter to the police and civil affairs departments to be jointly responsible for handling. (2) "Please ask the Education Bureau to order schools to give priority to borrowing classrooms when workers' organizations establish labor literacy schools," it was decided that the Education Bureau should handle this matter. (3) "Please exempt education funds from being deposited in all levels of schools run by people's organizations or factories," it was resolved that this association should send a telegram to the Ministry of Education and a letter to the Education Bureau to facilitate the exemption. (4) "It is proposed that the Municipal Education Bureau handle scientific models and conduct activity education," it was resolved to send this proposal to the Education Bureau for reference. (5) "Please ask the Education Bureau to earnestly build the Municipal Jiangwan Middle School building," passed. (6) "Please ask the Education Bureau to increase the funding for the Shanghai Municipal Museum to enrich its content and strengthen the city's cultural education," passed. (7) "The City Government is requested to find ways to strictly prohibit the export of antiques, and to instruct the Municipal Museum to select and purchase important antiques for preservation and display," it was resolved to send this proposal to the City Government for reference. (8) "Please recover the Hongqiao Airport as soon as possible, and actively establish the Zhongzheng Cultural and Educational Zone, to revive the city's cultural development and show respect for the national leader," passed.

### The Council Budget Committee Reviews Health Expenses Again

[Our report] Five councilors including Xu Yongzuo of the Municipal Council Budget Committee held a meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday morning to review several budget items such as health expenses again. After review, regarding: (1) The temporary fee for clearing accumulated garbage of 453,200,000 yuan and the aerial survey fee of 530,000,000 yuan in the first additional budget are actually necessary or were ordered to be handled, and have already begun to be carried out, so they are tentatively allowed to be included. (2) 187,825,000 yuan for repairing the garbage truck and 148,692,500 yuan for building urinals in the third additional budget. The former can be paid from the bureau's original budget for temporary repairs, and the latter is allowed to be listed as is. (3) The report will be finalized before this afternoon's meeting.

The City Government Policy Report Review Committee also held a meeting yesterday morning to review the report, which will be submitted for discussion at today's meeting.

### Jiaotong University Faculty Association Requests the Council to Express Approval

[Our report] The speaker of the Municipal Council reported two matters related to the student unrest at yesterday's council meeting: (1) Regarding the Jiaotong University Faculty Association's proposal that "the medical expenses of students injured in the May 30th conflict and the school's losses should be paid by the city government after investigation by the Municipal Council," the council should reply to express its agreement. (2) Councilors Zhao Yangxiong, Xi Yushu, and Yan Yilin were requested to attend this morning's Fudan University Faculty Board of Directors meeting. The conference unanimously approved the above two points.

[Another report] In order to understand the business situation of the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, the Municipal Council has sent a letter to the bureau chief Lou Guowei to attend the meeting this afternoon to report.

### Petitioners Arise

[Our report] Yesterday afternoon, trade associations in various industries in the city sent representatives to the Municipal Council to petition on matters related to the profit tax. Private radio stations also sent representatives to the meeting to petition for the abolition of unequal treatment with state-run radio stations. Education groups and private school colleagues went to the meeting again to petition for in-kind rations.

In addition, fresh meat merchants from the Central, Huxi, and Pudong districts of the city went to the Municipal Council yesterday to petition, stating that: In recent years, military police, including twenty troops, in the Central, Hongkou, Huxi, Pudong, and Nanshi districts of the city have repeatedly forced meat merchants in their respective districts to sell loss-making fresh meat, paying only 1,500 yuan to 2,000 yuan per catty, which is obviously unbearable exploitation. On the 30th of last month, after the representative of this association, Shi Zhigao, met with Deputy Adjutant Liu of the 33rd Regiment of the Military Police to conduct lobbying, they were allowed to pay a price of 3,000 yuan per catty from May 31, but it is still necessary to lose 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per catty. All colleagues are really unable to bear it, and they have come to the association to petition the higher-level authorities. Gu Ziyun, the person in charge of the association, separately submitted the grievances to the Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Government. Their expectation is to request a reply and to allow the military police to be restrained from forcibly purchasing loss-making fresh meat, so as to stabilize people's livelihood and relieve merchants' troubles.

Another report: According to the person in charge of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, the price of fresh meat purchased by this regiment (2,000 yuan per catty) was agreed to by the representatives of the Nanshi District meat merchants in advance. Recently, the price of meat has risen sharply, and the industry representatives have not notified us. Moreover, the military police of the regiment have never forced purchases.

“To Equalize the Average Development on Both Banks of the Huangpu River”

"Requesting the Central Government to allocate US$20 million from the US$500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States to build a cross-river project, so that the income from cross-river tolls and engineering benefits can be used to repay the principal and interest of the loan in equal installments," the resolution was passed as is. In addition to sending it to the City Government to transfer it to the Public Works Bureau for planning, it is proposed to ask the General Assembly to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan to approve the appropriation.

### Repair Old Zhabei Bridge, Open to Vehicles

### Health Bureau Staff Accused of Corruption and Malfeasance, The Court Opens the Trial

[Our report] The case of Health Bureau staff Zhu and Chen Boyu being accused of corruption and dereliction of duty by Liu Gulin and his wife Huang was heard in court yesterday. Liu Gulin was contracted to manufacture garbage trucks for the bureau. Due to rising prices, the delivery was slightly delayed, resulting in a balance of 22.1 million yuan, which he repeatedly requested the bureau to pay but could not obtain. Zhu and others used their positions to falsely claim that Liu's fines exceeded the amount he was claiming and that he needed to "smooth things over." On the 12th of last month, when Zhu and Chen accompanied Liu to the Shanghai City Bank on Jiujiang Road to collect the money, they jointly seized a package of 1.29 million yuan in cash that Liu had obtained. Liu refused to give it. During the dispute, Liu Huang called the police. Zhang Biao and other guards from the City Bank testified and escorted them to the Huangpu Sub-bureau, which forwarded them to the procuratorate for prosecution on charges of corruption. Zhu is in custody, Chen is on the run, and the case was heard by Judge Rao in the local court yesterday, who ordered a postponement for further hearing.

### After the Index is Unfrozen, Different Parties Have Different Reactions, If the Capital Side Really Cannot Bear the Burden, They Can Negotiate Openly to Resolve It

[Our report] After the announcement of the May employee living index, different parties have different reactions. Most manufacturers believe that they cannot bear the burden, and Yan Yaoqiu and others, the chairman of the Machinery Industry Association, went to the Social Bureau last Saturday to ask how to close the factory through legal procedures. On the employee side, most people are satisfied with the index, but they hope that prices will not rise again, otherwise life will still be difficult to maintain.

Li Jianhua, deputy director of the Social Bureau, told reporters yesterday that most people believe that the index announced this time is too large. In fact, the index is based on prices and is not fictitious. The problem now is whether the capital side can bear it. However, Article 5 of the Shanghai Wage Adjustment Measures states: "If the capital side has poor production and business conditions and it is difficult to bear the wages as stipulated in Articles 3 to 5 of these Measures, the labor and capital sides may negotiate to reduce them. If the negotiation fails, it shall be evaluated by the Labor and Capital Arbitration Board." Therefore, if the capital side really cannot bear the burden, it can convene a factory meeting with employee representatives to openly discuss and resolve it. Otherwise, closing the factory rashly, resulting in a large number of workers losing their jobs, is not a solution. In addition, there is another way, which is to ask the government to help solve the difficulties, such as purchasing raw materials on their behalf, eliminating unnecessary donations and taxes, facilitating transportation, opening up sales channels, and providing legitimate industrial loans, to reduce a part of the capital side's burden.

Shui Xiangyun expressed his feelings about the life index announced this month as follows: (1) What the government has decided today is a progressive calculation of 90%, which is a considerable concession for the labor side. Currently, the price index in Shanghai, according to unofficial statistics, is already around 40,000 times, and even if the workers' income is calculated according to the index, it is only the minimum living expense. If the factory side objects to this, it will inevitably cause labor unrest. (2) If a small number of factories cannot pay in full according to the index due to poor economic conditions, they should negotiate openly in the spirit of labor-capital coordination and mutual assistance to seek a solution. I believe that the workers' side will definitely not intentionally force the factory to collapse. If the capital side has real difficulties, the workers are willing to make concessions.

[Another report] Hu Boxiang and Tian Heqing, standing directors of the Industrial Association, went to Beijing together last Saturday, which is said to be related to the difficult situation of the factories after the life index was unfrozen.

Regarding the continuing discussion of proposals in the area of ​​public utilities: (1) "Lanes in the city lacking water pavilion (Taiping Dragon Head) street lights, please order the water and electricity company to add and repair them," it was resolved to send this proposal to the Public Utilities Bureau to order the water and electricity company to deliberate and handle.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Bao Dayong, the district chief of the eighth district of Xujiahui, was recently accused by Cheng Xiaodou, a resident of the district, of "coercive bribery."

To talk about national construction plans, we must first give the people a peaceful and stable environment and the opportunity to recuperate, while political innovation and the improvement of people's livelihoods require time and conditions, because this is reality, not magic, and must gradually transform and cannot change instantly. Therefore, the greatest task of Chinese students today is to face the current responsibility, unite and strengthen themselves, and strive to be the most progressive and greatest stabilizing force in society.

### Dire Situation at Hao County Normal School: Students Without Food, Forced to Disband

[Our Newspaper, Hao County] Hao County's County-run Simple Normal School suddenly stopped classes on May 27 and disbanded over 300 students in the first, second, and third grades on the 28th, leaving only over 100 fourth-grade students who will soon graduate. People throughout the county were surprised by this. This reporter interviewed Principal Su Pusheng of the school to learn the cause of the incident. Su replied that the school's student public grain has always been allocated by the provincial government under the item of public grain collected with land tax. The public grain allocated to the county last year, approximately 6,000 dan, was used for soldiers in the County Self-Defense Force, normal school students, and military prisoners. Unfortunately, all of it was plundered by the Communist army when they captured the city on February 1st of this year. The County Council resolved in March to allocate grain from this year's continued collection of last year's land tax. However, due to the severe spring famine, farmers are impoverished, and collection has been ongoing to no avail. In addition, the county treasury is severely depleted (the county's monthly budget needs 120 million, relying entirely on taxes, but currently only receives over 40 million per month, a huge difference, and many agencies are in arrears with salaries), so it is impossible to provide subsidies. As a result, the student public grain was stopped in May. Most of the school's students come from poor families and cannot afford to provide their own food. The school was forced to disband over 300 students in the first, second, and third grades, and only the more than 100 fourth-grade students who can afford to provide their own food will continue to attend classes until graduation in the summer.

The program and referee list for today is as follows:

Yuanjie—Sino-French (Youth Final) 5:45 PM Jin Botao
Zhenglun—Hualian (Friendly) 6:45 PM Wu Zibin Yang Liecheng

Youth Group Final

The Mayor’s Cup Youth Group Final adopts a best-of-three system. In the first game, Yuanjie unfortunately lost despite initially being ahead. Today is their second encounter, a chance to avenge their defeat. As it concerns the championship, founder Qian Xucang must have a brilliant plan to defeat the enemy. Sino-French, having won the first game, will surely win the championship if they win today, so they will put in even more effort to achieve their goal. A bloody battle is anticipated.

Zhenglun’s Momentum

In the main battle, Zhenglun meets Hualian. This match has been delayed for a long time due to Zhenglun's tour, and can be said to have been eagerly awaited. Zhenglun has won six out of six games in Shanghai, shaking the Huangpu River. Their momentum is high, and their reputation is such that they can be compared to Qunsheng. Each of their generals is like a dragon or a tiger. Under the leadership of Captain Cai, Yu Ruizhang, Liu Zhengjun, Cheng Fei, and others are brave and good at fighting. Tu Wenlong is an especially dangerous figure, throwing the ball with one hand and hitting the basket with 100% accuracy, which is the key to scoring. The team's energy is abundant, and their spirit of fighting to the death is popular. Today, against the champions, they will surely display their superior skills and put on a wonderful performance.

Hualian's Prestige

Hualian has won the basketball championship for two consecutive years, dominating Shanghai. Recently, they toured Xiamen, winning all four games and shaking South China. They have just returned. In terms of momentum, they are no less than Zhenglun. Individually, captain Kong Guangyi, national player Li Zhenzhong, as well as Chen Xuechong, Bao Songyuan, Ren Xiangcheng, and others are all veterans of the arena. Wu Chengzhang's performance in Xiamen was particularly good, and he is in excellent condition. He is young and strong, and is most qualified to deal with Zhenglun. Moreover, Zhang Liangxiong has returned, and Liu Fushan has also come to help, making the military strength abundant, unmatched by any other. The skill of their playing is secondary. Last year, they met Zhenglun, but because the players were ill and took to the court despite their illness, they suffered at the hands of their opponent. This time, the enemies meet on a narrow road, providing a chance for revenge. A fierce battle between dragons and tigers is expected. The rosters of the four teams are listed below:

Four Teams

[Sino-French] Fei Jiansheng, Cao, Hu Zhengkang, Li Xusen, Zhu Muping, Zhang Peilin, Zhu Guan Hong, Gong Hehua.

[Zhenglun] Wu Jian (Leader), Cai Zhongqiang (Captain), Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, Yu Ruizhang, Zhang Gensheng, Ji De, Wang Binghuan, Chen Baoshu, Ma Xilin, Cheng Fei. [Hualian] Cheng Boan (Leader), Kong Guangyi (Captain), Li Zhenzhong, Ren Xiangcheng, Bao Songyuan, Chen Xuechong, Zhang Liangxiong, Zhuo Guorong, Wu Chengzhang, Liu Fushan.

[United Press, Manila, 2nd dispatch] The Xingdao football team played against the Philippine Second Mixed Team (composed of famous Philippine football players) at Rizal Football Field on the 1st. The Rizal team won 4-0. It was drizzling in the afternoon, but the audience was not disappointed and flocked to the stadium, reaching more than 8,000 people. The Xingdao athletes, wearing yellow striped jerseys, were in high spirits. From beginning to end, they were impeccable, like eleven fierce tigers. Xingdao team center Zhang Jinhai opened the scoring. Before the end of the first half, left forward Zou Wenzhi scored another goal. In the second half, the Xingdao team still controlled the overall situation, and left winger Zhu Yongqiang scored two consecutive goals.

### Analysis of the Victory or Defeat of Hualian and Zhenglun; Strategic Application is the Key Tonight

Tonight Zhenglun battles Hualian. Some predict that Hualian can win, while others believe that Hualian will suffer a crushing defeat. These two different views are based on different perspectives and are not contradictory.

Last year, Hualian was initially defeated by Qunsheng, and the players suffered from diarrhea on the day of the match. They took to the court while ill, and their morale was low, which was the main reason for their defeat by Zhenglun. This time, Zhenglun has returned with a vengeance, winning all six games. Their skills have improved rapidly, while Hualian's morale is high and their recent performance has been excellent, making revenge not impossible.

In terms of overall teamwork and individual skills, Zhenglun is not as skilled as Hualian. However, Zhenglun's stamina and speed, as well as the accuracy of their shooting from both near and far, are also formidable. This game is nothing more than a competition of intelligence and strength between the two teams. Therefore, proper strategic application will become an important key to victory.

However, I personally believe that Hualian has more conditions to win: their advantage in the paint will undoubtedly be taken by Hualian. Lao Bao and A Di are currently at their peak, and Da Li and Xue Chong still have their old style. Hualian's individual ball control skills are on average above Zhenglun's.

Strategically, Hualian should strive to seize the initiative. The lesson of the Mayor’s Cup defeat by Columbus is a good one. Hualian may wish to maintain their consistent style, focusing on stability and giving up competing with Zhenglun in speed. They should use more short passes, and when throwing the ball, they must take advantage of the follow-through to minimize the chance of the ball falling into the hands of the enemy as much as possible. Because of their lack of physical strength, Hualian should not adopt a man-to-man defensive strategy, but should pay special attention to Tu Wenlong and Yu Ruizhang. If necessary, Da Li and Lao Bao can be assigned to guard them separately, not allowing them to have the chance to shoot the ball. Hualian still has Xue Chong and A Di to score. Kong Guangyi may wish to play. Lao Kong is more suitable to deal with these inexperienced fierce generals than Xiangcheng. It is hoped that Lao Kong's long shots can offset Liu Zhengjun's scoring, but it is still not advisable to try long shots unless the situation requires it.

In addition, Hualian should also try to induce personal fouls from Zhenglun. If one of Tu, Yu, and Cai is fouled out, the situation can be decided. If Tu Wenlong "graduates" before the last ten minutes, Zhenglun will be unable to compete with Hualian.

Unless Tu, Cai, and Yu have smooth shooting hands, Liu Zhengjun hits nine out of ten long shots, or Hualian's strength fails midway - especially Da Li, I believe that Zhenglun will hardly be lucky in tonight's battle. (Changnian)

### Shanghai Stock Market Plunges Across the Board; Illegal Trading Emerges Again

[Our newspaper's report] The Shanghai stock market replacement of cash with US dollar bonds was officially announced by the exchange yesterday. The multi-party groups like Nos. 152 and 211 painfully cut their losses, and Yongsha fell to the limit, with the dark market calling low to below 6,100 yuan. Nine out of ten stocks fell to the limit. The general public felt regretful about the exchange's announcement in two stages that cash delivery was only allowed for one month's extension and the US dollar bond substitute measure. Most of the trading was transferred to the illegal markets. The trading price of Yongsha in the black market was more than 100 yuan higher than in the exchange yesterday. It was heard from insiders that short sellers with a background bought 700,000 to 800,000 in the illegal market, while many multi-party groups also settled in the exchange and resided in the illegal market, so illegal trading became prosperous.

The market felt fearful from the morning opening. Although the immediate delivery stocks were relatively stable, they plummeted as soon as deferred delivery stocks opened. After deferred Yongsha opened, Nos. 231 and 1217 made up for losses, slightly rebounding. Nos. 76, 163, 119, 27, 102, 207, and 36 sold off, dropping to 6,820 yuan. Nos. 235, 155, and 14 absorbed slightly and rebounded a little. Nos. 117, 94, 12105, and 157 maintained at a low price, but the increase was not much. Matches first fell to the limit. Nos. 185, 153, 224, 104, and 152 sold off, and deferred Yongsha subsequently fell to the limit. China Silk, Lilian, Yonggong, and Huafeng successively fell to the limit. The dark market called low to below 6,480 yuan. Nos. 99, 160, and 141 came in to buy, and Nos. 61 and 99 bought spot Yongsha, once rising to around 6,650 yuan. However, under the strong selling of Nos. 102, 76, and 152, it finally fell to the limit again. Spot Yongsha, China-France, Tongyi, Xinyi, Jingfu, Qinxing, Xinhua, Xinguang, Jinglun, and China Textile successively fell to the limit. Nos. 211, 152, and 102 jointly sold off strongly, and the situation worsened. There was no trading, only supply and no demand. Near the close, deferred Yongsha fell to 6,150 yuan. After closing, Nos. 129 and 32 sold again, and it fell to below 6,100 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, immediate delivery stocks, except for National Goods which remained flat and New Asia which slightly declined, Cement and Commercial fell by more than 10%. Xinhua, Yonggong, Rongfeng, and Lilian had some rebound after falling to the limit, each falling by 10% to 20%, while the rest fell to the limit. Deferred delivery stocks also fell to the limit. The illegal market stocks each declined from slightly to down over half a percent.

Government bonds were weak yesterday due to the unfavorable environment and tight money supply. Unified C opened at 14,800 yuan and gradually fell to 113,400 yuan, with Rundet and retail investors selling. In the end, short positions were covered, and it hovered at 14,000 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Grades A, B, C, and D each fell by 1,000 yuan, and Grade E also fell by 900 yuan, with a turnover of about 6 million yuan.

Overseas stocks were sluggish yesterday due to poor sentiment and holders being eager to settle. In addition, Hong Kong's Shenzhen Electric also rose to 14 yuan, and Yisha had lost stocks found on the market. The market was very sluggish. The opening of Yisha fell to 69,000 yuan, with a high price of 70,000 yuan and a final price of 68,500 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British Union, Yisha, Steel, and Beer fell by 10%, and the rest fell by half a percent.

### Brokers' Three Hopes; Stock Exchange Decides to Submit to the Ministry for Approval; Opening Hours to Be Modified

[Our newspaper's report] The Stock Exchange Brokers Association held an extraordinary board meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the new instructions from the Ministries of Finance and Economics regarding the payment of US dollar bonds as margin. As a result of the discussion, it was agreed that the new measures of the authorities should be sincerely supported. However, it was also proposed to ask the authorities to take into account the actual difficulties of the brokers and find ways to alleviate them. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will approve three requests: (1) The broker's identity guarantee deposit of 30 million yuan will be fully paid in US dollar bonds in accordance with the order. However, due to the limited time, it is requested that the payment deadline also be extended to June 15. (2) The substitute for the deferred delivery transaction evidence deposit, in addition to the provision of payment with US dollar bonds, it is still hoped that it will also be able to use 26 listed stocks or cash for deduction. (3) The US dollar bonds paid can be used for the full face value. The above three requests were sent by the Brokers Association to the Stock Exchange authorities yesterday afternoon.

The Exchange held an extraordinary board meeting at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the three points requested by the Brokers Association. Chairman Du Yong, Standing Directors Xu Weiming, Zhuang Shuhao, Zheng Xiaozhou, and Wang Zhixin, Secretary of the Board of Directors Chen Xusun, Stock Exchange Assistant Yang Yinpu, Gu Shanchang, and Chief Secretary Hua Wenyu attended. The meeting adjourned at 7:15 PM. The main points of the meeting are as follows:

First, Stock Exchange Assistant Yang Yinpu reported on representing the Stock Exchange in explaining the current situation of the Stock Exchange at the City Council. Then, the discussion of various proposals began. The main resolutions were: (1) The housing contract with the former Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange has been signed and established. (2) The opening time of the Stock Exchange will be changed to 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM noon, which will be implemented after the announcement. (3) The three points requested in the letter from the Brokers Association were considered to be based on facts and will be submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Economics for approval.

### National Cotton Purchase Nearing Completion

The national cotton production area purchase has now been ordered to stop. All yarn factories and cotton firms in this city that had established branches in various production areas in the past are now closing. Very few goods have arrived in recent days, and the transaction volume of the industry is very small. The market is calm. After the war, due to the inability of transportation to be smooth, yarn factories and flower firms did not dare to inquire about cotton producing areas far from transportation lines. Some cities within the areas of Hankou, Shashi, and Xi'an and near the railway lines have been the focus of yarn factories and cotton firms' purchases, and their current inventory has been exhausted. For those farther away from the railway lines, the freight is very high and the time is slow, so yarn factories and flower firms cannot purchase. In northern Jiangsu, except for Nantong, where branches were established for purchase, most other places could not be purchased either.

### Textile Construction Sells Yarn

[Our newspaper's report] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn yesterday as usual, selling a total of 1,512 pieces, all sold to manufacturers, with a total of 970 purchase orders, it is said.

### Leather Prices Rise Sharply

Leather prices rose sharply as the black market exchange rate for gold notes and foreign exchange soared. Yesterday, the market called prices, with all goods rising by more than 20%. Transactions were very active.

### National Bank Studies Countermeasures to Strengthen Cloth Exports

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank discussed how to strengthen the export of cotton cloth. The discussion was held at around 5 PM yesterday. The Bank's Deputy Governor Liu convened representatives from the Export Promotion Committee, China Textile Construction Corporation, and the Textile Control Committee to talk and study appropriate countermeasures. It is heard that the government's export of yarn and cloth has been entrusted to China Textile Construction Corporation as an agent. Recently, after the company exported cotton cloth and settled foreign exchange with the National Bank, the discount was quite large. Furthermore, due to the recent sluggish market price of yarn and cloth in Southeast Asia, the resulting export revenue was less than one-third of the company's list price. If the company is still responsible for the losses, it will be difficult to maintain the agency export business. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that representatives from the National Bank, Export Committee, China Textile Construction Corporation, and the Textile Control Committee would go to Beijing to discuss with the Ministry of Economic Affairs the issue of who should bear the losses, in order to strengthen the export of yarn and cloth.

Another report: It is reported that since China Textile Construction Corporation started exporting yarn and cloth last year, the value of goods exported has exceeded five million US dollars. The export destinations include Hong Kong, Siam, Rangoon, Singapore, the Philippines, Java, Iran, Egypt, and Greece. Among them, most of the exports went to Hong Kong and Siam.

### Tight Credit and Sagging Yarn and Cloth Prices

Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly experienced tight credit, customer support stalled, and many took profits. In addition, China Textile Construction Corporation opened yarn sales with ample inventory, and prices tended to weaken. The price of 411-count Fengjian Phoenix yarn was 13.45 million yuan, down 200,000 yuan from Saturday, while 110-count Shuangma yarn was 7.8 million yuan, down 250,000 yuan. However, the coarse yarn market was more stable due to the limited supply. The price of yarn sold by China Textile Construction Corporation was similar to the previous period. Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was sluggish due to stagnant customer demand and some selling off. Credit was tight in the market, and resale was not weak. The final price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 323,000 yuan, and Caiqiu cloth was 295,000 yuan, down 14,000 to 15,000 yuan from Saturday. Other fine cloths, such as Wufu, Lanj, and No Brand, all fell by 10,000 to 15,000 yuan. The market for bleached cloth, fine twill, and pique was also weakening, while colored cloth, raw cloth, blue cloth, floral cloth, Fufu cloth, and low-grade Shilin cloth were relatively strong.

### Producer Prices Rebound; Rice Prices Slightly Rise; People's Food Allocation Committee to be Established Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the rice market turned slightly from weakness due to it being Monday and stores being more active. The market revived. In addition, producer prices rebounded, and cargo owners were unwilling to sell easily, so the market improved slightly. The total arrival of goods in the North and South markets was 8,351 shi, 7 dou, and 1 sheng. The price of high-quality white粳 rice was 420,000 yuan, and the price of thin rice was 415,000 to 420,000 yuan.

Regarding the purchase of rice by our government from Thailand and Burma, the Central Trust Bureau released the following news: Yesterday, 623 tons of rice shipped by Hualun Company Huimin from Siam arrived. Today, 1,500 tons of rice shipped by Yuanyang Company Yuanyang from Siam arrived. The day after tomorrow, 2,500 tons of rice shipped by Doulang Foreign Firm Bintang (Rintong) from Burma will arrive. On the 16th, Zhaoshang Haichen will also ship 7,000 tons from Siam. Yesterday, the price of flour varied slightly. The price of domestic flour and imported flour was stable. The price of Tongfen flour increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan due to demand from sauce gardens. The new wheat bran had just entered the market and was still sluggish, with a slight drop of 300 to 500 yuan. It was reported that a large batch of soybean cakes from Yingkou was shipped south, causing a sudden softening of prices. The closing price plummeted, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans were stable, tea bean transactions were extremely rare, high-quality goods were stable, and medium and low-quality goods were reduced by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The supply of red beans was abundant, but sales were slow, and the market was flat. High-quality sesame seeds from foreign firms continued to move, remaining strong, while the demand from medium and low-quality oil mills was normal, remaining mediocre. Raw peanuts were actively sold, with a price increase of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum was temporarily stable, while corn from Qingdao and the Beiyang region moved actively, with a sharp increase of 10,000 yuan. Cowpeas were similar, new broad beans had flat sales, and the market showed weakness. New Yuan wheat was first seen yesterday. The oil market saw a continuous supply of goods from Qingdao, and store demand was flat. Raw oil fell by 10,000 yuan, soybean oil was unchanged, refined oil was stable, sesame oil was slightly stronger, and new rapeseed, new broad beans, new barley, and new Yuan wheat have all gradually appeared. The People's Food Allocation Committee was scheduled to be established yesterday, but according to Section Chief Shi of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, the preparations for the People's Food Allocation Committee were mostly ready. Because Chairman Wu took advantage of this trip to Beijing to attend the price conference and contacted the Ministry of Food and other relevant agencies about all matters related to the committee, he remained in Beijing to carry out this matter, so he was unable to return to Shanghai as scheduled yesterday. The return was postponed until this morning, and the allocation committee had to be postponed to this afternoon for its formal establishment at the Shandong Shanghai Fellow Association.

### China Textile Construction Corporation Changes Yarn Allocation Method; Yarn Numbers and Weaving Industry Suspended from June

China Textile Construction Corporation has slightly changed the allocation of cotton yarn to various manufacturers starting in June. Because the Textile Control Committee stopped purchasing civilian factory support yarn in April, the yarn source has decreased. Starting in June, the company will temporarily suspend the purchase of cotton yarn for yarn numbers, dyeing and weaving industries, and mercerized groups. In addition, the purchase of yarn for the knitting industry, glove groups, and hand-weaving groups will be changed to unified quota purchase by the Public Management Association starting in June, for fair distribution. Cotton textile industry associations that have registered in other areas will be limited to purchasing yarn once a month, with the third Wednesday of the month as the allocation date. Electrical engineering weaving belts, camel hair, and woolen weaving will all be purchased by the Public Management Association, and the original registered distributors will be suspended.

### Flour Industry and Longevity Group Loans for Wheat Collection Agencies

The Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District requested a wheat collection loan of 320 billion yuan from the Food Department and the Four Joint General Offices. Factories in this city accounted for 240 billion yuan, but it has not yet been approved. It is now known that the Food Department has specific measures for lending to the industry. For factories in Shanghai, it is stipulated that the factories that collect wheat with loans must jointly organize a committee. All loan and wheat purchase matters shall be handled uniformly by the committee, and then the purchased wheat shall be distributed according to the production volume of each factory and the proportion of flour mills. The loan will be organized and handled by China Agricultural Bank, Bank of China, and Communications Bank. For factories in other areas, the China Agricultural Bank will be responsible for investigation, review, and lending.

The Food Department has notified the flour factories in this city of this method. The industry held a meeting yesterday and decided to first set up a loan-receiving wheat collection agency. According to the organizational regulations, each factory applying for a loan in this city will send one representative to serve as a member of course. There will be five standing members and one chairman. An office will be set up under the committee, and one director and one deputy director will be appointed to handle daily affairs. The director will be divided into four departments: loan, wheat, general affairs, and storage and transportation. It is heard that the committee will be established within one or two days.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten as the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar increased. The association's quotation for spot Peruvian sugar was initially 530,500 yuan, and later 542,000 yuan. The premium for warehouse receipts in the morning was 94,000 to 100,560 yuan. In the afternoon, it was 100,700 yuan, loosening to 95,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts for four-and-a-half carloads of white sugar were 140,000 to 145,000 yuan. The spot price for three-and-a-half carloads of white sugar was initially 515,000 yuan, and later 530,000 to 535,000 yuan. The spot price for 24 coarse white sugar was 580,000 yuan, and the spot price for 20 medium sand white sugar was 485,000 to 495,000 yuan, with a warehouse receipt premium of 130,000 yuan. The opening price for Xinghua white sugar was 470,000 to 650,000 yuan, followed by 453,000 yuan, and red sugar was 365,000 yuan, totaling several hundred baskets. More than two hundred bags of Diaoqing were priced at 300,000 to 300,500 yuan, dozens of baskets of Wenqing were priced at 283,000 yuan, Tiqing was priced at 334,000 yuan, and Shundeqing was priced at 312,000 yuan, with only dozens of transactions.

### Sluggish Cigarette Sales

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with vendors adding to their holdings, and prices rose slightly. However, hoarders released their goods, and vendors from other areas resold them, causing prices to gradually fall. The market atmosphere softened further in the afternoon, and rumors spread that Yongtaihe was distributing British American Tobacco (BAT) cigarettes, leading to sluggish sales. The final price of 10 BAT cigarettes fell to 6.95 million yuan, and Laodao cigarettes fell to 5.9 million yuan. Other Chinese-made cigarettes were said to have rebounded. As for Shantou cigarettes, prices remained stable due to the lack of mold.

### Another Silver Shop Closes

Qiu Tianbao Renji Silver Shop in Xiaodongmen also announced its closure after Fang Tianbao. The issue of severance pay for employees is also being negotiated, and a special agreement will be reached before closing the business.

Fang Tianmai Silver Shop on Nanjing Road began auctioning off its remaining inventory yesterday, and will close shop once everything is sold. However, the dispute over employee severance pay is still under negotiation.

### Huge Losses in Old Tea Sales; National Bank Agrees to Remedy

Shou Jingwei, general manager of the China Tea Industry Joint Company, went to Beijing to discuss the overseas sales of old tea and the tea loan for this year with the Four Joint General Offices, and returned to Shanghai yesterday from Nanjing. According to reports, the evaluation of last year's 70,000 catties of old tea is expected to be completed in early next week. The evaluation standards will be based on New York, London, and French North Africa. The sales method will be the responsibility of Xiehe Foreign Firm, Wang Yutai, Huacha, China Tea Industry Joint Company, and other companies, which will sell to their respective foreign affiliates. The exchange settlement method, calculated at 12,000 yuan, will result in huge losses for tea merchants, and the National Bank authorities have agreed to find a way to remedy the difference between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate. As for the tea loan portion for this year, China Agricultural Bank has lent 2.1 billion yuan. The amount is small, and the procedures need to be simplified. The original loan was set at three levels: 400,000 yuan for Pingshui tea, 500,000 yuan for Tunxi tea, and 600,000 yuan for Qimen tea. Tea merchants requested that the level be raised to 800,000, 900,000, and 1 million yuan. The authorities agreed to lend at three levels: 700,000, 800,000, and 900,000 yuan.

Another report: The domestic sales of Tunxi tea usually open around the beginning of summer, at 500,000 yuan per dan, falling to 450,000 yuan. Now that the domestic tea collection season has arrived, most of the tea is in the hands of hoarders. According to the Tea Industry Association's registration, there are more than one hundred processing tea merchants. However, due to the strict restrictions on the China Agricultural Bank loan, and there are few outlets for old tea in Shanghai, tea merchants are generally hesitant. According to the original plan of China Agricultural Bank, it is necessary to collect 300 dan of raw tea before applying for a loan. Recently, after repeated requests from tea merchants, the standard has been lowered to 100 dan, and preparations have begun more actively. It is heard that more than forty companies have started collecting raw tea, with prices around 300,000 yuan or more.

### Hankou Prices Rise

Due to lack of external sales for sufficient quantity white oil from Shanghai, the wholesale market saw a slight increase in prices yesterday. The wholesale price was 620,000 yuan per market unit, with few transactions, but retail sales were very strong. Hankou Guangbang's purchases became more intense, and the closing telegram was 515,000 yuan, with many transactions. The market situation was very strong, and prices are expected to rise further. It is heard that the black market price in Hong Kong can be sold for 1.15 million yuan per dan.

### Longan Has a Slight Turnaround

Miscellaneous road longan was weak and uninspired due to flat sales, but producer prices remained strong due to scarcity of goods. Recently, news from Quanzhou indicates that the cost exceeds the Shanghai market by more than 200,000 yuan, so it is not easy to loosen. Yesterday, the market opened with more than two hundred pieces, but the quality of the goods was inferior. The price was 1.05 million yuan, and high-quality goods were still 1.15 million yuan, but no transactions were made.

### Joint Request for Relief from Cloth Factories in Five Counties of Su, Chang

[Our Newspaper's Report] Cloth factories in Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Jiangyin, and Changshu have repeatedly requested yarn allocation without success, and the cost of living index for workers has skyrocketed, causing them to feel deeply distressed. A joint conference of cloth factories in the five counties was convened in Shanghai a few days ago. Representatives from the counties, including Wu Zhenshan and Wang Derun, and other fourteen people, attended. After discussion, it was decided that (1) regarding the application for yarn allocation, starting today, in addition to issuing a declaration, they will also petition China Textile Construction Corporation, the Textile Control Committee, and other organizations. At the same time, they will jointly appeal to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other relevant agencies, together with labor and management in the five counties. (2) The cost of living index for workers has soared, and inland cloth factories cannot afford it. However, the level of living in the inland areas is different from that in Shanghai, so each county should negotiate with the local labor representatives and the local competent authorities to discuss practical measures, with the principle of being approximately equal to 50% of the Shanghai market index. (3) Submit urgent appeals to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Four Joint General Offices, with the principle of approving the use of factory-produced machinery as collateral.

### More Selling Than Buying of Rayon; Market Prices Plunge; Factory Agents' Bids Slightly Firmer, Few Transactions

Yesterday, the opening price of rayon in the market remained the same as the original plate on Saturday. The highest bid for 120-count Gaoshan with light was 20.7 million yuan. Later, due to more selling than buying, prices fell steadily. The closing price was 20 million yuan. The afternoon market was affected by the stock market decline, and people were more nervous. There were no actual sales, resulting in a continuous plunge. In the afternoon, prices fell below the 20 million yuan mark. The final bid was 19.3 million yuan, a sharp drop of 1.2 million yuan from Saturday. Dongyang Jin Sanma and other brands also declined accordingly, and the price of 75-count semi-light was also reduced by 1.1 million yuan. Yesterday, the market transaction for factory agents was very quiet. However, the bid price was slightly firmer than on Saturday. The C-grade bid was around 28 million yuan, and the D-grade was bargained at 27 million yuan, but no transaction was made. There were few transactions for high-grade five-dan goods, and there were slight transactions for mid-grade another dan. The transaction price for mid-range goods was 24.5 million to 25 million yuan, and the price for high-grade another dan was 25.5 million to 26 million yuan, all with three to four day forward dates. The medium-grade second-tier bid was 23.5 million yuan, and the dry-grade another dan bid was 18.5 million yuan, but few transactions were made.

Yesterday, the silk market was stable with a soft tone. Dachung quilt covers were traded at 9.55 million yuan, and Huaqiang quilt covers were traded at 9.4 million yuan. Dachung checkered 壁绉 opened at 35,700 yuan and was once bid at 6,000 yuan. There were also slight transactions, but the price was low again, and the bid price returned to 5,700 yuan, about 200 yuan less than Saturday. Rayon goods, Huajin 绉 and 羽纱, were traded at 17,500 yuan yesterday, slightly less than the bid price on Saturday, and Shenghang and other goods had little change.

### Securities Exchange Brokers Subscribing to US Dollar Bonds

After the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs notified the Securities Exchange that part of the margin deposits must be changed to US dollar bonds, it was heard that brokers were planning to set up a Brokerage Subscription to US Dollar Bonds Custody Committee to solve the current difficulties and facilitate customer transactions. Each broker will subscribe to 10,000 US dollar bonds and hand them over to the Custody Committee for safekeeping. The funds will be lent to brokers for use based on the Securities Exchange's deposit account balance. It is expected that deferred transactions can continue as usual in the future.

### Plywood Prices Rise

Yesterday, the price of wood plywood rose because factory wages increased and factory quotations increased by 20%. The prices of other wood remained flat.

### Central Trust Bureau Resumes Allocating Rayon

The rayon sold by the Central Trust Bureau used to have a large gap between the allocated price and the market price. The market price of Tianqiao brand rose to 18.9 million, while the allocation price was still 5.3 million, which was unreasonable. A special report was submitted to the Executive Yuan for another price determination. Last week, the bureau received the Executive Yuan's approval. The approved price for Tianqiao brand was 9.8 million per box, the approved price for Dongyang, Jin Sanma, Peacock, and Earth brands was 9.6 million, and the approved price for Gaoshan and Zao Ri brands was 9.4 million. After receiving the order, the bureau resumed allocation yesterday (2nd). Three hundred and fifteen silk weaving companies in the city applied for a total of 1,780 boxes in advance, but the result of the allocation was only 178 boxes, and all were settled at the new price.

[Another report] The Committee for the Sale of Government Materials and Property, acting on behalf of the Central Trust Bureau, allocated rayon for the 29th time yesterday (2nd). A total of 315 silk weaving companies applied, and the allocation was made at one-tenth of the total allocation in December last year, totaling 178 boxes.

### Police-Civilian Cooperation to Eradicate Opium

— Xuan Tiewu

It has been one century and eight years since the 6/3 Opium Suppression Memorial Day. Yet, we still need to cry out and work for opium suppression. One cannot help but feel extremely emotional about this!

The history of China's opium suppression is also the history of the Chinese nation's struggle to resist the aggression and exploitation of international imperialists. More than a century ago, the Opium War, which was caused by opium suppression, was the first shot fired by imperialism to open up China's closed-door policy. It was also the first step in turning China into a semi-colony of international imperialists. Since then, China's coastal ports - all important commercial ports - were completely in the hands of imperialists under the constraints of unequal treaties. As a result, opium, red pills, white powder, and heroin flowed in large quantities from the coastal cities to all of China under the pretext of promoting commercial prosperity. They became the most vicious weapons for imperialists to extract money from the Chinese people and paralyze their nerves!

Due to the weakness and incompetence of the Manchu Qing government, China's first and most important opium suppression work suffered a failure and paid a heavy price.

Thus, for nearly a hundred years, the awakened outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation have not only had to fight for the revival of the nation and the independence of the country, but also to fight for the eradication of opium. They have not only had to struggle against international imperialists, but also against opium, an important tool for imperialist rule and colonization. The struggle for national revival and national independence is certainly very difficult, but the struggle against opium can also be said to be a struggle against the shackles and influences that imperialists have imposed on the Chinese people - especially the people in concessions - in terms of spirit, consciousness, and even daily life.

In the past fifty years, under the wise and outstanding leadership of the father of the Republic of China - President Sun, and his successor President Chiang, the outstanding children of the Chinese nation, from the Xinhai Revolution and the Northern Expedition to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, have already broken free from the status of a semi-colony and leapt to become one of the strong countries. This means that we have won the struggle against imperialists. However, the unequal treaties were canceled as early as during the war, and the concessions have been recovered for nearly two years. Yet, the shackles and influences that imperialists have imposed on the Chinese people - especially the people in concessions - in terms of spirit, consciousness, and daily life (opium is one of them) have not been eradicated with the cancellation of unequal treaties and the recovery of concessions.

The harm of opium to addicts is so profound that it not only harms themselves, but also their children and grandchildren. The reason why Shanghai has more opium addicts than other places is that, in the beginning, they were protected by the concessions, and the Chinese government's ban could not be extended. Later, during the occupation period, the policy of poisoning was one of the important strategies of the enemy and the puppet regime. In the middle of the concessions, there were many people with money and leisure who aimed to enjoy life. As a result, opium formed an indissoluble bond with this group. After the recovery, although the authorities repeatedly issued orders and announcements to persuade and even punish severely, it is necessary to have great perseverance and determination to quit opium, and to have the patience to endure the pain of opium addiction. This determination and patience are exactly what most addicts lack. Therefore, although Shanghai has been recovered for nearly two years, opium has not yet been eradicated.

In the current advanced countries, opium is only used as a medical drug. In Shanghai, an international city, there are still people who smoke and indulge in opium. This is not only a shame for Shanghai, but also a shame for all of China. We want to make Shanghai a modern city, and we want to make Shanghai a representative of China. We must eradicate opium in Shanghai within the shortest possible time and rescue Shanghai from the poisonous atmosphere of opium.

The government authorities should list the eradication of opium as one of the central tasks and severely punish those who manufacture, sell, traffic, and transport opium. However, to prevent every citizen from smoking opium, it is necessary for all citizens to cooperate with the authorities' decisions and assist them.

Everyone may doubt that strict opium suppression is the job of the police bureau. Why do the people need to assist? How can ordinary citizens without power assist in opium suppression? It is true that opium suppression is the responsibility of the police bureau, but for the police bureau to fulfill this responsibility, it really needs the assistance of all citizens. As for the specific methods of assistance, we can start with the following two points:

1. Persuade to Quit Opium: Whether he is your relative, family member, friend, fellow villager, neighbor... As long as he is a person who smokes opium, you should sincerely persuade him, explain the harm of opium to him, and tell him that smoking opium is an illegal act. Make the addict determined to quit under your persuasion.

2. Secretly Report and Expose: People who smoke opium are social pests. The existence of these pests is of no benefit to the country or the family, in public or in private. Therefore, we must report those opium addicts who do not listen to advice to the authorities, and the government will force them to quit. You must never condone relatives and friends, because the result of condoning is ultimately harming your relatives and friends. As for those who manufacture, transport, and sell opium, they are even more sinners of society. Every citizen should secretly report to the authorities when they hear news of manufacturing, transporting, and selling opium. The government will reward those who break the case due to secret reports.

I believe that now that police power has been unified, and the government authorities are actively working hard in accordance with their consistent methods, if they can obtain the practical assistance of the general public, opium in Shanghai will definitely be eradicated in the shortest possible time!

### Smoking and Nation Building

— Fang Zhi

Today (the 63rd year of the Republic) marks the 108th anniversary of Mr. Lin Zexu's burning of opium at Humen. As we are now embarking on nation-building, with countless tasks and everything requiring our accelerated efforts, we commemorate our predecessor. On one hand, we must strengthen our resolve to prohibit opium and build the nation, aspiring to emulate the sages; on the other hand, we should learn from the past to strengthen our concept of self-reliance and striving for strength. We know that for an individual to develop their career, they must first have a healthy body and abundant spirit, as the saying goes, "One point of spirit, one point of career." By extension, the wealth and strength of a country, the prosperity of a nation, cannot be achieved without a strong citizenry first. As the saying goes, a strong country must first have a strong people, and a strong people must first have a strong race. There is no country in the world where the people are poor, weak, and sickly, yet the country is wealthy, strong, and prosperous.

Since the late Qing Daoguang era, when the Qing government's internal affairs were corrupt and the country was weak, Indian opium was imported into our country in large quantities, catering to the desires of our people. The magnitude of its harm and the intensity of its toxicity can be said to be worse than airplanes and artillery. It not only made individuals mentally depressed and careers ruined, but it could even lead to the demise of a country and the extinction of a race. Therefore, Lin Zexu once cried out loudly, "If this disaster is not eliminated, there will be no usable soldiers and no funds to raise in ten years." During the eight-year war of resistance, the enemy manufactured highly potent drugs everywhere in our occupied territories, such as morphine, heroin, red pills, and white powder, and openly set up establishments, forcing our compatriots to smoke them. Their intention was to turn our Chinese nation into opium addicts and ghosts, barely able to continue the war of resistance, forcing us to national subjugation and racial extermination. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued an explicit decree at the time: "We must resist the war on one hand and prohibit opium on the other." Today, the work of nation-building is a "heavy burden and a long road," and its difficulty is even greater than the war of resistance. Every youth and every compatriot must have a strong physique and abundant spirit to strive for self-improvement and take on great responsibilities. Therefore, today, to accelerate the work of nation-building, we should strengthen the prohibition of opium even more.

However, the work of prohibiting opium has lasted for more than a hundred years, yet it still cannot be completely eradicated. News of drug trafficking and drug use is still occasionally seen in the newspapers. This not only gives people a sense of fatigue but even makes the general public doubt the policy of opium prohibition. Examining the reasons, in addition to the fact that some local governments cannot conscientiously implement the central government's opium prohibition laws, mostly perfunctory, making the work of opium prohibition enter a stubborn state, the main reason lies in the fact that some compatriots who are addicted to opium lack self-awareness and cannot have the determination to die yesterday and be reborn today. They even devise ways to evade and secretly smoke, willingly degenerating. At the same time, the general public does not recognize that the work of opium prohibition is related to the survival of the country and the rise and fall of the nation. Everyone should assist the government and work hard to promote it. They only manage "sweeping the snow in front of their own doors" and cannot bravely report it. Some even help to conceal it due to family and friendship. This is also the reason why the government's opium prohibition work cannot be thoroughly promoted.

In addition, there is also the widespread drug policy of the enemy in our occupied areas during the eight-year war of resistance, as mentioned above, which means that after our recovery today, the work of opium prohibition must start from scratch. At the same time, the Communist Party still widely plants opium in the so-called "liberated areas" and uses ignorant people to steal and transport it, not hesitating to poison compatriots and sabotage government orders, thereby taxing and raising troops, splitting up the area, and rebelling against the government. Therefore, the entire work of opium prohibition has been hindered. Today, as we commemorate our predecessors, we should recognize the disease and focus on the current situation. Compatriots who are addicted to opium should have the determination to die yesterday and be reborn today, and automatically repent and reform. The general public must recognize the severity of the opium scourge, adopt the attitude of persuading and admonishing people to do good and correct their mistakes, bravely report it, and unite to demand that the armed rebellious Communist Party lay down their weapons, stop splitting up the area, stop acts of undermining government orders, and abolish the so-called "liberated areas." One country cannot allow two different numbered armies, and one country cannot allow two governments. They should immediately return the military to the country and the government to the people, so that the country's military and government orders can be unified and thoroughly eliminate the opium scourge that has plagued our country for more than a hundred years.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once instructed us: "I sincerely hope with twelve-hundred-thousand parts sincerity that all compatriots in the country must use the same spirit of resisting the war and killing the enemy, work together with one heart, assist the government, implement the opium prohibition policy, and everyone regards opium prohibition as their own responsibility." Today, we should be vigilant of this instruction from the head of state, strengthen our concept of self-reliance and striving, take on our own responsibilities, work together to eradicate opium, eradicate all reactionary forces that hinder the work of opium prohibition and nation-building, and complete the construction of our Three Principles of the People China.

### Travel Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (Part 1) The Full Picture of the Revived Southeastern Artery

— Hangzhou, May 29th Quick News Reporter Huang Xingtian from this newspaper

Winding through the mountains of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, connecting the Guangdong-Han, Shanghai-Nanjing, and Ningbo railways, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is a major artery in the southeast. It not only solves the difficulty of "walking with difficulty" for travelers and provides opportunities for the sale and development of local products along the line but also facilitates the exchange of essential goods and rice for the livelihood of the people in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. Therefore, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is of extreme importance in the lives of the people in the southeast. Due to the complete destruction during the War of Resistance, the recovery of this artery, which bears a heavy responsibility and has made great efforts for the War of Resistance, has been difficult. The lack of funds and materials has made the recovery, despite the desperate efforts of the Railway Bureau over the past two years, only to extend the main line to Jinhua and the branch line to Lanxi. What I call "desperate" is not an exaggeration. Within the possible limits of funds and materials, the Railway Bureau employees have indeed broken the record in the history of road construction with the greatest speed, with an average of 2.6 kilometers of rail laying per day. Their highest record has reached 4.2 kilometers. If any recovery and construction work can be done with this spirit, then it will greatly reduce the broken remains on our country's land.

Now, the full-line track recovery project of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has established five engineering offices in Zhuji-Quzhou, Rao-Xiang, Xunnan, Nanchun, and Chunzhu to carry out track recovery work separately. The Zhuji-Quzhou section, which is 188.500 kilometers long, and the Jinhua-Lanxi branch line, which is 122.77 kilometers long, are mainly repaired by the Zhuji-Quzhou section engineering office. There are eight large bridges, sixteen small bridges, one first-class ticket office, three third-class ticket offices, and four fourth-class ticket offices in these two sections, all of which have been completed and opened to traffic. Currently under construction is the Jinhua-Quzhou section, which is more than 80 kilometers long. There are eleven large bridges, fifteen small bridges, one hundred and seventeen culverts, one open channel, two third-class ticket offices, five fourth-class ticket offices, and other equipment that have been completely destroyed by the enemy and need to be repaired. The project is arduous. In order to speed up the work, the Railway Bureau has divided the large bridges above 100 meters on the entire line into three areas and established large bridge engineering offices separately. The first area is located in Jinhua, supervising the repair of five bridges between Jinhua and Quzhou, including the Jinhua River, Lingshan Port, and Dongxi River. The bridge piers of each bridge have now been completed 90%. The second area is located in Liangjiadu, supervising the repair of large bridges between Shangrao and Nanchang, including Shangwan Port, Dengjia Port, and the tributary of the Fu River. The third area is located in Zhangshu, supervising the repair of large bridges between Nanchang and Pingxiang, including Jiaxi, Shanqian, the tributary of the Gan River, and Yuanshan. The bridge work in the Jinhua-Quzhou section is the most difficult. The reporter once went to Jinhua to observe the restoration project of the Jinhua River Bridge. The bridge is 282.945 meters long and 18 meters high, with a total of twelve holes. During the War of Resistance, enemy aircraft bombed it again and again, but failed to destroy it. Later, due to the withdrawal of the National Army, it destroyed six bridge piers itself. Now it has been repaired, but steel beams and steel bars are still lacking. According to Engineer Wang, the person in charge, who told the reporter: "The weather is good this year and the water level is low, so the construction is very convenient, but there is a lack of equipment. When we repaired the No. 9 bridge pier, we could only borrow a farmer's waterwheel for simultaneous use because the water pump was not enough, and it took more than 20 days. If there are no steel beams, we can only use wooden beams and change them to semi-permanent."

The reporter took a car from Hangzhou to Jinhua and Zhuji, passing through the entire revived Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. He felt that the Jinhua-Lanxi branch line was the most stable and fastest. The situation in the Zhuji-Jinhua section is also good; while the travel in the Hangzhou-Zhuji section is very bumpy, only 20 kilometers per hour. Therefore, the entire journey from Hangzhou to Jinhua is 190 kilometers, and the journey takes eight hours. The main reason is that the Hangzhou-Zhuji section uses 70-pound steel rails, and some of the sleepers have rotted; the Jinhua-Lanxi section uses 90-pound heavy rails, and the sleepers are brand new. "For the safety of the train," Commissioner Zhang Zongyao of the Railway Bureau told the reporter: "We are gradually repairing the tracks in the Hangzhou-Zhuji section, but due to the lack of village materials, we can only replace them sporadically for the time being; on the one hand, we are trying to strengthen the 36 relatively weak bridges among them, so that vehicles with a load of more than 40 tons can run. In order to cooperate with the development of the national construction railway transportation network, the Railway Bureau is determined to gradually revive this transportation hub across the southeastern provinces, enrich the equipment, cooperate with the machinery department, strengthen the transportation efficiency, and plan to build a large machine factory of 200 acres in Xiaoshan to manufacture other star material accessories. The most serious problem at present is the problem of vehicles. There are only six third-class passenger cars and three baggage cars in the Hangzhou-Shaoxing section; after the Hangzhou-Lanxi section is opened to traffic, the route is extended by one time, and passenger and freight transportation increases daily. Although the Ministry of Communications has allocated ten parts of freight cars and merchants have been recruited to undertake the construction of six passenger cars, it is still not enough. In order to cope with the current passenger transportation, 20 passenger cars and 150 freight cars have been borrowed from the Jinpu Railway in Qingdao. If the entire line is opened to traffic, the need for locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars will be even more urgent."

The direct train between Hangzhou and Lanxi is scheduled to start on the 25th of this month. The joint transportation between Shanghai and Jiangxi has been agreed upon with the two railway bureaus and can be implemented immediately. The Ministry of Communications has decided to complete the full-line opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway within the year. In the attention of the government and the eager expectations of the people, we hope that the employees of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau can continue the working spirit of the Jin-Zhu section, create new records anytime and anywhere, and quickly restore this major artery that connects the economy and culture of the southeastern provinces!

### Big Lanxi County, Small Jinhua Prefecture

"Big Lanxi County, small Jinhua Prefecture," this sentence has become a realistic portrayal again after the war. As the train passed through the fields of golden wheat ears and the forests of fine-leaved jujube trees, the first impression of Jinhua was that Jinhua retained her simplicity and honesty, but she had lost her former prosperity. From 1938 to 1941, it was the golden age of Jinhua. "Small Jinhua Prefecture" far surpassed "Big Lanxi County." The population increased to more than 100,000, becoming the only transit point in eastern China during the War of Resistance. Thousands of small merchants, porters, and smugglers came and went endlessly, crowding the more than 200 temporary hotels, smuggling a large amount of materials from Hangzhou, Shanghai, Ningbo, and the entire enemy-occupied area across the blockade line, passing through here, and dispersing to the rear. At that time, Jinhua was truly a glorious city. But just like the changes in the Jinhua River, the Jinhua River was turbulent in 1939, a normal river close to Jinhua; in 1941, the water flow gradually decreased; today, the water is shallow and the river is wide, and large sandbars rise in the middle of the river. The water flow does not have a definite mainstream, and it does not look like a big river at all. And Jinhua, after the ravages of the enemy cavalry, victory deprived her of her prominent economic position, causing the market to decline eight times and the population to decrease five times, falling behind Lanxi again. Therefore, some people say: "Jinhua was a nouveau riche during the war, and now it is a ruined family that cannot be restored." But I think Jinhua's inability to recover is temporary. The War of Resistance has changed the ancient appearance of her prefecture city and has the spirit and scale of a modern city. As long as the entire line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is open to traffic, and with more active construction, Jinhua will definitely be able to regain her youth.

Although the economic value of Jinhua has declined, her local economy can still be self-sufficient. The annual output of rice is 1,795,000 dans, wheat is 154,000 dans, soybeans are 30,000 dans, and miscellaneous grains are 498,000 dans. The grain output is not only self-sufficient but also has a small amount of exports. The annual output of rosin is 12,400 dans, and tung oil is 8,800 dans, which are important specialties and are all exported. Although ham is named after Jinhua, the important production areas are in Dongyang (20,000 dans) and Fuyang (5,000 dans). Jinhua not only has a small output, but also cannot buy good top-quality hams in the market. In addition, tea, lime, Buddha's hand citron, jasmine, writing brushes, paper umbrellas, and firecrackers are also important specialties of Jinhua.

### The Cultural City of Eastern Zhejiang

Rather than saying that Jinhua is the political and economic city of eastern Zhejiang, it is better to say that she is the cultural city of eastern Zhejiang. Now Jinhua has a National Yingshi University, a Provincial Jinhua High School, three private high schools: Zuoxin, Chengmei, and Sanwu, one Ba Wu Girls' High School, one Simplified Normal School, and one Provincial Jinhua Agricultural Vocational School. There are 25 Central National Schools, 202 Bao National Schools, two private elementary schools, and 75 junior elementary schools. In terms of social education, there is one Provincial People's Education Center and two People's Lecture Halls. Following the large number of schools, there are nine bookstores, including Commercial Press and Victory, where you can buy the latest magazines published in Shanghai, but new books are very scarce. There is only one tabloid "Guide News," which is smaller in scale and poorer in content than other second-tier counties in eastern Zhejiang. This is an abnormal bad phenomenon. Fortunately, you can see the current newspapers of Shanghai and Hangzhou, which can slightly relieve the hunger of spiritual food.

Yingshi University is a beautiful flower in the cultural circles of eastern Zhejiang, but recently, the student unrest at Yingshi University broke the tranquility of the cultural city and shocked the whole country. The focus of the student unrest is that the students are dissatisfied with the simple temporary school buildings and demand to move to Nanjing or Hangzhou. For this reason, the reporter made a special visit. The entire school has only four colleges, but they are distributed in five areas, and only the College of Engineering is concentrated in one place. The others are scattered and disorganized. A single College of Liberal Arts, classrooms and student dormitories are scattered in five places, which is bound to cause student dissatisfaction. The main reason is that the school does not have its own buildings and can only rent private houses, using temples, shrines, and ancestral halls. Some of the leases are about to expire. The simplicity of the houses is unimaginable to the people of Shanghai. The lime walls shake when you touch them, there are no electric lights, and there are no glass windows. The president's office is just like the temporary room of an engineer. Therefore, teachers and students of the entire school expressed great dissatisfaction with the school buildings. According to the current acting president, Zhou Shang, Dean of the College of Engineering, he told the reporter: "Our school currently has more than 80,000 books and instrument equipment that is no less than ordinary universities, which can be used for any kind of experiment. And the environment of Jinhua is quiet and the folk customs are simple and honest, which is suitable for concentrating on studying. Therefore, the focus of the problem is not moving the school, but the need for a permanent school building of its own. If the relocation fee of 10 billion yuan is used to move the school to another place without existing school buildings, it is better to build school buildings in Jinhua." I think Dean Zhou's words are very right. In fact, the permanent school buildings of Jinhua have long been designed, and the estimated cost is 30 billion yuan. Now that prices are soaring, it costs about 60 billion yuan. If the Ministry of Education really wants to complete his national university network plan, then he should allocate this fund as soon as possible.

Lanxi is purely a commercial city. The water conservancy of the Fuchun River has created a superior position as a water transportation center for it. The prosperity of the market far exceeds that of "Jinhua Prefecture." The current population is 278,826. Each person has an average of nearly two acres of cultivated land. The annual output of rice is 2 million dans, wheat is 300,000 dans, and miscellaneous grains are 70,000 dans. The main specialties are rosin 35,000 dans, candied dates 50,000 dans, tung oil 5,000 dans, bayberries 3,000 dans, and ham 5,000 dans. The export of ham is about 64,000 pieces, tung oil 5,000 dans, and rosin 15,000 dans; imports are mainly daily necessities. There is a glass factory and a cotton textile factory in the county seat, although the output is not very abundant; the family industry is mainly the textile industry, and the number of people engaged in it is about 10,000. The county's farmland tax quota is 88,376 shi, and 80,266 shi have been collected, with a percentage of 91%. The quota for various donations and taxes reaches 805,150,000 yuan, but only 10.9% has been collected. But in any case, compared with Jinhua, Lanxi is much more prosperous.

### Jinhua Cave is Far Better than Seven Star Cave

Beishan Scenic Spot is one of the "36 Grotto Heavens and 72 Blessed Lands" mentioned by Taoists in the past. It was famous in the Tang Dynasty and flourished in the Song Dynasty, and it is the most peculiar and beautiful place in eastern Zhejiang. People who have been to Jinhua always feel that although the mountains and rivers of Guilin are the best in the world, the Seven Star Cave of Guilin is not as good as the Jinhua Cave. Jinhua Cave is the general name of Shuanglong, Binghu, and Chaozhen three caves. It is located in Beishan (ie, Jinhua Mountain), 26 li away from Jinhua County. You can take a car from Jinhua to Luodian, a distance of eight kilometers, which can be reached in 15 minutes. From Luodian to the north, only ten li, walk along the stream, the mountains rise and fall and the sound of water gurgles; the scenery is beautiful, much better than the Nine Streams and Eighteen Ravines of Hangzhou. Along the way, there are also the ancient sites of An Qisheng's hometown, the tomb of Princess Kangyi Qin of the Song Dynasty, and the Buddha Longevity Pavilion.

Shuanglong Cave faces east and faces west. It is located at the northwest foot of Jinhua Mountain, 1,050 feet above Jinhua City. It is adjacent to Binghu and Chaozhen Caves. There are two natural stalactite dragon heads at the outer cave entrance, protruding from the cave entrance, one of which has been lost. The cave entrance is extremely large, with a width and depth of more than ten feet. The light is sufficient, and it can accommodate two or three hundred people. There are scenery such as "Mr. Lu's hiding place," Big Dipper star nests, fairy plums, stone clouds, and stone Taoists, all of which are the works of stalactites. There is a hole in the depths of the outer cave, like a toad's chin, and clear springs flow out of it, which will not dry up even in drought or flood. Going upstream, it is the inner cave. There is a very large flat-bottomed rock on the spring, only a foot away from the water surface. Therefore, to visit from the outer cave to the inner cave, you must lie on your back on a small boat, light a gasoline lamp to lead the way, and enter with a rope pulling the boat. At this moment, people's spirit is extremely tense. You must hold your breath and lie still, watching large pieces of rock closely pass by your face, your heart beating rapidly, with a psychological feeling of terror and curiosity, as if passing through the cave leading to the Plum Blossom Source, or driving to another strange world. The inner cave is indeed a strange place, deeper and wider than the outer cave, and more tortuous and strange. The entire cave is dark, and you must light a lamp to lead the way. Looking up when entering the cave, there are two stone dragons, yellow and green, opening their mouths and holding their claws, coiling around the left and right. Therefore, it is named Shuanglong. The cave walls are glittering, like flying dragons, like lions and tigers, like immortals and Buddhas, like clothes and shoes, like rising and lying. According to Xie Ao's "Record of Figures and Ancient Sites of Jinhua Cave" in the Song Dynasty, there are 57 kinds in total. There are still inscriptions on the cave walls from the Tang and Song dynasties, and the stone carvings carved in the fourth year of Wanli are the clearest. The inner cave is warm in winter and cool in summer. The reporter sweated in single clothes outside the cave, and still did not feel warm when he put on a jacket in the cave!

### Reading Wen Tianxiang's Poems

— Xiang Peiliang

Judging solely on the military successes or failures, Wen Tianxiang's career can be said to be insignificant. The time involved was short, and there were only a few small, fleeting battles that ended in defeat. He was purely a scholar who had only held a few local official positions. During Jia Sidao's time in power, he was unwilling to advance in his career. At the age of thirty-six, he developed the Wenshan new residence, with quite the intention of retiring, saying himself: "I intend to wait until forty-three years old, then request retirement, like the story of Qian Ruoshui." In 1275, on July 7th, he raised an army to support the emperor. By August, he had reached Hangzhou. The following January, Yuan forces had already surrounded Lin'an. On January 20th, he entered the Yuan camp to negotiate peace. On February 8th, he was forced to travel north by the Yuan forces. On the 29th, he escaped in Zhenjiang, and after countless hardships, fled to Fujian in April. The following year, he went to southern Jiangxi to raise an army, starting his activities in May, and achieving two small victories in June. On August 27th, his army was defeated at Kongkeng. Such battles were simply no match for the Yuan forces. "In August, Li Guida with 1,000 regular troops and several thousand militia stationed at Zhongbu. They encountered the northern army, and the militia was frightened and scattered. Within ten days, Bian (Zhang Bian), Shang (Zhao Shishang), and Shen (Zhao Mengying) led tens of thousands of militia to besiege Ganzhou. The northern army charged with a hundred-odd cavalry, and the crowd fled." (See Chronicle Record) After this defeat, he traveled from Fujian to Guangdong. The following June, he visited the young emperor at Yai Shan. On December 20th, he was captured by Zhang Hongfan's troops at Haifeng. The above is the complete political and military activities of this great figure throughout the ages. From a utilitarian point of view, these activities are too insignificant to be worth mentioning. I specifically point this out to show that the career of a great person is not necessarily built on a foundation of utility.

There is a supremely great spirit in Chinese culture, the so-called "knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it." Calculating the situation, one clearly knows that there is no hope of success, but one cannot let go of this conviction; one can only feel at peace by doing it no matter what. Therefore, one completely abandons the calculation of success, failure, benefit, and loss, and even refrains from harboring illusory hopes, but simply does what one believes should be done according to this conviction. When he started his uprising in Jiangxi, "His friends stopped him, saying: 'Now the great army is advancing with great momentum, breaking through the suburbs and approaching the heartland. You are going to meet them with a motley crowd of ten thousand, which is no different from driving a flock of sheep to fight a ferocious tiger.' Tianxiang said: 'I also know that this is the case, but the state has nurtured its subjects for more than three hundred years. Now, in a time of crisis, not a single soldier or horse in the entire country has entered the pass. I deeply resent this, so I do not overestimate my strength and sacrifice myself for the state.'"—Song History: Biography. The Chronicle Record records his own response to Bo Luo's question: "Since you know it cannot be done, why do it?" He replied, "A subject serves his ruler as a son serves his father. If the father unfortunately falls ill, even if one knows it cannot be cured, how can one not give medicine? I am doing my best; if it cannot be saved, then it is fate." These two passages best explain the principle of "knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it." Whether things succeed or not is left to fate. As long as the principle that should be done can be demonstrated and spread, naturally someone will continue to do it, and the situation will gradually change. Eventually, one day, this principle will be revealed to the world, and this matter will be successful. It was ultimately Wen Tianxiang, Lu Xiufu, and Zhang Shijie who drove away the Yuan people. With military strength unparalleled throughout history, the Yuan dynasty swept across Eurasia, invincible, but could not defeat these few individuals.

Wen Tianxiang's important works include "Guide Records," "Sequel to Guide Records," "Collection of Chanting and Whistling," and "Collected Du Poems." The other poems were written before his service to the emperor and are not enough to fully express his unique sentiments. "Sequel to Guide Records" starts with the poem "Crossing the Han Dingyang on the Twelfth Day of the First Month of the Year Ji Mao," when he had already been captured by the Yuan army, and ends with the poem on the Dragon Boat Festival in the Year Ren Wu (there are a few poems after this, but the dates are unknown), a period of four years. He was killed in December of that year. The time of "Collection of Chanting and Whistling" is not very verifiable, roughly from the time he was arrested until Xin Ji (the year before his death). The number of poems is not large, and the time overlaps with "Sequel to Guide Records." "Collected Du Poems" consists of two hundred poems, collecting five-character lines from Du Fu's works to form five-character quatrains, recording the experience of disorder and separation. It was completed in the Year Geng Chen (two years before his death). "Guide Records" records the journey from his mission to the north to being forced to travel north, then escaping midway and traveling to Wenzhou. From January 13th to April 8th. In the preface, "One volume is for the mission to the Northern Camp staying outside the Northern Pass. One volume is for leaving the Northern Pass, passing through Wumen, Piling, Guazhou, and returning to Jingkou. One volume is for escaping Jingkou and going to Zhenzhou, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Taizhou, and Tongzhou. One volume is for traveling from the sea to Yongjia and coming to Sanshan." There are a total of 178 poems, mostly seven-character quatrains. Most of the poems have prefaces, detailing the intervening events.

Among poets of all ages, none has been in a more difficult situation than Wen Tianxiang. On the one hand, he bore the responsibility of national politics, and on the other hand, he lived the most impoverished life. Two sons and six daughters all died in the war. He was imprisoned for four years and finally martyred for his country. After being imprisoned, he was simply determined, not losing his integrity, only seeking death. The period recorded in the Guide Records, on the one hand, was the most dangerous, and on the other hand, he harbored hope, not daring to sacrifice himself. His mood at this time was the most distressed. The six poems recording events precisely express this mood: "The affairs of the Three Palaces and Nine Temples are precarious, the wolf's ambition is still unknown. If there is no one to subdue the mad barbarians, which man in the southeast is a man?" (One) "Figures of Spring and Autumn are capable of speech, the nation often survives by words. I also face danger with eloquence. The north wind fills the wilderness, bearing the universe." (Two) "A hero is unwilling to rest before death. The wind rises, the clouds fly, freedom is lost. Kill me and send me outside the Hun Tong River, surely there is no Cao Han to guard Youzhou!" (Six) "A hero is unwilling to rest before death!" What kind of spirit is this! In difficult circumstances, prolonged imprisonment, he never gave up hope. Until seven years after the fall of the Song Dynasty, five years after Yai Shan, he finally did not yield, and this stemmed precisely from this kind of spirit.

One of the two Wang's poems says, "A single horse crossed the river and opened the Jin Dynasty, five dragons supported the sun and restored the Tang Dynasty. The descendants of the imperial family are truly blessed, the fate of the barbarians has never lasted a hundred years." Because he held this kind of hope, he constantly planned to escape. Returning to Jingkou, he wrote, "I will leave early like Tian Wen, never stay like Su Wu. I would rather die by the sword than endure death and burn the boat. The escaping steed thinks of surpassing the ride, the flying falcon aspires to escape the reins. Ascending the tower and looking at the river, I count the boats every day." Later, he finally escaped in Jingkou. Du Hu was in charge of everything for him. This was a righteous man who always stood by Wen Tianxiang's side and died of illness after being captured after the defeat at Yai Shan. The twelve lines of the Seven Quatrains of Escaping Jingkou depict the infinite suffering of the time. Arriving at Zhenzhou, he discussed with Miao Zaicheng, planning to send out all the troops, harboring dreams of restoration. At that time, he had a poem that said: "Nanba returned in vain when the Tang fortress fell, Bao Xu went out once and the Chu territory was restored. Now the survival of the country is decided, it all depends on the advance and retreat of the commander-in-chief." But this was only a dream. He was immediately driven away by Li Tingzhi. This unwarranted misunderstanding added another layer of hardship to this great man with a heart of steel.

The poem "Leaving Zhenzhou" at the age of thirty-three resonates with blood and tears. Compared to escaping from Jingkou, not only is the time longer, but the mood is also vastly different. "The Qin River cries with blood forming a stream, surprisingly Zhonghang can be whipped on the back. The north and south both know the bitterness of loyalty and righteousness. In my life, I only lack the fate of Lianghuai." Reaching this state, he almost thought that his fate was so doomed. After being expelled from the city, Miao Zaicheng led a small team to escort him, originally intending to suspect him and investigate the truth. But Wen Tianxiang, with his heart set on the monarch and the country, was determined to meet with Li Tingzhi to distinguish right from wrong, and finally moved the escort, who pointed out the road to Yangzhou: "A thousand gold braved danger to escape Shi Qiu, who would have thought that the southern bandits would be alarmed instead? Remember the matter outside the Xiaoxi Gate, every year on Shangsi Festival, weep at the river!" "What do you want to do getting off your horse in the wilderness! Life and death are up to you. If it weren't for the white soldiers having eyes, who would know there is a ball of grievances?" "I will cut off my head and face Guangling, I have no one to appeal to in heaven. It is better to entrust my life to the East Sea, still riding the wind near the Jade Capital." After arriving in Yangzhou, he was not allowed to enter, and the area outside the city for hundreds of miles was within the sphere of influence of the northern army. Four people from his entourage stole gold and fled. Fortunately, he met a woodcutter who led him through a secret path to Gaosha. On the way to Gaosha, he encountered a northern army patrol - many of his companions were killed or wounded. Even such a man of iron will said, "After the pain subsides, I think about the pain, and the tears are like rain." The five-character poem "Immediate Events in Ji Zhuang" says: "Gaining the heart of the royal family, I march south day and night. Treading on danger, I would rather not regret it, holding loyalty, I would rather see it clear. The sound of geese connects with the color of the water, distant mountains are level with the sky. In vain I cry on the desolate road, a man seeks death in life."

From Gaoyou, Hailing, Rugao, he turned to Tongzhou, and obtained a sea boat, and then floated to Wenzhou. But no matter how difficult, he never frustrated his ambition. The five-character poem "Immediate Events" says: "Crying bitterly, I bid farewell to the Jingguan, walking secretly, I visited the seagate. I have not heard the crowing of a chicken for a long time, and I have new lice to feel. White hair should grow more, and there are few servants left. But if my body is not dead, I will repay the universe with all my strength." This kind of dedication, giving one's all until death, is the spirit of our country's patriots and benevolent people. Because of this spirit, no matter how unwilling to admit defeat, one will eventually achieve the long-cherished wish. The seven-character poem "Arriving in Wenzhou" says: "Thousands of miles of wind and frost have streaked my temples, adrift, looking back, my ambition is sad. Has snow come down under Mount Luofu? Who does the moon shine on at the head of the Yangtze River? I only said that the tiger's head was not a noble appearance, I did not expect the ram's teat to have a return date! Taking the tide to Zhongchuan Temple, I secretly read the second stele of Zhongxing." The five-character poem "Self-Lamentation" says: "Sleeping on the grass, exposed to the dew, dining on pine, standing in the evening wind. I lament my existence in chaos and separation, who shares the hardships! Zu Yao has the ambition to cross rivers and mountains, Cheng Ying has the merit of the state. I plan for a hundred years, the universe is vast and boundless!"

Reading Wen Tianxiang's poems, I am filled with sorrow and melancholy, truly evoking countless emotions. Chinese poetry is mainly gentle and honest, using allegory as its method. It does not directly express personal feelings much. The purpose of writing poetry is to seek peace in poverty, so like Du Fu, even when experiencing hardship, one often uses humorous self-deprecation. Only Wen Tianxiang disregards everything, fully expressing his grief and indignation. This is truly a sound of decline. However, just as his "righteous spirit" exists between heaven and earth, making every reader stand upright and resist corruption, this kind of work fully expresses the spirit of knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it, which cannot be fully explained by my country's poetry or Western tragic theory. (May, 1947, Suzhou).

### Sleeping Posture

— Xiao Shufang

### To Little Lotus Flower

— Li Baifeng

The weather is so clear and bright

Dewdrops have retreated from the lotus leaves

Willow branches cast their shadows into the bright water

I visit your beautiful little lotus flower again

Peeking out of the gaps in the leaves above the water

Reluctant to bloom for so long

Is it because the sun has not yet shone?

Proud little lotus flower, bloom!

Don't wait for the sun -

Squandering your youth, old age will come in the blink of an eye

### Huangpu River

— Nie Ping

You murmur and flow with turbid waves all year round,

Endless waves imprinted with ancient wounds,

A mighty current, a living history,

Having experienced countless changes and vicissitudes.

You tell people: how magnanimous Lord Chunshen was,

A hundred years ago, it was nothing more than a barren fishing ground,

The Opium War brought prosperity and disaster,

The anti-Japanese bloody battle reflected unparalleled brilliance...

You embrace this bustling city,

Listening to its roars and its soft songs;

Like an enthusiastic young girl, you use your

Powerful arms to embrace your lover.

Coal smoke covers you with a layer of black gauze,

In the sounds of groaning, the morning sun rises,

When night slowly descends on the river,

You rest after a day of busyness.

You bring supplies to the large city,

And send grain-filled warehouses to the big merchants;

But the countless hardworking people,

Also live on your body.

Skimming past sampans,

Sailing past warships and giant ships,

You silently endure,

Never minding how much weight there is.

But when you are angry,

Every wave is like hair standing on end,

The world changes color because of it.

Seagulls soar with you,

You love freedom.

You yearn for the vast ocean,

The concession can't stop your progress,

And the headwind can't change your direction.

### Noon

— Shi Ying

When the plums are yellow,

The low air pressure of May.

A patch of grayish-white floating clouds,

A middle-aged man's melancholy.

A piece of music ends,

The violin string gently stops,

Rippling in my heart.

That unfinished silent sound.

The past grief and joy of the clouds.

The gorgeous colors

Sink into a faint dream.

### Short Note

— Lü Zhuang

Last spring I wandered in a dark place

Where brothers cried with chains

They washed the years and swords with tears

This spring I reopened to that place

A thousand cliffs and crevices full of wild grass

With green little leaves seeking the distant sunlight

Thousands of years of rock cannot suppress a blade of grass

Thousands of years of chains will eventually be shattered

Our will, our ideals will bloom!

### Tomorrow

— Jiao Ben

Walking halfway up the mountain from I don't know where,

—A string of venomous vines hanging around my ears laughed:

It grabbed my neck,

While shaking its arms,

While seemingly singing said:

"Don't go,

The road ahead is dangerous——

No, there is no road ahead,

There is no sky ahead,

Spend a spring with me here...

I twisted off its arm,

Giving it a cold glance

Not saying anything in my mouth,

Firmly believing in my heart that tomorrow is spring.

### Musical Aphorisms

— Zhong Qi

Where there is life, there must be music. (Paderewske)

Let literature, painting, sculpture, architecture, and especially music, enrich your life. (Theodore Roosevelt)

Music makes friendship stronger and stronger. (Dr. Frand Crane)

The purpose of music is to make the soul strong and noble. (Morales)

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 525

— Ye Jingfeng

"Sorry, if we don't send out the signal, they will have to aim and attack here... Let's go inside and have a look." Shouyi, not even seeing a pistol, acted as if he were the owner of the house, opening the door with one hand and beckoning with the other, inviting He Jian to enter.

The first large room on the left, lit by bright lights, turned out to be a reception room. It was now empty. Two "tatami" mats were placed on the floor in the center, and several mosquito coils were burning all around. Some had burned down to one or two rings, and some were just freshly lit. The air was filled with the smell of mosquito coils and dampness. The two merely glanced around the room, knowing there was nothing much to study, and turned back to enter the living room and dining room opposite. This room, however, was full of a wide assortment of things: a broken table, a few broken chairs, three or four "Yang Yang Mi," genuine wine, beer, and other types of alcohol, some empty bottles discarded on the floor; some had leftovers, and many had not been opened; cooked fish, roasted meat, fruit, bread, and other cold dishes were plentiful, apparently a good amount had been consumed. They seemed to be divided by the table and its vicinity and did not throw things around; this was where the Japanese were more advanced than the Chinese. As long as they didn’t spit everywhere, the place was probably the headquarters of the bandits." He talked with a smile.

The upstairs and the three-story annex were all empty rooms. Only one large bedroom facing south also had several tatami mats on the floor, and several mosquito coils were burning. There were also several boxes piled in the corner. Near the window was a small table with paper, pens, two or three books, and three or four chairs. A stack of clothes was piled in disarray, all of which were men's kimonos.

"What's this?" He Jian first discovered writing in purple lines on a wall near the door.

"—A duckweed flower, a trumpet; bind the trumpet, welcome away the duckweed flower!—"

Besides these four lines of writing, which were neither poetry nor folk song, there were six small characters written at the end: "Left by Heavenly King Laozi."

Shouyi looked at it, chuckled, and shook his head.

"I understand the situation, Pingzi has been rescued, but it's a little hard to believe. Could these bandits all be dead? ... There were only four young ladies who came; no matter how great their abilities, they shouldn't have escaped without raising an alarm..." He Jian, no matter what, couldn't believe it. "Looking at the words on the wall, it shows there were two people here. That 'trumpet' is probably a morning glory, which is also a woman; tied up, presumably it's definitely someone on the enemy's side. ... Is this morning glory so easy to deal with? A trumpet should be used to attack, why use it to shout?

I can't guess... I'll just have to go back and ask them... "Shouyi scratched his head.

"...It's very simple..." Later, at Bai Ren Manor, everyone met, and He Jian, based on his Japanese education's spirit of "breaking the clay pot to get to the bottom," asked Zishan to explain the situation when rescuing Pingzi. Zishan rolled her big, round eyes and showed her little dimples, chattering and laughing as she spoke, "That group of people were playing an empty city trick; there were only nine people in total, including that female spy—she was pretending to be kidnapped together, wanting to find out the secrets of Miss Nakamura Pingzi—when we arrived, we originally wanted to force our way in, but Sister Hui didn't agree. It just so happened that we ran into Japanese soldiers on patrol, three strayed, and two idiots were left in the house ten miles away. They were probably drunk, sleeping like two dead pigs, snoring to the heavens..."

### The Grass-Cutting Girl

— Zhongyuan

Every day, when I push open that west-facing window, I always see a grass-cutting girl.

I see her wearing a patterned calico jacket, with a dark blue cloth apron tied around her waist. A light red handkerchief is tucked into her collar. Her eyebrows are slender, and her tiny fingernails are dyed red with the juice of balsam flowers.

That girl always sneaks into my garden from the side door of the wall. When she comes in, she carries two empty large grass baskets on her right shoulder, and clutches a shining sickle in her left hand. She walks and smiles, seeming unable to bear her coquettishness. But she also looks back step by step, seeming somewhat afraid. Finally, seeing me in front of the window, she says, "Miss! Begging for a little grass..." Her crisp voice is as gentle and soft as the spring breeze.

She only goes back when the sun sets in the west. When she goes back, a load of green grass fills both baskets, almost bending the small carrying pole into a curved bow. But she still walks so lightly and freely. Her right arm blocks the carrying pole, and her left arm hangs down quietly. She takes a step and swings, her small mouth humming a beautiful village song.

"It's such a pity about this girl, if she had grown up in the city..."

One day, I suddenly began to fantasize like this: I fantasized about changing the girl's patterned calico jacket into a light green silk dress; changing the dark blue cloth apron into a goose-yellow wool coat; changing the pink handkerchief tucked into her collar into a large red patent leather handbag; adding a stroke to her thin eyebrows to make them curve downwards; adding Parisian rouge to her rosy face, and applying scarlet Danqi lipstick to her small mouth, painting her fingernails with bright red and shiny Koushou lacquer... But alas——

But alas, I smiled sadly. I saw that the girl was no longer surrounded by tender green grass, no longer had the beautiful blue sky, no longer had the clear flowing water and quiet fields, only a chaotic, thick, black coal smoke was swirling, swirling, swirling around her...

Another time, I asked lightly from my mouth: "Girl! What do you do with so much grass that you cut every day?"

"This grass?" She raised her head and smiled blankly: "It's for my sheep!"

What a beautiful sound! But I pondered, pondered... Suddenly, I remembered: Wasn't that the same sound as when Christ, on the eve of being nailed to the cross, instructed his most trusted disciple Peter, "Feed my sheep!"

So I smiled sadly again. I seemed to see that girl, following behind a group of fierce soldiers, wearing a crown of thorns, dressed in a purple robe of sin, carrying Christ on her back with the heavy cross, walking together towards the terrifying "Mount Calvary"; the girl's face was full of tears...

This day, I closed that west-facing window.

I never saw that grass-cutting girl again, but I think of her every moment.

Free Talk

### University Education

— Leike

When talking about China's education, everyone shakes their heads. However, when talking about China's university education, it is bound to be surprising. Because we have as many as one hundred and ninety or more (according to Hu Shi's recent words) universities. Judging from the development of our education, it can be said to be abnormally numerous.

Now, each university not only lacks economic strength (this was the case after the war, and before the war as well), but also lacks human resources. We don't want to praise or criticize the current university professors' character and learning here. Simply recalling the professors of several universities in Shanghai before the war is enough to make us "tremble with fear." One who taught poetry didn't know who Wu Qian'an was, and another who taught economics pronounced the "depreciate" as the "blink" of an eye. One who taught sociology couldn't even explain the textbook (in English), and another who taught elementary school turned the work of explaining the text into a calligraphy class. These are just small jokes. There are all kinds of big jokes. There are simply too many to enumerate.

The problem lies in the fact that we simply don't have so many scholars qualified to serve as university professors, but we aim too high and want to run so many universities. In order to fill the positions of so many university professors, we can only (and still have not enough) promote those who are only qualified to be middle school teachers to be university professors, and those who are only qualified to be elementary school teachers (and still have not enough) are promoted to be middle school teachers. Those who are not qualified to be teachers at all cannot but be invited to elementary schools and kindergartens. As far as I can remember, before the war (what I said above was all before the war), some elementary school teachers themselves had not graduated from elementary school. What I am saying is, of course, not about every teacher or professor, but such people are indeed not in the minority in the education sector. Think about how can education be done well when there is such a lack of talent? With such mediocrity, such perfunctory irresponsibility, seeing that there are more and more university graduates, but there has been no increase in useful talents.

A country is like a person. To study knowledge, one must build depth on top of breadth. Depth is university education, and breadth is elementary school education. Only on the basis of truly universal elementary and middle school education can a sound and solid university education be built. If one neglects this lower foundation and only pursues high-level knowledge, the result is bound to fail. Because this is by no means a magnificent building, but only a non-existent castle in the air. This is the lesson from before the war. We should make some changes now.

### Three Words and Two Phrases

— Yu Jing

This little woman stopped her incessant chatter, put her hand on the light switch, and asked, "Dear, everything has been taken care of tonight, right?"

In the darkness, her husband patiently replied, "My dear, everything has been turned off except you."

### Thoughts on Receiving the Electricity Bill

— Wu Derun

I received the power company's "User Bill," and the account section actually listed three items: the first item is electricity charges; the second is a fuel surcharge; and the third is a 10% public utility surcharge for the Municipal Government · Wu Derun. I casually calculated it: the electricity charge is 120 yuan per unit, but the fuel surcharge is an additional 205 yuan per unit. That's simply 162.5% of the electricity charge itself.

The fuel surcharge didn't start this month; moreover, we benefit from it not being "adjusted" monthly like the "cost of living index." However, this still doesn't resolve our confusion. First, what is the basis for the fuel surcharge? Why not include it in the electricity charge item for calculation? (Perhaps this is because public utilities cannot arbitrarily raise prices without the approval of the authorities, but we also suspect) What standard is used for calculating the surcharge? Has it been approved by the authorities?

Unexpectedly, I also discovered a few lines of red text on this month's bill. I didn't usually pay much attention to these "notes" or "explanations." Only the striking red color aroused my curiosity.

Original text: "This company is hereby ordered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs that any revised electricity prices or surcharges approved by the authorities, for which advance notice is not possible, are allowed to be collected retroactively. Therefore, this company reserves the right to increase charges for the amount of electricity included in this bill."

After reading it, I couldn't help but feel surprised again. "Reserving the right to increase charges" seems to be an unprecedented innovation.

Electricity supply is a public utility and cannot be as profit-driven as ordinary for-profit businesses. Although everyone knows the facts of soaring fuel prices and huge expenses, "the name of the fuel surcharge may have been created for this reason, but perhaps no user will agree to this 'reservation of the right to increase charges.'"

### Arts and Culture Scene

A monthly booklet of letters will be published in this city. The publication will purely print and compile letters from various writers, which is a unique approach and seems to have no precedent.

Novelist Tian Tao has recently completed a full-length novel titled "Beyond the Border," which depicts the characters and events of rural life.

Tian Han's hurriedly written "Lament for Jiangnan" will be directed by Ying Yunwei, starring Zhou Xuan and Zhao Dan.

Li Ming has resigned from his publicity work at Cathay Film Company and is currently rushing to write a new script for Great China Film Company.

The "Painting Star Literary Series" edited by Fan Quan and published by Xianxing Bookstore has released its first collection of four volumes, including Xiao Hong's full-length novel "Tales of Hulan River," Jian Kejia's short story collection "Embrace," Fan Quan's collection of character sketches "Genesis," and Li Jianwu's five-act play collection "Clouds and Rainbows." The first title, Xiao Hong's "Tales of Hulan River," has already been published.

Xiao Hong's posthumous work, "Tales of Hulan River," is her longest and best novel. It describes Hong's own childhood life, but not in a self-narrative style. Instead, it focuses on the depiction of the entire Hulan River City, making it more expansive and richer than a typical autobiography. Mr. Mao Dun said in his thousands of words of preface to the book: "It is a narrative poem, a colorful picture of local customs, and a string of poignant ballads."

"Spring and Autumn Pictorial" No. 66 has already been published. The contents of this issue include over a hundred pictures on "Government Reorganization," "New Selections for the Executive Yuan," "Pan-Asian Conference," "Diplomatic Activities," "Galloping Horse to Yan'an," "American Aid to Greece and Turkey," and more.

"Emotional Doctor" by Bo Jia, author of "Eighth Squad," will be published on July 5th. The content is fresh, and the writing style is light. The price per copy is 5,000 yuan.

"A Room of One's Own" (On Women and Fiction) by the famous British female writer Virginia Woolf, translated by Wang Huan, and Feng Zhi's short story "Landscape," Liu Xiwei's collection of critical essays "Chew the Flowers Collection" and "Chew the Flowers Collection Two," have all been published and sold by Cultural Life Publishing House.

### A Trilogy of Abandonment

— Xu Zhou

Deng Shiping, manager of the Chinese musical troupe that will soon travel to New York to perform "Meng Jiangnu," was recently sued by his wife, Chu Jingru, on charges of assault and abandonment. This is originally a very ordinary abandonment case, not worth making a fuss about. One newspaper's headline was "Manager's Scandal," but in the various kinds of criminal cases, Deng Shiping's "change of heart" doesn't even count as a "scandal." A police training class leader raping a colleague's wife with a gun, that is a real scandal; Feng Lai posing as a husband and raping a fellow villager, Mrs. Zhang, that is a scandal. Moreover, it seems that some scandals come from famous families. Despite the tall buildings and magnificent exteriors, there are quite a few places to hide dirt and accept filth. Cases of human-demon relationships and incestuous cases can be cited as examples.

However, from the Deng Shiping's abandonment case, we can also see the tragedy of women in a male-dominated society. A few words Chu Jingru said in court are especially worth noting by other women. Below is a direct transcript from a certain newspaper:

"Chu Jingru told reporters that when Deng pursued her, he went from Zhejiang to Japan and then to the mainland. At that time, she knew that Deng had abandoned his previous actress, so she did not want to marry him. However, Deng was determined to die and attempted suicide five times. She also showed two photos, one of herself in her youth, standing gracefully, lively and charming, completely different from her current appearance. She told her that although her husband had six or seven new lovers, none of them could compare to her youthful beauty. Her words were filled with feelings about the past and present...

In a male-dominated society, what is a woman's only capital? — Youth. How many women are forced to sell their youth, and how many women, because their youth has passed, have lost their security and can only spend their days weeping. Shakespeare said: "Frailty, thy name is woman?" If women cannot liberate themselves from the process of "making a living by relying on youth," then gender equality will always be just a slogan, and all kinds of injuries, crimes, and abandonment crimes will likely increase day by day. In Bai Juyi's time, women in the marketplace already lamented "when a person ages, their pearl turns yellow," but today, how many women are still frequently worried about the passing of youth? This is sad. When Chu Jingru was "standing gracefully," Deng Shiping did not hesitate to commit suicide five times, and went from Zhejiang to Japan and then to the mainland, which can be said to be a "pursuit expert"; when they got married, Chu Jingru knew that the other party was unreliable, and asked him for security, he enthusiastically and generously gave her a pistol, saying: "I have nothing else, just a gun and a life. If I ever change my heart towards you in the future, you can shoot me dead." But how long had it been before Chu Jingru was no longer "standing gracefully," so Deng Shiping also canceled his promise - "the new lover has six or seven people" said.

There are many such stories in society. Even in the same day's newspaper, there is a news item about "Paint Store Owner Wang Xirong Raping and Abandoning the Famous Young Lady Shao Wenying," and it is also the same "trilogy": initially, "Wang saw Shao and was amazed by her beauty, so he thought of seducing her"; then, "Wang opened a room in the Kang Le Hotel, Shao knew something was wrong, wanted to leave, but Wang used force to hold her down"; the ending is "the woman sought refuge, Wang refused sharply, and she was repeatedly beaten and humiliated, her body and mind were shattered." Although the methods may be slightly different, the procedures are roughly the same for any abandonment case.

For the sake of women, it is necessary to think more about the future life and encounters when they are "standing gracefully."

### Lighted Sky Advertising

— Bai Gao

Santa Claus rides in a sleigh pulled by several reindeer, parading in the city's sky; both humans and animals are equipped with electric lights, which shine brightly in the dark night. This is a type of lighted sky advertising discovered over New York City in the United States last Christmas night, and it can represent the latest development in sky advertising. This type of advertising is towed by an airplane, but because it is at night, the airplane cannot be seen.

In the past, sky advertising towed by airplanes could only be seen during the day, and its shape looked like a mesh billboard with solid letters attached. To make this type of advertising visible at night, it must be designed completely differently. The creator of the aforementioned lighted sky advertising, S.S. Pike Company of New York, has recently fully published the manufacturing and deployment methods of the "Santa Claus Riding a Reindeer Sleigh" lighted advertisement. A brief description is provided below:

This Christmas advertisement is towed by a 400-foot-long rope. The advertisement itself is 150 feet long and 15 feet high, and it is equipped with one thousand electric lights, using the electricity generated by the airplane's generator to supply the required current. The electrical wires are numerous and complicated; if straightened into a single line, they would be 3,000 feet long.

The first step in making this type of advertisement is to use fabric to make a net of the required size, and install crossbars at certain intervals to support the framework. Then, spread the net flat on the ground and attach the canvas silhouettes of the sleigh and figures. Then, attach light sockets to these canvas strips, one socket approximately every foot, and connect them with electrical wires. Although the lights used are no larger than flashlight bulbs, their light output is very strong. One person must spend hours of hard work to install these more than a thousand small light bulbs in their sockets. The main cable is tied to the tow rope with a narrow band. Before deployment, the voltmeter must be used to test all parts of the connected wiring from the advertisement to the electrical terminal below the aircraft to ensure that there are no

Now the lighted advertisement is complete. Next, we will talk about the deployment method. Based on the experience of deploying daytime sky advertisements, the same method can also be used to deploy lighted sky advertisements. The standard deployment method is to place the advertisement flat on the airfield, and then lead the tow rope backward and then forward to the aircraft in a large U-shape. When the aircraft takes off, it first lifts the loose part of the U, and then "peels" the advertisement off the ground. To ensure that the lighted advertisement is not damaged, its creator uses a group of personnel to hold the advertisement upright so that the aircraft can pull it away. In order to keep the lighted advertisement stable and upright in the air, a streamlined weight is attached under the triangular fabric of the advertisement, several pieces of cloth are sewn on the appropriate parts of the advertisement, and an air drag net is attached to the tail. When the aircraft is about to land, the advertisement is released first, so that it can slowly sink to the ground.

### Introduction to Famous Songs

— Ke Di

Here, I will introduce two famous operas by Puccini (Puccini): "Madama Butterfly."

One Fine Day (Un bel di vedremo)

This beautiful aria has a deeply charming melody, full of hope and fantasy of love. It is sung by the heroine, Madame Butterfly, at the beginning of the second act. Although her husband—an American officer named Pinkerton—has left her for three years, she always hopes that he will return. She lives with her son and a faithful maid (Suzuki) in a small house, leading a carefree life. The maid has begun to doubt whether her husband will really return. Although Madame Butterfly tries her best to remain calm and wait, there is always a surge of worry and fear in her heart. In this moving aria, she imagines a large ship bringing her husband back from faraway America, so that they can live a happy and fulfilling life together again. Diana writes that Ping once sang in "First Love."

Duet of the Flowers

This female duet (soprano and mezzo-soprano) is also sung in the second act. The poor Madame Butterfly finally sees her husband's ship entering the harbor. She firmly believes that her husband will return to her side, so she instructs the maid to decorate the room with flowers in preparation for his arrival. The maid picks all the flowers in the garden. As they decorate the room, they sing this exciting and lively duet.

### Chronicle of a City in Peril

— Bang Shouou

"Everyone, I have something I want to discuss with you!" Old Zhu, who is taller than anyone else, stood in the center of the circle of people like a bamboo pole, with a strange and unnatural smile on his face, and said to everyone: "I have been to the highway checkpoint twice, and I have also been to the town. There are absolutely no empty cars, and there are no rides available to take us for the time being. Now there is only one car from the Trade Commission that is already full of people and goods, and they have agreed to take two of us. I originally didn't want to agree to this scattered way of leaving. However, it's my fault for bringing two friends, Mrs. Hu and her daughter, from the woods in the first place. But now, Hu Benben is so seriously ill. As a last resort, I would like to ask Lao Zhang to accompany them to leave first, so that she can quickly enter the county hospital in Hechi. This matter..."

"No problem! No problem," many people immediately shouted in unison. "People who are sick should leave first!"

Zhu Zhaonian is now really smiling, but at the same time, he also made a great effort to prevent his tears from flowing.

So he separated the crowd and quietly walked closer to Lan's head.

"Thank you, I heard everything!" Before he could speak, Lan had already spoken in a weak voice. Her face was a little dark, and her lips were as red as a cockscomb. Old Zhu's strange gaze kept moving back and forth across her face. He really wanted to gently touch it, but finally restrained himself. "Everything is up to you."

Lan, who usually doesn't like to talk, is even less willing to waste unnecessary words now.

"Okay, that's very good." Old Zhu replied softly, his voice sounding strange even to his own ears. "I will immediately pack the things you need in your small leather suitcase, and we will still take the rest with us. But, Feifei... does Feifei want to go with you?"

Fei nodded slightly.

### A Comedy of Errors

A poor painter had owed rent for many days, and the landlord had to come and urge him.

The painter said: "Please be patient for a little longer, in the future people will come here to visit and say: 'Look! This is where that famous painter used to work.'"

The landlord sneered: "Really? If you don't pay me today, they can say that tomorrow morning."
