### Major Cases Passed by the State Council: General Election Voting Postponed by One Month; All Parties to Participate in Local Public Opinion Organizations

[Our Newspaper, Peking, 26th Dispatch] The voting date for the National Assembly representative election has been decided to be postponed by one month. This case was submitted by the Election Headquarters to the National Government and was passed by the State Council on the morning of the 26th. According to the original schedule, the National Assembly voting period was set for October 21st to 23rd. However, due to some difficulties in the election progress (such as the obstruction of elections in the pacification zones and the unresolved issue of party nominations), the voting period has been postponed to November 21st to 23rd. It is reported that the election issues in the pacification zones were also discussed at the meeting. How to conduct elections in the areas recovered from the bandits by Zhu has not yet been decided, but the election affairs in the recovered areas will proceed as usual.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] After participating in the central government, the People's Party and the Youth Party are now requesting to participate in local public opinion organizations. This matter was proposed at the State Council meeting on the 26th by the government commissioners Xu Fulin, Ji Yiqiao, Hu Haimen, Yu Jiaju, and Zeng Qi. The proposal was to amend the regulations of the provincial, municipal, and county councils, and to select people from various parties to participate. The proposal has been passed by the State Council and sent to the Legislative Yuan for handling in accordance with the principles. The original proposal stated: Article 12 of the policy guidelines states that "the participation in the conferences or provisional conferences of various provinces, cities, and counties should be as far as possible by various parties and non-party people." Also, the election date for the supervisors is very near, and the election law stipulates that candidates for supervisors must have nominations from at least five councilors. Now, although various parties participate in the government, because the councils of various provinces, cities, and counties have already been established, no one from any party has yet participated in the councils of various provinces, cities, and counties in accordance with the agreement of Article 12 of the policy guidelines. As a result, various parties have no legal basis to nominate candidates for supervisors in the election of supervisors, and the terms of the councils have been announced to be extended. In the current stage, there is still no possibility of re-election. The participation of people from various parties in the councils of provinces, cities, and counties cannot be carried out for the time being, which seems to be inconsistent with Article 12 of the policy guidelines, and the election of supervisors cannot be carried out. It is proposed that, in accordance with the principles of Article 12 of the policy guidelines, the Legislative Yuan should amend the regulations of the councils and provisional councils of various provinces, cities, and counties, and use the method of selection to select people from various parties to jointly participate in the councils or provisional councils of various provinces, cities, and counties. As for the number of people, it is proposed to be: 15 to 20 people for provinces or municipalities directly under the central government, and 5 to 10 people for counties or municipalities under the jurisdiction of provinces.

### The Four Banks Joint Trust Office Announces the Details of Housing Loans; A Total of Three Items Have Been Handled Successively

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Regarding the details of the Central Trust Bureau's handling of housing construction loans in the capital city, the person in charge of the Four Banks Joint Trust Office recently stated: There are a total of three housing construction loans in the capital city that have been handled successively:

1.  The Central Trust Bureau's pilot construction loan was inquired about in June of last year. The highest authority instructed the Central Trust Bureau to pay attention to and assist in the housing problem of public educators in the capital and other important cities, and to plan and promote the business of urban real estate management. The bureau drafted construction loan plans and measures for Peking and Shanghai, but it did not immediately implement them due to many practical difficulties. In April of this year, the bureau submitted revised measures, which were approved by Chen Feng and piloted in Nanjing. The loan amount was temporarily set at 5 billion yuan, and detailed measures were formulated. The main points are: Applicants must be public educators with their own base, and they must mortgage their base and the planned building. The total loan amount shall not exceed 50% of the mortgage value, and the maximum amount per household shall not exceed 200 million yuan. Repayments will begin in the fourth month after the loan is granted, and must be paid off in the sixth month. If the debt cannot be paid off on time, the mortgage shall be disposed of. A reliable guarantee must be provided. The above loan began to be handled in May of this year. The bureau reviewed and approved 35 households in succession according to the order, and the approved loan amount was a total of 5.12 billion yuan. The loan of 3.353 billion yuan has been paid. The detailed list has been published in the newspaper on the 14th.

2.  The Capital Zhongshan North Road Construction Loan: This loan is aimed at prospering the construction of houses on both sides of the vacant land on Zhongshan North Road. It was handled in accordance with the Chairman's telegram. The original approval was 20 billion yuan, and detailed loan measures were formulated and published in the newspaper. The main points are: The applicant's own base must be located on both sides of the road along Zhongshan North Road. The applicant is limited to individuals. Institutions, banks, companies, and firms are not allowed to apply. The loan per household can only be 50% of the total construction price, and the maximum shall not exceed 200 million yuan. The applicant must provide a land certificate from the Land Bureau and a construction permit from the Public Works Bureau. Repayments will begin in the seventh month and must be paid off within one year. In order to handle the matter properly, the Loan Syndicate was organized by this office to handle it. The managers of the Nanjing branches of the national banks and bureaus were appointed, and the directors of the Land Bureau and the Public Works Bureau of the municipal government were invited to jointly participate in the organization. All applications were reviewed one by one and forwarded to the Central Trust Bureau for lending. This loan began to be handled on May 17 and ended on July 2. A total of 28 households were approved for loans, with a loan amount of 3.997 billion yuan. The list of borrowers and the loan amount are listed as follows: Zhu Xian (Ministry of Education) 197.5 million yuan, Chen Youbing (businessman) 26 million yuan, Chen Youxin (contractor) 100 million yuan, Gong Yu (Sixth Office of the Ministry of National Defense) 77.5 million yuan, Liu Jicheng (doctor) 180 million yuan, Ha Xiongwen (Ministry of the Interior) 200 million yuan, Liu Rongbian, etc. (flour merchants) 60 million yuan, Li Jia (school) 150 million yuan, Chen Jiadong, Zheng Yuanxing (businessman) 100 million yuan, Zhang Fengwu (businessman) 150 million yuan, Zheng Zizheng (engineer) 170 million yuan, Zhou Huaxin (Ministry of Finance) 200 million yuan, Wu Songlin, etc. (watch industry) 60 million yuan, Hu Qingrong (grain merchant) 120 million yuan, Huang Cilun (local merchant) 200 million yuan, Zhao Wangzhi (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) 100 million yuan, Xu Baochu (Lequn Middle School) 200 million yuan, Jiang Jifan 31 million yuan, Sun Fushou (businessman) 95 million yuan, Jiang Shihua 100 million yuan, Zhou Yuncheng (China Real Estate Company) 200 million yuan, Luo Mingkun (film industry) 200 million yuan, Wang Anxiu (academic circles) 200 million yuan, Zhang (academic circles) 200 million yuan, Xu Zhizhong (businessman) 120 million yuan, Gao Hua (businessman) 200 million yuan, Ge Sukan 160 million yuan, Gu Shuwei (businessman) 200 million yuan. The above totals 3.997 billion yuan.

3.  Nanjing City Housing Construction Loan: This case is the remaining part of the Zhongshan North Road loan, about 1.6 billion yuan. The Nanjing Municipal Government drafted the measures and submitted them to the Chairman for approval, and ordered them to be handled by telegram. The construction site is not limited to Zhongshan North Road, and detailed measures have been formulated. The main points are: All public educators and civilians who have their own base and plan to build their own houses, and have prepared 50% of the funds in advance, can apply. The loan ratio is scheduled to be 70% for public educators and % for other civilians. The applicant must have a land ownership certificate from the Land Bureau and a construction permit from the Public Works Bureau. The loan term is one year, and the loan must be repaid in equal installments starting from the seventh and eighth months. This loan is still handled by the syndicate according to the application investigation cases of the Central Trust Bureau. After the review, it is returned to the Central Trust Bureau for lending. As of the 25th of this month, a total of 52 households have been approved for loans, and the loan amount is 2.45 billion yuan. The list of borrowers is listed as follows:

The above totals 2.45 billion yuan.

The purpose of all the above loans is to solve the housing shortage problem in the capital city, and special attention and assistance are given to public educators, but all loans must fully meet the loan conditions before they can be applied for. As for the payment of each loan, it is collected by the borrower together with the construction manufacturer according to the progress of the remittance, so as not to be diverted to other uses. In short, the Loan Syndicate and the Central Trust Bureau are all handling the matter in accordance with the approved measures, and if there is any situation where the repayment cannot be made on time, the pledged property will be disposed of in accordance with the agreement.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Central Trust Bureau recently issued a statement on the housing construction loan situation in Nanjing, and the content is the same as before.

### The Office Location of Chairman Chiang in Chongqing is Donated to the Church to Establish an Elementary School for Orphans; It is Not Private Property of the Chairman and His Wife

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] It has been found that the New York telegram issued by this agency the day before yesterday stated that Chairman Chiang and his wife would donate 100 acres of land and 20 stone buildings near "Huangshan" in Chongqing as a school and home for wartime orphans, and entrust it to Bishop Chen Wenyuan for management. It is now learned that the houses and land there are not privately owned by the Chairman and his wife, but the office location of the former Chairman of the Military Committee, covering more than 200 acres of mountainous land and a total of 10 buildings of various sizes, all of which were temporary buildings during the war. After the victory, the government returned to the capital. The Chairman, in view of the enthusiasm of the church in serving during the war and the disaster suffered by the citizens of Chongqing during the war against the Japanese aggression, which caused countless orphans, and the Military Committee had ended, suggested that the government donate the land to the National Christian Council of China and entrust it to establish a church and manage the elementary school for orphans as a foundation. As for the report on the 2nd by the United Press that the Chairman and his wife donated more than 10,000 acres of private property and 50,000 US dollars, it is an obvious misrepresentation of the facts.

### The Ministry of Personnel Should Recognize the Past Party Affairs Qualifications of People from Political Parties; It Was Approved in Principle After Discussion by the State Council

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Six government commissioners from the People's Party and the Youth Party, including Xu Chuanlin, believe that after participating in the government, their past experience in party affairs work should be recognized by the Ministry of Personnel as the years of service for grading purposes. On the 26th, Zeng Qi, He Luzhi, Yu Jiaju, Xu Chuanlin, Hu Haimen, and Ji Yiqiao jointly submitted a proposal to the State Council: "Please instruct the Examination Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Personnel that all political parties participating in government work, the party affairs work experience of their staff at all levels should be recognized as the years of service for appointment and grading, provided that the nature of the party affairs work is comparable to the position to be appointed." The proposal was approved in principle. The proposal stated: "The knowledge and skills required by party affairs workers and the nature of their work are no different from those of general administrative personnel. It is easy to achieve mastery through proficiency by applying this experience to administrative work. However, in the past, this experience was generally limited to the Kuomintang. Now that all parties are participating in government work, the party affairs work experience of other political parties participating in the government should be recognized uniformly, and there is no reason for the same experience to be treated differently. It is feared that the staff handling the matter may not understand this intention, or may use the excuse that there is no basis for it without clear instructions. It is proposed that the National Government instruct the Examination Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Personnel, and instruct other Yuans to instruct their subordinates to inform them of the matter."

### Strik Advocates Abandoning Japanese Reparations; All Parties in Our Country Are Extremely Dissatisfied; Our "Reparations and Restitution Committee" is Established in Tokyo

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The issue of Japanese reparations has been pending for a long time, and has long been suspected by the people of the country. Since the United States recently published Strik's recommendations, it has increasingly aroused dissatisfaction among all parties in our country. According to relevant sources, Strik, chairman of the seven-member American committee who went to Japan twice this year to assist the Allied Headquarters in handling Japanese reparations, recently published an article entitled "Retaliation is Waste" in "American Magazine." On the issue of Japanese reparations, he advocated that the United States should abandon the Pauley Plan and overturn the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission on reparations. This argument seems to be mutually confirmed with the current delaying attitude of the Allied Headquarters towards reparations and its strategy of appeasing and supporting Japan, and it has many adverse effects on the Allied countries' demands for reparations from Japan. Therefore, the main points of the article will be recorded below to arouse the attention and vigilance of the people of the country. Strik first quoted the experience of reparations from Germany, saying that the United States allowed the Soviet Union to dismantle industrial equipment and ships, while at the same time allocating funds to help the German post-war economy. This phenomenon is very contradictory, so he advocated that the issue of reparations from Japan should be handled with caution to avoid repeating the same mistakes. He also said that the United States does not need German and Japanese factories, but should encourage these two countries to be self-sufficient and produce items other than those they need. In this way, the United States can not only avoid providing relief, but also enable American factories and farmers to gain markets. Strik also stated: "The Pauley Plan is destroying the Japanese economy, thereby increasing the burden of American relief," and implied that MacArthur was dissatisfied with the decisions made by the Far Eastern Commission based on the Pauley Plan, hoping to change them, so he allowed 700 of the 1,100 factories that had been designated for dismantling to be temporarily put into operation. Strik continued to state his findings, saying: "Even if all the current equipment remains in Japan, it will be difficult for Japan to engage in war again. The policy of the Far Eastern Commission, which demands huge reparations, will inevitably lead to the collapse of the Japanese economy and continuous economic needs in the future." Therefore, his conclusion is: "The decisions of the Far Eastern Commission should be overturned, and Japan should be placed on a stable economic foundation in the peace treaty to enhance its production capacity."

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th Dispatch] The "Chinese Reparations and Restitution Committee" established by our delegation to Japan was officially established on the 21st, and is fully responsible for reparations and the return of looted property. The number of members of the committee may be increased to 20 to 25, and 15 to 20 technical assistants will be hired. Wu Bannong, the leader of the economic and scientific group of the delegation, also serves as the chairman of the committee. Wang Shugao, Li Chen, Zhou Maobai, and Chong Kong are the four members.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The External Affairs Committee for the Review of the Japanese Peace Treaty held another meeting on the morning of the 26th. Chairman Ye Gongchao attended, and the attendees were still representatives from relevant ministries and commissions. Personnel from the army and navy expressed their opinions. Wang Chonghui, the guiding committee member of the committee, told reporters that he would return to Shanghai on the 27th and immediately begin drafting his personal opinions, which would be submitted to the External Affairs Committee next week. His opinions focus on the content, with very little on the procedures of the peace conference.

### The Far Eastern Economic Commission Plans to Establish in Hangzhou; I Am Preparing to Participate in the International Trade Conference

### Authorities are Considering Methods for Issuing Foreign Exchange Certificates for Self-Provided Goods

[Our Nanjing Office, 26th Dispatch] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Import and Export Trade Association, and 14 other groups, in order to request the issuance of licenses for self-provided foreign exchange registered goods, specially sent representatives Shou Jingwei and 15 others to Beijing by car on the 6th. The matter is currently under consideration and a solution will be reached in the near future, reportedly no more than ten days. Shou and others attended meetings with the Participating Council, the Entire Economic Council, and the Ministry of Finance, with similar results from their petitions. Shou and his party will return to Shanghai by night train on the 26th. According to Mr. Shou, the announcement issued by the Committee for the Management of Arrivals and Departures on August 21st stated: "For goods already shipped or arrived in port before August 16th, permission will be granted for registration. For goods shipped after the 16th, foreign exchange will be purchased at the official rate or forcibly shipped out of port, and the merchant's license will be revoked." However, when merchants learned of this announcement, even if they urgently telegraphed foreign countries to stop shipments, it was too late. Goods already loaded onto ships between the 16th and 21st could not be processed, and foreign manufacturers are not located at seaports. If goods have already been transported from the factory to the port, even if the ships have not yet departed but berths have been reserved and other preparations have been completed, it is impossible to stop loading. Therefore, two requests are specifically made: For self-provided foreign exchange materials that have been registered and comply with current trade control regulations, and that fall under the categories of permitted imports, please promptly reissue licenses so that they can be declared and imported as soon as possible; for items that are prohibited from import, imports should be prohibited. Extend the date for loading goods that have already been ordered until the end of September, allowing manufacturers and importers to provide documentation for supplementary registration and release. A large portion of the goods that have arrived in Shanghai with self-provided foreign exchange but without licenses are machinery, steel, hardware, pigments, paper, rubber, and chemical raw materials, among which some are production equipment or industrial raw materials, and daily necessities for Shanghai. The sources of these goods are roughly as follows: Orders placed before the promulgation of the trade control regulations on November 17th of last year; the abolition of the regulation by the Management Committee that each importer could obtain $2,000 per week; the temporary opening of self-provided foreign exchange in April; the government not strictly requiring importers to obtain licenses before ordering from foreign countries before the announcement of the new trade regulations on August 21st. Through this repeated accumulation, the total value has reached as much as 70 million yuan.

### Wedemeyer Meets with Truman, Submits Investigation Report and Recommendations on China and Korea, Marshall Sends Special Letter to Stuart, Hoping to Strengthen Sino-American Trade

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th Dispatch] General Wedemeyer submitted to President Truman on the 5th the report and recommendations of his investigation into China and Korea. Wedemeyer met with the President for half an hour. Afterwards, he declined to comment on his report or on what he discussed with the President. When asked if he had plans to return to China, he replied: "I will not go to China in the near future," adding: "I have no such plans." When asked if the recommendations he made were based on his statement before leaving China, he replied: "The report I submitted today has nothing to do with my departure with my entourage."

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart Leighton and his entourage of 45 people took a landing craft to Wuhu on the 6th to visit local church personnel and inspect church schools and hospitals.

According to reliable sources, after the Wedemeyer Mission left Nanjing, General Marshall sent a special letter asking him to continue his outstanding work and strengthen Sino-American understanding and friendship. The Ambassador is currently awaiting the reaction from Washington regarding the Wedemeyer Mission's work report. Before that, he will not make any statements or take any actions that could affect fundamental policies.

### Wang Chonghui Discusses in Nanjing the Standoff Between the United States and the Soviet Union, Which May Continue for Thirty to Fifty Years

[Our Nanjing Office, 26th Dispatch] Diplomatic authority Wang Chonghui discussed the global situation with our reporter on the 26th, concluding that the current standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union may continue for thirty to fifty years. However, "experience is the best teacher." Some issues that cannot be resolved through reasoning may be resolved through experiencing some difficulties. Our diplomacy does not involve being pro-American or pro-Soviet, nor do we wish to profit from it. We will address matters on a case-by-case basis, and China will be on the side of justice. We may offend the United States on this matter and offend the Soviet Union on another, but this is by no means being pro-American or pro-Soviet. We choose public reason and justice, and it is possible that we will offend both the United States and the Soviet Union. He believes that the statements and measures taken by Foreign Minister Wang before and after his trip abroad are all manifestations of independent diplomacy, and are more proactive and progressive. Regarding the United Nations General Assembly, he predicted that unless a miracle occurs, only minor issues will be agreed upon. As for major disputes, because they involve ideologies and beliefs, it may be difficult to find solutions. Wang said regarding the overall situation in recent years that during the war, the United Nations had a common enemy of fear, and the United Kingdom and the United States showed more willingness to compromise, so they could cooperate and win the victory together. After the war, the common goal of fear disappeared, and the United Kingdom and the United States were unwilling to continue to make too many concessions. The Soviet Union placed particular emphasis on security, coupled with ideological gaps, resulting in a major standoff that is now difficult to resolve. However, he believes that this overall situation is only a stalemate. The world's anti-war sentiment can eliminate the cruel intention of engaging in war. The current situation of the United Nations General Assembly appears to be lacking in harmony, but frankly stating everyone's true feelings is actually a commendable phenomenon. This is an important point where the United Nations organization is superior to the League of Nations. The League of Nations appeared harmonious on the surface, but in reality, power and deception were the main causes of its failure. Although the United Nations organization may not have great achievements in a short period of time, it has already sown good seeds. In the future, when the two sides in the stalemate learn from experience and discover the principle that "some partial solutions are better than no solutions," it will be the beginning of the resolution of the stalemate.

Although the Communist bandits have gradually increased the number of their units from the 13th, 16th, 17th, and 18th Brigades, and the 12th Brigade has also been discovered, the actions of the bandits are encountering difficulties due to the arrival of the elite troops of the National Army and the deployment of the air force.

[Our Peiping Office, 26th Dispatch] In order to cover the three independent brigades, the 10th, 11th, and 13th, of the Communist bandits in eastern Hebei as they cross the pass to participate in the fighting in the Suizhong area, the Communist bandits, in coordination with local armed forces, are actively destroying the Beining Railway inside the pass and attacking National Army strongholds in the Hangu area. At the same time, they are secretly using civilian labor to actively build four highways inside and outside the pass (from Qian'an to Pingquan, from Zunhua to Fushun, from Lengkou to Lingyuan, and from Jiekou to Suizhong). It is reported that the Communist bandits' Independent 10th Brigade has also been discovered in the Jinxi area.

The main force of the Communist bandits on both sides of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is advancing north in a roundabout way from Wen'an, Renqiu, and Liucheng. Local Communist bandit units are concentrating on the west side of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The township administrations between Jinghai and Dacheng are under siege.

### Former Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e Accused of Receiving and Embezzling

[Our Tianjin Office, 26th Dispatch] Former Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e has recently been accused of embezzlement by the Tianjin Local Autonomy Promotion Association to the Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group. According to the association's petition: During the early days of the recovery, Zhang closed the front doors of the large warehouses in Tianjin and sold goods through the back doors day and night. It is estimated that the warehouses contained enough food to supply the citizens of Tianjin for three years, and half of the warehouses were emptied after the theft. It is heard that the authorities ordered Li Zongren to investigate this matter, but there have been no results to date. In addition, the Japanese technicians retained by Zhang were all wealthy merchants and not genuine technicians. The situation can be imagined. It is imperative that a thorough investigation be carried out to meet the expectations of the public.

### Chen Cheng Striving for Effective Governance, Northeastern China Taking on a New Look, People's Hearts Becoming Clear and Bright

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 26th Dispatch] Since Chen Cheng took office as the Director of the Northeast Administrative Region, he has adhered to the spirit of "striving for the fundamentals" and has quickly rectified various imperfect laws and unreasonable phenomena with great courage and decisiveness. In the past two weeks, he has brought the chaotic situation of the past back on track, and the depressed and sullen situation in Northeast China, and the dismay of the people of the Northeast, have suddenly become clear and bright. According to the facts, this reporter will describe Chen's achievements in Northeast China as follows:

Rectifying Military Discipline

Chen has accepted the demands of the people and has first rectified military discipline. He has strictly prohibited soldiers from forcibly occupying public and private houses, infringing on the people, engaging in commercial profiteering, corruption, and embezzlement, detaining vehicles, recruiting soldiers by false pretenses, and running newspapers, dance halls, and cinemas without following proper procedures. He has worked hard to correct these behaviors. He has severely punished corrupt officials and has encouraged people to report or secretly report corruption cases. He has prohibited civil servants from engaging in commercial activities, regardless of their background, and will severely punish those who violate this.

Streamlining and Merging Agencies

Since the recovery, the administrative institutions in Northeast China have been complex and chaotic, and have been criticized by some people in the central government and local areas. Upon taking office, Chen immediately adopted the opinions of various parties and merged unnecessary agencies. For example, he ordered the merger of the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Enterprise Assets Unified Reception Committee, the Northeast Production Administration, and the Northeast Real Estate Administration into the Northeast District Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau. The enemy and puppet enterprise assets received by the various agencies will be classified according to their nature, and will either be transferred to the central government, assigned to local agencies for management, returned to the people, or sold to private enterprises. The bureau will have two offices for secretary and accounting, and two committees for deliberation and valuation. The bureau will be established in early October.

Making the Best Use of Talent

The Northeast Administrative Region originally had political and economic committees. In order to increase administrative efficiency, the central government has decided to merge the above two committees into a political affairs committee. The provincial and municipal governments that have not yet been recovered will also be reduced in size, and will be ordered to move closer to the local areas of the provinces and regions in order to prepare for recovery. The remaining personnel will be reorganized into a political work team and will be trained and sent to various places to work, so that talents can be put to the best use. Therefore, the significance of Chen's simplification policy lies not in simplifying administrative institutions, but in increasing political efficiency. The purpose of his downsizing is not to lay off employees, but to mobilize them.

In the past two years, enemy and puppet properties have been occupied by few people. Recently, some people have secretly sublet the government properties they have occupied in order to profit from them. Chen has ordered that these activities be investigated and banned. The subletters will have their sublet fees confiscated, and the sublessees will be punished double the amount. The properties will be used for disaster relief.

Strictly Preventing Capital Flight

Recently, due to the changing situation in Northeast China, it is difficult to survive without illegal profits, resulting in a large number of officials and merchants carrying funds and attempting to escape into the pass. Since Chen took office, the outflow of Northeast circulation notes into the country was more than 1.5 billion yuan, and in the past few days alone, the outflow of circulation notes into the pass has reached as much as 600 million yuan. Among them, there are inevitably corrupt gains and illegal profits, which are all the blood and sweat of the people of Northeast China. Chen immediately convened the heads of relevant agencies, ordering them to conduct a thorough investigation. If the above-mentioned illegal funds are found to be fleeing, they will be confiscated and used for disaster relief. He also agreed on measures to strengthen auditing and reasonably restrict the outflow of capital.

Leading by Example

Chen personally leads by example, rectifies officials, and strives to eliminate the decadent atmosphere. He lives and eats within the office to facilitate work and avoid wasting time and resources. He has no private affairs. All officials must arrive and leave on time. All department heads and above will hold joint office hours. All important matters will be dealt with immediately without delay. He also promotes frugality, does not host lavish banquets, does not give gifts, and does not offer cigarettes to guests. The monthly savings will be used to subsidize the food expenses of the soldiers. He also prohibits civil servants from engaging in gambling and dancing and other improper entertainment activities.

Chen places great emphasis on the morality and talent of people, regardless of their seniority or connections, and does not place undue emphasis on qualifications. If they are capable and principled and have real talent and ability, they will be promoted without regard to seniority. Therefore, the officials are deeply grateful and work hard in the public interest.

### Rice and Wheat Prices Soar in Wuxi

[Our Wuxi Office, 26th Dispatch] Due to low arrivals and sales, and the implementation of currency reform, rice and wheat markets are experiencing tight credit, even during the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, people's hearts are unsettled. Today, rice prices have soared by four to five ten thousand yuan, and wheat prices have also risen by more than two ten thousand yuan due to large purchases. Flour prices are expected to rise. The opening prices are as follows: broken white rice, 555,000 yuan; new japonica rice, 516,500 yuan; port wheat, 472,500 yuan; old white yuan rice, 462,500 yuan; new japonica paddy, 209,000 yuan; old japonica paddy, 228,000 yuan.

### List of Selected County Magistrates Released, 44 People Admitted

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The selection of county magistrates from this year's higher examination passers, the oral examination began on September 24th and was completed at 1:00 PM on the 26th. At 2:00 PM, the third meeting of the County Magistrate Selection Committee was held. After deliberation, it was decided to admit 44 county magistrates.

### Jiangsu Province to Start Collecting Land Tax, He Yushu Hosts Press Conference, Provincial Government Decides on Additional Levies for Various Counties

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 26th Dispatch] He Yushu, Director of the Land Tax Department of Jiangsu Province, announced that Jiangsu Province has decided to start collecting land tax on October 1st. He held a press conference on the 26th, where he emphasized two points: 1. Eliminating malpractices and making things convenient for the people, and resolving to investigate all reports and handle them once they are verified. 2. Strengthening supervision work and promoting the collective tax payment movement. The department has also scheduled a province-wide tax collection propaganda week to begin on the 28th. In order to prevent apportionment by various counties and alleviate the financial difficulties of the counties, the provincial government has decided to add the following levies for the land tax collection in various counties: Jiangdu, one dou; Jurong, four sheng; Yangzhong, one dou and seven sheng; Jinshan, five sheng; Shanghai, nine sheng; Nanhui, eight sheng and four ge; Kunshan, five sheng; Danyang, six sheng; Chongming, eight sheng.

### Hubei No. 11 Flour Mill Flour Approved for Transport and Sale in Peiping and Tianjin

### Huo Baoshu Resigns

[Our Report] Huo Baoshu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), has long intended to resign since the CRRRA corruption case occurred. Recently, Huo has been bedridden for many days due to a stomach ailment. It is now learned that he has indeed submitted his resignation to the Executive Yuan. The contents of his resignation letter state his work in the year following the incident. Recently, due to poor health and many affairs, he requests permission to resign from his position at CRRRA and return to his original position at the Bank of China.

Editorial

### Implementation Issues After the Textile Conference

The Second National Textile Industry Federation Conference just concluded on the 22nd of this month, and the National Textile Industry Production Conference, convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, opened on the 25th, lasting for three days and scheduled to end today. This shows the importance of the textile industry and the importance that the country attaches to it.

The Textile Industry Federation Conference had 72 proposals, and the Production Conference had 101 proposals. All issues, from raw materials, machinery, technology, sales, and how to improve production efficiency, reduce manufacturing costs, and standardize quality standards, have been thoroughly discussed, discussed, and resolved. If we can move from sitting down and talking to standing up and acting, and acting with results, then in the near future, the so-called production of ten million spindles, 320,000 looms, and 25 million dan of cotton will not be difficult to achieve step by step, day by day, and achieve the results we expect. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "It is not difficult to know, but it is difficult to act." Since the government and the business community have identified the goal and are working together to advance towards the overall goal, then no matter how many difficulties are encountered during the implementation period, it will not be difficult to overcome the difficulties and complete this major mission.

We have the three major superior conditions of timing, geography, and human resources for the textile industry.

The current difficulties in increasing production are due to more than one reason, but the most important is the failure to coordinate. For example, textile factories are limited by power and lack accessories; the wool textile industry lacks raw materials, and domestic wool is difficult to transport; machinery manufacturing plants are strangled by funds and cannot expand; import quotas are limited by foreign exchange reserves and are not easy to increase; and high interest rates and high wages are a burden, and sales restrictions are not entirely reasonable. These are all major obstacles at present, and they are also the most thorny problems for both the government and the business community.

However, although there are many difficulties, they are not insurmountable. As long as we identify the key points and work together under the major premise, we can weigh the urgency and priorities and resolve them completely or partially. What is regrettable is that some parties urgently need to take action, while others may still be indifferent. In addition, opinions are divided and there are too many constraints. A few people are even eager for short-term gains and have ulterior motives, so the calculations are too tight and too many side effects occur. This inevitably leads to being overwhelmed and weakens the overall strength and disrupts the established plans.

Therefore, after the various plans have been carefully discussed and resolved at the two conferences, our greatest requirement is whether everyone fully understands the goals and whether the people in charge are impartial and can maintain their grip. If it is determined that this production is indeed the most important industry at present, and that the current industrial plan should focus on the textile industry, then with sincerity, gold and stone can be opened. We believe that there are no insurmountable difficulties.

### Temporary Suspension of Electricity Restrictions and Dance Ban

Shanghai City. The fourth municipal assembly has now entered the stage of current affairs discussions, and its topics are gradually attracting attention. Yesterday's assembly passed measures and resolutions, all after heated debate, and ultimately gained majority support. This is clear evidence of how municipal affairs are being handled and a new sign of China's democratic politics gradually becoming sound.

Electricity supply in this city has been unable to meet demand since the war, greatly impacting industrial production, especially from 6 PM to 10 PM daily. If this situation continues without change, allowing general users to waste electricity, the result will either force factories to operate for only eighteen days a month or compel the power company to adopt a zoned rotating power outage system to cope. The former will undoubtedly further hinder production, while the latter will subject citizens to widespread "darkness" and could lead to adverse consequences that disrupt public order. After serious debate, the councilors amended and passed the mayor's proposed measures for conserving electricity, which is a responsible and wise move. In addition to setting a standard of forty kilowatt-hours per month for ordinary users, with limits based on the highest electricity consumption in March, April, and May of this year, there are separate provisions for commercial, industrial, and institutional users such as schools and hospitals, which are generally feasible. Councilors particularly emphasized that charging all government agencies for electricity usage is welcome news to the public. We sincerely hope that everyone will share the burden of these difficult times, pay attention to increasing production, and conscientiously and voluntarily conserve electricity, so that the saved electricity can be used to power machines for the production of materials. Only with sincere cooperation between citizens and the government can policies achieve their full effect, and the City Council has fulfilled its role as a bridge.

As for banning dancing, although the Executive Yuan has issued a directive, there is still no law in China prohibiting dancing as of the present moment, so commercial dancing cannot be regarded as illegal, and banning it lacks a legal basis. If the ban is for the sake of conservation, then what is the difference between social dancing and commercial dancing? What should be conserved are the foreign drinks and other things that accompany dancing, which are not related to dancing itself. Moreover, this city is an international metropolis, and dance halls hold government licenses, supporting tens of thousands of people, directly and indirectly. The current situation is volatile, with refugees filling the streets and the unemployed still struggling to find placement. Dancers and others may not be able to switch careers immediately. Why create more unemployment at this time? The municipal government must implement central government directives, but the central government has repeatedly urged the closure of dance halls by the end of this month, which seems difficult. However, we know that the central government is striving to streamline administration, and matters that should be legislated or executed by the central government are clearly listed in law. This type of issue does not fall within the rigid administrative scope of the central government and should allow local governments to weigh the situation and adapt to local conditions. Furthermore, the municipality is a unit of local autonomy, and after the Shanghai City Council met, it also requested the central government to reconsider and asked the municipal government to suspend the ban. The popular sentiment is evident. For the sake of the entire municipality, the government should administer with benevolence, focusing on the greater issues. Perhaps it is appropriate to relax the dance ban and withdraw the order. There are many more important matters for the central government to handle at this time, and countless other things in society are more wasteful than dance halls. The Executive Yuan has major issues to address and should not cling to preconceived notions!

### State-Owned Enterprise Sales: Valuation Standards Determined; Methods Include Public Bidding and Share Offering

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises, under the National Economic Council, held its second meeting on the 26th. The meeting was chaired by [blank], with committee members Liu Gongyun, Wu Rencang, Xie Chengping, Li Zhong [blank], Zhang Zizhu, and over ten others in attendance. The following important matters were discussed: Valuation standards: The unit price in 1937 will be used as the valuation standard for each entity. At the time of sale, the Supervisory Committee will determine the price multiple, which will then be multiplied by the 1937 value to determine the sale price at that time. All valuations will be submitted to the Supervisory Committee for review within two weeks. Methods of sale: divided into public bidding and share offering. It was decided that China Textile, China [Blank], and China [Blank] will be sold through share offerings (selling government-owned shares of China Textile). China Fisheries Corporation, Tianjin [Blank] Paper Company, Central Automobile Parts Manufacturing Plant, and China Tobacco Company will be sold through public bidding. De Foe Trading Company and Bayer [Blank] are [Blank] businesses and will also be sold through bidding in the same manner as state-owned enterprises.

### Taiwan Provincial Authorities Commission Commercial Banks to Handle Remittances Between Taiwan and Shanghai; Exchange Rates and Fees to Be Announced Daily

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 26th] Three days after the Taiwan Provincial Government issued an order to crack down on the black market for exchanging Taiwan currency for legal tender, the black market stopped trading, but the Taiwan currency depreciated further. The unofficial rate was only 49 legal tender dollars for one Taiwan dollar. The Taiwan Provincial Government convened another meeting this afternoon and decided on a new measure: Starting tomorrow, the Bank of Taiwan will commission three commercial banks here—Industrial and Commercial Bank, Chang Hwa Bank, and [Blank] Bank—to publicly handle commercial remittances between Taiwan and Shanghai, without any limit on the amount. The exchange rate will still be based on the official rate of one to seventy-two. However, remittance fees and handling fees will be charged. The amount of these fees will be announced daily by the three banks. Tomorrow's remittance fee and handling fee will be set at 25 percent, meaning that 1.25 Taiwan dollars will be exchanged for 72 legal tender dollars, or one Taiwan dollar will effectively exchange for 57.6 legal tender dollars. According to the Bank of Taiwan, this measure will provide an outlet for commercial remittances, reduce the black market for Taiwan currency, and gradually increase the value of Taiwan currency to the prescribed rate of one to seventy-two. In addition, this reporter has learned that the Shanghai branch of the Bank of Taiwan will also publicly handle remittances between Shanghai and Taiwan at a rate of 60 legal tender dollars for one Taiwan dollar.

### Britain Formally Announces to the United Nations Its Decision to Withdraw from Palestine; Indicates Intention to Abandon Mandate; Arab League Nations Firmly Oppose Partition Plan

[Our Dispatch] New York, 26th (Broadcast): The 55-nation UN Special Committee on Palestine met at 15:30 standard time today (00:30 AM on the 27th Shanghai time). The British representative, Colonial Secretary Jones, declared that Britain had decided to withdraw completely from Palestine, regardless of the consequences. He continued, stating that Britain advocated immediately ending the old League of Nations mandate granting Britain authority over Palestine for 25 years. He also stated that the future of Palestine was now in the hands of the United Nations, and in the absence of a suitable solution, Britain had decided to withdraw its troops and administrative organs from Palestine as soon as possible.

[Our Dispatch] New York, 26th (Broadcast): British Colonial Secretary Jones, on behalf of the British Imperial Government, expressed gratitude to the UN committee for its long journey and difficult investigative work. He said that the committee had made twelve general recommendations, eleven of which were unanimously approved by the committee, and one of which was approved by a majority. Britain agreed to all twelve recommendations, and the first recommendation was that the mandate over Palestine should be terminated as soon as possible.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] Observers here generally believe that the British and American delegations attending the UN are not yet willing to immediately announce their final policies on the Palestine issue. The reason why the US policy has not been decided is that the Jews have great power in New York State, and in next year's presidential election, the Jewish vote will have a significant impact on whether Truman or New York Governor Dewey wins. Now Dewey and another Republican candidate, Taft, have expressed support for the majority recommendations of the Palestine Inquiry Committee, namely the partition plan, which is what the Zionist movement supports. Truman, considering his own position, has to proceed cautiously.

Representatives of various countries also pointed out that if the UN passes the partition plan, there are still two issues to be resolved: (1) Who will be responsible for the administration of Palestine during the transitional period of establishing the two countries? (2) Which countries will provide the troops needed to implement the UN resolution? Since the United Nations Military Force has not yet been established, the troops will have to be provided individually by member states. The United States refused to accept the mandate over Palestine after World War I and is unwilling to send troops to the Holy Land.

[United Press, London, 25th] Syria has notified Britain that the Arab League nations do not recognize the Palestine partition plan. The prime ministers of these countries held a meeting last week and planned to impose economic boycotts on UN member states that support the partition. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Yemen, Outer Jordan, and Lebanon are expected to issue similar warnings.

### United States Proposes New Plan to Resolve Balkan Disputes Peacefully; Albania and Bulgaria Must Meet Conditions to Participate in Discussions

[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] The United States has achieved a decisive victory over the Soviet Union in a test vote on the Balkan dispute, requesting the UN to establish a special committee, including the five major powers, to seek to stop the long-term conflict between Greece and its neighbors. The United States also accused Greece's Soviet-backed neighbors, Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, asking the General Assembly to condemn their support of guerrillas fighting the Greek government. The General Assembly's Political Committee acted quickly, first considering applications from non-member states Albania and Bulgaria to participate in the debate on the Balkan issue. The United States agreed, but only if the two countries guaranteed that when invited to participate in discussions on the Greek issue, they would respect their obligations to peacefully resolve disputes under the provisions of the Charter. The Soviet bloc opposed this entirely, saying that the Assembly should not bind Albania and Bulgaria. The committee ultimately passed the American proposal by a vote of 38 to 6, with Arab nations abstaining.

### South Africa Condemned for Disregarding UN Resolutions; Chinese Representative Liu Kai Speaks Righteously

[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] South African representative Lawrence reiterated today in the UN Trusteeship Council that South Africa refused to place Southwest Africa under the trusteeship of UN institutions.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 25th] Because the Union of South Africa failed to comply with the resolutions of the previous UN General Assembly to place Southwest Africa under UN trusteeship, it was attacked by non-colonial countries in the Trusteeship Council today. Chinese representative Liu Kai sympathized with the movement of the people of non-self-governing territories and criticized South Africa for failing to fulfill the trusteeship agreement. Liu pointed out that placing formerly mandated territories under UN trusteeship was a moral obligation of the administering state, and that the administering state's continued exclusion from the trusteeship system was inexcusable. Liu further stated that the General Assembly should authorize the Trusteeship Council to consider the information provided by the Union of South Africa regarding the South African situation, rather than continuing to assign this task to the Trusteeship Committee. The first to launch an attack on South Africa today was India, whose representative accused South Africa of disregarding the will of the General Assembly.

We believe it is necessary to satisfy the wishes of the Korean people, so we propose that US and Soviet troops withdraw next spring. We hope the US will respond immediately.

### Truman Concerned About European Situation; Considers Interim Aid; Clayton Estimates $2.5 Billion Needed

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] President Truman said today that in order to maintain and promote the political stability and economic recovery of the sixteen European countries, the United States must provide rapid "interim aid." He said that the urgent situation in Europe is awaiting the fate of the Marshall Plan, and the US government is planning to draft a plan to aid Western Europe without convening a special session of Congress. This issue must be decided by the leaders of Congress, and he will meet with them on the 29th.

President Truman declined to estimate the cost of interim financial assistance, but said that Undersecretary of State Clayton had estimated the amount at $2.5 billion, which the State Department did not deny. The President also praised the formal statement in the report of the Paris Conference of the sixteen European countries, calling it an "important and gratifying first step" toward economic cooperation. The economic recovery problem mentioned in the Paris Conference report is not only related to the political and economic stability of Europe but also is the key to world stability and peace. The document is only a preliminary report and must be carefully reviewed and revised by the United States, and discussed with European experts to expand its scope. Truman also said that the three committees he appointed have been tasked with assessing the European plan based on the ability of the United States to meet European needs.

[United Press, Southampton, England, 26th] US Undersecretary of State Clayton and Ambassador to Britain Douglas departed today on the Queen Elizabeth liner to return home to report to President Truman on the economic situation in Britain and Europe.

### France's US Dollar Reserves Will Be Exhausted Within a Month

### Taft Criticizes Government, Believes Foreign Policy Has Made a Big Mistake; Firmly Opposes US Foreign Loans

[United Press, Tacoma, Washington, 25th] Republican Senator Taft gave a speech here today at the World Affairs Council, detailing the Republican Party's position on US foreign policy, criticizing the government for making a big mistake with its "stubborn philosophy" in the international situation. It is said that in terms of war, we have won, but in terms of peace, we have failed. The current world situation is as critical as it was in 1940. Only MacArthur's occupation of Japan, the establishment of the United Nations, and the recent signing of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance in Brazil have brought a ray of light. The United States should immediately stop lending to the world, believing that the United States cannot save the world with money alone. The Marshall Plan for European aid should be based on the principle of special loans and limited to special purposes such as repaying US goods. A peace treaty with Japan must be concluded immediately to allow the country to be self-sufficient. If we allow a country's living standards to be lower than other countries, then that country will be able to produce cheap goods and compete with the United States around the world. This is related to the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and US policy should strive to effectively raise the living standards of all countries, including defeated countries.

### Impasse on Admission of Five Former Axis Satellite States; Security Council Debate Yields No Result

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 25th] The Security Council today reconsidered the applications of the five former Axis satellite states to join the United Nations, but a new deadlock formed again due to British accusations of Soviet behavior as "unusual bargaining." The Security Council discussed Poland's proposal this morning, asking the Security Council to recommend [Blank] and [Blank] to join the United Nations. Soviet representative Gromyko stated that now that the peace treaty has been approved, he is willing to support the application of [Blank]. Less than a month ago, he would have vetoed the application, but with the condition of recommending Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and [Blank] to join. This caused great debate, with most member states, including China, the United States, and Britain, holding the same position, requiring that each country's application be considered separately and not voted on as a whole. [Blank] (Chairman of the Security Council) finally agreed with the majority opinion and immediately began discussing Hungary's request. The United States launched a fierce attack on the current government of Hungary, while the Soviet Union tried its best to defend it. As a result, no decision was made. The Security Council then decided to discuss the matter again on the 29th.

### Truman Signs Peace Treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary

### Right-Wing Members of the Japanese House of Councillors Respond to Shigeru Yoshida's New Party Movement

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The Ryokufūkai, a group of right-wing members of the Japanese House of Councillors, believing that the time is ripe due to the imminent approach of the Japanese peace treaty, has decided to form a political party. Shigeru Yoshida, the former Japanese Prime Minister and President of the Liberal Party, has been in talks with Tsuneo Matsudaira, the Chairman of the Ryokufūkai, since this summer regarding the formation of a new conservative party. On September 2nd, in addition to Yoshida and Matsudaira, Tameharu Katayama, Honorary President of the Democratic Party, and Naotake Satō, Chairman of the House of Councillors Foreign Affairs Committee, joined the talks, forming a "Big Four" meeting. They stated their goal of establishing a strong conservative cabinet to deal with the peace treaty. Today, the Ryokufūkai held its first meeting convened by seven new party preparatory members, including Yukio Ozaki. At the meeting, they first decided to turn the Ryokufūkai into a political party. However, the party's name and political platform have not yet been announced. Tsuneo Matsudaira is considered the most likely candidate for party leader. However, within the Ryokufūkai, which comprises about half of the House of Councillors members, there is considerable unease among those dissatisfied with forming a party under the influence of the Liberal Party. It is rumored that some members will join the Social Democratic and Democratic parties.

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] General MacArthur today completed his review of the Japanese Coal Mine Law and returned it to Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama with an attached letter stating that he would not oppose the nationalization of coal mines.

### Councillors Unanimously Pass Resolution Requesting Central Government to Temporarily Suspend Dance Ban; No One Opposed During the Vote

[Our own dispatch] The Municipal Council held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon. Important decisions were made on both the proposal for electricity conservation in the city and the dance ban issue, with detailed and heated discussions.

Regarding the dance ban, with a vote of 82 out of 96 councillors, a resolution was passed "to request the Central Government to reconsider the dance ban order, stating the reasons. The city government will temporarily suspend the execution of the Central Government's ban in this city." When the Speaker put the resolution to a vote, inquiring if there were any objections, not a single councillor raised their hand.

The discussion began with Deputy Speaker Yu Ji, who has lived in Shanghai for 36 years and never danced with anyone, expressing his opinion that a dance ban was unnecessary. Mr. Xu explained three reasons why a dance ban was unnecessary: Dance halls are businesses approved by the government and the Social Affairs Bureau. If the government suddenly bans businesses that have already been approved, then any business in the future can be banned. Dancing is a public entertainment, and dance halls are public places. If public entertainment is not allowed, many people will inevitably turn to private entertainment venues. There are many unemployed people in Shanghai, and no measures have been taken to help those who are already unemployed. How can we increase the number of unemployed people? Other councillors also rose to oppose the dance ban. Zhang Zhihan stated: The government should be responsible for Shanghai's extravagance because the import of luxury goods is the cause of this trend. Conservation is about saving foreign exchange. If it is taken from the Chinese people and used for the Chinese people, and indirectly helps the people, then it should not be banned at all. For example, Xia Danwei's dance hall makes more than 100 million in ticket sales a day. We should let these wealthy people generously donate, indirectly increasing tax revenue. Otherwise, it will be impossible to ask the Director of the Finance Bureau to collect taxes from them.

Shui Xiangyun said, "Conservation is a small matter, starvation is a big matter." After the dance ban, not only dance hostesses and dance industry workers will be unemployed, but also people in various related industries such as department stores and fashion companies will lose their jobs.

In the middle of the discussion, councillors asked Director Wu Kaixian to report on the relief measures after the dance ban. Director Wu explained the three measures previously announced by the city government and said that he was well aware that the problems after the dance ban would be very difficult and he was acting under orders. At that time, a small interlude occurred. Zhang Zhihan asked: "Since the government has issued an order and the city government has accepted it, why are you asking the council for its opinion? If you are seeking public opinion, why should you respect the council's opinion? Isn't that contradictory?" Director Wu immediately replied wittily: "I am an appointed official, not elected by the people. I was appointed by the central government, so I must obey the central government. But I am supervised by the people's representative body, so I must respect public opinion. Therefore, there is no contradiction at all." Wang Xianqing believes that not only should dancing not be banned, but it should be promoted. He said, "If you see dancing and don't think it's strange, its strangeness will disappear on its own."

Later, female councillor Tian Shujun expressed her views on the dance ban issue. Ms. Tian also did not advocate for the dance ban, expressed sympathy for the dance hostesses, and hoped that the dance ban would be postponed for three years. Then Tao Baichuan explained based on the constitution that the dance ban issue was a matter of people's legislation and not within the scope of central legislation. The government's order should not violate the constitution. If there is a violation, the local government is not responsible and does not need to obey the central government, otherwise it will be a mistake. Therefore, not only regarding the dance ban, the government should repeal similar legislation in the future. However, Mayor Wu stood up and explained that the city government could not not implement the central government's order, nor could it postpone it. Finally, Speaker Pan collected opinions from all parties and drafted the above resolution, which was passed by the assembly.

### Assembly Approves Amended Electricity Conservation Measures

[Our own dispatch] City councillors had quite different opinions on the "electricity conservation" proposal. The Council's Public Utilities Committee reviewed the proposal the day before yesterday and expressed support for electricity conservation, but amended the city government's proposed electricity conservation measures. However, during yesterday's assembly discussion, some councillors fundamentally

Opposed

electricity conservation. There were many reasons for this: Lu Shi Dao resolutely opposed it, saying that saving electricity would only increase the income of some meter readers and administrators, an "emperor." Moreover, citizens pay many kinds of taxes, and if they don't even have a little right to enjoy water and electricity, how can they win the people's hearts? Yang Fusheng said that while electricity consumption by large industrial factories is important, other industries, especially handicrafts such as printing houses and typesetting rooms, all need electricity and cannot save it. Zhang Zhongyuan also said that if electricity consumption by shops is reduced, it will affect business.

Those who

Supported

electricity conservation were more numerous. Zhu Wende said: Corruption is a social disease, and we cannot stop talking about electricity conservation because of this disease. In addition, saving electricity can increase production and improve work efficiency. Developing industry and increasing production must rely on electricity. Business development has nothing to do with the amount of electricity. The reason why business is not developed is because people's purchasing power is weak, not because the lights are not installed beautifully, which reduces business income. Zhang Zhusan and Zhang Zhihan also listed reasons for agreeing to save electricity. When the discussion came to an end, the Speaker first put the motion of whether to fundamentally oppose electricity conservation to a vote. As a result, only 12 voted against, and it did not pass.

### Standard for Ordinary Electricity Users is 40 Degrees

Following the discussion of the electricity conservation measures submitted by the mayor, amendments were made to the review opinions of the subcommittee. It was resolved that the original measures (see page 4 of this newspaper on September 9 for details) Article 1 be amended to the electricity consumption of ordinary electric light and electric heat users, with 40 degrees as the standard (electricity meters with the same household name are calculated together), limited to the highest electricity consumption in the three months of March, April, and May of this year. Electricity within the standard degree will be charged according to the prescribed electricity price. Electricity within the standard limit will be charged at twice the prescribed electricity price. The part exceeding the limit will be fined four times the prescribed electricity price for the first time, and six times the prescribed electricity price for the second time (both including the base amount). For the third and subsequent offenses, in addition to six times the rate, the [missing characters, likely involve punitive] measures, such as [missing characters, likely disconnection] power, may be taken depending on the circumstances.

### Supplemental Four Points

In addition to the seven measures of the Municipal Government, the subcommittee supplemented four points, which were also revised and decided upon by the assembly: Any factory that already has power generation equipment shall generate electricity within one and a half months after the passage of this measure. If it is insufficient, the power company will supply the electricity. No power generation subsidies will be given to factories that generate electricity for their own use. If electricity is supplied to citizens for use, subsidies may be granted at the discretion of the authorities. Schools and doctors' clinics with electrotherapy equipment will receive preferential treatment in terms of electricity consumption. Military organs shall be charged for electricity without exception, and relevant organs are requested to strictly enforce this.

Mayor's Opinion

Mayor Wu expressed to the assembly his hope to revise the above two items regarding "factories with their own power generation equipment," still granting subsidies, because factories with their own power generation should be encouraged, as their costs are more expensive than those supplied by the power company, hoping for subsidies. However, this was opposed by the senators. Some senators believe that factories such as the China Textile Mill all have power generation equipment, although their costs are higher, but the price of yarn is rising daily, and slightly increasing electricity costs has little impact on actual income, so unless it is supplied for civilian use, no subsidies should be given. The above amendments and supplementary opinions were passed by a majority of one hundred and ten out of one hundred and twelve senators.

Furthermore, Director Zhao yesterday replied to senators' inquiries about "when can electricity conservation be lifted?" stating: It will be lifted after the new generator arrives next year. An American-made new generator with a capacity of 115,000 kilowatts has already arrived.

Committee's Review of the Proposed Borrowing of the Ewo Garden Fails to Conclude

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Senate's four committees on public works, land administration, finance, and regulations, held a joint review yesterday morning of the proposal to borrow the Hardoon Garden and open it as a park. First, Mayor Wu reported on the negotiations with the owner of the Hardoon Garden, stating that the owner initially refused to lease it. Later, the Bureau of Public Works advocated requisitioning it, but ultimately, there were no clear provisions in the Land Law, nor was there such a huge requisitioning fund of 12.1 billion yuan. According to Luo Jialing's second will, the Municipal Government could receive a donation of 2 million yuan, which was worth about half of the Hardoon Garden at the time. If it could be based on this will, the Municipal Government would only need to requisition half of it. However, this did not materialize because the owner did not recognize the validity of the second will. Later, through the mediation of Du Yuesheng, Xi Yushu, and Gu Jiatang, the owner agreed to donate 15 mu of land and allocate three-tenths of its charitable fund, about US$450,000, to build a library, etc. Then, Speaker Pan explained that this case in the Third Congress was based on Proposal No. 1 of the First Congress, which originally was "borrowing" and "leasing," not "requisitioning." If "requisitioning" is desired, it needs to be discussed in another case. Subsequently, the senators expressed their opinions one after another, with some advocating requisitioning and some advocating accepting the donation. There was still no result by noon, so it was decided to submit it to the Congress for discussion.

### Dance Industry Willing to Donate One Day's Income

Suggest Monthly Charity Sale Once

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, representatives of the dance industry in this city, Sun Hongyuan, Tang Zongjie, and three others, took a letter of suggestion to the Municipal Senate for submission. The content stated that in order to respond to the authorities' austerity movement, the dance industry is willing to hold a charity sale one day each month starting next month. All of the business income of the capitalists, the dance tickets of the dancers, the tips of the employees, and the salaries of the musicians will be entirely presented to the Senate for distribution. It is estimated that the 29 dance halls in this city can earn 300 million yuan from one day of charity sales.

### Starting Point for Imposing Banquet Tax Decided to be Changed to 30,000 Yuan

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Senate passed several other proposals yesterday.

The Congress decided to change the starting point to 30,000 yuan.

The temporary motion by Jin Runxiang, Yan Esheng, Liu Jingji, and others, "Please request the Municipal Government to consult the Ministry of Finance to lift the restriction that checks cannot be used for payment," was passed.

The temporary motion by Tao Baichuan and others, "In order to reward the Baozhang (ward chiefs) of various districts for their hard work and commendable efforts in this conscription, it is proposed that the Municipal Government select the best and award them certificates or prizes to encourage them," was passed.

### Low Salaries of Military and Police - Congress Passes Improvements

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Senate's Research Committee on improving the treatment of soldiers and police presented several research conclusions yesterday, which were passed by the Congress:

The treatment of military and police in this city is indeed too meager and needs to be improved.

The way to improve is to invite the leading groups in this city to discuss raising several billion yuan for the military and police welfare fund in the shortest possible time, and appoint representatives to jointly manage it. The usage method will be determined separately.

The fundraising target should be concentrated on the wealthy to avoid increasing the burden on ordinary citizens.

### Two Cases of Illegal Foreign Exchange Speculation Cracked - Suspicious Letters, Cables, and Account Books Confiscated

Recently, the trend of private foreign exchange speculation in this city has been rampant. The Economic Section of the Police Bureau, based on intercepted secret telegrams and tips, investigated and discovered two cases of private foreign exchange speculation with major suspicions:

Jihelong at No. 7, Lane 110, Jixiang Street, whose business is import and export, and manager Wu Bingyi, recently sent a telegram to his friend in Hong Kong, the text of which was "40 boxes of medlar." After obtaining this telegram, the police bureau suspected it deeply, so they sent personnel to inspect it yesterday afternoon. They seized dozens of cipher books, telegram drafts, letter drafts, and account books, and took Wu Bingyi and the company's accountant Chen Bonian to the bureau for questioning. Wu confessed to private foreign exchange speculation without hesitation. Last month, he speculated a total of about 600 million yuan. The "40 boxes of medlar" mentioned in the telegram was actually the code for "40,000 Hong Kong dollars." Wu and Chen have been temporarily released on bail.

Guangming Import and Export at Room 47, 3rd Floor, No. 119 Renji Road, was secretly reported to have private foreign exchange speculation. Police officers went to the location to inspect and obtained many suspicious account books and correspondence notes. Chen Shaoyan, the person in charge of the firm, was taken to the bureau for questioning. According to his confession, the firm was jointly operated by him and Zheng Shenbai, Ni Zengxiang, and others. The source of foreign exchange was one from foreign deposits, two from fund transfers, and three from the Central Bank. The scope of business was quite extensive. The part of the firm's private foreign exchange speculation will be determined by the Central Bank after reviewing the seized account books. Chen Shaoyan was temporarily released on bail.

### Employer Not Accepting Conditions - Haianing Company Struck Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] The American Haianing Company was purchased by our Ministry of National Defense and is about to be taken over. The company's more than 200 permanent and temporary workers, fearing being laid off, made demands to the employer a few days ago, requesting six months' severance pay, two months' year-end bonus, and other conditions. The employer refused, so the more than 200 employees surrounded the factory until late at night the day before yesterday and went on strike yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently persuading and mediating.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The employees of the Four Banks and One Bureau went on a mass hunger strike for one meal at noon yesterday to express a "silent protest" because their salaries for this month were reduced and their demands have not received a concrete response. However, they still worked as usual. According to the person in charge of the banks and bureau, there is no division between labor and capital in the Four Banks and One Bureau. They serve the country as a whole, and their nature is very different from that of general commercial banks. The authorities of each bank and bureau expressed great sympathy for the current difficult situation of the employees, but they could not help them. The demands raised by the employees have been forwarded to the government authorities for final approval.

### Family Members of Victims of Iron Barge Explosion Plead for Compensation

### Women Discuss the Prohibition of Dancing

Resolved to Ask the Government to Postpone for One Year

Establish a Committee to Assist Dancers in Changing Careers

[Our Newspaper's Report] The dancers in this city are facing extinction after the dance ban. They specially appointed five representatives, Sun Zhimin, Meng Yan, Shen Lifang, Hong Xiaoping, and Jin Meihong, to gather at the Dance Industry Trade Union yesterday morning and go to the Xingzhong Society to ask Ms. Tian Shujun, a director of the Municipal Women's Association, to guide them to the residence of Chairman Chiang Kai-Shek's wife on Dongping Road to plead for assistance. Tian told them that Madam Chiang was unable to meet due to business, and that the Municipal Women's Association would hold a second joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the New Life Club at 3:00 pm to discuss the dance ban. Chen Yiyun was sent by the Central Government to attend and provide guidance, and they could attend as observers.

Madam Chiang's Concern

At the joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Women's Association, Jin Zhenyu served as chairman and explained the purpose of the meeting. Then, Central Committee member and female senator Chen Yiyun was invited to give a speech. Chen said that she had recently talked with Madam Chiang about the dance ban in Nanjing, and Madam Chiang was very concerned about the future of the dancers after the dance ban. However, because the government has set laws and regulations that cannot be opposed, and the date of the dance ban is imminent, Madam Chiang hopes that Shanghai women can find a way to solve the aftermath of the dance ban for the dancers. Senator Chen also said: When the senators Zhang Zhijiang and others proposed the dance ban at the Standing Senate Committee meeting, she would have opposed it, but because her strength was insufficient, it was eventually passed by the Congress. Dancer representative Jin Meihong then reported on the actual living situation, claiming that dancing is a legitimate profession. If it is said that dancing is harmful to public morals, then after the dance ban, many dancers may be forced to do even more harmful things to public morals. At present, the dancers in various dance halls in this city have mostly automatically implemented austerity. If the government cannot withdraw the order to ban dancing, it is hoped that it can help arrange the dancers' change of careers. Moreover, the dancers' own problems after the dance ban are minor. Their family members who rely on them for living expenses and their younger siblings or children who rely on them for education will also lose their dependence and opportunities for cultivation. Subsequently, the directors and supervisors present successively expressed their opinions, expressing great sympathy for the dancers' situation and hoping to find a proper solution.

Five Resolutions

Liang Zhao and Liang Ding claimed that the home was sealed up after the victory, and only a few boxes were taken away, which have now been emptied. The rumors of possessing huge amounts of money are misunderstandings. The court clerk recorded the statements and will make a decision after investigation.

### Extravagance is Not an Honor - Bad Habits Should be Eradicated Quickly - Promotional Meeting for the Austerity Movement Held

[Our Newspaper's Report] The promotional meeting for the austerity movement in this city was held at the gymnasium at 9:00 am yesterday. More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life attended. Mayor Wu, chairman of the meeting, said in his speech: Austerity is an inherent virtue of China. Foreigners have always praised the Chinese people for their spirit of enduring hardship, hard work, self-reliance, and frugality. However, in post-war China, especially in Shanghai, the atmosphere of extravagance has become increasingly prevalent, affecting the past virtues of austerity. Today, the poor and civil servants in the country have nothing to save. However, there are still many people in Shanghai living an extravagant life of debauchery. This atmosphere should be quickly eradicated so that the entire citizenry can be consistently frugal. We should advise the citizens of Shanghai that extravagance is not an honor but a disgrace. The citizens of Shanghai should earnestly implement austerity and set an example for the people of the whole country. Speaker Pan gave a speech, stating that the propaganda for austerity in Shanghai has begun to be implemented. He hoped that the citizens of the city would do their best to persuade and urge society to practice austerity, increase production, and reduce consumption, and use social forces to automatically and spontaneously remedy the current crisis.

Finally, Commander Xuan, Chairman Fang, and others successively gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at noon.

### Apprentices Complain and Request Solutions - Municipal Government Has Taken Measures to Improve - No More Abuse

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Government received a letter from a self-proclaimed stationery apprentice a few days ago, complaining about the hardships of life and listing various questions requesting solutions. The Municipal Government believes that the apprentice system in China's industry and commerce is an abnormal contractual act. There are many cases where the teachers or shop owners are very concerned about the apprentices and treat them like family members, but there are also those who arbitrarily order them around, do not show compassion, and regard them as slaves and servants. Moreover, most of the apprentices are children. Due to heavy workload and insufficient nutrition, their normal development is hindered, affecting their physical and mental health. This is the worst of all. These accumulated habits that violate humanitarianism should be eradicated to improve the situation. The Municipal Government has ordered the police bureau to crack down on acts of abuse of apprentices at any time and ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the industry associations to notify their member firms to quickly find ways to improve the treatment of apprentices based on the actual situation of each firm. They must not be bound by prejudice and engage in destructive and abusive behavior.

### Alluring Corpse in Bunker: Bizarre Murder Case Discovered in Jinan - Strangled with Rope, Chopped with Knife, Covered in Blood

[Report from our Newspaper, Jinan, 23rd] At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, a nude female corpse was found in a fortification bunker at the intersection of Jing Si Road and Wei Shi Road in Jinan. After the police and court sent personnel to the scene for inspection, multiple suspects were detained. The case is bizarre, and authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation. The details are reported as follows:

Sex of Corpse Undetermined at Time of Discovery

Niu Dingchen, a 59-year-old refugee from Xintai County living in the Jinan Xintai County Native Association at 155 Jing Si Road and Wei Shi Road, got up around 9:00 AM on the 23rd to urinate. As it was raining and he suffered from paralysis, making it difficult to walk, he went to the fortification bunker outside his door to relieve himself. To his shock, he saw a naked corpse inside the bunker. He did not have time to determine whether it was male or female, nor did he urinate, but immediately rushed out and told his fellow villager, Tang Yulin, who reported it to the Baojia head. The Baojia head then reported it to the Shangxi Branch Bureau. Bureau Chief Zhong Dianbin immediately led officers to the scene, maintained order, and notified the Jinan District Court.

Around Twenty Years Old, Completely Naked

Hearing the news, our reporter also braved the rain to arrive at the scene. Inside the bunker lay a female corpse. She had short hair and unbound feet. Estimating her age, she was approximately twenty years old, with a pretty face and fair, plump skin. She was completely naked, and there were no clothes left near the body. It was the corpse of an alluring young woman, not resembling someone from the red-light district. There was a knife wound about an inch long in the middle of her neck, shaped like a triangle, with drops of blood. A white cloth strip was also tied around her neck, and her mouth was stuffed with flowered cloth, which appeared to be her lower garment. Her eyes were tightly closed, and her eyelids were red. Opposite this bunker was another, facing each other across the road. The female corpse was discovered in the bunker on the west side of the road, while a blue Shilin cloth dress and a pair of blue cloth-soled shoes were found at the firing port of the bunker on the east side of the road. The bunker facing the street had no accessible door, with the door being inside a certain clothing factory. Criminal police officers entered the clothing factory to investigate, finding the bunker entrance piled high with cotton clothing bundles, heavily covered in dust, as if they had not been moved. As the court had not yet sent personnel for inspection, the police bureau preserved the original state of the scene. Although it was drizzling, a large crowd gathered to watch.

Court Sends Personnel to the Scene for Inspection

At 4:00 PM, Court Prosecutor Qin Shuofu, Wu Tingxian, Clerk Wu Zhensan, inspectors, and court police arrived at the scene to conduct an inspection. The inspection revealed that the female corpse had first been strangled with a rope and then fatally stabbed with a knife. The woman was not a virgin, but there was no evidence of sexual assault. They then entered the bunker from the clothing factory and retrieved the clothing from the firing port. In addition to the dress and cloth shoes, there was also a pink rayon underwear and a pair of beige socks, all neatly folded without any bloodstains. They then inspected the Xintai County Native Association and questioned the male and female foremen of the clothing factory, who all replied that they did not recognize the deceased.

Detain Suspects, Bury the Alluring Corpse

After the court and police jointly inspected and questioned, they dealt with the witnesses separately. Zhang Jingbo, the person in charge of the Jinan Clothing Factory, and Cen Yuting, a worker, were considered to be highly suspicious. The factory owner was notified, and they were temporarily handed over to Yu Jingwu, the squad leader of the Third Inspection District of the Defense Command, for custody. Female workers Lu Xiuying and Wang Fengying were also released on bail pending further investigation. The other witnesses, including Niu Dingchen, Fei Mian, the messenger of the clothing factory, Li Yanming, the messenger, and Police Chief Yang Renjun, were all released. Because no one claimed the deceased, the court issued a burial certificate, ordering the local authorities to bury her.

### Eight Boys in One Birth - Sets New World Record for Childbirth

[Report from our Newspaper, Yixing, 24th] The niece-in-law of Zhang Shuping, Director of the Direct Tax Bureau in this county, gave birth to eight boys in one birth, which is a rare and astonishing event in the world. Our reporter visited Director Zhang to inquire about this matter. He confirmed that it was true and promised to send a photo within two weeks, which will be published in our newspaper at that time. The details are briefly described below: The Zhang family is from Ningjin, Hebei. They left their hometown due to the devastation caused by the communists and traveled south, having been on the road for over two years. They have been serving in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. Director Zhang was transferred to Yixing in May of this year. Director Zhang's elderly father still lives in Tianjin. News about Ningjin is relayed through letters from his father. His nephew, Zhang Bingwei, worked with his grandfather in Tianjin after the communists occupied Ningjin. He is currently 26 years old and married a 27-year-old woman named Wang. She stayed in her hometown of Houchang Village, Yangpan Town, northeast of Ningjin, taking care of household chores. Four years ago, Zhang Wang displayed signs of pregnancy, craving sour foods, sleeping often, and generally feeling weak and unwilling to work. After several months, her abdomen became significantly enlarged, and everyone assumed she was pregnant. However, time passed without a birth, and her abdomen remained swollen. The family suspected she was seriously ill. Then, on the 17th day of the fifth lunar month this year, she suddenly went into labor and gave birth to eight boys in one birth. The birth was intermittent but without significant pain. One of the eight boys died shortly after birth, but the other seven boys and the mother are all healthy, which can be called a miracle and may break the world record for childbirth. According to a letter from Director Zhang's relative, Mr. Liu: "The communists also consider it a world miracle. They are very concerned about the Zhang Wang mother and children, providing them with supplies from time to time and hiring five wet nurses. Therefore, there are no problems with their living conditions."

### Shocking Robbery in Hong Kong - Impersonating Fruit Shop Assistants to Open Safe

[Report from our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 25th] Although Hong Kong police authorities pay close attention to public safety, Hong Kong's bandits are becoming more and more audacious. A very interesting robbery occurred recently. A clerk from a major business, having just withdrawn US$30,000 from the bank, was somehow spotted by the robbers, who followed him to the elevator in the China Building. As the elevator ascended, they pulled out guns, ordered the driver to stop, stole the US$30,000, forced the passengers out, and then calmly went back down in the elevator and strode away. US$30,000 is equivalent to HK$160,000, which is an astonishing amount! Although the police have intensified their investigation, there is still no news.

Before this matter subsided, another shocking robbery occurred at 9:50 AM yesterday (September 24) on Suhang Street, with the victim losing as much as HK$90,000. The Zhenyi Import and Export Company at 94 Suhang Street, which has been in the textiles business for many years. At 9:50 AM yesterday, three men impersonated familiar fruit shop assistants, knocked on the door, and delivered a basket of fruit. Unexpectedly, once the door was opened, one of them suddenly pulled out a gun, and another pulled out a sharp blade, driving all the staff to the attic to be guarded. They then forced the store owner to open the safe, taking all 250 taels of gold stored inside. Based on current prices, this is worth more than HK$90,000. Later, a large contingent of riot police arrived, but the robbers had already fled.

Hong Kong's major robberies often occur in broad daylight, and the locations are often on the busiest Queen's Road and Des Voeux Road. They seem to be deliberately joking with the police. People say that Hong Kong is a paradise for thrill-seekers, and this is a good proof. (Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng)

The victim lost HK$90,000, and the robbers fled before the large contingent arrived. In addition, the Jiangsu High Court has now ordered its subordinates to dispose of all defendants detained in connection with cases within three months in accordance with the law. If there are special circumstances, a special request must be submitted for an extension. If a criminal is sentenced to less than three years of imprisonment and the circumstances are minor and not yet confirmed, they can apply for suspension of detention.

Seven Scientific Organizations - Issue Joint Declaration - Offer Advice on Scientific Research

[Our Newspaper] The

Science Society of China, the

Natural Science Society of China

, the Astronomical Society of China

, the Meteorological Society of China

, the Geographical Society of China, the Zoological Society of China, and the Anatomical Society of China held a joint annual meeting in Shanghai on the 1st of this month. The seven organizations provided opinions after the meeting as a

joint declaration. The opinions are published as follows: Atomic energy issues: We believe that

scientific research should aim to improve the welfare of mankind, and the research on atomic energy is no exception. The discovery that the atomic nucleus can be split coincided with the life-and-death struggle between democratic and dictatorial countries, so scientists used atomic energy for weapons of war. The misfortune of atomic energy is also the misfortune of scientific research. Now that the war has ended, democratic countries are working hard to cooperate. We advocate that this kind of research should be open, free, and move towards world peace and human welfare; we do not want to see this invention that can benefit mankind become a cruel weapon, nor do we want to see the unity of democratic countries undermined or the freedom of scientific research endangered because of the atomic energy weapons race or keeping the secrets of atomic bomb manufacturing. For this reason, we are willing to support the Atomic Energy Education Committee advocated by Professor Einstein and the alliance organized by American atomic scientists.

Domestic scientific research issues: The people of our country are struggling on the hunger line in the atomic energy era. One of the reasons is the backwardness of science. The meaning of scientific development is originally to improve the living standards of the people, and the degree of improvement should be proportional to the degree of scientific development. In the past, people in our country did not attach importance to basic science. Once they entered the atomic energy era, they chased after importing one or two instruments related to atomic energy research to keep pace with the scientifically advanced countries at that time, which is really impossible. We believe that if we want to seek the development of science in our country, we should start from the root, such as enriching the books and instruments for science education, and guaranteeing the lives of scientists who practice research and education; especially important is that scientific undertakings should have a definite budget and a long-term plan, and should not be like the Three Gorges Water Conservancy Project, which is started and stopped repeatedly, so that the promotion of science will not be like the ship and gun policy of the past, only to be ridiculed by people all over the world, and science can become an important factor in our nation-building and benefiting the people.

Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained firm, and green sugar saw high prices again. The association's pricing, the current spot price of 20 medium sugar white was 753,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan

, and later it was 760,000 yuan. The bag-packed Taiwan red was 760,000 yuan, and the four-and-a-half-day red was 910,000 yuan to 900,000 yuan. Shantou green opened to 650,000 yuan and suddenly rose by more than 40,000 yuan, with dozens of bags traded.

Xinghua white was 750,000 to 60,000 yuan, and the basket-packed was 735,000 yuan to 715,000 yuan.

Xinghong was 65,000 to 70,000 yuan, with more than 700 pieces traded. Diao green was priced at 620,000 yuan by the industry, with dozens of bags. Hainan high-quality red was 670,000 to 80,000 yuan, an increase of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, with hundreds of bags.

### Qi Hong Traded in One Batch

In the foreign tea market, the British merchant export company has been suppressing the price of this year's Qimen black tea. Because the goods side is trying to maintain the price and is reluctant to part with it, the transaction has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, in the market, some cargo owners who were adjusting funds frequently sold their goods, so the process suddenly became clear. The city totaled more than 100 boxes absorbed by Jardine Matheson, with a price of 1.75 million yuan per picul, and the market sentiment was slightly softer than before. For other patterns, buyers are still only sporadically interested, but suppliers are still determined to sell, so the situation is still standing. As for various domestic teas, both this street and the customer side have active destocking, and the green teas such as Huizhou fried green and baked green in this year's year are selling even more miraculously, and the market is rising again, and the rest are uniformly stable.

### Textile Adjustment Price Negotiations Stalled: Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Stop Rising and Start to Fall

[Our Newspaper Report] The Cotton Yarn Price Negotiation Committee of the Textile Adjustment Association,

did not make any changes yesterday. 20-count yarn remained at the

original price of 14.5 million yuan.

China Textile Construction Company yesterday, as usual, sold yarn in two groups, A and B.

Group A sold 1,976 pieces,

with 543 purchase orders. Group B sold 177

pieces, with 177 purchase orders. The two groups

sold a total of 2,153 pieces, equivalent to 20-count yarn,

with a total of 720 purchase orders.

Yesterday, the yarn market saw tightened credit

due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival. The authorities

were handling the registration of stored yarn, and industry

insiders were quite wary. Furthermore, the Textile Adjustment Association's

asking price remained unchanged, and many who had profited within the market were reselling a great deal,

causing a general decline in market momentum. By the close of the market, 42-count "Blue Phoenix"

yarn plummeted by 2.5 million compared to the previous day, falling to

25.2 million yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse

and fine yarns also uniformly and rapidly fell by 1 million to over 2 million

yuan respectively.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened in the morning with tightened credit conditions.

Customer interest in purchasing slackened, and industry insiders and small vendors

sold off their stocks, leading to lower opening prices for all goods. By 10:00

AM, the US dollar exchange rate suddenly rose, and market sentiment turned firm,

with active short covering, causing prices to rise again. Around 11:45

AM, prices fell again following the decline in yarn prices. At the close of the market,

"Dragon Head" fine cloth still saw a slight increase of 7,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

Bleached cloth, coarse cloth, dyed cloth, and Shilin cloth, etc., remained

strong and brisk, while the prices of other cloths saw mixed ups and downs.

Yesterday, the spot cotton market stopped rising and started to fall.

Market sentiment weakened, and buyers were not eager to purchase

due to the slight pullback in cotton yarn prices. Due to the industry's

urgent credit needs, many were selling off their stocks,

causing market prices to decline. Yarn factories took advantage of the low prices to buy, and

transactions were slightly more active. Total daily trading volume was around 2,000 bales.

### Banks Continue to Inject Funds, Credit Remains Tight

[Our Newspaper Report] After the national

banks injected a large amount of 92.9 billion yuan

into the bill clearing house

the other day, they continued to inject 5.2

billion yuan yesterday. Credit conditions remain

tight, and underground interest rates are still quoted at 20%,

while outside the stock market, interest rates are slightly

lower, around 28%.

In the breakdown of inflows and outflows, the Central

Bank had an outflow of 2.1 billion yuan, direct

clearing houses had an inflow of 32 billion yuan, foreign

banks had an inflow of 13.4 billion yuan, and agent clearing houses

had an outflow of 21.8 billion yuan.

Other banks include: Bank of China outflow of 6 billion

yuan, Bank of Communications inflow of 6 billion yuan, Farmers Bank of China

outflow of 9.7 billion yuan, China Trust inflow of 24.1

billion yuan, Postal Remittances outflow of 8.3 billion yuan, and Cooperative

Treasury inflow of 1.2 billion yuan.

### Tight Credit Causes Weak Silk Market

The artificial silk market yesterday was quite

sluggish due to extremely tight credit conditions. In the morning, 120-count "Takayama"

rayon was traded at 48 million yuan for immediate delivery, and 9 million yuan for deferred delivery.

In the afternoon, market conditions weakened further, and the final price retreated to 8.5 million yuan,

a drop of 1 million yuan compared to the previous day's final price.

Yesterday morning, the factory silk market opened extremely weak

also due to the very tight credit conditions among industry players. Later, it was learned that

the exchange rate had been adjusted again, and the market became firm

with asking prices at all levels similar to the previous day's prices. High-quality silk was traded at 46-47 million yuan per load, and high-quality

dried silk was traded at 33 million yuan.

Five-load factory silk only had one transaction. Forward contracts

for one-month delivery of "0" grade silk were at 48 million yuan.

The silk goods market was also affected by credit conditions. The real silk quilt market

opened lower. "Dazang Huachang" goods were initially traded at 7.65 million

yuan, but prices fell gradually, with the lowest price at 7.2 million yuan, fluctuating

between 7.2 million and 7.3 million yuan for a long time. Later, due to the high exchange rate,

market sentiment was revived, and prices rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan in an instant. The closing price

for immediate delivery was 7.6 million yuan, and 7.8 million yuan for deferred delivery. The asking prices for "Meiya" quilts

differed by only a few million yuan. The prices of other goods remained generally

stable.

### Executive Yuan Orders National Banks to Draft Detailed Exchange Settlement Measures for Overseas Students

[Our Newspaper Report] After the revised Measures for the Administration of Foreign Exchange

were promulgated and implemented on August 17,

exchange rates are divided into official rates and market rates. Regarding the exchange rate

problem for self-funded overseas students' foreign exchange needs, the Central

Bank immediately drafted its opinions and submitted them to the Executive

Yuan for instructions. On September 11, the Executive Yuan telegraphed

that self-funded overseas students who passed the second examination of the Ministry of Education

and held study certificates should settle exchange at the official rate,

and the Central Bank should issue Circular No. 113 to all designated banks for compliance.

However, the exchange rate for living expenses for other self-funded overseas students and first and second examination graduates

already abroad has not yet been determined.

It is now learned that the Central Bank has received an electric message on the 21st of this month

from the Executive Yuan, instructing the Ministry of Education to consult with the Ministry of Finance and

the Central Bank to discuss detailed measures for overseas students' applications for foreign exchange settlement, regardless of whether they are self-funded or not,

and whether they have gone abroad or not, and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Central Bank

has received a notice from the Ministry of Education that it will hold a meeting in Beijing

in the coming days to discuss the matter. It is also reported that since the Central Bank revised the Foreign Exchange Management Measures,

it has approved 532 foreign exchange applications for students who passed the second examination to go abroad.

### Idle Talk About Examinations

— Que Yizhi

Editor's Note: At the editor's request, the author of this article uses the perspective of the examination hall to view the miscellaneous scenes of academia. Here, the author raises questions, points out the difficulties faced by university students in enrolling a month ago, and writes about the various forms and formalities of the examination hall. This is a valuable piece of writing amidst the sound of the opening of universities.

The annual entrance examination for new students is held in the sweltering heat of August, as usual.

Schools have to spend a lot of money, and candidates travel from afar, exhausted.

Some say that this is also a waste of manpower and resources.

In order to keep the examination confidential, the test questions must be printed behind closed doors. Several staff members and

workers, from the time they enter the "gate," cannot step beyond the bounds of the pool for their daily life,

until the examination is completed before they are released. Leaking test questions can be punishable by imprisonment.

Grading papers is a tedious task, too monotonous.

Looking at the same papers every day, there are few

correct answers and many wrong ones, which does not arouse the interest of the graders.

There are so many examination papers, and the weather is so hot.

Waving a fan and wiping sweat is not enough, and one has to concentrate

and go through them one by one, which is truly

frustrating. After becoming tired, it is inevitable

to mark the grades carelessly. However, the fate of the candidates is determined here.

One must truly show leniency and be considerate of the candidates' hard work,

spend more effort and time, and not "do things according to one's own will" or "observe the mood."

The number of candidates is increasing year by year, and admission is becoming more and more difficult.

It is said that there are 200,000 high school graduates in the country this year, and universities and vocational schools across the country can accommodate about 30,000 people.

What about the remaining 170,000 people? Are all of them below the standard?

If their standards are not up to par, they should not be allowed to graduate in the first place. Since they have graduated,

efforts should be made to allow them to continue their studies. Although not all high school graduates want to go to college,

most of them are preparing for further education. To say the least, at least 100,000 of the 170,000 people

will be deprived of education. This is a major problem in education, and also a very serious social problem.

The current party and league are paying attention to "ensuring equal opportunities for young people to continue their studies and find employment."

It is hoped that they can think of practical solutions for them.

The economic circumstances of the candidates' families vary greatly.

As seen in the examination hall, some are dressed in elegant Western suits,

while others are wearing only a single undershirt. Some are wearing white leather shoes,

while others are wearing straw sandals. There are modern city girls with oiled hair and powdered faces, wearing diamond rings,

and there are also country girls with disheveled hair and wearing blue cloth gowns.

Moreover, some candidates come to Shanghai from afar, with no money to stay in hotels.

After the examination, they stay overnight in the examination hall. As for temporarily sleeping

on the floors of the corridors or classrooms of the schools they are applying to,

there are even more. This illustrates that a portion of the families

are economically depressed and the countryside is bankrupt. These students cannot afford to go to college.

On the other hand, there are also many who have the means to study. In an examination hall

with 220 people, I counted that 48 people were using new-style Parker fountain pens.

Needless to say, there were also many who used domestic fountain pens. If we use this to infer

the candidates' family economic situation, we can at least say that one-fourth of them are well-off and one-fourth of them

are very poor. To "ensure equal opportunities for continuing education,"

government scholarships should be specifically awarded to these aspiring, outstanding, and impoverished young intellectuals.

Do not let those young masters take public funds to dance and watch movies!

To enrich one's academic abilities, one must study regularly. Digging a well when one is already thirsty will not help in time.

There is a common phenomenon among candidates: before entering the examination hall, almost everyone

is holding a "Application Guide," "Further Education Guide," "Detailed Explanation of University Exam Questions,"

... This fully reveals that their usual studies are insufficient, so they can only cram at the last minute.

Cheating in the examination hall is also commonplace. Passing notes,

peeking, carrying cheat sheets, exchanging papers, switching seats,

and hiring substitutes all occur. There are many ways to carry cheat sheets.

The most ingenious is that a female student wrote the mathematical formulas with an ink pen on her snowy white

thigh. Writing on the palm of the hand is not considered rare. Comparing photos is an effective way to prevent candidates from impersonating others.

Some faces are special and can be identified at a glance. Some are ambiguous and difficult to judge.

In particular, it is even more difficult to distinguish between brothers taking the exam on behalf of each other.

My personal experience is that the shape of the ear can be used to distinguish between true and false.

Going to the examination hall is like going to the battlefield. One must rely entirely on one's true abilities.

Those with good abilities are sought after everywhere and do not need to ask someone to "introduce," "recommend," or "promote,"

... I dare say that now general universities all handle admissions through an organizing committee.

The power is independent, and even the president cannot interfere. The examination procedures are so complicated, the number of people is so large,

and everything is sealed. The admission standards are decided at a meeting.

Who can get through the "connections"? Therefore, it is absolutely impossible

to seek "relationships" or do "under-the-table work" to be admitted.

I often advise students who fail the exam not to be discouraged.

The exam is fair, and they should try again and again. If they are not admitted this year, they should come again next year.

If they have the ambition, they will eventually be able to achieve their wishes.

Indeed, enrolling new students is a major event for the school.

At the same time, it is a major turning point in the life history of the candidates. Entering the university

allows them to pursue advanced studies, with unlimited prospects and immeasurable opportunities.

Unfortunately, failing the exam leads to a change of career, not seeking to improve,

and living a mediocre life. Therefore, this turning point has a great impact on the future of young intellectuals.

Is our current examination system, with its limited number of admissions and large number of applicants, perfect?

Can we imitate the universities in Paris, London, and New York,

admit tens of thousands of commuting students and open up greatly,

so that every aspiring young intellectual can have the opportunity to study?

I think this is something that government authorities and people in society should consider.

### Lifelong Friendship

— Shufeng

In this society that "values clothes more than people,"

most people are inclined to each other for profit and associate with each other according to power.

Among friends, those who can truly show benevolence and righteousness and be honest with each other are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

Everywhere we look, what we see is mostly a group of so-called "relatives and friends"

who kick people when they are down or turn a blind eye to each other.

As for talking about the "phrase" "lifelong friendship," it truly evokes

endless emotions and sighs at the degeneration of people's hearts and the fickleness of the world.

It is said that during the Spring and Autumn period, King Yuan of Chu admired benevolence and righteousness and recruited talented people.

Many scholars came to him after hearing the news. There was a poor scholar named Zuo Botao,

who also carried his books and food to the State of Chu, hoping to be reused by King Chu and display his grand strategy.

When he arrived in Yongzhou, he met Yang Jiao'ai.

The two poor scholars hit it off and became sworn brothers.

Together, they went to Chu. When they passed Liangshan, they encountered a snowstorm.

Zuo Botao thought that the journey ahead was long and the clothes and food they had brought were limited,

and they could not have both. So, he "took off his clothes and shared his food,"

freezing himself to death in the forest. Instead, he told Yang Jiao'ai to take his clothes and food

and go to Chu alone. Later, Yang Jiao'ai was indeed appointed as a senior official,

and he even asked King Chu for permission to bury Zuo Botao generously.

However, because Zuo Botao's tomb was too close to Jing Ke's tomb, his spirit was often insulted by Jing Ke.

Yang Jiao'ai could not bear Zuo Botao being bullied by Jing Ke, so he also committed suicide in front of Zuo Botao's tomb,

burying himself beside it to help Zuo resist Jing in death and to follow Zuo Botao in the underworld.

Although this matter is inevitably absurd, the two men, Zuo Botao and Yang Jiao'ai, who sacrificed their lives for friendship,

are worthy of praise. The four words "lifelong friendship" are truly worthy of Zuo and Yang.

Coincidentally, at the same time (around 600 BC), there were also two "lifelong friends" in Greek history,

two Athenian youths, one named Cratinos and one named Aristodemos.

At that time, Athens was in turmoil after the Cylon rebellion, and people's hearts were fluctuating, making it difficult to calm down.

After Cylon seized power, he thought that he must make a sensational statement to cover up his guilt,

so that he could legitimately start anew with the people and change the people's intentions.

So, he invited the virtuous and well-known Epimenides to hold this atonement ceremony.

As a result, the "sacred fire" was rekindled on the altars everywhere, and rich sacrifices were offered on the altars again.

However, in the grand ceremony, a "person" had to be sacrificed.

Both Cratinos and Aristodemos were extremely willing to sacrifice themselves to seek the happiness of their country.

However, whichever of them died, the other would never be willing to survive alone,

because they had deep friendship and a shared desire to die on the same day.

Therefore, the two of them made a sacrifice together, and in this superstitious act,

for the sake of their country and for the sake of their friendship, they shed their blood,

smearing it on the altar. This story illustrates the story of a pair of "lifelong friends"

who lived in the same era as Zuo and Yang, but in different regions. It can be said to be

"uncommon."

Looking at the two East-West stories above, we can see that although they were in two slightly similar situations,

and in two regions that never communicated with each other, their heroic acts of sacrificing themselves for friendship can truly illuminate

the ages and shame ordinary unrighteous people.

Odds and Ends from America
— Xu Ziyuan

### American-Style Vegetarian Dishes Eaten Raw

When Americans dine, they always start with a plate of raw vegetables, with many varieties.

Commonly, it is raw tomatoes and raw cabbage. More refined ones have shredded chicken and raw cabbage, or assorted fruits.

Why don't Americans get worms from eating raw vegetables? Because American farms do not use manure to water vegetables,

but use disinfected tap water. Therefore, raw vegetables cannot become a medium for infectious diseases. In America,

you will never find toilet paper in your raw vegetables. The Western restaurants in Shanghai also imitate this,

fully Americanizing. Before I start eating, I always turn the raw vegetables over a few times to see if there is any

toilet paper inside. But the infectious bacteria hiding in the fibers cannot be caught. In order to

show that I am Westernized, I have to eat the unsanitary vegetables. This will not make the host lose face,

nor will I be considered a country bumpkin by the special guests. But before the large manure party is used as fertilizer,

it is always unsanitary to eat raw vegetables. Although manure donation is a large source of income for the municipal authorities,

and the huge price of manure itself has created the wealth of many manure kings,

a large portion of the income from manure is offset by the expenditure on disease prevention.

If the bacteria transmitted from raw vegetables each year were to be statistically analyzed, there would definitely be an alarming number.

When I occasionally sit in the Cathay Hotel or the Huizhong Hotel,

when I see the people at the next table eating raw vegetables, I get the feeling

that they are devouring toilet paper and bacteria. After eating, they inevitably have to get a vaccination to prevent the bacteria from causing trouble.

Why not cook the raw vegetables before eating them? American style requires American

conditions. At the very least, it can be said that manure and vegetables are mortal enemies.

### The Metaphor of Chinese, Indian, and Japanese Folding Fans

— You Jin

After reading the broadcast address given by Indian Ambassador Luo Jialun in New Delhi on August 18,

saying that the Indian bloodless revolution was a complete success, declaring it an unprecedented achievement in history, I thought of several articles in Zhang Taiyan's book.

Mr. Taiyan had a deep study of India.

He had a preface to the Indian Brahmin Baushatvayu II,

recording the words of Brahmin: "I heard that thousands of years ago, there were two Indian and Japanese monks

who came to China at the same time. The Chinese monk invited them in and talked very happily.

He said: "Are the three countries like folding fans?

India is the paper, China is the bamboo frame, and Japan is the rope for tying the handle.

If the two countries revive one day, and agree with Japan to be in Asia, they should be like

this folding fan." Alas, now the paper and the bamboo frame are both decayed, and only the ring rope remains.

Can it restore the old shape of the folding fan? It is unknowable..."

(This was written in the 40th year of Meiji, and is also repeated in the article "Record of the Commemoration of the Indian Shivaji King")

Now China, which has won the Anti-Japanese War, although

still in decay, has finally removed the ring rope.

Fortunately, India, as the paper of the folding fan,

has been completely renewed. Our not very complete bamboo frame

needs to be repaired urgently. If it is repaired well, and a new and beautiful paper is put on,

(meaning cooperation with India) wouldn't it be enough to form a very beautiful folding fan?

The folding fan does not necessarily need the ring rope of the handle.

It can be replaced with other things or discarded.

But I am afraid that someone will use that ring rope to bind this exquisite folding fan

with paper and bamboo frame.

### Random Collection of Doggerel

— Xiao Kangshi

A single mooncake costs a fortune,

Sweet to the mouth, bitter to the heart;

The Mid-Autumn Festival orders frugality,

But all that's seen on the streets is gift-givers!

As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, mooncakes appear on the market,

with some priced as high as tens of thousands of yuan apiece.

Although "orders are issued for frugality,"

the streets are filled with people coming and going to give gifts.

With commodity prices soaring so high, the mooncake

is "sweet to the mouth" but "bitter

to the heart"!

### Weekly Film Review

— Li Zhen

The Incoherent and Confused "South Seas Love Song"

This film uses

a love triangle

to depict the martyrdom of

the Malay local girl, Lotus. However, due to the lack of creative ability

of the screenwriter, the story in the script seems pieced together from various sources.

The male lead, Luo Qianglun, already knows that Lotus's kidnapping and disappearance

are his father's conspiracy, so why is he willing to return to Hong Kong with his father?

This example is enough to illustrate that

the screenwriter disregards whether the development of the plot is reasonable,

simply wanting to complete this tragedy at will. In the end, besides

a tragedy that is as incoherent and confused as it is now, what else can one expect?

Among the actors, Ji Hezi is mediocre, and Wang Hao is forever the same old

expression, lacking creativity. Yao Ping's singing is extremely clumsy.

The Subpar "Grievances of a Wealthy Family"

"Grievances of a Wealthy Family" attempts to portray the decline

of a feudal aristocratic family,

but the author only focuses on

the personnel disputes within this large family. It's like a series of endless

illustrations, tirelessly reenacting these unmoving

stories, making the audience feel weary. Especially important, the author

does not vigorously criticize these characters, so the reason for the decline

leaves the audience with no gains from this film, resulting in nothing

achieved.

The performance is also unremarkable, and the director's incompetence is

the main reason for the failure. At the same time, among these actors, except for Ba Qiu

Xia, who is somewhat satisfactory, none of the others

are acceptable. Especially Zhang Ying's portrayal of the young master and Ba Hong's portrayal of the third young master are simply terrible.

The Unremarkable "Spring Traces by the Sea"

Clark Gable returned to film

after the war, paired with

Greer Garson as the female lead, making for a strong cast, but

the film fails to satisfy us. First of all, the content of the script

depicts the love between a sailor and a female librarian.

It's purely "American style." From acquaintance

to love, it takes less than a day, only three days,

and they get married. A week later, they announce their

divorce. Everything is like child's play. Who can say this isn't

nonsense?

Clark Gable's sailor is glib and smooth-tongued, acting

over the top and making him annoying. Greer Garson is only average.

The performance of the great director Victor Fleming is also unremarkable.

The Mediocre "New Red Flower Serenade"

"New Red Flower

Serenade" is set against

the background of Havana

in South America,

interweaving an unoriginal multi-angle love story. The main

reason is to arrange the tropical song and dance of Carmen Miranda, who is known as the "South American shemale," but this strangely shaped

"shemale" is no longer

considered novel in the eyes of the Shanghai audience. In addition, the story itself lacks moving

elements, and the scenery of South America is not fully showcased, so "New

Red Flower Serenade" is just a mediocre musical.

Carmen Miranda always uses the same old tricks. Alice Faye and John Payne naturally

won't have any brilliant performances in such a film either.

The color in this film is still good.

The Excellent Documentary "China's Resistance War"

On the screen, it seems that we

have not yet seen

a systematic film

introducing the historical facts of China's War of Resistance. The currently screening

"China's Resistance War" is a relatively satisfactory

documentary.

Here, we must thank American director Frank Capra

for his excellent editing skills. Although some places use too many

repeated shots, that may be due to his lack of familiarity with the Chinese

situation, resulting in the use of shots of a certain event

for several different regional events.

To familiar Chinese people, this is impossible not to be recognized.

—— But I still recommend this documentary that is worth watching.

The Not Worth Watching "The Abandoned Woman"

"The Abandoned Woman" uses

sensational advertisements to lure

the audience, but the audience is

left disappointed. Because, in fact, this film is not worth

watching. The story is extremely bland, the performance is also dull

and unbearable, and the film is also short, without any of the so-called "sexy" or "licentious" things advertised. These are all

gimmicks to fool the audience. As for the Laurel and Hardy short film "The Shrewish Wife and the Clumsy Husband" added to the start of the film, it is an old and outdated

comedy short.
