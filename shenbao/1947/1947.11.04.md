### US Congress to Discuss Aid to China; Grain Relief to be Shipped to Shanghai Within the Year; Chow Yih-deh Meets Chairman Chiang, Discusses Political Situation

[United Press International, Washington, 3rd] It is reported here on the 3rd that after Senate President Vandenberg returns this week, the State Department's secret handling of General Wedemeyer's report on China will be brought up for discussion at the special congressional session to be held on the 17th. Vandenberg will have several members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Appropriations Committee. They advocate that the government provide Congress with full details of the plans for foreign aid, including plans related to China. It is said that some senators feel that the United States is moving slowly on aid to China while the Marshall Plan for European aid is nearing completion. They hope to know how much money and goods will be needed to strengthen the anti-communist forces of the Chinese National Government. They hope to see Wedemeyer's recommendations, believing that he is proposing large-scale aid to China.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The first batch of grain for aid to China, transported under the Sino-US relief agreement, is expected to arrive in Shanghai within the year. This move will greatly help stabilize grain prices. According to the agreement, the United States will assist us with 200,000 tons of grain, including 120,000 tons of rice and 80,000 tons of wheat, and US$5 million in medical supplies. It is also learned that the first batch of grain we purchased separately in the United States will also arrive in Shanghai within the year and will be sold in Shanghai to suppress grain prices, and the proceeds will be used to purchase grain in domestic production areas and transport it to disaster-stricken areas.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Chairman Chiang received US Congressman Chow Yih-deh at 5:00 PM on the 3rd. Chow was accompanied by Ambassador Stuart. He tried his best to converse with the Chairman in Mandarin, which was translated by Secretary Shen Chang-huan. They exchanged views on the current situation in China.

[This Newspaper News] Ambassador Stuart and US Congressman Chow Yih-deh flew to Nanjing yesterday morning at about 9:00 AM. Chow is scheduled to come to Shanghai again today to meet with people from all walks of life to exchange opinions on the current situation. Tomorrow, he will return to the United States by special plane to prepare for the special congressional session on the 17th of this month.

### Chow Yih-deh Tells Tseng Chi That He Will Call for Aid to China Upon Returning Home

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] US Congressman Chow Yih-deh met with Tseng Chi, Chairman of the Chinese Youth Party, and Hsieh Cheng-ping, a member of the Party's Central Committee, at the US Embassy at 2:00 PM on the 3rd. Tseng raised two points: 1. Since General Marshall returned to the United States, the US policy toward China seems to be hesitant. What is the reason for this? I am puzzled. 2. China has a vast territory and a large population, and its relationship to world peace is at least no less than that of Turkey. Why is the United States putting aid to China on the back burner? Chow replied: The US public opinion on China does have some misunderstandings, because many of the reporters who came to China in the past were left-leaning and had preconceived notions, so they often distorted the facts. For a time, the people felt quite confused, but now it is gradually becoming clearer and leaning towards aiding China. I have called for aid to China four times in Congress. I will continue to work hard after I return to the United States. He also asked Tseng what kind of aid to China would be the most appropriate? Tseng replied: Aid to China must be comprehensive, including economic, military, and political aspects. The economic aid can be divided into two types: (a) political loans and (b) economic loans. The former is limited, while the latter can be unlimited because China itself should strive for "self-reliance," while the "goodwill assistance" of friendly countries is also welcomed by us. Tseng also asked Chow to pay attention to the "urgency" and "time-sensitivity" of aid to China. Chow is a medical practitioner. Tseng also used the analogy of "delaying medical treatment," saying that if a curable disease is not treated in time, there will inevitably be regret. Chow expressed his agreement. The two met for about 30 minutes.

### The United States Should Replenish the Domestic Market to Support the Strength of Allied Nations. Chow Yih-deh Discusses US Foreign Policy

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Chow Yih-deh, a member of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, returned to the capital with Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 3rd and immediately held a reception for reporters at the Ambassador's residence at 11:00 AM. Chow first spoke extensively on US policy toward China, saying that he did not know what the US government was currently considering, but his personal opinion was that more assistance should be given. He did not understand the reason why the government had to keep General Wedemeyer's report confidential. Some parts of the report may be confidential and only for government reference, but there is no reason for the recommendations to be kept secret. He believes that this action by the White House prevents the American people from knowing what they are doing. If they are afraid that publishing Wedemeyer's recommendations will affect Congress's consideration of Secretary of State Marshall's plan for European aid, then this decision is a harmful mistake. The Marshall Plan will provide US$20 billion in aid to Europe, while there is no aid for the Far East, which is unfair and inevitably biased. In the Far East, Japan has lost its ability to defend itself, and South Korea is in adversity. If China cannot be a strong ally of the United States in the East, the United States will continue to expend its strength in Japan and South Korea without achieving a stable situation. Therefore, the US policy toward China should be determined, announced, and implemented as soon as possible. As for whether the recent rise in prices in the United States will delay its foreign aid, he acknowledged that it is very important. He said that certain countries (especially the Soviet Union) are spreading rumors that the United States is about to encounter an economic crisis, but they still hope to obtain loans or other assistance from the United States. If the United States helps other countries, it must risk the danger of economic recession and high prices, but if it does not help other countries, many independent countries will gradually collapse due to economic crisis. The United States must choose a proper path, on the one hand, increasing production to replenish the domestic market, and on the other hand, providing assistance to support the independence of friendly countries. This will be a matter for Congress to consider carefully. (Continued on page 2, column 1)

### Yu Pin Speaks in the United States, Says That There Is No Civil War in China, But Rather a Resistance Against International Communist Groups

[This Newspaper News] New York, 3rd Broadcast: Philadelphia News, Bishop Yu Pin gave a speech to the clergy here on the 3rd, saying: The war in China is not a civil war, but a war against international communist groups. Currently, the Chinese army is fighting one million communists in northern China, among whom are Koreans, Japanese, and Soviets. He also said that China's urgent task is to make the United States understand that China is not fighting a civil war, but fighting communism, and is becoming a new victim of aggression.

### Regulations on Penalties for Gold and Currency Trading; Ministry of Finance and Relevant Parties Discuss Revisions

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Regulations on Penalties for Gold and Currency Trading have been in effect for more than half a year since they were promulgated and implemented in April of this year. There are many areas that need to be revised. The Ministry of Finance and relevant parties are currently discussing them. It is heard that the main areas that need to be revised include the following: 1. Objects of punishment: According to Articles 1 and 2 of the original regulations, only firms that buy and sell gold and currency without government permission are subject to punishment. The Ministry of Finance believes that the scope is too narrow and proposes to include underground banks. 2. Article 3 of the original regulations stipulates that the gold and currency held by the perpetrator shall be confiscated. The Ministry of Finance believes that the gold and currency transaction is the act of both the buyer and the seller, and both parties should be punished equally. Punishing only one party is unfair. 3. Article 7 of the original regulations stipulates that there should be restrictions on bringing foreign currency into the country. The Ministry of Finance believes that the amount of foreign currency brought into the country should not exceed US$100. The legislative side believes that US$100 is too little. As for overseas Chinese passing through the country, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that the amount exceeding US$100 can be deposited in customs and retrieved within 30 to 40 days with a certificate.

### Sino-Dutch Air Transport Agreement; Both Countries Can Approve

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Sino-Dutch Air Transport Agreement can be approved by the governments of both countries. This agreement was finalized in early July of this year. At that time, the Dutch side suggested using Hong Kong as an intermediate station, which our side did not agree to. It is heard that the main navigation area in the future will be the Dutch East Indies first, because there are many overseas Chinese there, and our relationship with them is also deep. After the agreement is signed, Batavia, Surabaya, and China routes will be opened first.

### Ryukyu Islands Should Be Returned to Our Country; The Philippines Actually Expresses Opposition and Asks Taiwan to "Self-Determine" Its Future

[Associated Press, Manila, 3rd] The Manila Bulletin reported on the 3rd that the Philippines will oppose any movement to return the Ryukyu Islands to China. A Philippine Foreign Ministry official said that the country's representative will oppose this proposal at the peace conference with Japan and submit the matter to the United Nations. It is said that the Philippine government opposes this proposal because if the Ryukyu Islands are placed under the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the Philippines' position may be in danger. The Philippines will demand that the Ryukyu Islands be placed under trusteeship and will demand that the political status of Taiwan be "self-determined." Another official said that the United States may not be willing to give up control of the Ryukyu Islands.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 3rd] Regarding the Philippine opposition to our country's demand to recover the Ryukyu Islands, as reported in the Manila Bulletin, Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino and Vice Foreign Minister Africa did not express any opinions this morning. Other officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Palace said that they "had never heard of this matter" and therefore could not confirm or deny it. However, according to reporters from other sources, the Philippine government does have the intention to oppose it, and long before President Zhang Qun announced to the Standing Committee of the National Political Council that China would demand the recovery of the Ryukyu Islands, a certain official of the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already drafted a plan for the Philippines to express its opposition to this. Observers here are surprised by the Philippine side's attitude, because it is still unknown whether the Philippines will be invited to attend the peace conference with Japan.

(Note: The return of Taiwan to our country has been agreed to by the four major powers and has become an established fact. The Philippine side's sudden proposal is incomprehensible. As for the Ryukyu Islands, it is a historical, geographical, and cultural necessity that they should be returned to our country. The Philippine side's opinion can be said to be lacking a thorough understanding of the facts.)

### US Officials in Tokyo Say That They Should Be Managed by US Officials

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] High-ranking US military officers here today responded to reporters' questions regarding the opinions of China and the Philippines demanding to take over the Ryukyu Islands, saying that the Ryukyu Islands currently occupy a major position in Pacific defense and "should continue to be managed by the United States." They believe that the United States has already "lost" Korea, and the expansion of Soviet power on the Asian continent is difficult to avoid. The importance of the Ryukyu Islands has therefore increased and must be used as an advanced air force base to protect the US position in the Pacific and, in conjunction with bases in Guam and the Aleutian Islands, to prevent any offensives from the mainland to the Pacific. As for maintaining a large army in Japan, it will be useless.

### Suggestions for Amending the Postal Law; Two Committees of the Legislative Yuan Will Discuss

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Regarding the increase in postal rates, because postal rates are stipulated by the Postal Law, each adjustment requires amending the law, which is very inconvenient. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications recently submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to propose amending the Postal Law, deleting the postal rate table attached to Article 4 of the law, and adding a clause "The postal rates for each item mentioned above and the types and postal rates for items other than the aforementioned shall be drafted by the Ministry of Communications and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval." This case has been passed by the Executive Yuan and recently sent to the Legislative Yuan for preliminary review. Most people believe that there is no need to make this amendment.

### Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Initial Stage of Recovery Faces Severe Tests; Lack of Coal, Food, and Funds Are the Three Current Difficulties

[This newspaper, Pan Yang, 3rd] The Anshan Iron and Steel Works, which began its initial stage of recovery in August, has once again fallen into a quagmire of difficulties after only three months. The development of heavy industry in the Northeast is facing a severe test. The three major problems currently are lack of coal, food, and funds. This month, the minimum coal requirement is 41,000 tons, but the Materials Adjustment Committee only allocated 11,000 tons. The monthly food requirement is 150 tons. 300 tons of rice were purchased from Shanghai and transported to Huludao, but due to the railway being cut off, it cannot be transported to Anshan. Due to the lack of funds, employee salaries also cannot be paid on time. The General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Works, Bu Yiti, has arrived in Pan. He is running around everywhere. If the coal problem cannot be solved, the factory will be forced to shut down. There is currently no coal in the factory. The difficulties with food and funds will affect normal production. The difficulties of Anshan Iron and Steel are worthy of attention. People cannot bear to see the recovery become desolate and bleak again.

### Mr. Zhou Yide's Talk

[Continued from Page 1] He believes that Congress will definitely approve a comprehensive and consistent foreign policy towards all countries, and will not hesitate to provide assistance, because assisting other countries is also assisting the United States. Mr. Zhou believes that the US Congress will not approve a supervisory policy for foreign aid, but may agree to implement assistance through advisors and observers, and ensure that the benefits of assistance fully benefit the people of the aided country. He declined to comment on the differences between Marshall and Wedemeyer's views on China and the suggestions of some people that China should receive aid only after reforms, as well as the innovations of the current government. He only pointed out that, in any case, the current US policy towards China is unsuccessful. Regarding the government's declaration that the Democratic League is illegal, he initially stated that as an outsider, he should not express opinions on this internal affair of China, but then hesitated slightly and said: "What I can say is that the government should present evidence on this matter and go through legal procedures to clarify it and make it public, so as to avoid assisting anti-government propaganda." Later, Mr. Zhou explained his views on the Chinese Communist Party, stating that since June, he has traveled around the world and personally witnessed that there is no democracy or freedom in Eastern European countries under the Soviet system. The CCP has never declared that it will abandon its attempt to Sovietize China, and its actions of destroying transportation and the economy directly harm the people. He opposes the Soviet-style dictatorship of the proletariat, so he also opposes the CCP. Mr. Zhou also pointed out that the National Government has confidence in democracy, saying that during the period of stability from 1931 to 1937, it fully demonstrated its determination to implement democratic politics and achieved considerable results. The Three Principles of the People can be expected to benefit China and the world. Mr. Zhou finally praised Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: "Regardless of how maliciously criticized by some Chinese and foreigners, Chiang Kai-shek is absolutely loyal to China." He believes that the stability and peace of the Far East depend on the efforts of a strong China under the leadership of Chairman Chiang.

[Continued from Page 1] According to reports, the State Council rejected the association’s proposal, stating that it had no legal basis. The association argued that the government was just paying lip service and did not address practical matters. The association could also publicly announce certain illegal facts in the constitutional process. For example, the original regulations on constitutional laws and regulations stipulated that they should be promulgated within three months after the promulgation of the Constitution. However, in fact, the National Assembly Election and Recall Law was only promulgated on May 1st, and calculated from May 1st, the election should be completed within six months, that is, before the end of October. However, on September 8th, the State Council decided to postpone it for another month, so the deadline for handling the election has reached seven months. This is an illegal act by the government. The government has no right to change the preparatory procedures for implementing the Constitution, and the government's reason for postponing the election is "the three parties failed to reach an agreement on nominations." Now, the majority of areas across the country cannot hold elections. Why was the request for postponement rejected? At that time, some people proposed that the government's unconstitutional facts could be announced. After heated discussion, the text of the telegram was submitted to a small group for review. The main points of the case are as follows: The association's previous suggestion to the National Government by 688 people was based on nine major reasons, and did not quote the words "a request for convening by more than two-fifths of the number of people" listed in Article 30, Paragraph 4 of the Constitution. However, the State Council did not respond to the nine major reasons, and was rejected abruptly, which is regrettable. According to Article 9 of the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, the National Assembly representatives who formulated the Constitution are responsible for promoting the implementation of the Constitution. Regarding the preparatory procedures for constitutional government, the government's various measures, such as the regulations on the election of pacification zones and overseas Chinese, lack a legal basis. The National Assembly representatives, based on their mission, have the right to request the convening of the National Assembly to review them.

### Central Election Committee Passes Opening and Counting Methods

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Central Election Committee recently issued instructions to election offices at all levels on the opening and counting methods for various elections. The voting for various elections, the National Assembly, and the Legislative Yuan are stipulated in the provisional regulations of the Election and Recall Law, and should be completed within three days. In areas with a large number of voters, difficulties are inevitable, especially with opening and counting. At a time when transportation is inconvenient, it is not easy to transport ballots. Centralized opening poses many difficulties. In addition, it is stipulated that the list of elected candidates should be announced within ten days. Therefore, under these circumstances, the competent election authority can consider the situation and open the ballots separately, and order all elected candidates' vote counts to be listed first in remote areas and notified by telegram, and then send the ballots and the documents that should be reported by mail. When opening the ballots, a classification method can be used. After opening the ballot boxes in public, call out the names one by one. Place the votes of each candidate for each type of election in one place, and divide them into several places. After calling out all the names, organize and check the votes of each elected candidate, and bundle them separately, indicating the name and number of votes. This method was approved by the Central Election Committee.

### The Complete List of Kuomintang National Assembly Candidates Will Soon Be Finalized

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the Central Election Guidance Committee continued to hold a joint meeting on the 3rd to review the list of National Assembly candidates in various provinces and cities. It is reported that except for Xinjiang and some pacification zones and national professional groups, the lists of various provinces and cities have been reviewed and finalized. The list of candidates for national professional groups will continue to be reviewed in the coming days, and the entire list will soon be officially submitted to the General Election Office.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Regarding the election of Legislative Yuan members from national professional groups, the provincial and municipal election offices are legally the competent authorities, and the national election office is the higher authority. Except for municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, which still apply the original regulations, the provincial election offices cannot directly handle matters such as voter registration. The Central Election Office has presented a report to the National Government for recordation, allowing the offices to entrust county and municipal election offices to handle them.

### The Yongli Nitric Acid Plant Is Returned to Our Country

(Continued from Page 1) The factory was originally located in Jiangsu Province. In March 1942, it was plundered by the Japanese. It is hoped that the factory can be transported back to Shanghai in early spring next year by the Yongyuan, a Chinese steamship stolen by the Japanese in 1943. Our side began negotiating with the Allied Headquarters for the return of the factory last spring. According to the report of the Chinese experts sent by the Yongli Chemical Company to inspect the current situation of the plundered factory, part of the original equipment has been damaged or modified. New equipment was added during the war to maintain the factory's production. Many technical difficulties were encountered during the negotiations, that is, whether the entire factory (including the new equipment added in Japan after the plunder) should be returned to China, or only the original equipment that had decayed due to the passage of time. The Chinese representatives believed that the factory was in good production condition when it was robbed, and that returning only the old and broken original equipment would not benefit China at all. In order to respect the opinions of the Chinese representatives, it has now been decided to return the entire factory. The entire factory is worth a total of US$500,000, and its daily production is 10 tons of nitric acid.

### A Batch of Overseas Chinese Arriving in Singapore Is Detained at a Quarantine Station; Fasting Is Implemented, and They Only Stop After Persuasion

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 3rd] It is reported that on the 30th of last month, a batch of 704 overseas Chinese arrived here in the steerage of the Yi Wassi-Fer quoted steamship.

### Kawashima Yoshiko Sighs and Awaits Death; Adoptive Father Still Hopes She Will Return to Japan Innocent

### A Twelve-Year-Old Mystery; The Main Culprit, Wang Huayi, Is Arrested; The Beiping Box Corpse Case

[This newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] Wang Huayi (now using the alias Wang Zongyao), the main culprit in the sensational Beiping East Railway Station Box Corpse Case twelve years ago, was arrested a few days ago at No. 40, Dongsi 7th Alley, for drug use. It can be said that the net of heaven is wide, and no one can escape it. According to reports, in early 1936, a passenger at the Beiping East Railway Station entrusted the shipment of two blue and purple lacquered iron boxes to Pan Yang. When they were weighed, they were too heavy and had to be opened for inspection. The passenger said he would go home to get the key, but never returned. This aroused the suspicion of the railway station. When the boxes were opened, they contained the corpse of a man, dismembered into eight pieces and packed into the two boxes. After investigation by the military police, the accomplice Li Liangjing was arrested, and it was learned that the main culprit in the case was Wang Huayi. Wang was from Suning, Hebei. He once served as the director of the military affairs office in Sui Province. He resigned in 1930 and came to Beiping to live as a gentleman. Although Wang had many wives and concubines, he still had an affair with Liu Wang, the wet nurse of his second son (also known as Liu Ma). One time, his male servant Zhang Shulin saw them. Liu Ma was afraid that Zhang would spread the word outside, so she also had an affair with Zhang Shulin. After the Liu Ma triangle affair occurred, the resentment between Wang and Zhang deepened. Later, Wang received several anonymous letters, which he suspected were written by Zhang Shulin. He then bribed the cook Li Liangjing and his brother-in-law Xi Cangyou to conspire to kill Zhang. At 8:00 PM on January 27, Wang sent Zhang to Li's place, telling him to come to the house because he had something to do. Li entered the courtyard, and when Zhang stepped onto the stairs, he fired a shot at his neck. Zhang was immediately shot down. Li then used a rope to strangle him to death. The next day, Li and Xi dismembered Zhang into eight pieces and packed them into two newly purchased purple and blue lacquered iron boxes. Four days later, they sent them to the Qianmen Railway Station. When the railway station asked for the key to inspect the boxes, Li, Xi, and Wang made excuses to get the key and fled. Later, Li Liangjing was arrested, and Wang Huayi fled to Nanjing. In November of that year, he went to Gansu and served as a counselor in the Sui Provincial Government Office. After the war broke out in 1937, he went to Jiaodong and served as the commander of the security forces. In 1940, he served as the captain of the first detachment of the 56th Army in western Henan. In 1943, he was captured by the Japanese army in Bian. After the victory, he was released. Last year, he served as the section chief of the Fourth Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. In September of this year, he was transferred to the Northeast Headquarters. When he passed through Beiping, he lived in Dongsi 7th Alley. Unexpectedly, he was arrested for drug use. After strict interrogation, it was learned that this Wang Zongyao was Wang Huayi, the main culprit in the Box Corpse Case of yesteryear. After the investigation of the Criminal Investigation Corps was completed, Wang was handed over to the police station this morning for legal proceedings.

Editorial: The Resurgence of the British Conservative Party

Following the municipal elections in France, the national municipal elections in Britain were held a few days ago. According to reports, in the 385 of 392 municipal districts where election results are known, the Conservative Party won 631 seats, while the Labour Party lost 683 seats. Although this is not the final result of the British national municipal elections, the information already obtained makes it easy to see that the Conservative Party has achieved a decisive victory and has resurfaced. Although the British elections were municipal elections, they are sufficient to show that the British people have mostly turned to the Conservative Party. This is undoubtedly an important turning point for the future development of British politics and should be closely watched.

According to Labour Party Secretary-General Phillips, "Although the results of this election are disappointing, they are only a temporary setback." Conservative Party leader Churchill, however, believes that this is a manifestation of the national hatred for the Labour government, which is no longer supported by the people. Therefore, he called for a general election to determine the fate of the Labour government. These are all remarks made based on the interests of their respective parties. Standing in an objective position, we can see several points that should be noted in the results of the British municipal elections:

First, the Labour Party's defeat was unavoidable even in Birmingham, Manchester, and other industrial areas that have always been regarded as important strongholds of the Labour Party. Second, in the thirty-one cities controlled by the Labour Party, it has now failed and been replaced by the Conservative Party. Third, the number of voters in the British municipal elections was extremely enthusiastic, reportedly reaching 80 percent of the total number of voters. Fourth, the banner under which the British municipal elections were fought was not local, but national, that is, a challenge to the Attlee government; and the result was a disastrous defeat for the Labour government. These four points show that the British people have turned to the right, inclining towards the Conservative Party. This is just like the results of the French municipal elections, where the people are increasingly turning to the right. Regarding this trend, we believe that the following explanations can be offered: This is the most obvious and direct response to the revival of the communist international, which attempts to sweep across the entire Europe. The French people have clearly expressed their intentions to be incompatible with the Communist International in their municipal elections; coupled with the results of the British municipal elections, it further demonstrates the consistency of the will of the people in Western European democratic countries. This is a sign that the British people are tired of the Labour government. In the two years after the victory of the war, under the rule of the Labour Party, the lives of the British people were not only more difficult than during the war; but also because the Labour government emphasized nationalization policies and planned economies, the British people inevitably felt worried about the future of their nation. Although the Labour Party has adopted only moderate socialism, and there is not much obvious difference from the Conservative Party in foreign policy, the relationship with the United States is no longer as harmonious as it was when the Conservative Party was in power. And Britain lacks US dollars, and it must have a closer relationship with the United States. With these points, it does not seem unexpected that the British people have turned to the Conservative Party.

Although the ruling Labour Party suffered a disastrous defeat in the British municipal elections, it seems unlikely that it will immediately shake or even overturn the Labour government. However, the failure of the municipal elections has made the Labour government increasingly difficult. Although the Labour Party still holds an absolute majority in the British Parliament; even before the results of the municipal elections were announced, in the debate on gasoline rationing, under the roar of the lion of Conservative Party leader Churchill, the Attlee government only maintained its position with a majority of twenty-four votes. It can be seen that the Labour government's position in Parliament is becoming increasingly difficult. As a result of the municipal elections, the Attlee government will face a "serious crisis" in Parliament, which is inevitable.

But what we want to point out here is that the British Labour Party and Conservative Party are not essentially different. Although the Labour Party advocates moderate socialism, the Conservative Party also advocates planned economy. The Conservative Party is not conservative, and the Labour Party is not revolutionary. It is just that the Labour Party calls itself moderate socialists, and the Conservative Party's socio-economic policies are slightly more moderate than the Labour Party's. There is also no difference in foreign policy. Under the Labour government, we have not yet seen the return of Hong Kong. Therefore, the Labour Party and the Conservative Party seem to be no different in essence. However, the results of the British municipal elections make it even clearer that the British people are turning to the right, and even moderate socialism has failed. Following the French municipal elections, this is undoubtedly a concrete manifestation of the consistent will of the people in Western Europe and the best response to the Communist International.

War Creates Joys and Sorrows! Stories of Overseas Chinese (Part 1) Ninth Letter from Poland. Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of This Newspaper

It was a clear summer morning. A cool breeze was blowing across the Vistula River. On my way back to the "Bristol" Hotel from the post office, I ran into three Chinese merchants with "yellow faces" by the river. From that day on, overseas Chinese living in Poland came to visit me at the "Bristol" Hotel one after another, and I heard many stories about the overseas Chinese in Poland. If we do not include women and family members who have already acquired Chinese nationality, there are only forty-seven overseas Chinese in the entire territory of Poland now. It is said that there were more people last year than this year, and more the year before than last year. The war is over, and the overseas Chinese are eager to go home, but some have gone to France, and because they ran out of travel expenses and the boat tickets are too expensive, they returned to Poland again.

Like in other countries in continental Europe, most of the overseas Chinese are from Qingtian, Zhejiang Province, the hometown of General Chen Cixiu. The people of Qingtian are "destined" for Europe. You can see the simple, frugal, diligent, and hardworking people of Qingtian everywhere you go. In 1945, near the Gare de Lyon in Paris, I asked them if they had heard the name of "General Chen Cheng." Many people shook their heads blankly, but this time in Warsaw, they all raised their thumbs and talked about Chen Cheng with every sentence. Several people insisted that they were classmates of General Chen when they were in elementary school.

I don't know if what they said is true or false. Anyway, these people have come to Poland from Qingtian, tens of thousands of miles away, and they all have their extraordinary "tricks." The Cantonese go overseas to America with "a shoulder of luggage," the people of Qingtian go overseas to Europe with "a shoulder of pebbles" (Qingtian gems). They travel from the three northeastern provinces through Siberia to Europe. The language is not understood, the customs are not understood, and the courage of Pangu, who created the world, is impossible to imagine. Zhan Zhiyuan, a leather merchant in Warsaw, told me that a member of their family has lived in Europe for generations. His father returned to China in his old age, earning several thousand US dollars and building houses and buying properties in his hometown. Then, after graduating from junior high school, he inherited his father's business and went overseas to Poland. Another factory owner, Zhuo Jinlan, has spent his entire life wandering. He wandered from Qingtian to Japan, can speak Japanese, and has also been to "Manzhouli" (meaning the Northeast), where he learned to speak "Mandarin." Later, he sneaked into Siberia and stayed in Moscow for many years, so he also learned to speak Russian. Zhuo Jinlan speaks Polish quite well now, but he says that he can only listen and speak, but cannot write. He can read the newspaper roughly, because phonetic text can be read with meaning if you just follow the pronunciation. He said: Many of the overseas Chinese who now live in Poland came from Moscow. "Since the Communist Party revolution in Russia, the overseas Chinese have no way to survive, so they fled to Poland one after another." However, he said very sadly: "Poland has now become the world of the Communist Party again"? Another long-faced overseas Chinese interjected: "Some people in China are actually doing communism now, which is really stupid to the extreme." He said: "Let them come here to have a look, the world of Communist robbers!" Afterwards, I realized the source of the overseas Chinese's complaints. It is said that the police of the Polish government have searched the homes of overseas Chinese many times. Are there any "smuggled goods" on which taxes have not been paid? Are there any other items that violate regulations? Therefore, the overseas Chinese are all worried, fearing that their years of hard-earned money will be lost due to internal strife. I asked them if Moscow was like this? An overseas Chinese told me: After the success of the Communist Revolution in Moscow, almost all the legitimate overseas Chinese merchants withdrew from Russia, with the exception of those who had relations with the Communist Party. They still live in Moscow today. The years after the Nazis occupied Poland in 1939 were dark days for the overseas Chinese. They were arrested and forced to work in concentration camps, working more than ten hours a day. It is said that German officers were quite fond of "Chinese workers" because they were "obedient" and never lazy. In early 1945, when Germany was defeated from Poland, Nazi officers told them: "Follow our army back to Berlin, otherwise, if the Russians invade, you will all be shot!" Many people wandered to Germany like this, and many people deserted when the Nazis retreated and are still living in Poland. August 1944 was the most tragic season in Warsaw. In July of that year, the Russian army swept across Lublin and approached Warsaw. The Polish government in exile in London, without obtaining the consent of the Polish government established in Moscow, launched an uprising in the capital on August 1. The original intention was to cooperate with the Russian army outside the city to restore Poland, but unexpectedly, the Russian army remained motionless, which caused the Nazis to massacre in Warsaw. The Polish people call this uprising the "AK Party Revolution." The AK Party Revolution destroyed all the buildings in Warsaw, destroyed hundreds of thousands of Polish lives, and implicated our innocent overseas Chinese. Two Qingtian merchants, Yin Caichi and Xu Xiangui, left China in 1929, "walking and walking again," and arrived in Poland in 1932. They did business in Poland and had a small savings. They originally planned to return to China in the winter of 1939, but unexpectedly, the Second European War broke out that year, and Poland was the first to suffer. They were tied up in concentration camps for several years.

Before the outbreak of the AK Party Revolution, Yin and Xu, as well as Yin Caichi's uncle Yin Zuoyu, moved to No. 59 Shehukalu in Yeisha City. An hour before the outbreak of the revolution, Yin Zuoyu went out shopping. As soon as the gunfire rang out, traffic in the city was cut off, and Yin Zuoyu could not return to his home. "A murder occurred out of thin air during this period."

### Kashmir Situation Tense; Civil War in India Like a Raging Fire; Threatens to Engulf the State of Hyderabad; Governor-General of Pakistan Orders the Organization of Volunteer National Guard

[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd] The civil war in Kashmir and Jammu & Kashmir appears to threaten to engulf Hyderabad, India's largest princely state. Although the King of Hyderabad declared on August 15, the day India declared its independence, that the state did not intend to join India or Pakistan, internal unrest is brewing in this richest, most populous, and largest princely state. Muslims have been causing trouble from time to time in the past four days, fearing that the King of Hyderabad will announce the annexation of the Indian Dominion. If the unrest in Hyderabad cannot be contained, it will inevitably cause an explosive situation in the Indian princely states, plunging the entire Indian peninsula into terror. Negotiations between Hyderabad and the Indian Dominion continued today in New Delhi, but no communiqué was issued after the meeting.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd] In the state of Junagadh on the Kathiawar Peninsula on the west coast of the Indian Peninsula, after the King of that state announced the annexation of the state to Pakistan, the Hindus of that state declared the establishment of a provisional government and organized a revolutionary army to advance on the capital. According to a telegram from Rajkot, on the border of Junagadh, the revolutionary army has occupied 25 villages in and around Dhrol, only ten miles from the capital, and is about to approach the capital.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Indian-Muslim clashes occurred again in two cities in Hyderabad today. Six houses and a stack of firewood were set on fire, and several people were injured.

[Reuters, Karachi, 2nd] Amid the deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan, Governor-General of Pakistan Jinnah suddenly issued an order today allowing the organization of a National Guard to supplement Pakistan's regular army. The members of the National Guard are based on the principle of voluntary service and are subject to the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army. This order takes effect immediately and applies to all territories of Pakistan.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 2nd] Khunam, a prominent leader of the Palestinian Arabs, traveled from Lahore to Kashmir at the end of last month to participate in the holy war to liberate his Muslim brothers. (Note: Mr. Khunam participated in the Iraqi revolution during World War II. After the failure of the revolution, he fled to Turkey and was captured by the British army and imprisoned in the Northwest Frontier Province of India.) This time, he went to Kashmir at the invitation of Ibrahim, the leader of the provisional independent government of Kashmir, to organize an international corps.

### Nehru Asks Pakistan to Stop Armed Aggression Quickly; Advocates that the Fate of Kashmir be Determined by the People

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Indian Dominion Prime Minister Nehru broadcast to the nation on the situation in Kashmir, stating that after peace and order are restored, India is prepared to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir under the supervision of international organizations such as the United Nations. Nehru then explained in detail the various events that led to the current situation in Kashmir, saying, "We have repeatedly asked the Pakistani government to stop the invasion of armed forces and withdraw those who have already invaded. Because there are very few roads into Kashmir, and many bridges, it should not be difficult to stop them. As soon as the danger of invasion has passed, the Indian government has no intention of using troops in Kashmir again."

Nehru continued, "We have consistently condemned any misconduct in the past, whether it was committed by Muslims, Hindus, or Sikhs. Therefore, if Hindu, Sikh, or Kashmiri officials have behaved improperly in Jammu Province, they should be condemned. However, the reports we have received detail that 95 villages in the province have been destroyed by invaders from Pakistan, and many towns have been robbed and destroyed. Most of the Poonch district of Kashmir has been occupied by the invaders. Does this not indicate that the Northwest Frontier Province and West Punjab are launching an organized act of aggression against Kashmir? The invading troops are well-equipped and well-led, and they are all from Pakistan. We have the right to question Pakistan, how did these people get into Pakistan to invade, and how were they able to transport these weapons? Is this not an act in violation of international law, or an unfriendly act towards a neighboring country?"

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] An Indian Army communiqué stated: The troops invading Kashmir from Pakistan have been stopped at the Pandan Mountains, twenty miles west of Srinagar. The Royal Indian Air Force is conducting offensive reconnaissance operations in the area. At the same time, according to Srinagar, since Abdullah took office as the head of the transitional government of Kashmir, an action has been launched in Srinagar to purge the fifth column, and several suspects have been arrested.

### New Communist International; US Communist Party Does Not Plan to Participate

[United Press, New York, 2nd] US Communist Chairman Foster and Secretary-General Dennis issued a statement saying that the US Communist Party is willing to support the Information Bureau established by the Communist Parties of nine European countries, but has decided not to participate in the Bureau, because once the US Communist Party participates, it will inevitably invite new "oppression." The so-called "oppression" refers to President Truman's "loyalty order" and the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation of communist activities.

### Soviet Union Celebrates October Revolution; Issues Forty Slogans

[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd] The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party has recently announced forty slogans to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union, mostly urging the people to defend the motherland. All Soviet newspapers published the slogans in prominent positions on the front page. Some of the slogans instruct soldiers of the army and navy to improve their political knowledge, or order them to use the experience gained during the war to build the country's military strength. One of the slogans calls on workers in all countries to expose the masks of warmongers. As for laborers, especially workers in the coal, iron, railway, military, and chemical industries, they are urged to work hard to step up production and build the strength of the Soviet state. The Soviet government has stipulated November 7, 8, and 9 as holidays to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution, at which time the aforementioned forty slogans will be posted on all buildings across the country.

### Total Amount of US Foreign Aid Funds; Vandenberg Demands Disclosure; Harriman Advocates Extending Export Control Measures

[United Press, Michigan, 3rd] Senate Chairman and Foreign Affairs Committee Director Vandenberg gave a speech at the University of Michigan on the 3rd, stating that Truman should propose the "total amount" of foreign aid, including China, in the upcoming special Congress. The United States must not provide unlimited assistance to foreign countries. It is believed that this indicates that the Foreign Affairs Committee will insist on making the Wedemeyer Report public. Most of Vandenberg's speech referred to the Soviet Union's policy in the United Nations. He said that if the United Nations cannot guarantee peace, then it must clearly designate who should be held responsible, and the Soviet Union is clearly paralyzing the work of the Security Council with its veto power. He also strongly condemned Vyshinsky's absurdity in accusing the United States of being a warmonger. He called on the United States to continue its efforts to strengthen the United Nations while doing its best to maintain the US national defense. He said: "Most of us" believe that the Soviet Union's policy is "incompatible with peace." Vandenberg concluded by saying: Britain, the United States, and France will do their best to seek the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany at the upcoming foreign ministers' conference. If the Soviet Union continues to oppose, the Western allies will sign a separate peace treaty with their occupied zones.

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of Commerce Harriman suggested to President Truman tonight that the export control measures, which were originally scheduled to expire at the end of February next year, should be extended immediately in consideration of protecting the domestic economy and supporting foreign policy. It is said that export control can enable the United States to transport necessities to the most urgent countries, so that they can be used most effectively and accelerate the economic recovery of the world. Moreover, for the sake of promoting the Marshall Plan for European Recovery, export control is also necessary.

### UN General Assembly May Put Aside Veto Power Issue of Five Great Powers; Soviet Union Rejects US Proposal on Holy Land Issue

[Report from This Newspaper] New York Broadcasting on the 3rd: Lake Success News, today the Soviet Union rejected the US proposal on the partition of the Holy Land, but insisted that Britain should abandon its mandate over the Holy Land in January next year and withdraw all its troops by May next year at the latest.

[United Press, New York, 2nd] Reliable sources said today: The current session of the United Nations General Assembly will put aside the veto power issue of the five great powers and will not discuss it in order to declare a recess on the 25th of this month. Assembly President Aranha of Brazil has asked the fourteen-nation steering committee to meet tomorrow to discuss how to end the current session.

The General Assembly has only voted on one major issue in the seven weeks since the meeting opened. The proposal by US Secretary of State Marshall to establish a permanent "small assembly" and the issue of Korean independence are still being discussed in the political committee or its subgroups. It is learned that Tea (India) intends to suggest to the steering committee that the veto power issue and several other secondary issues be left to be raised after the end of the current session of the General Assembly or at the autumn meeting next year. If a "small assembly" is established, the veto power issue can be submitted for discussion.

[United Press, New York, 3rd] The United Nations General Assembly has entered its eighth week today. The two important cases proposed by US Secretary of State Marshall, the establishment of a "small assembly" and the granting of Korean independence, are about to end their debates and are expected to be put to a vote at the end of this week.

### India to Propose Amendments to Korean Issue

[United Press, New York, 2nd] It is reported that the Indian delegation will propose to the UN Political Committee that the elections in Korea should be held before February 15 under the supervision of a United Nations delegation with direct supervisory power. According to the US proposal, it should be before March 31, and the United Nations delegation is only of an advisory nature. India will suggest that all election details be handled by the US and Soviet occupying authorities under the guidance of the United Nations delegation. India will also suggest that the US and Soviet occupation forces should withdraw within ninety days after the establishment of the Korean government. Sources familiar with the matter say that the United States is unlikely to oppose India's suggestion that the United Nations Supervisory Committee have direct control over the elections, but it is unlikely to agree with the limited time for the withdrawal of the occupying forces. The United States believes that the establishment of Korean security forces should be required, and no precise date can be predetermined.

### Former Brazilian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns Home via Northern Europe

[Reuters, Moscow, March 3] Former Brazilian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Montele, along with four members of the embassy staff, boarded a plane today from Moscow to Helsinki, and then to Stockholm, en route to return home.

### Conservative Party Wins City Elections; British Cabinet Unmoved, Resolved to Continue Socialization Policies

[United Press, London, March 3] Despite the Conservative Party's overwhelming victory in the British city council elections, Prime Minister Attlee convened a cabinet meeting on the 3rd to discuss strengthening Britain's socialization program. A senior government official stated that regardless of whether a general election is held before 1950, the government will continue to nationalize gas, steel, and other industries. A veto from the House of Lords would only delay the process by a year. It is believed that the British Cabinet will not give much weight to the city council election defeats, as they will not directly affect Parliament or the government. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Conservative Party headquarters stated that the Conservatives may not formally demand the dissolution of the House of Commons and a special election, but Members of Parliament such as Churchill will likely raise this demand in Parliament. Currently, the Conservative Party and other anti-socialization parties have regained 42% of the 1,544 seats lost in the 1945 and 1946 city council elections. If this proportion is maintained in the next general election, the Conservative Party could recover 71 of the 170 seats lost in Parliament in 1945, but the Labour Party would still hold a majority. Authoritative sources state that although senior officials such as Attlee expected setbacks in these city council elections, the extent of the defeat was beyond expectations.

### Churchill Elated

[Reuters, London, March 3] Churchill, in a statement on the 2nd, declared that the victory of the Conservative Party and liberal-minded men and women over the incompetent and misguided forces that have led the country down a path of ruin is the best thing that has happened in Britain since the tragic election of 1945. The results of the city elections have deprived the Labour government of the mandate it obtained in the general election, and it will henceforth govern without moral support and in defiance of the will of the people.

### Gold from Britain and France Continues to Flow to the United States

### Reviewing "The Tumultuous Decade"; Marshall Calls for Cooperation, Otherwise Constant Readiness for Action is Essential

[Central News Agency, New York, March 3] In "The Tumultuous Decade" (from 1937 to 1946) written for the Encyclopedia Britannica, US Secretary of State Marshall implied that if another war were to occur, "destructive and decisive blows might be struck in the initial actions, leaving the defending nation no time to mobilize." He concluded that the nations of the world have only two choices: one is to "constantly maintain their highly prepared industries and armed forces"; the other is to develop some form of international mechanism to mutually guarantee against aggression.

### Total Number of Soldiers Killed in Action in World War II Reaches Fifteen Million

[United Press, Chicago, March 3] Former US Chief of Staff General Marshall wrote a report for the Encyclopedia Britannica stating that a total of 57 countries participated in World War II, with a total of 15 million soldiers killed or missing, with the Soviet Union having the highest number of deaths. Marshall listed the number of soldiers killed or missing from each country as follows: United States: 295,904; United Kingdom: 305,770; British Commonwealth: 452,570; Soviet Union: 7,500,000; France: 200,000; Germany: 2,850,000; Italy: 300,000; China: 2,200,000; Japan: 1,506,000 (starting from 1937). Marshall also stated that small countries, especially Poland and Southeast European countries, suffered losses of hundreds of thousands of people. The total cost of World War II may never be revealed, and all data "are only partial and inadequate calculations." For example, the number of civilian deaths and injuries is fundamentally difficult to calculate.

### Koishiso's Testimony Implicates Miao Bin

[United Press, Tokyo, March 3] Former Japanese Prime Minister Koiso Kuniaki testified in the International Military Tribunal on the 3rd that he had suggested to the Soviet Union in early 1945 that Japan send a special envoy to Moscow to discuss preparations for peace with Britain and the United States, but this was repeatedly rejected by the Soviet Union. Koiso also stated that in February 1945, Miao Bin, a puppet of the Wang Jingwei regime, visited Japan. The Japanese government intended to use Miao Bin to establish contact with the Nationalist government in Chongqing to conduct a "peace movement." Miao Bin was a "mysterious figure" who carried peace proposals from Chongqing to Japan, consisting of six points, including China and Japan signing a separate armistice agreement, the Japanese army completely withdrawing from China, Nanjing being under a long-term Japanese detention, and the establishment of a transitional government in Nanjing aligned with Chongqing to help mediate peace between Britain, the United States, and Japan.

### The Philippines Again Promulgates Harsh Laws, Making it Difficult for Foreign Nationals to Leave the Country

[Central News Agency, Manila, March 3] The Philippine Immigration Bureau has recently promulgated new regulations regarding the departure of foreign nationals, ordering them to hold a port clearance pass upon departure. This pass must be applied for in person, requiring the applicant to fill out an application form, affix fingerprints, and present documents proving that they do not owe the government any money and are not involved in any pending lawsuits. However, diplomats and their families, foreign naval personnel, foreign seamen under the age of fourteen, foreigners passing through, and foreigners staying in the Philippines for tourism for less than two weeks are exempt. These new regulations are unlawful in nature, as they assume that every departing foreign national is guilty of evading taxes or other accusations if they cannot produce the required documents.

### Bao Dai's Wife Arrives in Marseille

### Public Trial of Tax Officials' Embezzlement Case; Defendants Testify About Negotiations in Restaurants, Deny Accepting Bribes But Admit to Receiving Two Checks

[Reported by this Newspaper] Eleven officials from the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, including auditors Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, Yu Maojie, Zhang Baoping, Yang Renzheng, Zou Wenlong, Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, Wang Zonghuai, Wang Rentang, and Miao Boyan, were investigating the account books of seven Chinese-style furniture stores (Zhang Senmao, Zhu Genji, Wufu, Yang Longxing, Zhang Wanli, Zhang Wantai, and Qiao Yuantai) on August 15th of this year when they allegedly extorted a large sum of money. The case was uncovered, and the Tax Bureau handed over Gao, Xie, Yu, Zhang, Yang, and Zou to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and detention. Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, Wang Zonghuai, and Wang Rentang fled upon hearing the news and are wanted. After completing the investigation, the District Prosecutor's Office believed that the defendants were suspected of corruption and filed a public prosecution on October 9th. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Judge Hu Zhichao and Clerk Dai Duchen of the Third Criminal Court of the District Court began the trial. Eight lawyers appeared in court to defend the defendants. Zhang Shouqi, Zhu Jianni, Cao Caigeng, Zhang Xianliang, Yang Yinshi, Zhang Zhonghui, Wang Yongxiang, and Shen Wenbin, as well as witnesses Zhao Xinggeng and Jing Heng, were summoned to court. Zhang Zhongyuan and Zheng Gongda did not attend. First, Attorney Chu Shun, representing Zhang Zhongyuan, described the events in detail. Then, each defendant, witness, and respondent was ordered to appear in court for individual questioning. The defendants uniformly denied soliciting bribes, claiming that the accounts were inconsistent and could not be reported, so they negotiated at the Jingdong Restaurant. According to Zou Wenlong (Tax Bureau Supervisor), "On August 17th, auditors Zhang Baoping and Yu Maojie had a slight argument with Zhang Xianliang, the manager of Zhang Senmao, while auditing the Zhang Senmao accounts. I intervened to mediate, and everyone dispersed. After returning to the bureau, Zheng Gongda called and invited me to dinner at the Jinghua Restaurant at 5:00 PM. When I arrived, some people from the furniture industry were there, saying that they were willing to pay to settle the matter and asked us to help. We refused. After I returned home, Zheng Gongda called me and said that he had put two checks in my coat pocket, one for three million yuan and one for fifty million yuan, totaling fifty-three million yuan. When I checked, there were indeed two checks. I wanted to return them immediately, but I couldn't find Zheng several times. It wasn't safe to keep the money on me, so I deposited the checks in the Chengdu Commercial Bank and returned them to him on the 23rd." Miao Boyan, who was sent by the Tax Bureau to investigate the case, stated, "On the 23rd, I was ordered by the director to investigate and asked each furniture store to sign a guarantee that there were no corrupt practices. All the stores complied, except for Zhang Wanli, because the owner Zhang Zhongyuan was not there, so they did not sign. I don't know about any bribery." Zhang Zhonghui, Wang Yongxiang, and Zhu Jianni testified that seven Direct Tax Bureau officials, including Zou Wenlong and Yu Maojie, were present at the dinner that day, and Zhu paid for the meal. However, another witness, Zhao Xinggeng, stated that he went to see a movie with Yu that afternoon, so Yu could not have been elsewhere. It was already 1:30 PM, and the court adjourned for another hearing.

### Social Bureau Director Discusses Four Methods for Raising Funds for the Winter Relief Society; Charity Horse Races Expected to be Approved; Entertainment Ticket Surcharge to be Implemented from Mid-Month

[Reported by this Newspaper] The methods for raising relief funds for the Winter Relief Committee, as resolved by the Municipal Council, are to add a 20% entertainment tax, report to the central government for approval, hold charity horse races, organize charity soccer matches, and launch a fundraising campaign from all sectors. Social Bureau Director Wu Kaixian stated yesterday that the central government may approve the holding of charity horse races. He will contact the Jockey Club after Mayor Wu returns to Shanghai.

The surcharge of 20% for winter relief on entertainment ticket prices has been set to be implemented from the 15th of this month for a period of four months. All Peking opera, movie, drama, local opera, and dance hall ticket prices in the city will be subject to the surcharge. This period includes both the old and new Lunar New Years, and it is estimated that approximately 4 billion yuan can be collected each month. Peking opera theaters previously believed that the surcharge would affect their business due to high operating costs. Wu stated that this 20% entertainment tax is collected on behalf of the government, added to the ticket price, and not included in it. The money comes from the audience and has nothing to do with the theaters. As long as the actors have star power, it will not affect business.

The municipal government has temporarily allocated 10 billion yuan from the 60 billion yuan budget of the Winter Relief Society, and fundraising is underway. However, the weather is getting colder, so the municipal government yesterday first temporarily allocated 10 billion yuan for immediate use. The society has decided to first repair the shelter in Caohejing and prioritize accommodating elderly and vulnerable refugees starting from the 16th of this month. The shelter site at the Japan Textile Mill in Pudong is currently being negotiated with the China Textile Corporation. The police department will take over the Sheng Sheng Ranch in Xujiahui, where the mounted patrol team raises horses, to use as a shelter site. In Zhabei and other areas, it is planned to make maximum use of temples and other public places to accommodate refugees. The society will also soon put out a tender for the first batch of 5,000 cotton quilts to distribute to refugees for warmth.

Wu, the Director of the Social Bureau, added that the society is seeking to make relief efforts constructive, and is currently in contact with the Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Health to implement work-for-relief programs, with refugees undertaking tasks such as dredging rivers, repairing roads and bridges, and clearing garbage. Shelters will be built near the work sites to accommodate the refugees.

### Partial Rickshaw Strike Quickly Settled; Bureau of Social Affairs to Convene Labor and Management Today to Exchange Views and Discuss Issues Such as Rickshaw Rental Fees

[Reported by this Newspaper] The rickshaw pullers' partial strike over rickshaw rental fees on the morning before yesterday has been settled after persuasion from all parties. The Bureau of Social Affairs, based on the report from the Rickshaw Industry Labor Union, stated that the strike was caused by Dai Biyiao, a rickshaw owner at 38 Tangjia Alley, Xiaonanmen, increasing rental fees. Dai Biyiao owns a total of 19 rickshaws and 11 modified single-person tricycles. The rickshaw rental fee is 30,000 yuan per day, and the modified single-person tricycle rental fee is 52,000 yuan per day. On the morning of the 2nd, Dai attempted to increase rental fees, causing 19 rickshaw pullers to collude with rickshaw pullers from seven other companies to stage a partial strike. They blocked rickshaws and tricycles along the way, deflating tires and stopping business. After the unrest occurred, the union sent personnel to persuade them, and the situation did not escalate. In the afternoon, the unrest spread to Caojiadu and Jiangjiaqiao in western Shanghai, where personnel were also sent to stop it. After receiving the report, the Bureau of Social Affairs has scheduled to convene Dai Biyiao and the rickshaw pullers who were on duty that day for questioning in the coming days.

### Organization of a Rickshaw Rental Fee Review Committee

Huang Changhan, Section Chief of the Welfare Division of the Labor Department of the Bureau, told reporters that the Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to fundamentally resolve rickshaw rental fee disputes, suggested that the municipal government organize a rickshaw rental fee review committee consisting of nine units, including the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Public Utilities, the Police Bureau, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and representatives from both labor and management. The municipal government has approved the organization, and the Bureau of Social Affairs has submitted the organizational regulations for approval.

Inside the hall, incense and candles burned, enshrining the spirits of the martyrs Chen Yinghsi, Zhang Lude, Yu Zhiwei, and eighteen others. The walls were covered with revolutionary documents and photographs from before and after the restoration. The hundred-odd attendees carefully examined the displays, sighing with emotion. They were all former patriots who personally participated in the attack on the Jiangnan Arsenal, and now, mostly white-haired and leaning on canes, they were deeply moved by the sight of these relics.

Surviving the Vicissitudes of the World, Still Standing Proudly

After the music played and the meeting began, National Government Commissioner Chen Aishi led the public memorial ceremony and presented flowers to the martyrs' memorial tablets. Zhu Shaoyi, the commander-in-chief of the Commercial Corps during the attack on the Jiangnan Arsenal, then gave a speech, reporting in detail the events of the uprising. Mao Jingji, director of the Hunan District fire station, also reported on the fire station's response to the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, stating that the fire station and its clock tower are extremely glorious memorials in the history of the Republic of China. He added that it was especially gratifying that the station has survived the vicissitudes of the world and is still standing proudly today. Subsequently, Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian gave a speech stating that he was only twelve years old at the time of the Shanghai Restoration and was attending elementary school. He often saw the Taoist government office on fire at night and was extremely excited. The next day, he cut off his queue. Although 36 years have passed, the scene is still vivid in his mind. Today, seeing the veterans who led the uprising still healthy and vigorous, his excitement is no less than it was back then.

[Shanghai Social News] Yuan Xiqi, a 32-year-old native of Haimen, lived at 80 Xincun, Zhongshan North Road, had an affair with a young woman named Ni Eqin. Yuan works at a leather shoe factory on Yuhang Road, leaving early and returning late. Ni also works as a female worker at the factory and has recently had an affair with a man named Qiu. Yuan discovered this and had a quarrel. On the morning of the 25th of last month, Yuan suddenly died at home. Ni immediately notified her brother Yuan Mugou to handle the funeral arrangements and did not report to the authorities. The encoffining took place at 4:00 PM. Unexpectedly, during the encoffining, Mugou saw that his brother's body was blue and purple and blood was flowing from his mouth and nose, so he reported it to the local police station. After investigation, and after questioning Ni, who was eloquent, claimed that she worked the night shift that night, and that when she returned the next day, Yuan had been dead for a long time. After further investigation by the police, it was confirmed that Ni was suspected of murder, and after further questioning, Ni confessed that she and Qiu had conspired to sneak into the room while Yuan was asleep.

### New Liquid Fuel Developed for Steelmaking

[Reported by this Newspaper] In view of the difficulty in obtaining coal for open-hearth steelmaking, the Shanghai Steel Company, with the cooperation of coal and steel expert Liu Rongquan and engineer Jiang Jianwen, researched and designed the conversion of the 15-ton gas open-hearth furnace at the company's Wusong No. 1 Factory to oil-burning equipment. After several experiments and improvements, it has now been successful. This method of using liquid fuel for steelmaking is a first in the country. It is more economical and convenient than using coal, not only reducing labor but also improving the quality of the steel and increasing production. It is truly a new contribution to China's steelmaking industry.

### U.S. Expert Dr. Conway Completes Transportation Improvement Report: Suggests Opening Roads to Reduce Vehicle Density, Adding Buses to Strengthen Transportation Capacity

[Our Report] The municipal government, in order to improve traffic in the central district, previously hired a team of three American experts led by Dr. Conway. They came to Shanghai in March of this year for on-site inspections. Two months later, they returned to Philadelphia, USA, and completed an improvement report. Hu Huiquan, the department head dispatched by the Public Utilities Bureau to accompany them abroad, has returned to China and submitted it to the municipal authorities. Yesterday, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau told reporters that the report contained very concrete and valuable suggestions, but some may not be suitable for the local conditions of the city and will need to be revised. The Public Utilities Bureau will work with the Police Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and other relevant departments to study and implement the plan in phases. The full report is eighty pages long, and the main points are as follows:

### Insufficient Number of Public Vehicles

Regarding the analysis of current traffic congestion, based on the operations of the British and French companies in the city, a comparison between 1946 and 1936 shows that the number of passengers carried in 1946 exceeded that of 1936 by 40% to 160%, while the number of kilometers driven decreased by about 30%. Congestion is therefore unavoidable. Although the city-run buses have shown efforts to develop, they are limited by vehicle equipment. Furthermore, the vehicles of the pre-war British Bus Company, the Chinese Zhabei Bus Company, and the Nanshi Tram Company no longer exist. The total passenger capacity of these three units after the war increased by 34% compared to pre-war levels, while the number of vehicles in operation decreased by 18%. At the same time, the number of pedicabs and rickshaws increased from 10,818 in 1936 to 31,252, an increase of 189%. The insufficient number of public vehicles, which led to an increase in other vehicles, is one of the main causes of congestion.

### Noteworthy "Free Ways"

Modern experts believe that using vehicles with excellent performance, strengthening traffic control, and increasing driving speed to increase transport capacity is the most economical way to do so. Although the construction of underground passages is another excellent solution to traffic, it is extremely expensive (recent estimates at the Philadelphia municipal exhibition put the value of underground passages at US$16 million per mile). Elevated roads are less expensive, but have a negative impact on urban development, as evidenced by the New York City government's purchase and demolition of the elevated road on Sixth Avenue. It should be noted that if traffic in the city can be actively improved, there will be no need for underground passages or elevated roads. The maximum one-way transport capacity of the busiest roads in the central district, such as Nanjing Road, Waibaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and East Zhongzheng Road, has been measured at 5,000 to 8,000 people per hour. However, buses and trams, if equipped with excellent vehicles and effective traffic control, can achieve a one-way transport capacity of over 9,000 to 12,000 people per hour. Another important development in modern urban transport is the "Free Way", which is constructed like a highway between urban areas. It allows for rapid driving without passing through busy central areas. This potential development is most noteworthy for Shanghai.

### Improvement Plan Divided into Two Major Parts

The improvement plan includes two major parts: (A) Municipal Section: Improve the quality and treatment of traffic police, strictly enforce traffic control regulations, promote traffic safety to the public, improve traffic signals, separate fast and slow vehicles, and even when using the same road, lanes should be demarcated, phased elimination of bottleneck-shaped buildings, and other long-term plans: opening roads through the former racetrack site to connect Fuzhou Road and Weihaiwei Road, opening Dalu Road in Zhabei to connect Yangshupu and Hongkou districts, and from Changshou Road and its vicinity, after crossing the Suzhou River, vehicles in the northern district can directly reach the western and southwestern districts through this road, reducing vehicle density in the central district. (B) Public Transport Section: Add vehicles; the first phase plan is to find ways to add 300 new or public buses, and the second phase is to improve trams and trolleybuses.

In his report, Dr. Conway specifically pointed out that in the development process of modern cities, traffic in the commercial center must be properly handled. The inevitable trend for those who fail to take timely measures is traffic congestion, inconvenient travel, commercial relocation, commercial decline in the central district, property depreciation, and reduced tax revenue. The city is now facing this stage and should work together to resolve it as soon as possible.

Smiling and Stroking His Beard, Applauding in Response

The veteran comrades in the room, listening attentively to Shen's kind recollection, smiled and stroked their beards, applauding in response. Following reports by Chen Yishi and representatives from the Kuomintang municipal party headquarters, the meeting was adjourned for a photograph. It is said that the comrades of the Chamber of Commerce Uprising are all over fifty years old, with the oldest nearing eighty, so a dinner was held last night as a celebration. At the same time, Yuan Changkui and others jointly broadcasted the ringing of the bell and the opening of the meeting to commemorate this historic day of glory for the city.

### Preferential Fares for Soldiers Begin Tomorrow

[Our Report] The preferential fare policy for soldiers on the two railway bureaus will be implemented starting tomorrow.

Director Chen returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and said that all preparations have been completed, and disputes caused by soldiers riding without tickets should no longer occur.

### Japanese Returned "Heshuen" Arrives at Wusongkou This Afternoon

### Municipal Land Tax Collection to Begin Mid-Month

After the Ministry of Food approved a reduction of the land tax in Shanghai to 2.16 dou per mu (calculated as 1.2 dou actual, 0.6 dou borrowed, and 0.36 dou for public grain), the Finance Bureau has now scheduled the collection to begin on the 15th. The price standard is determined to be 198,000 yuan per stone.

### Oil Rationing by Population to Be Implemented, Purchase Certificates to Be Issued in Ten Days

[Our Report] The Civil Food Allocation Committee is actively handling the issue of oil rationing by population, which will begin this month, with one jin for large households and half a jin for small households. Purchase certificates are being printed and will be issued in ten days. The selling price will be determined by negotiation, equivalent to negotiation before the certificate is issued.

### Military Service Association Urges Payment of Preferential Funds

[Our Report] The expenses incurred by the Military Service Association for the settlement allowance and consolation items issued to the volunteers were borrowed from various banks and bureaus, and must be repaid by the middle of this month. However, the preferential funds raised by the association have not been paid by many sectors. The association has reissued a notice urging each fundraising committee member to be responsible for raising 100 million yuan and paying it in advance.

### Holding Victory Bonds to Claim Money: Discovered to Be Stolen Goods

[Our Report] Yang Chengyi, the manager of the Nanjing branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Bank, had 5,000 yuan worth of Allied Victory Public Bonds stolen by a pickpocket on Beijing Road last New Year's Eve. Afterwards, Yang reported to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, requesting that a notice be issued nationwide to invalidate the payment. He also published advertisements in major newspapers, offering a reward of 500 US dollars to anyone who found and returned the bonds. At about 3 pm yesterday, a man named Pan Xiaoqi (residing at No. 23, Xinping Lane, Longmen Road) brought the bonds to the National Treasury Bureau to exchange them for legal tender. He was detained and handed over to the Songshan Police Station. He claimed that he found the bonds at the intersection of Beijing Road and Dianchi Road last year, and had already received US$416 for the first installment in April. The matter is now under detailed investigation to determine whether the bonds were found or stolen, so as to handle the matter accordingly.

### Lieutenant General Feng Yan Passes Away in Shanghai Due to Illness: Minister Bai Dispatches Personnel to Preside Over Funeral Affairs

Lieutenant General Feng Yan, Director of the Land and Construction Department of the Ministry of National Defense, whose style name was Bu Fan, went to Linhai, Zhejiang last month on the 23rd on behalf of Minister Bai on official business. On the 24th, he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and took the North Jiangsu ship to Linhai. He changed to a shoulder-carried sedan chair to go to the countryside. Because urgent official business needed to be handled in Beijing, he did not stay long in Linhai He Duo and took a small train to Haimen. That day, the wind and waves in the sea were extremely strong, and the ship was excessively turbulent. Feng vomited continuously for two days and one night on the ship, resulting in severe stomach bleeding. After arriving in Haimen, he was unable to receive medical treatment and took the Jiangjing ship to Shanghai, arriving at dawn on the 30th. He was admitted to the Sino-Western Sanatorium on Pushi Road for treatment, but ultimately died at 5:25 am on the 3rd due to excessive stomach bleeding. He was a graduate of the 13th class of the Army University and the first class of the National Defense Research Institute. He served as the Director of the First Department of the Military Order Department, the Chief of Staff of the 71st Army, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Expeditionary Force Headquarters, the Chief Liaison Staff Officer of the Military Commission stationed at the Allied Headquarters in Southeast Asia, the Representative of the Southeast Theater of Operations for Receiving Surrender, and the Deputy Director of the Minister's Office of the Ministry of National Defense, and Director of the Land and Construction Department.

### A Blind Man's Ambiguous Case: Both Man and Woman Groped Their Way to Court

[Our Report] The District Prosecutor's Office seemed to be hearing a case of rape by a blind man yesterday. The plaintiff is Chen Afa, a businessman from Wuxian, who lives at No. 243, Dongsiwen Lane, Datong Road. His daughter, Huiqin, is 19 years old, blind, and studies fortune-telling. She was allegedly raped by her fellow apprentice, the blind man Zhu Haiqiao. According to Chen Afa's complaint, Zhu, 32, lives at No. 90, A-shaped, Dongzhuanbang, Jiangsu Road. He makes a living by fortune-telling. Under the pretext of illness, he asked his fellow apprentice Huiqin to help with fortune-telling at his house. He then used sweet words and various inducements, but to no avail. He then resorted to coercion and raped her on the fourth day of the third month of the lunar calendar. He then raped her twice more. Huiqin repeatedly negotiated with Zhu, requesting a settlement, but Zhu, having achieved his goal, ignored her. Out of shame and indignation, Huiqin swallowed Lai Sha at the Railway Hotel at No. 85, Tianmu Road on the afternoon of October 16th and committed suicide. Fortunately, she was discovered early and sent to the Shanghai Sanatorium for emergency treatment, and her life was saved. The North Station Police Station has taken the case. Yesterday, Prosecutor Huang Daping summoned both the man and the woman. The two blind people groped their way to court. Chen Huiqin said: "Zhu used sweet words to deceive me, saying that his wife was not a proper wife, and wanted to marry me. I was softened by these words." Zhu denied the rape, saying that Chen wanted to come to my house to help, but I didn't agree because she was young and prone to accidents. As for Chen accusing me of rape, I really don't know why.

### Stableman Loses Job and Secret Opium Den Finally Busted

[Our Report] The Xincheng Police Station received a tip-off a few days ago and apprehended two men and women publicly smoking opium in a makeshift shelter beside Shanjia Garden Road, Fengyang Road.

In less than a year, he accumulated a considerable fortune, with wives and concubines living together at No. 12, Lane 31, Xinchang Road. The furnishings in his home were extremely luxurious. When Chief Hao of the police station, along with officers Weng Yongquan, Zhao Yongji, Zhao Zigian, and others, went to arrest him, Yang had already escaped with his wives and concubines after hearing the news. Only a maid, Qin Aimei, was apprehended, and 115 small packets of heroin were found in a lead box at the back door.

The waiter repeatedly asked for payment to no avail. At about 1 pm yesterday, they were evicted, causing them to hold a grudge. They placed a cigarette butt in the cotton wadding. The tea boy, Yu Fengqi, discovered the wadding was smoking while tidying the bedding. He quickly put out the fire with water and chased after them. He turned Sun and the others over to the police in front of the Changzhou Inn across the street. They were taken to the North Station Police Station, where it was learned that they were all unemployed vagrants who lived solely by theft.

Xu then falsely accused Jin of stealing items and reported it to the police station for a search, but nothing was found.

### Injustice Cleared, Dreams Come True: A Record of the Murder and Body Disposal Case in Fuzhou, the Culprit Captured

[Dispatch from our Fuzhou Correspondent, 1st] A shocking case of murder for money and body disposal occurred recently at No. 2, Duan Sanying, Daoshan Road, causing a sensation throughout Fuzhou, with onlookers thronging the area. The full story is as follows: Zheng Qingjing, 32 years old, from Xianyou County, graduated from the high school department of Fujian College and is currently the chairman of the Bantou Township Chamber of Commerce in Xianyou County. He usually trades between Fujian and Taiwan. This spring, he and his sworn friend, someone, jointly operated a Southeast Company in Taipei, with Zheng as the manager. The business situation was not bad. Zheng has an elderly mother and a brother at home, and is married to Lin Ruiying, with whom he has five children. His wife usually lives with Zheng in Taiwan.

In September of this year, his wife returned to her hometown in Xianyou because she was pregnant and nearing her due date. Zheng said that he would also return to Fujian at the end of September. His wife returned to Xianyou for about a month, and on September 30th, she received a telegram from her husband from Taiwan, saying: I will take a plane from Taiwan to Fuzhou on October 1st, stay in Fuzhou for three days, and then transfer to Xianyou. Zheng did arrive in Fuzhou on that day and first stayed at the Jiangbin Hotel on Jiangbin Road. The next morning, he entered the city and visited his friend Wu Chao and Zhang Liangdong at No. 2, Duan Sanying, Daoshan Road. Wu had previously owed Zheng a sum of money in Taiwan, and Zheng came here partly to collect the debt. During the conversation, Wu and Zhang learned that Zheng had brought more than 30 million yuan in cash and checks with him, which aroused Wu and Zhang's murderous intentions. Wu feigned goodwill and dealt with him superficially, while the two plotted to poison Zheng. On the evening of October 3rd, the third day of Zheng's return to Fuzhou, Wu and Zhang invited Zheng to their home for drinks and entertainment. While Zheng was unaware, they strangled him to death and sank the body under the floor of the room. Two days later, the murderers falsely claimed to the landlord that they were returning to their hometown to visit relatives and fled far away in the middle of the night with their luggage. The landlord initially did not know why. Since his wife received the cable on October 1 from her husband, she waited eagerly everyday.

Looking eagerly.

She said that she had a bad dream on the 26th of last month, in which she saw her husband standing in front of her bed, telling her in detail how he was killed, and asking her to come to Fuzhou to excavate the body and avenge him on an auspicious day. The next morning, the deceased's wife immediately came to Fuzhou and inquired about everything with the landlord and the deceased's friend Lin Yuansheng. Later, she opened the empty room where the murderer lived. It is said that at this time, she suddenly felt dizzy and saw someone pointing to the old floor, which was nailed with new iron nails. So she yelled madly

Open the floor.

At this time, a police officer happened to pass by and heard someone shouting madly in the room. He rushed in to see what was going on and saw more than a dozen people gathered around. After inquiring about the details, he reported to the branch bureau and hired workers to excavate. After digging about four feet, they found a corpse, which was Zheng Qingjing himself. After the police station notified the District Prosecutor's Office to send a forensic doctor to examine the body, the provincial government, considering the seriousness of the case, ordered that the murderers Wu Chao and Zhang Liangdong be arrested in Xianyou County on the 1st and are now preparing to send them to the province for investigation. The course of this case is like a legend of the Tang and Song dynasties. The section on the deceased's wife "dreams come true" is particularly bizarre and strange. It is recorded as above. (Special reporter Chen Zhengyu)

### Refugees in Jinshan Seize Vegetables and Straw by Force

[Dispatch from our Jinshan Correspondent, 1st] On the 29th of last month, more than 100 refugees from Fengxian suddenly arrived at Zhangyan Township East City, in the county. They sent three representatives to the township office to request three dan of rice as relief. Township head Zhang was unable to provide the rice, but agreed to provide 250,000 legal tender. However, after receiving the money, the refugees forcibly seized people's vegetables and straw within the first ward and demanded a supply of chickens and ducks. After the local ward police reported the incident, a team was dispatched to suppress it, and the refugees left for Zhejiang Province on the 30th.

### Taiwan Coal Enters White Market from Black Market: Coal Producers Feel Greatly Threatened

[Dispatch from our Hebei Correspondent, 2nd] Liu Ming, chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Coal Industry Association, and Yan Qingxian, a coal industry tycoon, told reporters: "Taiwan coal is encountering the difficulty of 'entering the white market from the black market.' The equipment needed in the coal mining areas must be purchased from the black market at high prices, but the coal must be sold at the officially set price of 5,500 Taiwan dollars per ton, which poses a great threat to coal producers." In the past, the Japanese achieved a maximum annual output of 300,000 tons on Taiwan, where the coal seams are very thin. At the time of the recovery, it was only 15,000 tons. In the previous two months, it increased to 70,000 tons, of which 40,000 tons were shipped to Beijing and Shanghai. With the weather in the mainland gradually getting colder recently, Liu Ming said: "In order to fully express our love for the country and our compatriots, we have decided to increase production to 100,000 tons starting this month, of which 70,000 tons can be supplied to Beijing and Shanghai," and a meeting will be held on the 5th to discuss the matter. His only wish is that the government will establish policies to encourage increased production and assist in the operation of coal mines (77 mine pits have already received small subsidies) and adjust official prices.

### Central Farmers Bank Nanchang Branch Ends Wuyuan Tea Loan

[Dispatch from our Wuyuan Correspondent, 3rd] Bi Qinglai, a special inspector of the Central Farmers Bank Nanchang Branch, inspected tea loans. At the end of last month, he went to various tea factories and tea cooperatives in the east, north, and south townships to supervise the speedy addition of 20% of cases. The bank's tea loan work this year was all completed by the end of October. In addition, the head office of the Farmers Bank of China recently instructed the loan office stationed to investigate the general economic situation of the rural areas in the county and will set up an office to help transport and sell special products such as tea, wood, paper, and tung oil, and adjust the rural economy.

### Cave-In in Zhengzhou South City Kills Eight Refugees

[Dispatch from our Zhengzhou Correspondent, October 29th] There are no fewer than 50,000 to 60,000 refugees gathered in Zhengzhou. Among them, more than 4,000 refugees have no houses to live in and mostly live in air-raid shelters along the city. Unfortunately, two caves in the south city collapsed at 7 am on the 28th. County Magistrate Gao Qinglun personally led self-defense team soldiers to rescue them after hearing the news. A total of six corpses from the Zhang Senlin family and two corpses from the Li Junchuan family were dug out. One member of the Zhang family and two members of the Li family were seriously injured and sent to the hospital for treatment. According to the Li family, they lived in the refugee shelter of the Executive Yuan, but because they heard that the Executive Yuan was about to close and take back the tents they lived in, they first occupied the city cave, but unexpectedly encountered this tragedy.

### Notorious Thief Huang Xinhai Jumps from Train in Escape Attempt, Captured

### The Henan Province Competes to Plant Tobacco, and the Price of Tobacco Fields Skyrockets

"Our newspaper's Zhengzhou 31st dispatch" The tobacco leaves produced in Xuchang, Xiangxian, and Jiaxian areas of Henan are the most famous. Recently, almost all counties, large and small, are planting tobacco. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has established experimental farms in Xuchang and other places, and at the same time distributed American seeds to encourage farmers to cultivate them. Currently, one mu of tobacco field is unwilling to be sold even for 20 million yuan. It is said that the income from one mu of tobacco field is as high as 10 to 20 million yuan. As a result of everyone competing to plant tobacco, the price of grain in Henan has increased day by day (of course, there are other reasons). Farmers are now murmuring about planting tobacco, believing that if this continues, although those who deal in tobacco will get rich and live extravagantly for the time being, if there is no overall plan for grain in the province in the end, then tobacco leaves may become foxtail millet leaves, and everyone will rise up to level them. Farmers certainly know that these tobacco leaves can block part of the outflow of foreign exchange, but they still feel that it is important for them to have enough to eat.

"Another dispatch" Fresh dates have recently appeared on the market here, as large as green plums, with a color like coffee, crisp and sweet to the taste, and very filling. These dates are produced in Xinzheng, south of Zhengzhou and Nanchang. In Xinzheng, five out of ten townships are entirely planted with dates, with an annual output of 60 million catties. Currently, each catty is only selling for three yuan. Following the fresh dates, persimmons are also on the market here. Small ones can be bought for more than ten for every thousand yuan, and large ones can be bought for about seven or eight. Persimmon cakes produced in Sishui and Gongxian are particularly famous. There are still quite a few Guangdong merchants ordering persimmon cakes from Zhengzhou. If transportation is convenient, the harvest from this farmers' sideline occupation can be restored immediately.

### Two Prostitutes in Hong Kong Deported for Ten Years

[Our newspaper's Hong Kong 1st dispatch] The highest authorities in Hong Kong officially approved the deportation of two "streetwalkers" for ten years on October 31st. Deporting prostitutes is not only unprecedented in the history of Hong Kong but also rare in major cities around the world. These two unfortunate women: one named Tan and one named Li Xiang, both claim to be married women working in factories. The former's husband installs light bulbs, and the latter's husband sews canvas shoes. However, because their wages were not enough to maintain their lives, they began to solicit on the streets. They have been arrested five or six times, so the police, on the charge of "vagrants," petitioned the Hong Kong government to deport them.

### Jiangsu Province's Land Price Tax Starts at Ten Million

"Our newspaper's Zhenjiang 2nd dispatch" The land registration and reorganization of eleven counties including Zhenjiang has been completed.

### The Prosperity of Dantu Town is Promising

"Our newspaper's Zhenjiang 1st dispatch" Rong Desheng, the "Flour King," and others are currently making large investments in Dantu Town in this county, establishing the New Shen No. 9 Cotton Mill and a large-scale hydroelectric power plant. Therefore, many officials and businessmen are racking their brains to prepare for the revival of industry and commerce. According to reliable news from the Department of Construction: the plan to revive the entire greater Zhenjiang is only a matter of time. The department has also dispatched personnel to the town to measure the water depth, as Dantu Town is close to the urban area, adjacent to the Yangtze River, and has convenient transportation. In the future, after the establishment of the New Shen No. 9 Cotton Mill and the large-scale power plant, the bright future of Zhenjiang will be transformed and advanced due to the beginning of this driving force.

### The Issue of "Import Permits" is Rife in Hong Kong and Guangzhou

[Our newspaper's Guangzhou 1st dispatch] Along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Dongjiang River, "Expedition Teams," "Speeding Car Groups," "River Crossing Teams," "Little Devil Teams," "Sea Eagle Factions," and "Airplane Guys" and other "Risk-Taking Heroes" appear from time to time. The customs authorities have seized more than two billion yuan worth of smuggled goods in half a month in as many as fourteen cases. Customs revenue has fallen twentyfold, with daily revenue of only twenty to thirty million, and the national treasury is suffering unprecedented losses.

Following the "Tongtian Pass" of the Jiu You Fist, the market between Hong Kong and Guangzhou was once rumored to have a so-called "Import Permit" issue. This issue is related to the life of Guangzhou's import and export trade, the market in South China, and even the work of the South China branch of the Transportation and Management Committee. However, the South China branch of the Transportation and Management Committee has strongly stated that there has never been an "Import Permit" and immediately sent personnel to Hong Kong to investigate. In the meantime, a senior official of the Transportation and Management Committee (Deputy Director Tian Ding'an) also stated that the so-called "Permit" would absolutely not be issued by the Transportation and Management Branch. They said that there were only two possibilities for this news: one was "fraud" and the other was "rumor." However, newspapers everywhere described the shape, color, and size of the "Permit" in vivid detail. Whether there is "definitely such a certificate" or whether "the biggest connection lies in the Kowloon Customs" can only be resolved when the truth comes out, as Mr. Tian Ding'an said, "Paper cannot contain fire."

A few days ago, in order to encourage export businesses, the South China Transportation and Management Branch established a Property Small Group Committee for Export Goods and a Price Review Committee for Export Goods to solve the financial difficulties of export merchants and help export merchants settle foreign exchange. However, due to the "development" of smuggling in South China, the foreign exchange black market price is like a race between a rabbit and a hare (the difference between the official price and the black market price reached 30% within ten days). How many exporters can receive a little subsidy and endure the suffering of 30%? (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)

### The Defense of Suining: A Detailed Account of Chen Yi's Disastrous Defeat

[Our newspaper's Xuzhou October 28th dispatch] Suining is located at the midpoint of the Xu (zhou) Huai (yin) highway line. It is the gateway to northern Jiangsu. Therefore, it occupies a pivotal strategic importance. This small town, less than two li in circumference, has not yet recovered its original prosperity since it was taken back from the bandits last year.

At 9 a.m. on October 12th, General Sun Liangcheng, commander of the 25th Division of the Regular Army, made a speech at the Suining Senate: "The bandit Chen Yi led three divisions of his Third Column, namely the 7th, 8th, and 9th divisions, with a total of nine infantry regiments and one cavalry regiment, totaling about 15,000 people, and secretly crossed the Jinpu Railway at Xisipo on the night of the 10th, and have successively captured Lingbi, Sixian, and Qigang before fleeing back to northern Jiangsu. If the bandit Chen wants to wreak havoc on northern Jiangsu again, he must attack Suining." He also said: "As long as everyone unites and defends firmly, I guarantee that reinforcements will arrive in three days." Commander Sun went to Suqian to oversee the defense that afternoon. The Suining military and political authorities convened an

Emergency Meeting

in the afternoon and decided to defend the city and vow to "succeed or die." At that time, the garrison in the city consisted of only two companies from the 25th Division's transport battalion, four companies from the Suining Security Regiment, three heavy machine guns, and two mortars, which were their most valuable heavy weapons. To defend the city, they must first strike out. This is a preemptive tactic to gain the initiative. Wang Yunwen, deputy commander of the Security Regiment, led two companies to deploy along the Su River southwest of the city on the evening of the 12th. They engaged in a skirmish with the bandits near Dali Village on the morning of the 13th. In the afternoon, the bandit army reinforced, and the fighting became more intense. The bandits were forced to retreat. Later, the bandits changed their approach, not attacking head-on, but sending plainclothes teams from both wings to outflank them. Deputy Commander Wang Yunwen, facing overwhelming odds, withdrew to the Jingmen (25 li southwest of Suining) stronghold and defended the

Four Blockhouses

on Jing Mountain. The bandits used heavy artillery to bombard them, and three blockhouses had already been destroyed. Deputy Commander Wang was determined not to break through. When that blockhouse was destroyed, Deputy Commander Yu finally sacrificed heroically. Two-thirds of the officers and soldiers of the two companies were killed or wounded, so they risked death to break out of the encirclement and returned to the city.

On the afternoon of the 13th, the bandit Chen deployed for the siege. The bandits used six regiments to attack the city and four regiments to guard it. Ten li outside the city were included in the cordon, on the one hand to prevent the defending army from breaking out of the encirclement, and on the other hand to prepare to meet the National Army's reinforcements. In this way, the defending army's belief in "fight to live" was further strengthened. On the night of the 13th, the bandit army launched a fierce attack on the South Gate of Suining, and the fierce battle lasted all night, but the bandits did not succeed. On the morning of the 14th, the bandits launched a full-scale attack on the city and used artillery to bombard the defending army on South Gate Street. More than half of the Second Company of the Security Regiment was killed or wounded. District Chief Liu Jingxian, South Gate Town Chief Hu Huamin, District Team Deputy Ge Wenhua, and Company Commander Zhang Yuqing successively died. South Gate Street was abandoned and not defended. At night, the bandits concentrated their firepower on the East Gate, using large knives to cut the barbed wire outside the city gate and using direct-fire guns to bombard the gate tower. The tower collapsed, and more than 20 bandits poured into the city and

Engaged in Street Fighting

The sandbag fortifications and deer-fence obstacles were shattered by machine gun fire. Deputy Battalion Commander Li led the reserve team to rush to the scene and annihilated all the bandits. In one night, the bandits rushed into the East Gate three times, but were all annihilated or repelled.

The defending army was unifiedly commanded by Song Xiangfu, battalion commander of the 25th Division's transport battalion. Battalion Commander Song was stationed on the large blockhouse in the center of the city, calm and resolute. At night, he used signal flares to direct the defense. Wherever it was urgent, he personally led the team to kill the enemy. He strictly ordered the defending army to hold their positions. When the bandits rushed into the city, they used machine guns to sweep and bayonets to stab. They were not allowed to shout "Kill!" because if they shouted "Kill!" at night, the neighboring defending army would know that the bandit army had rushed into the city, which would shake their morale. Therefore, during the three melee battles at the East Gate on the night of the 14th, the neighboring defending army did not know until dawn. Every night, in addition to hearing the sounds of heavy artillery, machine guns, and rifles, and seeing the sparks of bullets in the sky, the city was as silent as death.

The bandit army's

Charge

was a company as a unit. After this unit died, another company would come up. After it died, another company would come up. This kind of attrition fatigue attack was really powerful. The bandit army used machine guns to command the night battles. These were Russian-style machine guns. The sound of the guns was particularly loud, and they used bursts and single shots to command the attack or retreat.

On the 15th, the bandits turned to attack the West Gate. At midnight, the bandits broke into the West Gate with one company. Battalion Commander Song personally participated in the bayonet fight, killing ten bandits in one breath. He himself seized seven rifles. Later, the bandits attacked four more times, but were all annihilated. Because the bandits were

Exhausted

after several battles before attacking the city, the defending army was well-rested and naturally had the advantage. At noon on the 16th, the 51st Division of the National Army and Sun Liangcheng's troops arrived to rescue, and the siege of Suining was lifted. The bandit Chen's dream of wreaking havoc on northern Jiangsu was completely shattered.

Zhang Xuezhong, commander of the Huaihai Pacification Area, arrived in Yaning from Huaiyin on the afternoon of the 17th to inspect the area and express his condolences to the defending army. Commander Sun Liangcheng accompanied him and commended the soldiers and civilians who had contributed to the defense of the city. Battalion Commander Song Xiangfu had the

Greatest Merit

and was promised to be promoted by two ranks (from lieutenant colonel to major general). Chairman Chiang also sent a telegram to Battalion Commander Song and all the officers and soldiers to commend them, and they were rewarded and credited separately.

In his own review meeting after the disastrous defeat, the bandit Chen said: Since leaving the Yimeng Mountain area, the Third Column had captured 28 county towns, none of which had withstood an attack for more than three hours. This time, they fought for three days and three nights, and the total loss of casualties and deserters was 15 companies. Nine company commanders died, not to mention battalion and regimental commanders.

Indeed, the bandits suffered more than 1,500 casualties, and more than 1,000 took the opportunity to desert. Now, outside Suining City, there are many scattered bandits surrendering with their weapons every day. The bandits said: "We can't get enough to eat, we are still wearing ragged single clothes, we are running around every day, and we are forced to be cannon fodder. Following Chen Yi is a dead end sooner or later. Surrendering is really the only way to survive." (Special Correspondent Zong Chunlin)

### Hualian Football Team Defeats Hong Kong Army United, Yichen Longhai, and Other Middle Schools by One Goal

Since the long-victorious Kitchee team was defeated by St. Joseph's, the league situation has changed dramatically.

Because the schedule is a double round robin, the team that can continue to win will be the champion. Let's see which of the three heroes wins the title.

31st (Friday): The Shanghai Hualian team deployed troops for the second time and set up camp at the So Kon Po field. The Army United team lined up to meet them. The number of spectators was neither crowded nor too sparse. When lining up, Hualian's forwards had Yao Hai but were missing Yao Shun and Yao Yao, with Yao Shui taking the field. Yao Qixiang rested due to injury, and Lin Gen played. Shi Xin also limped onto the field, kicking with a "limp" that was "wonderful." The two lineups were as follows:

Hualian in Hong Kong Draws with Sing Tao 2-1

"United Press Hong Kong, 3rd" The Shanghai Hualian Football Team played its last match in Hong Kong today, drawing 2-2 with the Sing Tao Expeditionary Team. Sing Tao took a 2-0 lead, but the Shanghai team scored two consecutive goals in the second half to tie the score. The whole game was dull, with each team scoring one penalty kick.

Shanghai Hualian Team: Zhang Banglun, Yan Shixin, Zhang Lingen, Han Longbo, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Qu Yongfu, Li Yichen, Yao Longhai, Gu Yiche, Fei Chunhua

After the start of the game, the Army United team started the attack after winning the ball, but the Shanghai team immediately gained the advantage. Yongfu headed high, and Yichen shot wide. The mixed attack lasted for 14 minutes. Chunhua broke through on the right and passed the ball. "Lazy Cow" followed with a furious shot, and the ball was as fast as an arrow, scoring the first goal. Hualian immediately gained the victory and continued to attack. After 16 minutes, Yichen headed the incoming ball, and the ball crossed the goal. Longhai rushed forward and flicked it in with his foot. After Hualian switched to defense with two goals, the Army United team tried to counterattack, but although they were able to penetrate the enemy area, their shooting skills were lacking. Most of the competition was in the midfield, and the shots were just for show. The only highlight was Longhai's single-handed attempt, where he had already picked the ball past the goalkeeper, but unfortunately hit the post. Yongfu rushed forward to shoot again, but was saved by Bana. As the melee continued, with Banglun in the Shanghai team, the Army United team was unable to score a goal. The game ended, and the Shanghai Hualian team won by two goals.

Hualian Team Forwards Active

Although the Shanghai Hualian team was missing two key players, the forwards had more of Yao Longhai and Yiche, taking the lead in the charge. The forwards were much more active. Although Yongfu on the wing was not very fast, his passing and shooting were well-coordinated. Yichen played like he was no longer a "lazy cow." The Shanghai team's victory depended on his shot, as well as his fight for the midfield ball.

Because the Army United team's front line was weak, the Shanghai Hualian's defense was stable, so the center back could focus on fighting for the midfield ball, and the situation was firmly in Shanghai Hualian's hands. The Army United team's forwards were too bad, especially the right wing. The forwards did not have good offensive capabilities, and the defense was unable to hold firm. As a result, they ended up with a double goose egg.

Introduction to the Malayan Chinese Expedition Team - Central News Agency Reporter Cai Baiqing

Deputy Captain Guan Yide (Negri Sembilan, left inside forward)

Deputy Captain Guan Yide was already famous in the Malayan Chinese football world at the age of fifteen, and still shines brightly today. He is a first-class talent and the captain of the Negri Sembilan Inter-State team, highly respected. In 1930, he once represented Malayan Chinese on expeditions to Shanghai, Saigon, and other places. Zhang's fans call him "Old Man," meaning he is qualified. He is good at using his brain and often wins by surprise. He is 35 years old this year.

Goalkeeper Zhu Zhicheng (Singapore)

He is 23 years old this year and has served as the goalkeeper of the Singapore Chinese Football Team. He learned his skills while studying. After joining Singapore Chinese in 1941, he received guidance from Bao Jiaping, the "Iron Gate" of South China, and his skills improved rapidly. His goalkeeping style is unique, with steady legs and feet, often taking the initiative. He was the goalkeeper in both matches against Sing Tao in June this year.

Goalkeeper Chen Shengwei (Johor)

He is 28 years old this year and is the first Johor player to be selected to attend the All-Malayan Chinese Games. His goalkeeping style is not fixed but purely natural. His recent performances have received much praise.

Left Back Chen Jiawan (Selangor)

Mr. Chen Jiawan and his younger brother Jiasheng are a pair of famous backs who have shocked Guangdong. People in the country have probably heard of them long ago. Jiawan is 33 years old this year and specializes as a left back. Since 1935, he has been selected to represent Selangor at the All-Malayan Inter-State Games. He has participated in many expeditions to the motherland and has rich experience. He is agile and has excellent heading and kicking skills. He is also strong and generous. The Chen brothers were instrumental in Sing Tao's defeat to the Malayan press team. When Sing Tao went to England, he was invited to join, but it did not happen due to some reason. It is said that this pair of brothers may be selected as our country's representatives at the World Games to be held in London next year.

Right Back Chen Jiasheng (Selangor)

Jiasheng is ten years younger than his brother. He began to emerge in 1940. Some fans here say that "Jiasheng works hard while Jiawan takes the credit." This is because Jiasheng is young and strong and always runs around the field under his brother's planning, making the defense as solid as a soup made from gold. Jiasheng's foot skills are excellent with both feet. His heading and interception skills are also skillful, with the same style as his brother. His long-range clearing kicks are especially appreciated by fans. In the match between Malayan Chinese and Sing Tao, one kick every half a field often turned danger into safety for the Chinese team, turning defense into offense.

Defender Zhang Guoxing (Negri Sembilan)

Nicknamed "Dull Face," he began his football career in Kuala Lumpur in 1938. He is a regular representative of the Negri Sembilan Inter-State team. He is 28 years old this year, 5 feet 10 inches tall, and weighs 160 pounds. He is good at long-range kicking and interception, and is very brave. In addition to football, he is also good at baseball, and is famous in Selangor and northern Malaysia.

### National Bank Actively Investigates Returned Checks, Sends Staff to Clearing House for Spot Checks, Analyzes Causes and Discusses Measures

[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the financial authorities are actively cracking down on returned checks. The other day (the 1st), the National Bank and the Ministry of Finance jointly sent staff to the check clearing house for spot checks. On that day, a total of 3,927 checks were returned, with a total value of $432,938,804,327.65. A total of 369 checks with larger amounts were selected for analysis. The reasons for the returns were: funds not yet received for collection accounted for 38.5%, overdrafts accounted for 23.3%, contact payable, please contact the issuer to collect accounted for 15.2%, insufficient funds accounted for 10.9%, payment stopped accounted for 2.5%, check not current accounted for 2.5%, incomplete or unclear seal accounted for 2.2%, suspension of overdraft accounted for 1.6%, account closed accounted for 0.8%, no endorsement by payee accounted for another 0.5%, unclear or inconsistent endorsement accounted for 0.5%, illegible handwriting accounted for 0.5%, changes not certified by issuer's seal accounted for 0.5%, other reasons accounted for 0.5%. The authorities will discuss countermeasures based on the above statistics.

Another report states that the money market is tightening as the authorities intensify their investigation of returned checks from banks and financial institutions. Yesterday, a total of 11,875 checks were exchanged, with a total value of $2,355,573,304,000. The four banks and two bureaus had a shortfall of $30.5 billion, with black market interest rates ranging from 10.8 to 22.5 cents. The number of returned checks yesterday has not yet been fully tallied, but is expected to be considerable. Therefore, the investigation is continuing by staff from the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank. According to the Deputy Director of the Auditing Department of the National Bank, the end of the lunar year is approaching, and if strict controls are not implemented, there will be major fluctuations before the new year. After this investigation, returned checks can be gradually reduced; reduced returned checks can also reduce the number of transactions, and prices can also be stabilized. In addition, the credibility of checks can also be rectified and improved.

The General Administration of the Four Joint Banks is also paying close attention to this matter, believing that the increase in returned checks is sufficient to affect finance and prices, and has sent a special auditor to Shanghai to supervise the investigation.

### Government to Formulate New Measures to Attract Remittances from Overseas Chinese, According to Statistics from the Bank of China, Overseas Remittances Have Returned to the State Before the Foreign Exchange Change

The current change from fixed to flexible exchange rates has two main objectives: to encourage exports and attract remittances from overseas Chinese. However, since the promulgation of the new foreign exchange measures, the gap between the black market and the official rate is very large. Export goods can still be exported with difficulty, but overseas remittances are still being evaded. According to statistics from the Bank of China, overseas remittances did increase at the beginning of the foreign exchange reform, but then gradually decreased, and have now almost returned to the state before the foreign exchange reform. There have been many suggestions for improving overseas remittances, such as allowing foreign currency deposit certificates for overseas remittances, allowing overseas Chinese to ship back necessities, and even advocating raising the official foreign exchange rate. The government has consistently failed to adopt these measures after weighing domestic and foreign situations and the advantages and disadvantages. The last price fluctuation was difficult to sell due to the high foreign exchange rate, and the current price surge has been quelled. If the official foreign exchange rate is close to the black market, it will inevitably stimulate prices again. Other measures also have their difficulties. However, overseas remittances are an important source of foreign exchange, and their relationship to the balance of international payments is extremely important, and the government will certainly not continue to sacrifice this huge amount of foreign exchange. According to sources familiar with the matter: under the current circumstances, the only way to resolve the overseas remittance issue is to set a separate exchange rate. The exchange rate for overseas remittances should be equal to the black market rate, so that overseas remittances can flow in continuously. If there is a difference with the black market rate, overseas remittances will still be difficult to achieve the expected goal. The folk remittance bureaus have their own history and credibility, but the general overseas Chinese still believe in the guarantees of the national banks. During the period of foreign exchange liberalization last year, folk remittance bureaus in Southeast Asia requested the Bank of China to resume business relations, transferring the overseas remittances they had absorbed to the Bank of China for transfer. It can be seen that the overseas remittance issue is entirely related to the exchange rate, and the folk remittance bureaus are not an obstacle to overseas remittances. Therefore, the government may take measures to set a separate exchange rate for overseas remittances in the near future in order to remedy the situation. It is generally believed that foreign exchange earnings from exports must be exchanged through the export of goods, while overseas remittances can be obtained without goods. The importance of overseas remittances over export goods has its own unique factors. According to a financial authority, if the government implements this plan, it is estimated that there will be no problem in earning 150 million US dollars in overseas remittances.

### Procedures for Foreign Exchange Settlement for Self-Funded Study Abroad to be Communicated to Designated Banks Within Days

According to a news release from the National Bank, the bank received the "Rules for Foreign Exchange Settlement for Self-Funded Students" formulated by the Executive Yuan on October 29. The bank's Non-Import Commodity Foreign Exchange Examination Committee immediately studied the relevant technical issues in the implementation of the foreign exchange settlement portion of the above rules for self-funded students and plans to distribute circulars to notify the designated banks to operate accordingly within one or two days.

### Bank Bureaus Loan and Calculate Interest on Packing, Four Joint Banks Approve Three Measures

In order to assist in the export of goods, the Four Joint Banks previously formulated three principles for packing loans, stipulating that exporters who export goods may mortgage foreign exchange bills of exchange and export goods to the National Bank for loans during the packing and sorting period, with a time limit of three months. It has been quite effective since its implementation. However, the interest rate has always been calculated in accordance with ordinary loans. In order to cooperate with the foreign exchange policy and encourage exporters to accelerate exports, the various bank bureaus will, in addition to handling packing loans in accordance with the above principles, review and approve three methods for calculating interest: 1. For periods within 10 days, the monthly interest rate is 5%; 2. For periods exceeding 10 days but within 20 days, the monthly interest rate is 6.5%; 3. For periods exceeding 20 days but within 30 days, the monthly interest rate is 8%.

### Rice Market Initially Firm, Then Weak

Yesterday, a total of 16,000 piculs of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The stores were still actively stocking, and the market was lively. Japonica rice continued to rise by 20,000 yuan, and indica rice also increased by more than 10,000 yuan. Early thin rice rose by more than 20,000 yuan, while white yuan and yin yuan were flat. At noon, all commodities fell, and sentiment softened. Flour was actively traded in small quantities and rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, but the market was also quite slack at the close. Skin Township sales were active, temporarily showing a firm trend. Bean cakes were inactive, showing a slightly weak trend.

Soybeans from Longhai sources were being received continuously. Arrivals from the Yangtze River were not weak. Abundant supplies of Pudong Pinghu Du Huang rice were available. Shantou factories were not actively stocking. Trading on the street was normal. Few customers were stocking. Du soybeans plummeted by 10,000 yuan, and customer soybeans also fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Mung beans were being shipped from both the north and south oceans, subtly tightening. Red beans continued to be absorbed by the Guangdong group and remained firm. Broad beans remained slack in small quantities, sluggish, and falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Cowpea oil was sluggish in stocking and flat. Red sorghum from Kent Island was being actively traded, and oil factories were purchasing, creating a lively situation and rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn from the north was being picked up selectively at high prices, continuing to rise by 10,000 yuan, while medium and lower grades were flat. Raw peanuts remained depressed. Trading on the street continued to move, temporarily showing a firm trend. Sesame oil factories stopped trading, and customer sales stalled. The street was looking forward to it, but supply exceeded demand. There was no buyer, and prices fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, with very few transactions.

The oil market was in a slump, with Jiangbei's continued arrival of raw oil causing a sharp drop of 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Soybean oil also continued to fall by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and Qing oil also saw a gradual drop of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The Edible Oil Allocation Office is currently handling the allocation of oil, and there is still little optimism in the oil market.

### Offices of the Textile Adjustment Committee Established in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan

[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the Tianjin and Guangzhou offices of the Textile Adjustment Committee were established at the end of last month, and the Wuhan office can also be established in the first ten days of this month. It is also reported that the cotton cloth pricing will be decided by the Textile Adjustment Committee on the 12th. Statistics for the southern transport of yarn and cloth in the previous month show 4,120 bales of cotton yarn and 99,217 bolts of cotton cloth. 2,996 bales of cotton yarn and 47,386 bolts of cotton cloth were handled on a special basis. The Textile Adjustment Committee has separately urged factories that have not yet delivered the foreign cotton they spun on consignment in the second phase to deliver them continuously this month. As for the labor cost, it is still under discussion between the two parties.

### Quantitative Output of Oil Raw Materials Should Pay Attention to Market Fluctuations

After the output of oil raw materials was changed to a quantitative permit system, the export volume was reduced to 39,000 tons according to the meeting of the International Food Emergency Committee and shipped to various countries according to a ratio. According to oil industry authorities, the quantitative export system restricts the export volume and does not have much impact on the market. However, it is feared that the announcement of the export details may cause market fluctuations, because exporters may compete to purchase in the market, which may affect market prices. However, there is no problem with the supply of oil raw materials. The current output in North China and Northeast China is very abundant. If transportation is convenient, the domestic supply is more than sufficient. Therefore, after the implementation of the quantitative round-out system, the government should pay attention to exporters competing to purchase in the market and opening up transportation to allow raw materials from North China to flow south.

### National Economic Council Reviews Joint Allocation, Textile Federation Sends Representatives to Express Opinions

[Report from this newspaper] The National Textile Federation recently received a telegram from the National Economic Council in the capital, agreeing that the Textile Federation should send two representatives to express their opinions at the National Economic Council's cotton yarn joint allocation review meeting to be held on the 3rd of this month. After receiving the telegram, the Textile Federation immediately selected Liu Piji and Rong Erren to attend as representatives. The review opinions will be submitted for discussion at the National Economic Council meeting on the 4th. It is also reported that the allocation plan for private factories has been drafted and will be announced today or tomorrow.

Another report states that, according to yarn industry sources, the most important focus of the current dispute between the two parties is the "flexible pricing" point. Currently, factories believe that factory costs have increased after the increase in the cost of living, so future pricing must be flexibly increased. However, officials believe that if pricing is adjusted every time, it will be seen as leading to price increases, so the handling is also quite difficult. Shares were initially stable yesterday morning, but soon collapsed again. Major players in the industry sold off their inventories, leading to a gradual decline. Although there were bulls continuing to short, the downward trend of stocks was difficult to reverse, and the process was very bleak.

At the beginning of the morning, due to the reduction of margin requirements and news of US aid, buying increased and prices rose. From 292 yuan and 295 yuan, Yong Yarn opened, and retail sellers immediately supplied, slightly downstream. It once rose to a high price of 292 yuan for immediate delivery and 297 yuan for deferred delivery. After selling off one after another, it gradually went downstream. Off-market interest rates remained at 19.5 cents and 24 cents, but fell to 282 yuan and 287 yuan. At noon, under the lack of activity and maintenance, it retreated to a low price of 277 yuan for immediate delivery and 282 yuan for deferred delivery. The afternoon closed slightly higher at 279 yuan and 285 yuan. Except for New Asia, which had limited transactions and fell more than on Friday, matches, Xinhua, Huafeng, and Zhongsi also fell slightly more, while the rest of the stocks were flat and weak. Compared with Saturday, stocks for immediate delivery included underwear, Hengda was still flat, Rongfeng rose slightly, Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Meiya, Xinguang, Qinxing, Zhongfa, Yongni, Zhabei, Huaxin, Datong, and Huaxin fell slightly, Huafeng matches, Xinhua, and Zhongsi fell by half a percent, and New Asia fell by 10%. Deferred delivery stocks included Xinguang and Meiya fell by half a percent, and Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Huaxin, Jingfu, and Qinxing fell slightly.

The after-market was stable. After the opening, the opening yarn retreated to 278 yuan and 282 yuan. There was buying and a slight consolidation. The National Bank's exchange had a shortfall, and money tightened. Before closing, it retreated to 277 yuan and 28 yuan. Xinhua Department Store's implementation of capital increase, the stock exchange revealed the public share recognition, and it was the last half-day of trading, causing retail investors to be disappointed (actually giving three shares and recognizing four), leading to a large number of liquidations, pushing it down to within 60 yuan. Yong Yarn closed at 280 yuan and 283 yuan. Tongyi was the only one that was stable, but the cement five and, lacking opponents, fell sharply. As a result, compared with the morning close, stocks for immediate delivery included Jingfu, Zhabei, and Hengfeng were flat, Yong Yarn, Tongyi, Meiya, Zhongsi, Huafeng, matches, Xinguang, and underwear rose slightly, Huaxin, Rongmeng, An, and Qinxing fell slightly.

### National Bank and Bureau Relocation to Beijing, Executive Yuan Stipulates Steps

(Report from this newspaper) Regarding the relocation of national banks and bureaus to Beijing, it is reported that the Executive Yuan has stipulated four steps: 1. The board meetings of national banks and bureaus must be held in Beijing this month; 2. The secretariat and personnel departments of the administrative management departments of national banks and bureaus must be relocated to Beijing before the end of the year; 3. The accounting department and audit department of the accounting departments of national banks and bureaus must be relocated to Beijing before March of next year; 4. The business departments of the head offices and bureaus of national banks and bureaus will be relocated to Beijing at different times, depending on the urgency of business conditions. It is reported that some of the bureaus and offices of the Central Bank are currently working in Beijing, and the bank buildings purchased and built in Beijing are about to be completed, and it is expected that they can be relocated as scheduled. As for whether a branch will be established in Shanghai for the Shanghai business after the relocation of the head office and bureaus to Beijing, it is reported that the National Bank has no plans to set up a branch in Shanghai, but the business bureau may be delayed in relocating to Beijing. The remaining securities, Jinglun and Jinfang fell by half a percent, and cement fell by 10%. Among the deferred delivery stocks, Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Huashan, and Meiya fell slightly, and Jingfu and Xinguang were flat. Among the old stocks outside the market, cultural stocks and bank stocks rose by another half a percent, while the rest were flat. Xinhua Yonggong Department Store is undergoing a capital increase, which has been rising in the market recently, and trading has been temporarily suspended. After the capital increase is completed, the new shares will be auctioned for immediate delivery from today, and deferred delivery will be resumed from Thursday, with the transaction unit temporarily set at 100,000 shares.

### Public Bonds and Foreign Shares Both Fall

Yesterday, public bonds were repaid at twice the amount of pre-war deposits, failing to reach the national price, causing people to feel timid. Unified Class C opened in the morning at 12,000 yuan, retreated to 19,300 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Rooms 555 and 644 sold, while rooms 552 and 550, as well as small money shops, accepted them, with a turnover of just over 4 million. Compared to last Saturday, Classes A and B fell by 1,000 yuan, Unified Class C fell by 1,000 yuan, Class D was lower by a large hundred yuan, and Class J was lower by 1,100.

Foreign shares were mediocre and gradually declined yesterday. Although Universal Films was being bought, foreign merchants and the gold industry were selling. Ewo Silk opened in the morning at 190,000 yuan, retreated from 191,000 yuan to close at 187,000 yuan. Hong Kong-Shanghai Telephone also hovered around 6 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Ewo Silk, British American Tobacco, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, and Steel Telephone experienced slight increases, while Yieh Guang, Shanghai Dockyards, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants Steam Navigation, and Asiatic Petroleum each fell by half a percent.

### Rayon Declines

The rayon market slumped yesterday, and sentiment was very weak. There were rumors of Japanese goods arriving in Shanghai, causing widespread panic, and people rushed to sell. No. 120 Toyo opened in the morning at 79 million, falling all the way to 75.5 million, a drop of 4.5 million compared to last weekend. No. 120 Mixed Brands with luster were between 74.5 million and 75 million, all falling by more than 4.4 million. All Raw Silk Purchased for Export

Since the China Trust Bureau started purchasing raw silk this year, it has collected a total of 3,997 bales to date, and it is expected to collect 13,000 dan. The original deadline for all manufacturers to deliver was the end of this month, but there is currently a trend of delays, so the end of the China Trust Bureau's purchase work will also be postponed. The raw silk that has been purchased has been successively exported. Currently, a total of 2,365 bales have been sold, with 1,200 bales shipped to the United States, 1,000 bales shipped to India, and the remainder shipped to the United Kingdom and France. There are still 1,632 bales remaining, which will be shipped for barter trade with the Soviet Union. All of the raw silk purchased has been exported.

Another report: According to Fan Chongshi, a leader in the Sichuan silk industry, the raw silk in Sichuan province this year has been purchased by the China Trust Bureau at the end of last month in accordance with the government's regulations. A total of 900 dan were purchased at a price of 31.73 million yuan per dan, and the procedures were completed three days ago. Fan also stated that although the government's purchase price is only half of the market price, fortunately, the price of goods in Sichuan province has been stable in the first half of the year, and the silkworm farmers will not lose money at this selling price. However, the cost of autumn silk is two to three times higher than that of spring silk, and there is currently no estimate of the output, which is estimated to be about half of that of green silk.

### Sluggish Actual Sales, Banks Tighten Credit
### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Decline Downstream
### Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Falls 1.4 Million Compared to Saturday

Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened mediocre, but then, due to tightening credit from all sides, many speculators were forced to sell. Furthermore, because of bad checks among yarn merchants last Saturday, the market was unable to support downstream prices. As a result, the final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 1.4 million compared to Saturday, to 36.6 million yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 200,000 to 400,000 yuan.

The cotton cloth market was initially opened with dyeing factories and retailers snapping up goods. The price of Longtou fine cloth gradually rose by 910,000 yuan. However, due to strict credit withdrawals by the authorities, and the increasing number of bad checks in the market, credit tightened, and actual sales were stagnant. Speculators, in turn, sold off, and prices subsequently declined. As a result, various types of Longtou fine cloth, such as 12-pound cloth, fell by 7,000 to 15,000 or 16,000 yuan compared to Saturday. However, fine twill, bleached cloth, raw cloth, and high-end Schreiner cloth, which were selling well, rose by 15,000 to 50,000 yuan. The market for all other cloths tended to be weak.

Spot Cotton Weak
Yesterday's spot cotton market was weak. Due to the urgent need for credit, merchants turned from buyers to sellers. Yarn factories were not enthusiastic about purchasing due to the decline in cotton yarn prices. Transactions in the market were active on dips, with 1,500 bales changing hands. The prices for cotton delivered to factories were: Shashi 3.658 million, Qidong 3.555 million, Han Fine 3.47 million, Han Coarse 3.06 million, and Zhongtong 3.06 million, with 600 bales changing hands. The prices for cotton delivered to warehouses were: 3.737 million, White Luo Went 3.7003 million, Han Fine 3.27 million, Andong 2.86 million, and Shandong 3.637 million, with 900 bales changing hands. Zhoupu cottonseed was 637,000.

Yarn and Cloth Shipped South
[Our Dispatch] China Merchants Steam Navigation’s "Haitian" vessel resumed its service to India yesterday, carrying 600 bales of cotton yarn and 285 bales of cotton cloth, which were shipped to Bangkok by the China Trust Bureau. 100 tons of soybeans and 100 tons of potatoes were shipped to Hong Kong, and more than 20 tons of sundry goods were shipped to Singapore. Very little was shipped to Calcutta.

### Strong Domestic Tea Sales

Yesterday, domestic tea was still in strong demand, especially this year's fried green tea, with Ai Qian, Shui Shao, and others being highly sought after. The activity of the tea shops on Mu Street was unprecedented in recent years, and the prices were consistently strong as sellers took advantage of the old. As for the foreign tea market, since exporters offered prices for export varieties that were attractive to customers, they have been holding the reins due to high costs, unwilling to part with their goods. Transactions in recent days have been in a state of negotiation and compromise, and have not yet become active. China Trust Old Tea Sold Out

[Another Dispatch] On the 30th of last month, the China Trust Bureau held its fourth auction of more than 4,000 boxes of enemy-property export old tea, mostly black tea. The goods included teas from Lianghu, Fuliang, Ningzhou, and Qimen, totaling 3,441 boxes, and the remainder were green teas, approximately 1,112 boxes. Among them were varieties such as Shou Zhen Gong Xi and Xia Mu Zhen Mei. Many exporters from this city went to participate enthusiastically. As a result, Jardine Matheson and Wing Hing foreign firms, Wu Chang, Tung Tai Cheung, Ting Chun Tai, Pei Feng, Ting Kang, Wing Fat, New Zhou, and Zhongnan tea companies successfully bid for all of them. The price was from 640,000 yuan to 1.46 million yuan per dan. A 20% deposit was paid at the time, and the full amount will be paid within ten days. It is understood that the selling price of these varieties is still low, but because they have been stored for many years, they must be re-baked before they can be shipped abroad.

### Highly Conductive Purple Copper Wire
### Changed to Non-Quota Import

The Import and Export Control Commission has submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to change the high-conductivity, uncoated, unstranded purple copper wire from Schedule A to Schedule B, which means that the import of this item will be changed from quota import to non-quota import.

### Great Flexibility in Purchase Rules
### All Industries Hope for Mutual Understanding Between Officials and Merchants

[Our Dispatch] Sixteen import and export trade associations held a discussion meeting at the Iron Trade Association on Hong Kong Road in the afternoon to jointly discuss the "Detailed Rules for Handling Goods Arriving and Starting Transportation with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange without a License" announced by the Import and Export Control Commission last Saturday. More than 20 people in charge of each association were present. All industries expressed satisfaction with the Commission's regulations. However, some of the regulations in the detailed rules are quite flexible, and it is hoped that they will not be strictly enforced during implementation. Especially during the allocation and negotiation of prices, it is still hoped that officials and merchants can understand each other in order to achieve reasonable fairness and smooth resolution.

Woolen Fabrics Stable
Yesterday, woolen fabrics tended to be stable. Local customers were intermittently buying. There were many transactions in overcoating fabrics. As the cost of living rises, and the production costs of various factories increase, the current prices of woolens are high, and most are unwilling to compromise and sell. On the contrary, there are many people within and outside the industry who go to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Hankou to try to ship woolens to Shanghai. Confiscation due to inspection is common, and many parcels sent by post are detained. Yesterday, China Textile's black and gray overcoating fabric sold for 950,000 yuan, Meifeng's for 1.35 million yuan, McConnell's for 630,000 yuan, and Army Ship's overcoating fabric for 510,000 yuan.

Commercial Briefs

The General Administration of Cotton has completed the allocation of cotton to yarn factories. It is reported that the total number of spindles operating nationwide is 4 million, and 10,000 spindles can be allocated slightly less than 500 bales of cotton from the General Administration of Cotton. Recently, Taiwan Sugar Corporation's production has increased compared to the past. Recently, in response to orders from Japanese merchants, sugar will be shipped to Japan in succession. It is reported that the first batch has been set at 50 tons.

Cotton yarn and cloth produced by Textile Construction are sold to Abyssinia, East India, Australia, and other places. In particular, East India and India have a more urgent need for cotton cloth. Other countries such as Cairo also have a great need.

Spring and Autumn

### Rickshaw Puller

— Xu Qinwen

Having received a few pecks of low-priced rice, I found it inconvenient to walk home.

"Rickshaw!" I called at the school gate, feeling unnatural, because it had been a long time since I had made that sound, and I had been walking to and from school lately.

After explaining my destination, the rickshaw puller said it would cost three thousand yuan. I remembered that the last time I took a rickshaw because I was sick, it only cost eight hundred yuan. Just like getting a haircut, the price increases every time, and you have to ask about the price. Although the amount of three thousand yuan was very unexpected, I felt unfamiliar with the situation and didn't want to bargain casually, so I just sighed softly, "That's so expensive!"

"Two thousand," the other party seriously continued, "Sir! This is just the price of one liter of rice! Rice is so expensive now, and pulling a rickshaw, you have to eat. Am I asking for too much?"

"But our salary," I said, "has not increased with the price of rice."

Finally, we settled on two thousand yuan. We loaded the rice into the rickshaw at the school and started moving along the road with a rumbling sound. I sat in the rickshaw, with the rice bag blocking my feet, which was very uncomfortable. When going up and down bridges, the rickshaw puller looked strained, and I felt dangerous. After turning two corners, I knew there were no more steep bridges. The rice was still brown, and I wanted to have it milled at a shop with a rice mill, so I started talking to the rickshaw puller.

"Are you from Shaoxing?" I asked, knowing from his accent that he was a fellow villager.

"How many rickshaw pullers here aren't from Shaoxing?" he quickly replied, "Pulling a rickshaw is hard, but now, the number of rickshaws is being reduced, and even this hard-earned meal is getting hard to come by. Who would want to pull a rickshaw! We used to weave silk in the weaving factory. The silk business wasn't doing well, the factory closed down, and that's why we had to pull a rickshaw. The rickshaw tax has increased again, to 180,000 a month, 6,000 a day. Two people take shifts, and each person has to pull 3,000 yuan for nothing every day."

He seemed very emotional. I wanted to comfort him, but I didn't know what to say.

"Sir!" he suddenly started a new topic, "Rice is so expensive, you can eat sparingly, and it's okay. We use our strength, and we have to eat a lot, so it's really unbearable!"

"It's unbearable for us too!" I said, finding something to say, "Eating sparingly is a thing of the past. Now, I always walk back and forth, which also takes strength. I eat less oily food, and meat is so expensive, so I can only eat vegetables. When I'm hungry, I have to eat more rice!"

"You're right," he echoed, "Now, you teachers are also suffering!"

Mentioning the milling of rice, he sighed again, saying, "Before, rice shops, rice shops, even the rice milling machines were destroyed. There are fewer machines, and the rice can't be milled in time, making it even more difficult. The low-priced rice is always brown, and no place is willing to mill a peck or two for us. Brown rice doesn't cook well, and it doesn't give you energy. And you can't accumulate three or four pecks to mill at once. As soon as you have rice, you have to cook it and eat it. Sir! This is how we do it now. We soak the brown rice overnight, then scoop it out and cook it the next day, so the rice can cook better."

Saying this, it seemed that he had already decided on a solution for me, and he pulled me all the way home. Although this was our first conversation, it was as if we were old friends, and we were very close in the face of life's difficulties. In terms of income, he earned slightly more than I did, but his living situation was not better than mine. What I secretly admired was that his spirit of perseverance was stronger and more resolute than mine.

### Unstable Souls

— Li Baifeng

Just like Dostoevsky's "The Insulted and Humiliated," I felt this way as soon as I saw the old blind beggar kneeling on the side of the road.

His two blind eyes stared straight ahead, like the eyes of a dead fish, frozen and empty. The journey of life had not recorded anything on them. They were so blank, just like a piece of white paper that had never been written on.

Although he couldn't see anything, I knew from his begging voice that he was very aware of the passing pedestrians and vehicles. He seemed to distinguish the delicate footsteps belonging to a fashionable woman, and the confident stride, knowing it was a rather proud gentleman... So he called out, using various, person-specific, pitiful tones.

Like a plucked string, his tone was always so trembling, intermittent, speaking the most touching words of the soul; however, perhaps because of the narrowness of his thoughts, perhaps because the big hand of hunger choked his throat, the words he used were so poor and powerless! Just imagine: in such a city of pleasure-seeking, who would be moved by these one or two moans of hunger?

In fact, it is not because people's hearts are as hard as stone, but because there are too few people who can truly think and listen with their hearts. People are busy saving themselves from the abyss of life, how can they have the mind to listen to his tearful plea?

He knelt upright on the terrazzo slab, his hands resting on a cane, like an old tree that had endured wind and rain for a long time, supported by a pillar standing on the open plain. Its root hairs could no longer hold on to the soil under its feet.

A few gray whiskers swayed weakly in the breeze like withered reeds. His powerless fingers grasped the cane tightly, like the coarse roots of an old tree holding onto the stone... This is a stone statue of suffering, explaining China, and representing China!

Pedestrians and vehicles came and went quickly in front of him, and no one would cast a glance at him. In the center of this bustling city, his existence was like a stone, a piece of rotten wood.

As dusk entered the city, the old man tremblingly stood up from the terrazzo slab, groping with his cane and a few wrinkled banknotes in his hand. He did not know their value, and kept asking passersby, while not believing everyone who told him.

Using his cane as his eyes, the old blind man sighed softly, as if with infinite apology, he left the slab where he knelt every day. I seemed to hear an unstable voice saying to me

"Don't just pity the one you saw with your own eyes, but pity the millions of those you haven't seen; don't always help this old man who is about to enter the coffin, you should support the young ones who are growing..."

I looked around blankly, and some ragged shadows flickered in front of me. I knew they were all hungry, unstable souls, and only in this unstable country would these scenes appear.

### Leaving Kunming

— Lin Yongquan

Travel Notes 1

In the end, I left Kunming. Because I have been to many cities, I am familiar with the feelings of staying there and leaving there. I particularly avoid the saying "what is left behind, not in the present, is all good." The same is true for Kunming. Even in the most annoying times, I would use reason to explain to myself, "But many of her places are still lovely." And today, to those that are inherently annoying, I still have to say: "Evil!"

Kunming, like other cities, has political institutions, but what's worse is that it's more chaotic and dirty than other cities. The Chinese nation's patience is too great. Those who should be responsible ignore the uneven roads; ignore the hungry people on the streets—especially during temple fairs, the roads outside the temple gates are full of lines of beggars stretching for more than a mile; ignore the desolate mountains everywhere and don't plant a tree, and even build their own walls of evil, building them thick and high, using bricks and soil that are actually base and dirty but thought to be noble and glorious. They are accustomed to it and even take pride in it...

But all the beauty that nature can arrange has been arranged, such as the warm, unhurried climate; the always clear and towering lakes and mountains; and the endless flowers of all seasons... They are all too memorable, and there are always some sincere friendships there! Although they are also from afar.

It was yesterday, leaving from the small building on the side of the highway. On a clear morning in May, the tender yellow young leaves of the large poplar trees greeted the rising sun, appearing particularly fresh and bright. There was no fog in the refreshing air, only the coolness formed by the breath of grass flowers and leaves, wandering in the empty stream. The green lawn collected some small dewdrops, and some coolness permeated upwards from the feet of pedestrians from time to time.

The train departed at 8:10. Regardless of whether it was temporary or long-term, short separation or eternal farewell, it was all farewell. Looking at the tall and lush mountains, the clear and wide lakes, the long dikes and long trees that still remained built by our ancestors, as well as those kind faces, the forms of evil were all left behind.

People, everyone is like this, recognizing them one by one, and then saying goodbye to them one by one. Unexpectedly, I was sickened by the excessive coolness of the morning. Soon after the train started, my whole body started to feel sick. At first, I was still struggling to support myself, but later I had to lie down and bought an unoccupied first-class seat to lie down. Wherever the train passed, I couldn't look around due to the pain, and I couldn't say goodbye to the mountains and rivers reflected on the train. In this dream of life, who knows if I can come again, if I can be a "former Liu Lang"?

Because I had to change trains from Qujing to Zhan Yi, this really made me suffer. I could hardly stand up, and I managed to ask a neighbor to help me move my luggage over, and then I stumbled onto the iron feather car with no space, leaning diagonally against the door. It was extremely dangerous, and I vomited several times, swaying outside the car.

In several moments of clarity, I always thought: it's over, life is over, I'm going to fall off the train like this, otherwise, I'm afraid I won't be able to support it to Zhan Yi; moreover, there's not a single acquaintance there, even if there's still a breath left, what will I do? The best way is to take the train back to Kunming tomorrow, but can I last until then? And will I still have the strength to get on the train?

Like waiting for heaven and earth, I finally waited for it to arrive at Zhan Yi, and I don't know what kind of power made me not fall off the train, and did not encounter that terrible thing. The train stopped, and I fell at the station. In a daze, two porters carried me to a hotel near the station, and I was thankful for the two soldiers who took care of my luggage.

Now I am healed. I found a doctor in a panic after arriving at the hotel yesterday and was cured; it was after sweating profusely less than two minutes after getting an injection. It was just like a sudden rain and then a strong wind sweeping away the cloud of disease. I was trying such a disease for the first time, and it was so ferocious and terrible that it reached its peak. But it was also the first time to recover so quickly. At that moment, when the comfortable blood flow instantly ran through my whole body, I exclaimed in surprise. "Thank you, sir, this injection is so effective, I'm better, completely better." I wiped away the hot sweat.

Today, I will rest for one day according to the doctor's instructions, and tomorrow morning I will step onto a long, new journey again. This place did not keep me, did not extinguish the light of my life. The stone tablet of hope and ideals has been erected again, life continues, and I walk forward, leaping and bounding like a rebirth, towards the vast future journey.

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Yaoqun frowned and shook her head when I mentioned this, but then she smiled: "This guy, you can really say he's one of us; because we need him to provide information. There are several places in the headquarters of the Japanese special agents that I can't get into; at the same time, I don't understand Japanese..."

"Do you think his information is very reliable?" I asked immediately.

"So far, the information he has provided is not only clear and understandable, but also reliable. As for what will happen in the future, I dare not say." Yaoqun seemed very sure.

"One more thing, do you think she has given you all the information she has obtained?" I think this is very important.

"I dare not say that." Yaoqun hesitated a little: "Because this guy is very resourceful, maybe he has collected a lot of information, and what he has informed me is only a part of it. Maybe..."!

"Then, are you very sure that Miss Baishafu hasn't revealed any information about our work in front of the Japanese spies? Suppose she plays the same role between us and the Japanese invaders; in other words, she tells us some information from the Japanese side, and then completely conveys our information to the Japanese special agents, do you think..."

Yaoqun shook her head and pondered for a while: "Maybe there is such a situation, but my personal speculation is that he doesn't need to do this."

"What's your basis for saying that?" I also think this is very important and I must repeatedly explain it to Yaoqun.

"There's no great basis... If you want to say there's any basis..."

When Yaoqun said this, a strange light suddenly flashed in her eyes, like lightning, flashing for a moment and then disappearing. She raised her face and looked at the empty space, as if carefully observing a kind of book slice reflected by her imagination: "Mr. Yue, I think the only basis is based on an imagination. This imagination is a conclusion I drew from observing his actions these past few days..."

"Oh!" I couldn't help but blurt out, making such a surprised sound; but I was afraid of interrupting Yaoqun's train of thought, so I repeated the word "conclusion" in her mouth.

"In other words," Yaoqun didn't seem to notice my expression and continued: "Why does such a person risk his life, sneaking around on the edge of a knife, on the front line? ... There must be a purpose, isn't there? I'm not very sure about his purpose at the moment. But my grasp of everything about him is based on this one-sided assumption!"

"Could it be..." I was just about to ask Yaoqun if she could outline her assumption.

"But let me explain this assumption?" Yaoqun asked me immediately before I could finish speaking; while asking, she shook her head with a smile: "Because I'm afraid that my assumption is fundamentally wrong, so I dare not say it now. So far, in my heart, it is only regarded as an "assumption". I think you must also have an "assumption" in your heart. But whether your "assumption" and mine are the same, we can temporarily ignore it; and wait until a certain joint, I hope that at that time, we can explain each other and compare."

### Writing Tools

— Dongfang Mengwu

Production tools are needed. These include a fountain pen, a pencil, a typewriter, a telephone, and some clothes to wear when eating out. In order to go to the editorial office, a bicycle is also needed; for writing poetry on rainy days, an umbrella is also needed; a chair and a house that can be used for a considerable walk (this is necessary when a person is writing poetry). In order to store some continuously obtained poetry materials, a cabinet for storing documents is also needed; in addition, there is a pipe and some cigarettes. (Mayakovsky)

### Concerning Feathers

— Qun Lin

The lingzi, or feather, is the bird feather inserted upside down on a helmet, usually one or two feet long, preferably from a pheasant's tail or peacock's plumage. This ornament originally had no fixed system, but by the early Qing Dynasty, it was established as an object of royal favor and began to be valued. The "Shuowen Jiezi" does not have the character for ling (翎, feather), but although ancient China did not have feather ornaments, it had long valued feathers. The "I Ching" says, "Its feathers can be used as ornaments." In old operas, pheasant tails are often used to adorn the helmets of military generals. When adorned on a crown, it can also serve as a literary embellishment, called a "qiao" (翹, raised). Ban Gu's "Ode to the White Pheasant" says, "Releasing white feathers, dividing and raising elegance," and the "Rhapsody on Shooting Pheasants" says, "The patterned tail is raised and elegant." Duan Yucai notes, "The long hair of the tail must be raised high, hence the saying 'qiao' for anything raised high."

The Qing system's chanzhi, although worn hanging down, actually also had tails that were raised up. However, peacock feathers with "eyes" were considered more valuable. In the early Qing Dynasty, it was originally given exclusively to military generals with meritorious achievements. It was also associated with the military adornment and the saying of the "feathered forest army." The ancient "feathered forest" in the Han Dynasty was the heavenly army, officials guarding the emperor, also explained as being as swift as feathers and as numerous as the forest, but one can also imagine that they also had feather ornaments. In the Qing system, those rewarded with feathers were still military men. Those in the Imperial Bodyguard and Guard Regiment, the Infantry, and the firearms battalion, who were above the fifth rank, could wear peacock feathers on their hats, while those below the sixth rank only had a blue feather to distinguish them. In the residences of princes and kings, only the first-class guards were allowed to wear flower feathers; the rest still wore blue feathers. Furthermore, princes and kings, as noble relatives of the imperial clan, generally did not wear peacock feathers. Only beizi (a noble title) could wear peacock feathers with three "eyes" as a crown for officials. During the Qianlong era, Prince Shuncheng Qin, Ye Ying, when serving as the vanguard commander, requested a flower feather from Emperor Gaozong. The Emperor said, "The flower feather is what ordinary officials should have. If a prince wears it, it would be against the system." Grand Secretary Huan pleaded on his behalf, "The prince is young and just wants to wear something beautiful," and the Emperor finally allowed it. From then on, princes and kings were often granted such favors. Emperor Qianlong even considered making five-eyed flower feathers the standard for princes and kings, but it was prevented by Grand Scholar He Kun and never implemented. As for those with great achievements among the meritorious ministers in the early Qing Dynasty, some were occasionally granted unique flower feathers with difficult-to-obtain "eyes." Civilian officials in the outer provinces originally had no precedent for flower feathers. Also during the Qianlong era, Fang Guancheng, the Governor-General of Zhili, upon receiving his appointment, went to Gubeikou for a grand review and relied on his position to specially request a flower feather for the sake of appearances, which greatly pleased the Emperor. Gaozong smiled and said, "Looking at your dwarfish appearance, you also want a flower feather?" After some ridicule, he still granted it to him. Afterwards, this opened a precedent, and many high-ranking officials in the outer provinces were granted flower feathers. Nowadays, in some families, when ancestral god statues are hung on the wall on days of worship, they are also adorned in court attire with flower feathers, looking like noble officials, regardless of whether they received such honors in life. After death, they are all treated as noble officials. Perhaps it is self-mockery.

### Secret History of the War

—— The U.S. Military Landing in Shanghai. By Bao Zhongqi.

During the final stages of World War II, the Japanese army was retreating on various islands in the Pacific. The U.S. military was approaching the Japanese mainland. It was generally speculated that the U.S. military's strategy was to land on the Japanese mainland and to land on the Chinese coastal ports for a pincer attack, cutting off the Japanese army's return route on the Chinese mainland. The four proposed landing sites were Huludao, near Shanghai, Fuzhou, and near Guangzhou, with the landing near Shanghai being the most likely.

To respond to this major landing plan, the supreme Chinese war authorities in Chongqing convened a meeting of responsible personnel from various departments and established a production bureau to specifically plan for the U.S. military's landing operation.

It was estimated that Shanghai's population was around 1.5 million to 1.7 million. If war broke out, approximately 25% might remain in Shanghai. Their food supply would be provided by the Food Department in the form of wheat products. At the same time, the locations of several key bombing targets in Shanghai had been approved by the Chairman, and the rear had sent personnel to notify the residents of Shanghai to evacuate. However, at that time, transportation and security were extremely chaotic, and residents were unable to evacuate. Fortunately, the war ended quickly, otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

The most important issue at that time was the supply of coal and electricity. It was assumed that all of Shanghai's power equipment would be destroyed. The landing troops would require a large amount of coal and electricity. The nearest coal mining area in China was Yixing, and it would be very difficult to connect the railway tracks to the coal mining area or to transport it by truck. Therefore, it was decided that "coal" would be transported by plane from the United States or the Philippines.

Of course, the number of personnel and equipment required for such a task was considerable. The authorities had allocated 15 aircraft and 30 trucks for transportation, and at least 3,000 tons of coal would be loaded onto trains daily. At the same time, Mr. Du Yuesheng had been appointed to establish a driving brigade in Lihuang, which could mobilize several thousand people in the event of war.

Medical and mechanical facilities were also considered, and everything was fully prepared.

The meticulousness of the plan was best demonstrated by the fact that the U.S. military inquired with Chinese agricultural experts about which vegetable seeds grew the fastest in case of food supply difficulties, to ensure that the food supply would not be cut off.

Everything was ready, and U.S. warships were approaching the Chinese coast, waiting for the Pacific typhoon in September to pass before the Shanghai landing, which had been brewing, was to be realized.

However, the invention of the atomic bomb hastened the end of the war. Before this plan could be implemented, Japan had already surrendered. While the victory saved the lives of many soldiers and spared Shanghai from the ravages of war, the sudden victory and the lack of preparation for post-war reconstruction led to widespread chaos in the takeover work, which was truly regrettable.

### In Memory of Mr. Yu Songhua

— Chen Lijiang

Heaven is unjust; a wise man has suddenly withered. My grief over the passing of Mr. Yu Songhua is not only due to personal friendship but also to public duty, for Mr. Yu's failure to enjoy a long life is not only a misfortune for our college but also a great loss for the nation.

My friendship with Mr. Yu began in the sixteenth year of the Republic when I traveled with Mr. Yu's younger sister, Ms. Qing Tang, and Mr. Gao Jiansi, thus I came to know Mr. Yu. Later, when Mr. Yu was the chief editor of the Shen Bao Monthly, I often sought his corrections on my articles, and our friendship grew stronger. During the war, we often gathered in the wartime capital. In the summer of the thirty-fourth year, our college established the Department of Journalism, aiming to train journalism professionals with the ideal of promoting social education, which coincided with Mr. Yu's usual advocacy. After repeated requests from me, he gladly accepted the appointment as director. Since taking office, Mr. Yu has worked extraordinarily hard, formulating plans, searching for professors, and personally teaching, tirelessly. Universities at home and abroad that have established journalism departments, such as Yenching in Peking, Fudan in Shanghai, and the Central Political School, have already achieved results, but the journalism department of our college, led by Mr. Yu, has its own unique style. Its training of students is not only to make them news professionals but also to enable them to take on educational work, not only to equip them with the ability to work as "reporters" and "educators," but also to give them a noble outlook on life and a belief in the paramount importance of journalistic service. The method of training students focuses on individual conversations. Every student who has had several conversations with him has been transformed and become a young person with lofty ideals, indeed possessing the belief that they will engage in journalistic endeavors with the attitude of an educator. As the ancients said, "Those who teach by example are followed." Mr. Yu's personality was noble, and his attitude was sincere, so the students readily followed him. Had he been granted more years, a good atmosphere would have been created, and our country's "journalism" and "education" would have benefited together. Alas, Mr. Yu fell ill and never recovered!

Sudden decline spreads; the nation mourns. Some say that Mr. Yu was a standard figure in the journalism field, while others call him the "Achilles" of the journalism field. However, I believe that although Mr. Yu's lifelong career was in journalism, his ultimate goal was education. Mr. Yu was not only a well-known journalism professional but also an educator with the aura of a Confucian scholar. Mr. Yu's chief editorship of newspapers was to use newspapers as a tool to promote education, and his engagement in education was to cultivate "both literary and moral" journalism professionals as his goal. Mr. Yu's leadership of the journalism department of our college lasted only two years. Although the time was short, the results were great and will forever remain in our college, forever remain in education.

Mr. Yu was never in good health, and the wartime relocation east and west further weakened his body. However, he never neglected his duties for even a moment due to his physical weakness. Since taking charge of the journalism department of our college, he has been working hard to realize his ideals and has been devoting his heart and soul to the advancement of the department. After August of this year, he vomited blood several times, yet even as he groaned in bed, he was still urgently seeking out excellent professors and formulating teaching plans. His spirit of loyalty to his duty can be described as "exhausting his efforts to the end."

Mr. Yu was upright in character but kind to others. He treated the students like his own children, loving them with sincerity. Therefore, on the day of Mr. Yu's death, the students cried bitterly, and many colleagues also shed tears of regret. As for me, I regret the withering of a wise man and remember the friendship of the past. My feelings are endless. Thus, I compose this essay to record my sorrow.

### Specially Appointed Antarctic Ambassador

— Shazhou

It is customary for the President of the United States to attend the Washington "National Press Club" banquet at least once a year. In 1940, an interesting incident occurred at this banquet for President Roosevelt.

At the time, many guests surrounded the distinguished guest, vying for his autograph on their commemorative albums. One reporter, named H. M. Bratter, took a menu and wrote on the back: "Specially Appoint Bratter as Ambassador to the Arctic." He then folded it in half, covering up these words, leaving a blank space below for the autograph. Then, in the crowd, he mixed this piece of paper with many others' commemorative albums and sent it to Roosevelt.

Soon, the menu was returned signed, but Roosevelt was not fooled. When Bratter opened it, Roosevelt had crossed out the word "North" and rewritten "South," adding below: "The Arctic is already taken."

### Two Muslim Leaders

— Polun

The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Huseini, is the leader of the 1.2 million Arabs in Jerusalem and is highly supported by the Arabs. Although the Arab countries are politically divided, they are very eager for independence. Arab political party leaders often encourage and stimulate the Arab people to quickly unite and defend the Arab nation. Due to Huseini's initiative, the strong resistance elements of the Arabs organized a secret alliance in Shen Dong, similar to the American Ku Klux Klan. There are 50,000 members who are all receiving military training. They are commanded by the Arab League, and their target is the Jews.

The leader of this secret group is called Hawari, only thirty-eight years old this year. He is a short but stocky man. He looks like a football coach. He advocates that every Arab man should marry four wives because this is permitted by Islamic customs so that the Arab population can grow and forever resist Jewish colonization. Hawari has an old mother but has nine children. He was deeply taught to oppose the Jews in his childhood because his father's property was sold to the Jews. Therefore, he is a penniless Arab, but he strives to study, especially mathematics; he establishes schools, instilling the sins of the Jews in Arab children, while also teaching Arab children not to trust foreigners, only to struggle by themselves to show their strength. In 1929, the Arabs launched a massacre against the Jews, which was also initiated by Hawari.

Hawari once said: "Arab youths are all receiving military training. Arabs know that Western countries cannot help the Arabs in the slightest, so they can only organize themselves to solve their own problems. Now the Arabs are going to realize their future ideals, preparing their own strength, money, and military power to achieve final success."

### Thoughts on Visiting a Grave on National Day

— Li

"He died before his mission was accomplished, making heroes shed tears forever." My brother, you loved the country and gave up your life. That moment of pain meant nothing to you. Willing to sacrifice became a choice, causing your sister to bear an empty name, getting up early and sleeping late, enduring hunger and cold, braving the wind and dew, and sweating on the road. The hardship of ten years, to whom can I tell? Even swallows have a day to return, but I ask you, why don't you come back? You told me that for a goose-shaped eagle, you harmed your father and mother, who swallowed you and spat you out in Stettin. I can't bear to hear it. The goose-shaped eagle, people see you as the almighty science, but in my heart, you have become the object of a lifelong grievance.

What can I bring to visit you today? I think of you in life, wanting to be magnificent and not willing to decay like grass and trees. Now, our compatriots are all living in drunken dreams, fighting for power and profit. I think you must be very unhappy in your heart. Before you, I am ashamed not to offer flowers, and I bow with heartfelt incense to pay my respects. Today, I am glad to celebrate National Day, and it is worth kneeling before you. Your past history is worth worshipping. Although there is no one in the garden, no sound of sparrows and crows, the cold wind is piercing, but it is as if I am facing you, without any fear. Sitting before you, I silently receive your teachings, and I am very happy. Reluctantly, I wrote a line on the stone tablet to leave as a memento. Your sister thinks that you are alive, hoping that you live among us. Do you know? Looking back at the country, the people are destitute. You rest in heaven, not needing to worry, this is your good fortune. I tell you that your sister is healthy, and Min'er is learning, and now the day has dawned after suffering. If you know in the afterlife, you can close your eyes with a smile!

Note: The goose-shaped eagle is an airplane.

### Two Special Zones in Shanghai

— Hui

The Shanghai Ditanyuan, located at the Jinyuanyuan Wharf, was used by the Shanghai County government during the Qing Dynasty for seasonal sacrifices. It was located outside the Old North Gate. At the beginning of the Daoguang reign, when the boundaries were drawn, it was included in the French Concession. In the early Xianfeng reign, the Shanghai Taoist government designated the land as public land for sacrifices. Following the precedent of the autonomous Tianhou Temple in the Public Concession, negotiations were held with the French consul to reclaim it. Later, during the Taiping Rebellion, wealthy merchants and gentry from Jiangsu and Zhejiang flocked to Shanghai to escape the chaos and settled in the French Concession. To promote prosperity, the French Concession authorities expanded the Ditanyuan and built streets and shops, completely losing the original site. Today, when people in Shanghai talk about it, I am afraid that no one can explain the matter in detail.

The second is the Jinyuanyuan Wharf in the old French Concession along the Bund. In the late Qing Dynasty, goods piled up there, stretching for about two li. It was the real estate of the China Merchants Bureau. The China Merchants Bureau was also founded by Sheng Xuanhuai, established in the early Guangxu years. At the beginning of its establishment, because there was no land available for purchase in the French Concession, let alone build houses, it hired a large number of workers to fill the land in the Huangpu River, competing with the river for land, spending countless sums, and finally succeeded. Therefore, this wharf seems to protrude into the river, like a peninsula. Business was prosperous, and the rights were purely autonomous. Therefore, the French Concession authorities repeatedly seized the opportunity to speak out and negotiate, but Sheng Xuanhuai used the argument that "this land was filled by me from the river and has nothing to do with your boundary" to fight for it and was able to preserve it. If I do not come to Shanghai, and the sea changes, I do not know how the changes will be.

### Film Scene This Week

— Li Zhen

"Su Feng Ji" From the script of "Su Feng Ji," we cannot find its theme. After watching this war, the audience cannot figure out what the playwright wants to express. All that is there are scenes of lively embellishments. Because the playwright is only trying to sell the story, the tragedy of this female performer is hung in the clouds, and the audience is pushed to see flowers in a fog. Although flowery and lively, the result is emptiness.

In the play, the Kunqu actress Xue Lianqiu is weak and contradictory in character. She has no active upward aspirations, and her final suicide is even forced. As the heroine of a tragedy, such a character is really too weak. Another upright character, the journalist Liu Chengzhi, his beautiful words cannot hide his selfishness and deceitful behavior. His love with Li Ling is even more of a forced match by the playwright. The con man impersonating an Air Force captain, on the other hand, is particularly emphasized in the story. Therefore, this play is lively in sections, but also disconnected, unable to achieve a coherent whole. Even if we discard the content of the script, the scriptwriting technique is also a failure.

We regret that Tang Xiaodan directed this play after "Paradise Dream." Even if the scenery around Beihai and the Summer Palace is made more beautiful, it still cannot save the ending of the play, which is as sloppy and loose as it is.

In terms of performance, it is really difficult for the actors. Li Liqiu's character is contradictory and vague. It is not easy for Lu Ming to handle this role in a simple and honest way. Xiang Kun's Yuan captain is superficial and lacks depth. Shi Hong's performance is stiff and affected, extremely clumsy. Zhou Ting, who plays Xiao Jinhua, is quite natural and appropriate. The performances of Lu Ming and Zhou Ting are the best in the whole play.

"Six Palaces and Powdered Dais" This long-promoted color film "Six Palaces and Powdered Dais" is not as exciting as expected. Although the color is quite gorgeous and the performance scenes are extremely lively, the script is loosely written, the development of the play lacks a process, and exaggerated gimmicks are interspersed quite often, even if the color is gorgeous, it still cannot compensate for the composition of the whole play.

"New Flames of Desire" "New Flames of Desire" is a French film. The story depicts a multi-faceted love affair. Its original name is "The Tempest," symbolizing the love in the throes of passion. The style is quite novel.

"The Bandit Pingfan" It emphasizes the goodness of human nature, but it also has some sentimentalism. In fact, it is still impossible.

Child star Margaret O'Brien is very cute, making it impossible not to like her, although this film's results are not as good as her "Green Township Jasper." Clarence Brown's rough style will not disappoint you.

### Random Gleanings of Duplicated Characters

— Wang Shuzheng

In ancient people's lyrics and songs, the best use of duplicated characters is like the opening lines of Li Qingzhao's "Sheng Sheng Man": "Seeking, searching, cold, cold, clear, clear, miserable, miserable, wretched, wretched." It can be called a brilliant hand. Another example is Qiao Ji's "Tian Jing Sha" little poem: "Orioles and swallows, spring, spring, flowers and willows, true, true, things, things, wind, wind, charm, charm, delicate, delicate, proper, proper, people, people." Mr. Wu Mei commented that it is "clear, handsome and beautiful, not like a great master." However, words such as "chun chun" (春春, spring spring) and "zhen zhen" (眞眞, true true) are inevitably somewhat far-fetched, but these are rhymes, and it would be difficult to change them. (According to Qiao Ji's name, Mengfu, was from Taiyuan, and also known as Shenghe Weng.) As for Wang Shifu's "Romance of the West Chamber's" "Yue Diao Dou Qun Quail" and "Zi Hua Er Preface," he says, "Pricking up my ears to listen, tiptoeing to walk, quietly, dimly, secretly, waiting, waiting, waiting for my neatly, elegantly, gracefully, sister, sister," then it comes casually, and feels even more seamless.

### Reader Consultation - Legal Interpretation

A Stepmother Acts as the Decision-Maker in Arranging a Marriage, Leading to Disputes over Dissolution of the Engagement

Dear Editor: I am a male, 22 years old. When I was twelve, my stepmother arranged an engagement for me with a Miss Wang from the same village of the same age. At the time, I did not agree. When I left for the West at the age of eighteen, I twice entrusted my clansmen to notify the other party that I denied this engagement, but the other party kept delaying and even threatened to force the marriage. To deal with this, I published a notice in the newspaper to formally deny the engagement. The other party also published a rebuttal in the newspaper, saying in essence: "The engagement has been more than ten years, is it legal? There should be a matchmaker to prove it. I have been an adult for more than two years. If the woman suffers damage to her reputation and spirit, the parents should be responsible for compensation." This matter has dragged on for more than a year, and I am always uneasy. I have several questions to ask you to answer: Is the above engagement valid? Is their rebuttal reasonable? Should I be responsible for compensation for the delay? The other party's parents claim that they will never dissolve the engagement unless I pay a large sum of money. What should I do if they continue to threaten me with illegal means in the future? Do I need to sue the court first? If the court rules that the man should be responsible for all losses under the law, will the man bear the burden? Sincere Reader, Zhou Tongqiang.

[Lawyer Chuan Kuang's Reply] If the individual does not agree with the engagement arranged by the legal representative after reaching adulthood, he may declare it dissolved. The innocent party may request the guilty party to compensate for the damages suffered as a result. The matchmaker can be invited to mediate the amount of compensation. There is no need to sue first. If the responsibility lies with the man, he should bear the responsibility for compensation.

To Mr. Mi Zijian of Shanghai: Your letter is too brief to allow for speculation. My humble opinion is that if you are ill, you should always seek the advice of a doctor, and you should not conceal your illness. It is difficult to diagnose an illness by correspondence, and no matter how detailed the description is, it is always better to seek medical attention and examination.

To Mr. Huang Yide of Shanghai: According to your letter, there is no ground for the crime of disrupting a family, and the father and brothers of the Chen woman should be held responsible for the crime of assault.

To Shen Yu of Wuxi: There is no such thing as "feng shui" in law. The criminal law stipulates that those who exhume graves are guilty.

To Ms. Qian Haiju of Shanghai: I have read your letter. Article 997 of the Civil Code stipulates: "A person who marries due to fraud or coercion may petition the court to revoke the marriage within six months of discovering the fraud or the termination of the coercion." Article 1052 stipulates: If one spouse is subjected to unbearable abuse by the other, they may petition the court for divorce.

Postal Q&A

Our bureau has received letters from Mr. Lu Bingyuan of this city and Mr. Bi Xichang of the Seafarers' Fellowship, inquiring about the following points, which we will briefly answer below:

(Answer) 1. In addition to the Management Bureau, there are 21 branches and 6 postal kiosks in this city. The exchange rate is divided into special group and ordinary group. The special group is 1/1000 of the basic fee, plus a supplementary water fee of a certain amount, which is adjusted according to the local exchange rate at any time. The ordinary group is 1 cent per yuan for the basic fee, 4 cents per yuan for the special supplementary fee, plus a supplementary water fee of a certain amount, and adjusted at any time. The 40th Anniversary of the Post Office commemorative stamps were issued in 1936. Stamp collectors can buy stamps at any time. The office hours of the stamp collecting group are from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM every day. The business windows of the Management Bureau provide service around the clock. The branch offices are usually open from 8:30 AM to 6:30 PM. On Sundays or holidays, except for the Jing'an Temple, Sinan Road, Fujian Middle Road, and Jinling East Road branch offices, which are open all day, the rest are open from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM in the morning and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM in the afternoon.

2. For mail sent to Changshu, the bureau seals it twice a day. The first time is at 12:00 noon, and it is transported by the Xihu bus. The second time is at 9:00 PM, and it is sent by the Hujing 12th train to Suzhou and then transferred. It takes about two days to arrive. Unused diaries should be sent as small packages or parcels. Manuscripts sent for printing and publication can be sent as trade contracts. Fan surfaces, if blank, should be sent as small packages. If they have already been painted and inscribed, they can be sent as printed matter. The packaging method for printed matter and trade contracts should allow the post office to easily verify them. Due to limited manpower, the auto post office only accepts a small amount of registered printed matter. Airmail stamps are limited to airmail.
